intended to issue under the general title of marco pauls adventures in the pursuit of knowledge is not merely to entertain the reader with a narrative of juvenile adventures but also to communicate in connexion with them as extensive and varied information as possible in respect to the geography the scenery the customs and the institutions of this country as they present themselves to the observation of the little traveller who makes his excursions under the guidance of an intelligent and wellinformed companion qualified to assist him in the acquisition of knowledge and in the formation of character the author will endeavor to enliven his narrative and to infuse into it elements of a salutary moral influence by means of personal incidents befalling the actors in the story these incidents are of course imaginarybut the reader may rely upon the strict and exact truth and fidelity of all the descriptions of places institutions and scenes which are brought before his mind in the progress of the narrative thus though the author hopes that the readers who may honor these volumes with their perusal will be amused and interested by them his design throughout will be to instruct rather than to entertain     marco paul in the forests of maine     chapter i  the mouth of the kennebec   one summer forester and marco paul formed a plan for going to quebec marco was very much interested in going to quebec as he wanted to see the fortifications forester had told him that quebec was a stronglyfortified city being a military post of great importance belonging to the british government marco was very much pleased at the idea of seeing the fortifications and the soldiers that he supposed must be placed there to defend them  on their way to quebec they had to sail up the kennebec in a steamboat as they were passing along marco and forester sat upon the deck it was a pleasant summer morning they had been sailing all night upon the sea on the route from boston to the mouth of the kennebec they entered the mouth of the kennebec very early in the morning just before forester and marco got up and thus it happened that when they came up upon the deck they found that they were sailing in a river the water was smooth and glassy shining brilliantly under the rays of the morning sun which was just beginning to rise  the shores of the river were rocky and barren here and there in the coves and eddies were what appeared to marco to be little fences in the water forester told him that they were for catching fish the steamboat moved very slowly and every moment the little bell would ring and the engine would stop then the boat would move more slowly still until the bell sounded again for the engine to be put in motion and then the boat would go on a little faster  what makes them keep stopping said marco  the water is very low this morning said forester and they have to proceed very carefully or else they will get aground  what makes the water so low now asked marco  there are two reasons replied forester it is late in the summer and the streams and springs are all low so that there is but little water to come down from the country above then besides the tide is low this morning in the sea and that causes what water there is in the bed of the river to run off into the sea  is not there any tide in the river asked marco  no said forester i suppose there is not strictly speaking that is the moon which attracts the waters of the ocean and makes them rise and fall in succession produces no sensible effect upon the waters of a river but then the rise and fall of the sea itself causes all rivers to rise and fall near their mouths and as far up as the influence of the sea extends you see in fact that it must be so  not exactly said marco  why when the water in the sea continued forester at the mouth of the river is very low the water in the river can flow off more readily and this makes the water fall in the river itself on the other hand when the water in the sea is high the water cannot run out from the river and so it rises sometimes in fact the sea rises so much that the water from the sea flows up into the river and makes it salt for a considerable distance from its mouth  i wonder whether the water is salt here said marco  i dont know said forester  if we had a pail with a long rope to it said marco we could let it down and get some and try it  we could let the pail down but i doubt very much whether we could get any water said forester it is quite difficult to drop the pail in such a manner as to get any water when the vessel is under way  i should like to try said marco  you can find out whether the water is salt easier than that said forester you can let a twine string down and wet the end that will take up enough for a taste  well said marco if ive got a string long enough so saying he began to feel in his pockets for a string  he found a piece of twine which he thought would be long enough but on trial it appeared that it would not reach quite to the water forester then tied it to the end of his cane and allowed marco to take the cane and hold it over the side of the vessel and by this means he succeeded in reaching the water and wetting the end of the string he could after all succeed in wetting only a small part of the string for it was drawn along so rapidly by the motion of the boat that it skipped upon the surface of the water without sinking in  at length however after he had got the end a little wetted he drew it up and put it in his mouth  how does it taste said forester  the question was hardly necessary for the faces which marco made showed sufficiently plain that the water was bitter and salt  yes it is salt said he then suddenly casting his eye upon a long darklooking substance which just then came floating by he called out  why forester what is that  a log said forester  the log was round and straight and the ends were square the log glided rapidly by and soon disappeared  it is a pine log said forester there are vast forests of pine trees in this state they cut down the trees and then cut the trunks into pieces of moderate length and draw them on the snow to the rivers then in the spring the waters rise and float the logs down this is one of these logs floating down sometimes the river is quite full of them  where do they go asked marco  oh men stop them all along the river and put them into booms and then fasten them together in rafts  how do they fasten them together asked marco  they drive a pin into the middle of each log and then extend a rope along fastening it to each pin in this manner the rope holds the logs together and they form a long raft when they catch the logs in booms they afterwards form them into rafts and so float them down the river to the mills where they are to be sawed  can men stand upon the rafts said marco  yes replied forester very well  they make a floor of boards i suppose said marco  no replied forester they stand directly upon the logs  i should think the logs would sink under them replied marco or at least roll about  they sink a little replied forester just about as much as the bulk of the man who stands upon them  i dont know what you mean by that exactly said marco  why the rule of floating bodies is this rejoined forester when any substance like a cake of ice or a log of wood or a boat is floating upon the water a part of it being above the water and a part under the water if a man steps upon it he makes it sink enough deeper to submerge a part of the wood or ice as large as he is himself if there is just as much of the wood or ice above the water as is equal to the bulk of the man then the man in stepping upon it will sink it just to the waters edge  but perhaps one man would be heavier than another man said marco  yes replied forester but then he would be larger and so according to the principle he would make more wood sink before the equilibrium was reached  what is equilibrium asked marco  equilibrium is an equality between two forces replied forester  i dont see what two forces there are said marco  there is the weight of the man pressing downwards said forester for one and the buoyant power of the water that is its upward pressure for the other the weight of the man remains constantly the same but the upward pressure of the water increases in proportion as the log sinks into it for the deeper the log sinks into the water the more of it is submerged and it is more acted upon and pressed upward by the water now as one of these forces remains constant and the other increases they must at length come to be equal that is in equilibrium and then the log will not sink any farther thats the philosophy of it marco  marco did not reply but sat looking at the barren and rocky shores of the river as the boat glided by them presently another log came into view  there said forester look at that log and see whether you think that you could float upon it  yes said marco i think i could  it depends said forester on the question whether the part of it which is out of water is as big as you are  i think it is said marco  yes added forester i have no doubt that it is  only i should roll off said marco  true replied forester but the millmen who work about the logs acquire astonishing dexterity in standing upon them if there is only enough of the log above water to equal their bulk so that it has buoyant power enough to float them they will keep it steady with their feet and sail about upon it very safely  i should like to try said marco  perhaps we shall have an opportunity at some place on the river said forester  here marco suddenly interrupted the conversation by pointing up the river to a column of smoke and steam which he saw rising beyond a point of land which was just before them  here comes another steamboat said he see forester  no said forester i believe that is a steam mill  a steam mill repeated marco  yes replied forester they have steam mills and tide mills to saw up the logs in this part of the river farther up where there are waterfalls on the river or on the streams which empty into it they build mills which are carried by water i presume that that is a steam mill  at this moment marcos attention was diverted from the steam mill by a boat which came gliding into the field of view there was one man in the boat rowing it another sat in the stern with a pole in his hand the pole had an iron hook in the end of it a short distance before the boat was a log floating upon the water the oarsman was rowing the boat towards the log he brought it up to it in such a manner that the other man could strike his hook into it when this was done the oarsman began to pull the boat towards the shore drawing the log with it  by this time the whole group disappeared from marcos view behind a boat which was hanging on the quarter of the steamer marco who wished to watch the whole proceeding left forester and ran aft in hopes that he could get another view of the men in the boat he found however that the steamboat was proceeding so rapidly up the river that he was fast losing sight of them and then he concluded to go forward to the bows of the steamboat thinking that perhaps there might be other logs coming down the river with men after them in boats  when he reached the bows marco found the deck encumbered with cables and anchors and heavy boxes of freight which made it difficult for him to find his way to a good place for a view he finally reached a place where by standing upon an anchor he could look over the bulwarks and get a view of the expanse of water before him it was smooth and its glassy surface was bright with the reflection of the rays of the morning sun  marco admired the beauty of the river and of its banks but he could see no boats or even logs coming he saw some large sand banks before him which had been left bare by the efflux of the tide he wished that the steamboat would stop and let him land upon one of them he also looked down over the bows and admired the graceful form and beautiful smoothness of the ripple or rather wave which was formed by the cutwater of the boat as it urged its way rapidly through the water after gazing upon this for some time marco turned to go away in pursuit of forester when an occurrence took place which being somewhat important in its consequences the account of it must be deferred to the next chapter     chapter ii  the lost bucket   as marco was stepping down from the position which he had taken upon the anchor his eye fell upon a small bucket with a long rope tied to the handle which he immediately recognised as one of those buckets which the sailors fit up in that way in order to draw up water from alongside the ship  theres a bucket now said marco to himself i declare i believe ill draw up some water forester said that it was hard but i think it will be easy ill draw up a bucket full and carry to him and show him  so saying marco took up the bucket lifted it gently over the side and let it down slowly by the rope into the water there was a knot in the end of the rope and marco held the knot firmly in his hand so as to draw up the bucket by means of it as soon as he should get it full he found however that although he could let the pail down easily enough it was no easy matter to dip up any water into it for the rope being fastened to the bail or handle kept the handle and of course the open part of the pail upwards so that the water could not run in if marco let the rope down more the pail being light would not sink but skipped along upon the surface of the water drawn by the motion of the steamboat  while marco was making these fruitless attempts another boy dressed in sailors clothes whom marco had seen several times before about the boat came up to him and asked him what he was doing  im trying to get some water said marco  that isnt the way to get it said the sailor boy let me have the bucket ill show you the way  no said marco i want to get it myself  you never can get any that way said the boy you must swing it back and forth and when it is swinging well let it drop suddenly and catch the water  so marco began to swing the bucket back and forth and after he had got it well aswinging he let down the rope suddenly at the moment when the bucket was at the extent of its oscillation the bucket filled instantly but as the boat was advancing rapidly it was caught by the water with such force that the rope was twitched out of marcos hand with great force  hold on exclaimed the sailor boy  but it was too late the rope fell down into the water and the bucket rope and all sailed back upon the surface of the water until they floated under the paddle wheel of the boat which dashed them down beneath the surface of the water and they disappeared finally from view  why did not you hold on said the boy  marco was silent  the boy looked round to see if anybody had observed what had taken place he found that all the seamen were busy here and there and that nobody had noticed what the two boys had been doing  nobody has seen you said the sailor boy so you say nothing and ill say nothing  but suppose they ask you what has become of that bucket said marco what will you tell them  oh ill tell them i dont know where it is he replied and i dont i am sure i dont know where it is now do you hush here comes joe  marco looked up at these words and saw the sailor approaching whom the boy called joe and the boy himself immediately stepped down from the anchor where he and marco had been standing and began coiling a rope upon the deck marco walked sorrowfully away towards the stern of the vessel where he had left forester  there was something wrong and something right in the boys proposal to marco to conceal the loss of the bucket his object was to befriend and help marco in his distress this was right the means by which he proposed to accomplish the object were secrecy and fraud this was wrong thus the end which he had in view was a good one and it evinced a good feeling in him but the means for promoting it were criminal some persons have maintained that if the end is only right it is of no consequence by what means we seek to promote it hence they have had this maxim viz the end sanctifies the means but this maxim is not sound the contrary principle is correct it is sometimes expressed by this saying we must not do evil that good may come which is a much safer proverb to be guided by  marcos first impulse was to go at once and tell the captain of the steamboat that he had lost his bucket but he did not know exactly where he could find him he looked at his office window and found that it was shut he asked one of the waiters whom he met coming up stairs from the cabin if he knew where the captain was but the waiter did not know presently he saw a gentleman walking back and forth upon that part of the deck which is in front of the door of the ladies cabin he thought that he was the captain marco walked up to him and accosted him by saying  are you the captain of this boat sir  am i the captain asked the man why what do you want to know for  because if you are said marco i have lost your bucket  lost my bucket repeated the gentleman how did you lose it  i lost it overboard said marco  here the gentleman laughed and said no im not captain but you seem to be an honest sort of boy i dont know where the captain is  all this though it has taken some time to describe it took place in a very few minutes and the boat had now advanced only so far as to be opposite the steam mill which marco had seen just before he had left forester marco happened to see the mill as the boat moved by it and he went immediately to the side of the boat to get a better view of it  there was a chimney for the smoke and a pipe for the waste steam at the mill from the steampipe there issued a dense column of vapor which came up however not in a regular current like the smoke from the chimney but it was puffed up in regular strokes making a sort of pulsation while marco was looking at it forester came along and stood looking at it too there were a great many logs lying about the shore and enormous piles of boards which had been sawed and which were ready for the vessels that were to come and take them away  what makes the steam come up in puffs asked marco  because it is what they call a high pressure engine said forester it works against the pressure of the atmosphere all such engines throw out the steam in puffs  why do they asked marco  do you know what the cylinder of a steam engine is said forester  not exactly i dont remember it very well replied marco  come with me then said forester and i will show it to you  so saying he took marco to the engine of the boat and showed him in the midst of the machinery a large iron vessel shaped like a hogshead only it had straight sides marco could not see much more than the top of it  that is the cylinder said forester it is the heart of the steam engine as i may saythe seat of its power all the other machinery is only to aid the cylinder and to convey the power to the point where it is wanted to do the work thus the place where the steam exerts its power and on which the whole movement of the machinery depends is the cylinder  marco observed that a long iron rod large and solid and very bright kept ascending and descending through the top of the cylinder as if pushed up and drawn down again by some force within forester told him that that was the piston rod  the piston rod said forester is fastened at its lower end to the piston which is a flat plate of iron made to fit the inside of the cylinder exactly  first said forester the steam comes in below the piston and drives it up and then it is stopped from coming in below and is forced in above and so drives it down  and how does the other steam get out asked marco  there are two ways of getting rid of the steam that is below the piston when the piston is coming down said forester one way is to open a passage to let it out into the air on this plan when the piston has been driven up the steam is cut off from coming in below the piston and is admitted above at the same instant the passage is opened to let the lower steam out of course the steam that comes in above drives the piston down and forces the steam that is below out into the air they generally have a pipe to convey it away and as the piston goes up and down the steam comes out in puffs as you saw it in that mill  yes said marco i understand that and now what is the other way  that kind of engine is called a high pressure engine said forester because the piston in coming down has to drive out the steam from below against the pressure of the atmosphere for the atmosphere above passes into the pipe and resists the movement of the steam in coming out it requires a greater force of steam to work the piston on this plan than it does upon the other  what is the plan of the other asked marco  on the other plan said forester the steam under the piston is condensed that is turned suddenly into water and this leaves a vacancy or void below the piston so that the piston can be forced down much more easily than if it had to drive the steam out before it against the pressure of the atmosphere  forester was going on to explain to marco how it was that the steam was condensed in the cylinder when the conversation was suddenly interrupted by the sound of the engine bell which was the signal for the engine to stop the thumping sound of the machinery and of the paddle wheels accordingly ceased and the boat began to move more slowly presently the bell sounded once more and the piston rod slowly rose out of the cylinder and then slowly descended again  they are going very slowly said marco  yes replied forester the water is low and i suppose that the channel is narrow  just at this moment they perceived a strange sensation as if the steamboat had been suddenly pushed backwards marco was startled he did not know what it meant  there we are said forester  what said marco what is it  aground said forester  aground repeated marco  yes said forester thats the sensation produced when a ship goes aground upon sand or soft mud  so saying forester left the engine and went up to the upper deck followed by marco there were several persons there looking out upon the water  yes said forester we are aground you see by the trees upon the bank that we are not moving  marco saw that they were at rest he asked forester what they were going to do  just at this moment the little bell sounded and the engine which had been stopped when the boat went aground was put in motion again  they are going to back the engine i suppose said forester to try to draw her off  but the boat would not move the engine did not seem to have power to release her from her confinement  what shall we do now asked marco  why whenever a ship is aground said forester the first question is what is the state of the tide  because continued forester after a moments pause if the tide is rising it soon lifts the vessel off and enables her to go back or perhaps forward if the water is not very shallow but if the tide is falling it leaves her to rest more and more upon the sand and she cannot get off until the water has gone entirely down and then rises again she cannot get off in fact until the water has risen higher than it was when she first grounded  and how is it now asked marco  i presume the tide is going down said forester and if so we must wait here until it rises again so saying he began to look about for somebody of whom he could inquire he soon heard a gentleman say to another that the tide was falling and that they should have to stay here three hours  thats rather provoking said marco  oh no said forester perhaps we can go ashore  well said marco with an expression of gratification at the proposal  and perhaps we can borrow some fishing lines and go a fishing  yes said marco that will be an excellent plan  at any rate said forester when accidents of this sort occur upon our travels we should not allow ourselves to be provoked by them but make ourselves contented by the best means within our reach  at this time they began to hear the loud hissing sound produced by the blowing off of the steam from the engine which forester said was an additional indication that they were going to remain there for some time presently a man came up the stairs from the deck belowfor forester and marco were at this time on the upper deckand told the passengers that the boat would have to remain there three or four hours and that if any of them wished to go ashore to amuse themselves he would send them in his boat after breakfast  quite a number of the passengers seemed disposed to accept this offer and the boat was accordingly lowered and joe with two other sailors were despatched to row it ashore they were all safely landed upon a raft of logs just above the mill     chapter iii  a raft   forester and marco did not take breakfast on board the steamboat but waited until they got on shore they had inquired of a fellowpassenger who seemed acquainted with the country and were told that there was a very good tavern about a quarter of a mile from the mill  when they landed upon the logs marco whose curiosity seemed to be stronger than his appetite wanted to ramble about for a little time along the shore and among the piles of boards but forester thought it would be best first to go and get their breakfast  because said he we can then amuse ourselves by rambling about here and shall be ready to return to the steamboat whenever they send for us  so they went to the tavern  forester seemed to have little appetite for his breakfast he complained of feeling fatigued and yet he had nothing to fatigue him marco ate and talked fast all the time but forester seemed silent and dejected  come cousin forester what is the matter with you said marco at last  forester said that he felt somewhat unwell and as there was a sofa in the room he concluded to lie down upon it and not go out marco was at first disposed to stay and take care of him but forester said that he did not need anything and he wished marco to go out and amuse himself  you may go and see the mill said he and the logs along the shore only be careful not to go where there is any danger and come and let me know when the boat is coming from the steamer to take us on board again  so marco left forester upon the sofa and went away he was sorry that he was sick and he was particularly sorry that he had to go himself without company but concluding that he would adopt foresters principle of making the best of everything in the events which occur in travelling he walked along the road singing a tune which he had learned at a juvenile singing school in new york and watching the pulsations of the steam as it issued from the pipe at the mill  as marco walked along it occurred to him that he had not after all succeeded in acknowledging to the captain of the steamboat that he had lost the bucket and since the first occasion for doing so had gone by he began to doubt whether it would be best for him to trouble himself any farther about it  the bucket was not worth much said he to himself nobody knows it is lost except that boy and he will not tell ive a great mind not to say anything about it  in fact marco found that he was much less inclined to make his acknowledgment now than he was when the circumstance first occurred he wished that he had at once stated the facts to forester which would have been his wisest course but now that the first occasion for doing so had passed away he began to feel disinclined to do it at all  marco soon reached the mill and he amused himself for half an hour in watching the movement of the engine the strokes of the saw and the drawing up of the logs from the water to the floor of the mill there was a steep sloping platform from the mill down to the river and a long chain extended down to the water this chain was fastened to one end of one of the logs which lay floating there and then by means of the machinery it was drawn slowly up bringing the ponderous log with it  the way in which the machinery drew up the chain was this the end of the chain which was within the mill was wound around an axle which was made to revolve by the machinery the axle thus revolving wound up the chain and in this manner drew it gradually in by which means the log which was attached to the lower end of it was drawn up  presently marcos attention was attracted towards some men who seemed to be sailing about upon some logs in a cove just below the mill he went down immediately to see what they were doing they had long poles in their hands with iron points in the ends of them and were pushing the logs about with these poles to choose out such as they wished to saw in the mill  just as marco came down one of the men stepped upon the end of a log which was floating very near him the log sank a little but not much under him and the man walked along towards the other end of it marco wondered how he could keep his balance  when the millman reached the farther end of the log he extended his long pole very dexterously and struck the point of it into the corner of a sort of wharf which was built upon the bank and then pulling gently he drew himself along together with the log upon which he was floating marco was surprised at this and he wondered that the man did not fall off the log he thought that if the log were to roll in the least degree the man would be rolled off into the water he ran down to the little wharf so that he could see better  well my boy said the millman do you belong on board the steamboat  yes sir said marco we got aground youll fall off of that log if you dont take care  no said the millman theres no danger  why if the log should roll the least atom away youd go said marco though the water is not very deep  here the man began to step upon the log in a peculiar manner so as to make it roll it rolled slowly but the man continued stepping until he had rolled it completely over the side which had been under water appeared of a dark color and was very slippery being covered with a sort of slime but the man did not slip after he had thus rolled the log completely over he looked up to marco and said  there you see that there is no danger  when the man had drawn this log up to the shore he went for another and he had to sail upon this second one a long distance in bringing it to its place he pushed himself along by running his pole down to the bottom and pushing against the sand  could i sail upon a log asked marco  no replied the millman youd roll off  how did you learn to do it asked marco  oh i learned when i was a boy replied the millman  did you roll off when you were learning asked marco  yes said the man ive been off the log into the water many a time  and how did you get out again said marco  oh i could swim he replied and as soon as i came up i would paddle back to the log and climb up upon it once however i came very near being drowned  how was it said marco  why i was on the upper side of a boom  a boom said marco what is that  a boom repeated the millman dont you know what a boom is it is a place to catch logs they go to some cove or eddy where the water is pretty still and chain logs together end to end so as to form a long line on the lower side of the eddy and then along up the middle of the river a little way so as to enclose a space to catch the logs  what do they fasten the boom to asked marco  why the lower end said the millman is fastened to the shore by means of a very strong post or an iron staple set into the rocks the other end which is out in the middle of the stream is fastened to some island if there is one or if not to a pier built up from the bottom  well said marco tell on about your getting in  the boom was full of logs and i was upon the upper side of it at work with some other men i was on a log trying to find the mark and i fell in  what made you fall off asked marco  i dont know replied the millman i was not much use to logs then i was trying to find the mark  what mark asked marco  the owners mark said the millman the owners all mark their logs when they get them out in the winter and then we separate or sort them in the booms sometimes the mark is on the under side of the log and so we have to turn it over in the water to find it  while all this conversation had been going on the millman had been moving about over the water with the various logs marco accompanying him and keeping as near to him as possible walking along the shore and sometimes on the logs which were resting by one end on the shore as the millman was describing the system of marking the logs he was sailing along very near to marco and he immediately began to turn the log over under him saying  for instance look here and see me turn up the mark of this log  marco watched the log as it slowly revolved until presently there came a sort of hieroglyphical mark upon one end made by crosses and lines cut into the wood  every owner has his particular mark said the millman  whose mark is that asked marco  i dont know said the man but they know at the mill they have a register of them all at the mill  i wish i could turn over a log standing on it in that way said marco  you couldnt said the millman the only way by which you can sail safely on logs would be to put two together and make a sort of raft  how asked marco  by nailing short pieces of boards across from one log to another then they would not roll  well said marco if i could only get a hammer and some nails  the millman told him that perhaps they would let him have a hammer and some nails at the mill and marco accordingly went up to inquire they told him they had a hammer but they had no nails to spare so marco failed of getting the means of making a raft he forgot to go back to the millman to get the rest of his story but instead of it he rambled down the bank of the river until he came to a place where there was an old fence which had fallen down and the nails were sticking out of the boards he now wished that he had borrowed the hammer at the mill and he tried to persuade a boy who was standing there to go and borrow it for him  the boy told him that a stone would do very well for a hammer  so it will said marco find me a good one and bring it to this old fence  the boy brought marco a stone and marco began to knock out the nails very soon however he set the boy at work upon the nails while he went in pursuit of some short boards to nail across from one log to the other he found some which he thought would answer without much difficulty and collected them together near the logs and soon afterwards the boy brought him the nails  the logs were lying side by side with two ends resting upon the shore the two other ends being out towards the stream marco concluded to nail first the two ends which were towards the shore they being nearest and being also more steady than the others he accordingly laid one of his short pieces across and nailed it as well as he could using the stone for a hammer  now said he to the boy ill put another board across at the middle and one more at the other end and then if i can find something for a pole ill take a little sail look about a little my boy wont you continued he and see if you cant find a pole while i am nailing the other boards  the boy accordingly went away in pursuit of a pole while marco nailed first the middle board and then the end one he came back just after marco had got the first nail of the end board driven in and as soon as he came in sight of the logs and of marco he exclaimed  youre adrift youre adrift  marco got up immediately and looked around he was indeed adrift his weight pressing upon the outer ends of the logs had lifted the other ends off the shore and the raft was slowly floating up the stream the reason why it floated up was that there was at this place what they call an eddy which is a current near the shore flowing up the stream such eddies are caused generally by curves in the banks  as soon as marco perceived that he was afloat he said  throw me the pole  the boy threw the pole and it just reached the raft marco took it in and thrusting the end hastily down into the water he endeavored to push himself back by pushing against the bottom but it was too late he had got already into such deep water that he could scarcely reach the bottom and he could not push the raft back  in the mean time the raft slowly moved up the river  never mind said marco im going right for the mill and when i get there theyll come out for me in a boat in the mean time id better finish my raft  so saying he kneeled down and finished nailing on the last board when he rose again he found that he had advanced considerably and the boy had accompanied him walking along by the shore he perceived however that he was gradually getting away from the shore and looking forward he saw to his consternation that the eddy did not extend to the mill but that at a short distance above him it swept out into the main current of the river which was running by a point of land at the upper part of the eddy with great speed the raft advanced slowly till it came to this current when it turned around and began to glide swiftly down the stream  boy cried marco in great distress run to the mill as fast as you can go and tell them that i have gone down the river adrift tell them to send a boat after me as quick as they can my cousin forester will pay them well  so the boy ran off towards the mill while marco floated away helplessly down the current     chapter iv  the desert island   after marco had sailed on for a few minutes he cast his eyes up the river and saw the steamboat she was still lying in an inclined position as she had been left grounded by the tide he shouted and waved his hat in the endeavor to attract the attention of the people on board and lead them to send a boat to rescue him but all his efforts were vain he could not make them hear  the current soon bore him beyond a point of land which hid the steamboat from his view and he began to fear that he should be actually carried out to sea he was calculating in fact how many miles it was to the mouth of the river when it suddenly occurred to him that though he could not push with his pole he might perhaps paddle with it he accordingly took up the pole which he had laid down upon the raft and began to use it as a paddle  marco found to his great relief that he could produce considerable effect upon his raft by using his pole as a paddle he contrived to get the head of his raft round towards the shore and by working hard he succeeded in urging it along through the current very slowly indeed but still perceptibly so that he began to have some hope that he might succeed in reaching land  before he had made much progress however he suddenly saw before him at a short distance a little rocky island with some grass and a few trees on the lower end of it the island was very small being not much longer than marcos raft it lay almost directly in his courseso nearly that he perceived that by working a little more with his pole he thought he could bring himself into such a position as to be thrown by the current directly upon it  this he did he paddled with all his strength to get into a line with the upper end of the island the current all the time bearing him down directly towards it in a few minutes he had the satisfaction of seeing that he was going directly upon it  all right said he to himself now im safe  as he said these words the end of the raft struck the rock and he leaped off upon it the raft swung round and was going away but marco seized it and dragged it up a little way upon the shore so as to secure it he then sat down upon the rock and began to consider what was next to be done  he was certainly at a loss to know what was to be done he waited an hour and then getting very tired of his situation he began to consider whether it would not be best for him to entrust himself once more to his raft and endeavor to get to the shore by means of his paddle  while he was sitting on a point of the rock in this perplexity looking towards the shore that was nearest to him he suddenly saw a boy coming upon a horse along a winding road which led to the river he was driving the horse down to water the horse advanced to the brink of the river when marco began to call out in his loudest voice  halloo  halloo answered the boy  cant you get a boat and come and take me off this island cried marco  the boy paused a moment and gazed earnestly at marco while the horse continued drinking  how came you on that island said the boy calling out again in a loud voice  i got adrift on some logs said marco and floated down the river cant you get a boat and come and take me off  i have not got any boat said the boy there ant any boats about here  i wish you would go and get one said marco ill pay you well for it  the boy did not answer he seemed to be hesitating in the mean time the horse having nearly finished his drinking lifted up his head and looked at marco  there is not any boat within a mile said the boy but i should think you might wade ashore the water is not deep between here and the island  then wade out here with your horse said marco and take me on behind you  the boy hesitated a moment but he finally decided to comply with marcos proposal and accordingly began to advance his horse into the water marco watched his progress with intense interest as the water grew deeper he began to fear that the boy would get discouraged and turn back but the boy kept on he turned his steps somewhat below the island where there was an extensive shoal the water grew shallower and shallower until at last the horse emerged entirely and stood upon a little dry sand bank at the lower side of the island  im very much obliged to you indeed said marco for coming for mebesides the pay i will pay you for it as soon as we get on shore  oh no said the boy i dont need any pay just for wading my horse out here i wade him out here very often when i come down to water that is in the summer when the water is low  marco mounted behind the boy and the boy turned his horses head towards the shore  how far is it back to the mill asked marco  to the steam millfour miles answered the boy  four miles exclaimed marco is it possible that i have floated down four miles how shall i ever get back again  how did you happen to get adrift asked the boy  marco proceeded to give the boy an account of his getting adrift but in a short time the water began to grow so deep that he was afraid the boy however told him that there was no danger the bottom of the river at this place was a great bed of pebble stones and the current ran very swiftly over them and curled in sharp ripples about the horses legs presently however the water became more shallow and they soon safely reached the shore  now said marco i want to get back to the mill just as quick as i canbefore the steamboat goes  the steamboat said the boy she has gone long ago she went by early this morning  yes said marco she went by here but she got stopped  so marco told the boy the story of their having got aground and of his going ashore and of all his adventures in fact down to the time of his being cast upon the desert island the boy told him that he had better make haste for said he the tide has risen a great deal already when the tide is at the lowest we can go out to that island almost on bare ground  but i cant walk back four miles said marco could you not carry me in a wagon he continued  we have got a wagon said the boy if my father will let me go  let us go right up and ask him said marco  they accordingly began to advance up the road the boy putting his horse to a rapid trot marco who was not accustomed to riding in this stylebehind another boy and without a saddlewas much jolted and in fact he found it very difficult to keep his seat he began to feel so much anxiety however about getting back again that he did not complain in a short time the boy reached the house it was a small plain farmhouse there was a shed at one side of it with a wagon standing in the shedthe shafts resting upon a woodpile  my father is not at home now said the boy but he will be at home very soon  oh dont let us wait for him rejoined marco hell be willing to have you go i know  no said the boy i should not dare to go without his leave  let us harness the horse into the wagon then at any rate said marco and then we shall be all ready  we can do that said the boy  so they harnessed the horse into the wagon and the boy led the horse around to the door marco who was quite impatient to go got into the wagon and sat waiting the man came in about twenty minutes and when he heard a statement of the case he said that his boy might go and take marco back to the mill  it was now so late that marco began to be seriously afraid that the steamboat might have gone he was very impatient to have the horse go as fast as possible and he watched at every turn in the road which gave him a view of the river hoping to get a glimpse at the boat he wondered whether forester was still at the tavern or whether he had come out in pursuit of him after wearying himself with conjectures which were all in vain he suddenly came to a view of the river opposite the mill the steamboat to his great joy was in its place but there was a black column of smoke issuing from the smokepipe  they are firing up said marco i verily believe  what do you mean by that said the boy  why building up the fires said marco to set the engine agoing they call it firing up  just at this moment there broke forth a loud and hoarse hissing from the steampipe and a dense column of white vapor began to ascend which mingled its snowy volumes in a beautiful manner with the dark masses of the smoke  they are blowing off the steam said marco  what does that mean asked the boy  why that they have got the steam up and are letting off a little of it while they are waiting for something perhaps they are waiting for us drive on as fast as you can  a moment after this the sound of the steam suddenly ceased and the great paddle wheels on the sides of the boat began slowly to revolve  they are trying to get her off said marco i do hope they cant start her drive on drive on as fast as you can  they were at this time upon the top of a hill which commanded a fine view of the river and of the scenery upon its banks the mill was before them too in full view but marco was too much engaged in watching the movements of the boat to regard the scenery the boy drove rapidly down the hill they reached the mill in a very few minutes and drove down to the bank of the river by a road which led to the water a short distance above the mill but in the mean time unfortunately for marco the steamboat had regained its liberty and when marco and the boy came in view of it again as their horse stopped at the edge of the water they saw to marcos dismay that she was ploughing her way swiftly up the river being just about to disappear behind a point of land which terminated the view of the water in that direction  they are gone said marco in a tone of despair they are gone and what shall i do  cant you go in the stage asked the boy hoping thus to say a word of encouragement and consolation  no said marco i dont believe there is any stage from this old mill besides i dont know where to go i should not have thought that forester would have gone off and left me  was he on board the steamboat asked the boy  yes said marcothat is he was to go on boardbut i left him at the tavern  perhaps he is there now said the boy let us go and see  marco approved of this plan and they turned the wagon and rode towards the tavern as soon as the horse stopped in the yard marco leaped out of the wagon and ran in he found forester reclining upon the sofa where marco had left him asleep  marco advanced towards him and took him by the shoulder roughly to wake him up saying  forester cousin forester wake up the boat has gone  forester opened his eyeslooked wildly at marco and then put his hands to his head pressing his temples with the palms but he did not speak  the boat has gone cousin forester continued marco  then what good does it do to wake me up so roughly asked forester  whyithought youd want to know it said marco but why did not you come down  because said forester you were to come and tell me i thought when they were ready to go  marco had no reply to make to this suggestion and he was silent he found afterwards on farther conversation with forester that he was quite unwell his head ached and his face was flushed as if he was feverish marco related to forester an account of his adventures on the raft of logs forester thought that he had had a very narrow escape  marco expected that forester would have rebuked him very sharply for his fault in going upon the logs at all but he did not after marco had got through with his account forester only said  well marco you evidently did wrong in getting upon the logs at all but the evil consequences to you will be punishment enough and in fact more than enough  evil consequences said marcono there are no evil consequences only that we have got left behind  i dont regard that said forester for i am too unwell to travel today but then you have suffered considerable pain and anxiety already and besides there will be some money to pay  what for said marco  why you have got to pay the boy for bringing you home replied forester  must i pay him said marco out of my own money  who do you think ought to pay him said forester  why i ought to i suppose said marco but it wont be much i think a quarter of a dollar will be enough  then did not you say that you sent to the mill to have somebody go down after you in a boat asked forester  yes said marco but i dont think they went  you had better go to the mill and see said forester  so marco went out and paid the boy a quarter of a dollar with which he seemed to be satisfied then he went to the mill and he found two men just returning in a boat from a long pull down the river in pursuit of him marco paid them half a dollar thus his loss was three quarters of a dollar  when he returned to the tavern he found that forester had taken some medicine and had gone to bed forester told him that he must amuse himself the best way he could and that after the experience that he had had that day he hoped he would be careful not to put himself any more into dangerous situations     chapter v  the benefit of the doubt   marco took dinner that day at the tavern alone and after dinner he carried a cup of tea to foresterbut forester was asleep and so he did not disturb him  in the afternoon he went out to play he amused himself for half an hour in rambling about the tavern yards and in the stables there was a ferociouslooking bull in one of the yards chained to a post by means of a ring through his nose marco looked at the bull a few minutes with great interest and then began to look about for a long stick or a pole to poke him a little through the fence to see if he could not make him roar when instead of a pole his eye fell upon a boy who was at work digging in a corner of a field near behind the barn  the boys name was jeremiah he was digging for worms for bait he was going a fishing marco determined to go with him  jeremiah furnished marco with a hook and a piece of sheet lead to make a sinker of and marco had some twine in his pocket already so that he was soon fitted with a line but he had no pole jeremiah said that he could cut one on his way down to the river as they would pass through a piece of woods which had plenty of tall and slender young trees in it  he succeeded in getting a pole in this manner which answered very well and then he and jeremiah went down to the river they stood upon a log on the shore and caught several small fishes but they got none of much value for nearly half an hour at last jeremiah who was standing at a little distance from marco suddenly exclaimed  oh here comes a monstrous great perch he is coming directly towards my hook  where where exclaimed marco and marco immediately drew out his hook from the place where he had been fishing and walked along to the log on which jeremiah was standing  where is he said marco looking eagerly into the water  hush said jeremiah dont say a word there he is swimming along towards my hook  yes said marco i see him now hes turning away a little let me put my line in too  marco extended his pole and dropped his hook gently into the water he let it down until it was near the perch the poor fish after loitering about a minute gradually approached marcos hook and bit at it  jeremiah seeing that he was in danger of losing his fish now called out to marco to take his line out it is not fair said he for you to come and take my fish just as he was going to bite at my hook go away  but it was too late as jeremiah was saying these words the fish bit and marco drawing up the line found the fish upon the end of it as the line came in however jeremiah reached out his hand to seize the fish and marco to prevent him dropped the pole and endeavored to seize it too  let go my fish said jeremiah  let alone my line said marco  neither would let go a struggle ensued and marco and jeremiah in the midst of it fell off into the water the water was not very deep and they soon clambered up upon the log again but the fish which had been pulled off the line in the contention fell into the water and swam swiftly away into the deep and dark parts of the water and was seen no more he was saved by the quarrels of his enemies  marco who was not so much accustomed to a wetting as jeremiah was became very angry and immediately set off to go home to the tavern jeremiah coolly resumed his position on the log and went to fishing again paying no heed to marcos expressions of resentment  marco walked along very uncomfortable both in body and mind his clothes were wet and muddy and the water in his shoes made a chuckling sound at every step until he stopped and took his shoes off and poured the water out it was nearly sunset when he reached the tavern he found forester better he had left his bed and had come down into the parlor he was reclining on the sofa reading a book when marco came in  marco advanced towards him and began to make bitter complaints against jeremiah in giving an account of the affair he omitted all that part of the transaction which made against himself he said nothing for instance about his coming to put his line in where jeremiah was fishing and while a fish was actually near jeremiahs hook but only said that he caught a fish and that jeremiah came and took it away  but what claim had jeremiah to the fish asked forester  he had no claim at all said marco  you mean he had no right at all said forester  yes said marco  he had a claim certainly rejoined forester that is he claimed the fish he pretended that it was his now on what was this claim or pretence founded  i dont know said marco i am sure i only know he had no right to it for i caught the fish myself and he was going to take it away  forester paused a moment and then resumed  i dont think that you have given me a full and fair account of the transaction for i cannot believe that jeremiah would have come and taken away the fish without any pretext whatever you must have omitted some important part of the account i think  marco then told forester that jeremiah said that the fish was just going to bite at his hook and after several other questions from forester he gradually acknowledged the whole truth still he maintained that it was his fish he had a right to put in his line he said wherever he pleased whether another boy was fishing or not the fish belonged to the one who caught him and before he was caught he did not belong to anybody it was absurd he maintained to suppose that the fish became jeremiahs just because he was swimming near his hook  sometimes one can judge better of a case said forester by reversing the condition of the parties suppose that you had been fishing and a large fish had come swimming about your hook and that jeremiah had then come to put his hook in at the same place should you have thought it right  why i dont know said marco  it is doubtful now it is an excellent rule continued forester in all questions of right between ourselves and other persons for us to give them the benefit of the doubt  what does that mean asked marco  why if a man is tried in a court for any crime replied forester if it is clearly proved that he is innocent of course he goes free if it is clearly proved that he is guilty he is convicted but if neither the one nor the other can be proved that is if it is doubtful whether he is innocent or guilty they give him the benefit of the doubt as they term it and let him go free  i should think that when it is doubtful said marco they ought to send him back to prison again till they can find out certainly  no said forester the jury are directed to acquit him unless it is positively proved that he is guilty so that if they think it is doubtful they give him the benefit of the doubt and let him go free now in all questions of property between ourselves and others we should all be willing to give to others the benefit of the doubt and then the disputes would be very easily settled or rather disputes would never arise in this case for instance it is doubtful whether you had a right to come and interfere while the fish was near his hook it is doubtful whether he did or did not have a sort of right to try to catch the fish without your interfering and you ought to have been willing to have given him the benefit of the doubt and so have staid away or have given up the fish to him after you had caught it  but i dont see said marco why he should not have been willing to have given me the benefit of the doubt as well as i to have given it to him  certainly said forester jeremiah ought to have considered that there was a doubt whether he was entitled to the fish or not and to have been willing to have given you the benefit of the doubt and so have let you kept the fish each in such a case ought to be willing to give up to the other  and then which of us should have it asked marco  why it generally happens said forester in reply that only one of the parties adopts this principle and so he yields to the other but if both adopt it then there is sometimes a little discussion each insisting on giving up to the other but such a dispute is a friendly dispute not a hostile one and it is very easily settled  a friendly dispute exclaimed marco i never heard of such a thing  yes said forester suppose for instance that when you had caught your fish you had said there jeremiah that fish is yours he was coming up to your hook and would have bitten at it if i had not put my line in and then if jeremiah had said no it is not mine it is yours for you caught it with your hook this would have been a friendly dispute it would have been very easily settled  i am sorry that i left my pole down at the river said marco i cut a most excellent pole in the woods on my way down and i left it there across the log i mean to go down and get it early in the morning  no said forester we must be on our way up the river early tomorrow morning  how shall we go asked marco  i have engaged a wagon here to take us to bath and there we shall find a stage  accordingly early the next morning forester and marco got into a wagon to go up the river to bath which is the first town of any considerable consequence which you meet in ascending the kennebec river marco and forester sat on the seat of the wagon and a boy who was going with them for the purpose of bringing the wagon back sat behind on a box which had been put in to make a seat for him  marco said that he was very sorry that he had not time to go and get his fishingpole  it would not do any good said forester for you could not carry it  why yes said marco we might put it on the bottom of the wagon and let the end run out behind it is pretty long  true said forester we might possibly get it to bath but what should we do with it then  why then said marco we might put it on the top of the stage i suppose would not they let us  it would not be very convenient to carry a long fishingpole in that way to quebec replied forester through woods too half of the way full of such poles you might stop and get a cane or staff if we find a place where there are some good ones a cane would be of some service to you in walking up the hills and that could be taken along with our baggage easily  marco said that he should like this plan very much and as they rode along they looked out carefully for a place where there were slender saplings growing suitable for canes  what kind of wood would you have asked forester  i dont know replied marco which kind is the best  the different woods have different qualities replied forester some are light and soft which are good qualities for certain purposes some are hard some are stiff and some flexible some are brittle and others tough for a cane now do we want a hard wood or a soft one  hard said marco  why asked forester  oh so that it shall not get indented or bruised easily replied marco  a light wood or a heavy one asked forester  light replied marco so that it will be easy to carry  stiff or flexible asked forester  stiff replied marco  yes said forester some kinds of wood grow straight and others crooked  we want it straight said marco  yes replied forester the pine grows very straight if we could find some young pines they would make us some beautifullooking canes  and how is it with the other qualities asked marco  pine is very light said forester  that is good said marco  and soft said forester  that is not so well said marco  and it is very weak and brittle  then it will not do at all said marco i want a good strong cane  just at this time they were ascending a hill and after passing over the summit of it they came to a place where forester said he saw in the woods a number of young oaks and beeches which he said would make good canes the oak he said was very strong and hard and tough so was the beech  only there are two objections to them for canes said forester as they were getting out of the wagon they are not so light as the pine and then besides they are apt to grow crooked we must look about carefully to find some that are straight  which is the most valuable of all the kinds of wood asked marco  the question is ambiguous said forester  what do you mean by that asked marco  i mean that it has two significations replied forester that is the word valuable has two significations pine is the most valuable in one sense that is pine is on the whole most useful to mankind but there are other kinds of wood which are far more costly  i should not think that pine would be so valuable said marco it is so weak and brittle  it is valuable said forester because for the purpose for which men want the greatest quantities of wood strength is not required for boarding the outsides of buildings for example and finishing them within which uses perhaps consume more wood than all others put together no great strength is required  i think people want more wood to burn than to build houses with said marco  yes said forester perhaps they do they do in this country i think but perhaps not in europe and other old countries but pine although it has no great strength is an excellent wood for building it is so soft and easily worked  foresters remarks upon the different kinds of wood were here interrupted by marcos finding what he considered an excellent stick for a cane when he had cut it however he found that it was not so straight as it had appeared to be while growing  however after some time spent in the selection marco and forester both procured excellent canes  this is good hard wood said marco as he was trimming his cane and cutting it to a proper length  illustration  yes said forester it is beech and beech is very hard  after finishing their canes they took their seats in the wagon again     chapter vi  ebony and pine   after riding along a short distance in silence marco introduced the subject of the different woods once more he asked forester which was the most costly of all the woods  costly is not an ambiguous term said forester that means which has the greatest money value  yes said marco i suppose it is mahogany  o no said forester  rose wood then said marco it must be rose wood my mother has a beautiful piano made of rose wood  no said forester ebony is more costly than either rose wood or mahogany they sell ebony by the pound  where does ebony come from asked marco  i dont know replied forester  i should like to know said marco how much do they sell it for by the pound  i dont know that either said forester i know very little about it only that it is a very costly wood on account of some peculiar properties which it has and its scarcity  what are the peculiar properties asked marco  one is its great hardness said forester it is very hard indeed another is its color  what color is it asked marco  black replied foresterblack as jet at least one kind is black as jet there is a kind which is brown it is called brown ebony  i dont think black is very pretty said marco  no said forester there does not seem to be much beauty in black in itself considered but then for certain purposes it is much handsomer than any other color would be for a cane for instance  marco looked at the beech cane which he had before him and began to consider how it would look if it were black  i suppose i could paint my cane black said he after a moments pause if you think it would be any better  no said forester i should prefer having it of its natural color the bark of the beech has beautiful colors if they are only brought out by a coat of varnish  brought out repeated marco  yes said forester there is a kind of fine dust or something like that which dims the bark but when you put on oil or varnish there is a sort of transparency given to the outside coating which brings the natural color of the bark fully to view  then i will get my cane varnished when i get to bath said marco  ebony said forester is used a great deal where a contrast with ivory is wanted ebony is hard and finegrained like ivory and it takes a high polish so whenever they want a contrast of black and white they take ebony and ivory  when do they want a contrast between black and white  one case replied forester is that of the keys of a piano forte they want the short keys which mark the semitones of a different color from the others so that the eye will catch them as quick as possible so in a chessboard they sometimes make chessboards with alternate squares of ebony and ivory  i think it would be just as well to take common wood and paint it black said marco rather than pay so much money for ebony  no said forester that would not do so well the paint would wear off or if it did not wear off by handling still if it got a little knock or hard rub a part would come off and that would show a little spot which would be of the natural color of the wood this would look very badly  then besides painted wood continued forester cannot be finished off so smoothly and polished up so highly as a wood which is black by nature they have a way of staining wood however which is better than painting it  how is that done asked marco  why they make a black stain said forester which they put upon the wood this staining soaks in a little way and blackens the fibres of the wood itself beneath the surface this of course will not wear off as easily as paint  i should not think it would wear off at all said marco  yes replied forester for if a cane is made of any wood stained black after a time the wood itself wears away farther than the staining had penetrated then the fresh wood will come to view so that if you want anything black it is much better to make it of a wood which is black all the way through  besides continued forester ebony is a very hard wood and it will bear knocks and rough usages much better than other kinds of wood which are softer once i made a carpenter an ebony wedge to split his laths with  what are laths asked marco  laths are the thin split boards which are nailed upon the sides of a room before the plastering is put on sometimes laths are made very narrow and are nailed on at a little distance from each other so as to leave a crack between them then the plastering being soft when it is put on works into the cracks and thus clings to the wood when it is dry and hard if plastering was put on to smooth boards or a smooth wall it would all fall off again very easily  yes said marco i have seen the plastering coming up through the cracks in the garret at your house in vermont  the lath boards continued forester are sometimes made narrow and nailed on at a little distance from each other and sometimes they are wide boards split up but not taken apart and then the cracks which are made in splitting them are forced open when the boards are nailed on the way they do it is this they put the wide lath board down upon a plank and make a great many cracks in it with an axe then they put it upon the wall or ceiling and nail one edge then they take a wedge and drive into one of the cracks and force it open far enough to let the plastering in then they put in some more nails in such a manner as to keep that crack open then they wedge open another crack and nail again and so on until they have nailed on the whole board so as to leave the cracks all open  and you made the carpenter an ebony wedge said marco  yes said forester he had had wedges made of the hardest wood that he could get but they would soon become bruised and battered and worn out with their hard rubbing against the sides of the cracks at last i told him i had a very hard kind of wood and i gave him a piece of ebony he made it into a wedge and after that he had no more difficulty he said his ebony wedge was just like iron  was it really as hard as iron asked marco  oh no said foresterbut it was much harder than any wood which he could get he thought it was a very curious wood he had never seen any like it before  i should like some ebony said marco  ebony would be an excellent wood to make a top of said forester it is so hard and heavy  i should like to have a top hard said marco but i dont think it would be any better for being heavy  yes said forester the top would spin longer the heavier a top is the longer it will spin  then i should like a top made of lead said marco  it would spin very long said forester if it was well made though it would require more strength to set it agoing well but lead would be soft and thus would easily get bruised and indented besides black would be a prettier color for a top than lead color a jet black top well polished would be very handsome  is black a color asked marco i read in a book once that black and white were not colors  there are two meanings to the word color said forester in one sense black is a color and in another sense it is not for instance if a lady were to go into a shop and ask for some morocco shoes for a little child and they were to show her some black ones she might say she did not want black ones she wanted colored ones in that sense black would not be a color  on the other hand continued forester she might ask for silk stockings and if the shopkeeper were to ask her what color she wanted she might say black in that sense black would be a color  which is the right sense asked marco  both are right said forester when a word is commonly used in two senses both are correct the philosophers generally consider black not to be a color that is they generally use the word in the first sense  why asked marco  for this reason replied forester he was going on to explain the reason when suddenly marcos attention was attracted by the sight of a long raft of logs which was coming down the river they had been riding at some distance from the river and out of sight of it but now it came suddenly into view just as this raft was passing by there were two men on the raft  see those men on the raft said marco they are paddling  no replied forester they are sculling  sculling repeated marco  yes replied forester they always scull a raft it is a different motion from paddling  marco watched the men attentively examining the motion which they made in sculling and considering whether he might not have sculled his raft to the shore in the same manner  illustration  what straight logs said marco  yes replied forester the pine tree grows up tall and straight and without branches to a great height this is the source of some of its most valuable properties it makes the wood straightgrained that is the fibres run smooth and regularly from one end of the stem to the other  just at this time forester saw a large pine tree growing alone by the side of the road they were travelling this solitary tree had a great many branches growing out from the stem in every part from the top to the bottom  that is because the tree grows by itself said forester in the open field those that grow in the forest do not throw out branches from the stem but they ran up to a great height with only a little tuft of branches on the top  i dont see why they dont have branches in the woods said marco  because replied forester where trees grow close together the light and the air is excluded from the lower parts of the stems and so branches cannot grow there nothing can grow without light and air  ive seen monstrous long potato sprouts grow in a dark cellar said marco  yes said forester so have i i did not think of that but they dont grow very well  they grow pretty long sometimes replied marco  at any rate said forester the branches of trees will not grow from the stems of the trees near the ground in the woods and this is of great importance for whenever a branch grows out it makes a knot extending in to the very centre of the tree this would injure a pine log very much as the knot would show in all the boards and a knot is a great injury to a pine board though it is of great benefit to a mahogany one  why asked marco  because it gives the wood a beautiful variegated appearance when they get it smoothed so that the more knotted and gnarled a log of mahogany is the better it makes the more beautiful wood but in pine it is not beauty but facility of working which is the great object so they always want to get pine as smooth and straightgrained as possible so that one of these trees that grow detached in the fields would not be of much value for lumber it has so many branches that the boards made from it would be full of knots  that is the reason i suppose said marco why they dont cut them down and make them into boards  perhaps it is replied forester  has pine any other very good qualities asked marco  i believe it is quite a durable wood said forester at any rate the stumps last a very long time in the ground i have heard it said that there are some stumps in the state of maine with the old mark of g r upon them  what does g r mean asked marco  georgius rex replied foresterthat is george the king if there are any such the mark on them means that they belonged to the king of england before this country was separated from england in those days the kings workmen went into the forests to select and mark the trees which were to be cut down for the kings use and these marks were left upon the stumps  and how long ago was that asked marco  o it must have been sixty or seventy years ago but i can hardly believe that the stumps would last as long as that  i mean to ask some of the men when i get up in the woods how long the stumps do last said marco  they last very long i know said forester the people after getting tired of waiting to have them rot out tear them up with machines and make fences of them  i dont see how they can make fences of stumps said marco  they put them in a row with the roots in the air replied forester they make a funnylooking fence  just at this time marco perceived a large town coming into view before them which forester told him was bath there were several ships building along the shore of the river  illustration     chapter vii  the bear in the mill   marco and forester found a small steamboat at bath going up the river and they took passage in it to hallowell at hallowell they took the stage and travelled along the banks of the river sometimes on one side and sometimes on the other they crossed the river by means of bridges which were erected in nearly all the principal towns they passed a number of waterfalls where sawmills had been built for sawing the logs marco was astonished at the number of these mills the quantity of logs which lay in the booms and the vast piles of boards which had accumulated in some of the sawing villages  at one of these villages where he and forester stopped to spend the night they went out in the evening to see the mills the mills were lighted by little fires of pitchpine knots which made a bright flame and gave a fine light these little fires were built upon slabs which marco thought was very dangerous the slabs however though they looked dry were really very wet being thoroughly soaked with water within having been sawed from logs which had been for a long time floating in the river  the beam to which the saw was attached in each mill as it ascended and descended with the saw passed across these lights with a rapid motion which made the lights appear and disappear in regular succession in a very beautiful manner  forester and marco clambered into one of these mills they had to make their way over slabs boards and heaps of rubbish of various kinds and the floor of the mill seemed to be made of boards and planks laid loosely and with many open places in which when marco looked down he saw dark and frightful abysses where he could hear the water dashing and now and then could get a glimpse of the foam  of course both forester and marco advanced very carefully when they had entered they found but one man tending the mill he was seated on a square block of wood near the fire eating some bread and cheese as forester and marco advanced towards him he looked up and bade them good evening  will you allow us to come in and see the mill said forester  by all means said the millman  the millman here looked around at the log which he was then sawing and he observed that it was time for him to attend to it so he put down his bread and cheese upon the block and went towards the saw forester and marco both turned to see what he was going to do  the log was lying upon a long frame which frame seemed to be mounted upon some sort of trucks for it advanced slowly by a steady motion against the saw as the saw was constantly moving up and down with great force the log was sawed as it advanced it had now advanced so far that the log had been sawed nearly through from end to end when it had gone a little farther the millman pulled a handle and stopped the motion of the carriage and the log and in a moment afterwards the log began to go back again the saw all the time ascending and descending as before but without doing any work when the log had got back so far that the saw came out of the cleft which it had made the man stopped it and then with an iron bar he shifted the position of the log in such a manner that when the carriage should be put in motion the saw would cut the log in a new place at a little distance from the othera distance just equal to the thickness of the board which they wished to make  marco watched all these movements with great interest forester who had often seen them before went back to the fire and held his hands out to it for as it was a cold evening the feeling of the warmth was pleasant he could see that marco remained talking with the millman but the noise of the machinery was so great that he could not hear what they said  the flashes of light from the fire illuminated marcos face however and forester could see that he was much interested in what the millman was telling him the millman sat down upon the log and made gestures as if he was eating something then he took hold of marco and put him down upon the log in his place and he took a seat himself beyond himthat is between marco and the saw all this time the log riding upon the great frame was slowly advancing against the saw carrying marco and the millman along with it when it had carried them so far that the millman was getting to be very near the saw he turned suddenly round and made a gesture as if he was going to clasp the saw in his armslaughing as he did itand immediately afterwards he got up from the log and marco got up toobeginning to laugh himself also though his countenance had expressed surprise and anxiety before  a short time after this when marco came back to the place where forester was forester asked him what the millman had been saying to him  he was telling me a story of a bear said marco  of a bear said forester  yes said marco of a bear in a sawmill  i dont see what a bear had to do in a sawmill replied forester  it was a great many years ago when there were bears in the woods about here there was a man sawing in a mill and he was sitting on the end of the log that he was sawing eating his bread and cheese the bread and cheese were lying on the log next to where the man was sitting  while the man was sitting there in this manner eating his bread and cheese a bear came walking into the milla great black bear he came up to the log and when he saw that the man was eating bread and cheese he thought he should like some too so he sat down on the log  on which side of the man asked forestertowards the saw or from it  illustration  towards the saw said marco the man was on the end of the log farthest from the saw the bear sat a little beyond him nearer to the saw and the bread and cheese was between them the bear began to eat the bread and cheese  how asked forester  why he took it up in his paws i suppose said marcothough i dont know certainly about that at any rate he began to eat the bread and cheesesitting with his back towards the saw and his face towards the man  and all this time you must understand said marco that the carriage was carrying the log man bear and all towards the saw and the man saw that if the bear would only keep still in his place until he was carried to the saw he would get sawed in two and so killed at first he thought it would be best for him to get hold of the iron bar if he could and beat the old bears brains out but he was afraid that he should not succeed in doing that and so he concluded to wait and see what would happen  now bears have a way continued marco whenever they are angry with anything of grasping it in their arms and hugging it tight the man did not think of this he only hoped that the saw would saw the bear in two the log moved on nearer and nearer and at last brought the bear along so far that the next stroke cut right down his back he immediately turned around and seized the saw and hugged it with all his strength and it tore him all to pieces  indeed said forester that is quite a story  forester did not seem so much astonished at this account as marco had expected but farther conversation on the subject was prevented by the occurring of a new object of attention the millman began to make arrangements for drawing up more logs from the water of the river by means of a long chain passing around a revolving axis in the manner which has been already explained  marco watched the first log as it came slowly up and then he wanted to go down the inclined plane to the water below the moon was just rising which gave them sufficient light and so forester and marco went down marco wanted to ride up on the next log but forester thought that that would be a very dangerous experiment there was however a boat lying there which forester said perhaps they might get into and take a little excursion upon the water by moonlight marco thought that he should like that very well and so he went up into the mill again to ask permission to take the boat the millman said that they might have the boat all night if they wanted it  marco accordingly returned down the inclined plane telling forester that they could have the boat but forester who began to find the evening air too cold and chilly said that he did not think it was worth while for them to set out on a voyage at so late an hour but marcos imagination was so much taken with the idea of a voyage in a boat by moonlight that he was very urgent to have forester go so forester consented and they both got into the boat  which way shall we steer asked marco  we must go up the stream said forester  why must we asked marco  because there is a dam and a waterfall below us replied forester  there was a dam across the river at the mill and the inclined plane which led from the floor of the mill down to the shore of the river terminated at the edge of the water just above the dam the water was so low that it did not fall over the dam near the shore though forester and marco could hear the roaring of the water which fell over the dam nearer the middle of the river  we must take care said marco or we shall get carried over the dam i read of an indian once who was carried over the falls of niagara  yes said forester we must be careful  forester turned the head of the boat up the river keeping near the shore so as to avoid all possibility of being carried over the dam the boat shot along swiftly through the water  the boat goes very well said marco  yes replied forester and yet it is only a log canoe  a log canoe said marco is this only a log canoe  that is all replied forester it is made of a log hollowed out they use a great many such boats on this river they go very easily with paddles  forester and marco both had paddles marco sat about in the middle of the boat but forester sat in the stern propelling the boat and steering it at the same time when they got up a little way above the dam they went out farther towards the middle of the river forester soon became warm by the exercise of paddling and had no disposition to return they both found it very romantic and delightful to glide smoothly over the glassy surface of the water which was silvered by the moonbeams  they soon came to a turn in the river which carried them away from the sight of the mills and the dam and brought them under high banks which in some places presented rocky cliffs to the view and in others were covered with forests this scenery had a peculiarly sombre and solemn expression seen thus under the light of the moon marco gazed at it in silence and with a feeling of awe  they went on in this manner for half an hour until they found themselves approaching a rocky island crowned with forests marco wanted to land upon it  very well said forester i have no objection but would you not rather go back  no said marco i want to explore this island  but are you not cold asked forester  no said marco not at all  my hands and feet are a little cold said forester  then we will go back pretty soon said marco but first just let us land a minute upon this island  so forester turned the head of the boat towards the shore and marco as soon as it touched scrambled out upon the rocks  oh forester he exclaimed at once here is plenty of driftwood let us make a fire and warm your hands and feet  driftwood rejoined forester will driftwood make a fire  why not asked marco  i should think it would be too wet replied forester  marco said no more but at that instant forester observed a little flash and then a faint glimmer of light where marco was he had lighted a match by rubbing it against some driftwood he touched it to some dry bark and soon had a pleasant little blaze upon the rocks near the shore he piled on pieces of driftwood such as branches of trees old slabs c which he found lying about there and he soon had a very good fire forester sat down upon the rocks and warmed his hands and feet  i wish i had a hatchet here said marco or an axe  why asked forester  why we could make a camp and lie here all night said marco  o no said forester  yes said marco for the man said we might have his boat all night  no replied forester we will camp out when we get fairly into the forests on dead river  accordingly after a little time when the fire had burnt down somewhat they threw the brands into the river and then embarking in their boat they returned to the mill     chapter viii  the bivouack   marco and forester had an opportunity to encamp for the night in the woods in a manner different from what they expected it happened in this way in the course of their rambles among the forests which are about the lakes and the upper branches of the kennebec they came one night to a farmhouse where they had to spend the night the house was built of logs it was in a small opening in the woods this opening was occupied with fields which were divided from each other by log fences the fields were full of stumps the whole opening was bordered on every side by a perpendicular wall of forestthe tall stems forming a colonnade which reminded marco of the palisades on the north river just above new york  there was but one room in this log house and at first marco did not know where he and forester were to sleep there was a great blazing fire in the fireplace which was made of rough stones the hearth was made of great flat stones these stones were tolerably smooth on the upper side but as they were not square there were many spaces left between them and at the corners which were filled with earth but though the fireplace was rough the great fire blazed merrily in it and marco thought that it was pleasanter than his fathers marble fireplace in new york with a grate in it filled with a hard coal fire looking like redhot stones  i wish we had such a fireplace as this in new york said marco  and wood to burn in it replied forester  o we can get wood enough in new york said marco the carmen bring it along every morning we might have such a fireplace down in the basement or in that little room in the stable and then i would go and build fires in it  just then the farmers wife came with a spider to the fire to broil some chickens for their supper she pulled out the coals with a longhandled iron shovel which she called a slice she cooked the young travellers a most excellent supper  the farmer and his wife were both rather young they had one child he was asleep in the cradle this cradle was only a box made of boards and mounted on rockers marco asked the farmer if he made the cradle himself and he said he did  there was a boy living in this house named isaiah isaiah was the farmers brother he worked hard all day on the farm and at night he slept in a sort of garret which they called the loft the way to get up to the loft was by a ladder on one side of the room  when bedtime came forester and marco climbed up this ladder and went to bed they slept upon a straw bed which was lying in a corner they had two clean but very coarse sheets and a good warm coverlid marco crept in well under the eaves of the house but forester slept on the outer side of the bed where the roof was higher  marco was awaked in the night by a strange sound which he heard directly over his head he lifted up his head and listened it was the pattering of rain upon the roof the roof was however very tight and none of the rain came in the roof was covered with shingles which the farmer had made himself in a little shop near his house  marco listened to the rain a few minutes and then went to sleep again he was glad to hear it rain because he wanted to stay at this house the next day and he thought forester would not go away in the rain  the next that he knew was that it was morning he spoke to forester saying  it rains cousin forester  does it said forester then i dont know what we shall do  we must stay here today said marco then i can see isaiah make a shingle isaiah can make a shingle did you know it  i dont hear it rain said forester  i mean to get up and see said marco  there was no glass window in this garret but the light shone through the chinks between the logs there was a wooden window as marco called it that is there was an opening in the wall with a wooden shutter to close it marco went to this window and opened it he looked out upon the wild and solitary scene which was before him with great interest at length he said  no cousin forester it does not rainbut i wish you would stay here today  very well said forester i will stay here as long as you wish  marco was rejoiced to hear this and he spent two hours after breakfast in rambling about the farmers house and grounds he went into the little shop and amused himself for half an hour in seeing isaiah make shingles isaiah let him try to make one himself and he succeeded pretty well he carried his shingle in to forester to show it to him  forester said he thought it was a very good shingle  i should like to carry it home said marco but i suppose you would think that that would be a foolish plan  no said forester i do not think it would be foolish the shingle is flat and will lie down in the bottom of your trunk and after you get tired of it as a shingle you can have a little box made of it and keep it all your life as a memorial of this expedition  this was a very good plan for marco had not shaved his shingle very thin in fact it was of about equal thickness at the two ends this though a very serious fault in a shingle made it much more suitable as a material for making a box of  marco also amused himself for half an hour in going down to the spring where the farmers wife went to get water and playing there there was a pleasant little path leading from the house down to the spring he went down once alone and brought up a pail half full of water for the farmers wife which seemed to please her very much  while he was doing these things forester remained in the house writing letters before forester had finished his last letter however marco had got tired of all his amusements and began to think that they had better resume their journey  very well said forester whenever you say the word  how are you going asked marco  i have made a bargain with the farmer said forester to let us have his wagon to go through the woods about twentyfive miles and isaiah is going with us in order to drive the wagon back  marco was much pleased with this arrangement and forester asked him what time they should start we are under your direction you know said he  yes said marco and i wish you would let me have the direction all day  i have a great mind to do it said forester  do said marco and see how well ill manage  well said forester i will give up the command to you till i resume it again  marco was quite pleased with his new powers he said they must take a hatchet and a bag of provisions for he meant to dine in the woods on the way isaiah accordingly put a hatchet in the wagon they also took some bread and cheese and some other articles of food in a bag and also a tin dipper to drink from when all was ready marco called forester and they set off their trunk was put into the wagon behind  they went on very well for ten miles the road led through thick forests for a large part of the way and it was very stony and rough but the wilderness and even the difficulties of the way interested marco very much he thought that it was much pleasanter travelling through those forest scenes the wheels of the wagon sometimes jolting over roots stones logs and sometimes sinking in the mire than riding in a carriage as he had often done with his mother over the smooth and broad avenues leading into new york  after they had gone about ten miles they were brought to a sudden stop by a tree which had been blown down and had fallen directly across the road  what is to be done now said marco  nobody answered  what is to be done now cousin forester repeated marco  i dont know said forester ive nothing to do with it you are commander  oh very well said marco then ill decide what to do well chop the tree off with our hatchet  marco bustled about with an air of great importance taking the hatchet from the back of the wagon and advancing towards the tree as if he expected to sunder it at a single blow he looked towards isaiah and seeing a lurking smile upon his countenance he immediately perceived how absurd was the idea of chopping off such an enormous stem with a hatchet  he accordingly turned suddenly about saying  no we cant cut it off with the hatchet it is too big or rather the hatchet is too little well see if we cant find a way to get around it  so marco asked forester to look on one side of the road while he and isaiah examined the other side they found that by cutting down one or two small trees they could get around very well so marco directed to have these trees cut down and then they led the horse around without much difficulty excepting a slight obstruction from the bushes  marco was quite pleased with the successful result of his management in this first serious emergency they rode on five miles farther and then marco determined that it would be a good plan to look out for a place for their dinner he chose a place in a pleasant dell overshadowed by tall pines and hemlocks and watered by a brook which meandered through the middle of it  marco directed isaiah to drive the horse out to one side of the road at a place where there was a pretty broad and level spot which seemed to marco a convenient place for the horse to stand marco told forester that he and isaiah might go and employ themselves in finding a good spot for them to make a fire and in collecting some dry wood while he fastened the horse isaiah accordingly took the axe and marco was to bring the bag of provisions  marco drew the horse out of the road and brought his head up near to the stem of a little tree which was growing there he then took out the bag and made his way through the bushes in the direction in which forester and isaiah had gone down a little cow path which descended to the bank of the brook  he found forester and isaiah very readily forester was seated upon a flat stone near the water and isaiah was gathering dry sticks for a fire it was a warm and pleasant day and they wanted a fire not so much for its warmth as for the cheerful and pleasant aspect it gave to the place there was a gentle breeze blowing that day in the open ground this breeze was not felt among the trees but it caused a gentle draft of air which carried all the smoke away from them and made their seat on the great flat stone very pleasant  have you fastened the horse said forester  yes replied marco  you ought to fasten him pretty strong said isaiah for hes very apt to get away  o he wont get away said marco i fastened him to a good stout tree  illustration  when the fire was burning well isaiah and marco buried some potatoes which they had brought with them in the embers under it they also put some apples down to roast on a flat stone which they placed near the fire  i wish we had some carolina potatoes said marco  what kind of potatoes are they asked isaiah  they are sweet they would be excellent to roast in the woods  i never heard of a potato being sweet said isaiah  yes said marco they have plenty of them in new york  then why dont they call them new york potatoes asked isaiah  why i believe they came from carolina first said marco and now i want a long stick for a toaster  so marco cut a long stick and after he had made the end sharp he put a slice of bread upon it and placed it before the fire and thus toasted the bread it is remarkable that the business of cooking the food which in houses and cities is considered a disagreeable drudgery which is to be kept as much as possible out of sight is always in the woods a very important part of the entertainment in which all the guests are pleased to take a share     chapter ix  the encampment   our party of travellers remained at the place of their bivouack more than an hour at the end of that time having eaten all that they had cooked they began to think of resuming their journey marco was sitting upon the stone wishing that he had put down one more potato to roast when suddenly he perceived a large grey squirrel upon a log near him the squirrel ran along the log and marco immediately rose and went in pursuit of him  the squirrel ascended a tree running up the stem then he glided along one of the branches till he came to the end of it when he leaped through the air and caught the end of another branch which was growing from another tree this branch which was very slender bent down half way to the ground under the squirrels weight bunny ran up the branch however as easily as if it remained level thus he went along from tree to tree following generally the direction of the path by which marco had descended in coming from the wagon  at length he emerged from the wood just at the point where marco had fastened the horse but all farther pursuit of him on the part of marco was suddenly arrested by the astounding fact which here burst suddenly upon marco that the horse and wagon were gone marco looked all about this way and that to assure himself that it was the very same place where he had fastened the horse there could be no doubt of it there was the very tree to which he had tied him and the marks of his feet near it upon the ground  marco was in consternation he looked all around and then ran into the road and looked both ways but no signs of the horse were to be seen he then hurried back to the edge of the woods and called out in a loud voice  cousin forester isaiah cousin forester our horse has got away  isaiah sprang from the seat and ran quicker than the squirrel had done up the path as he came out to the place where marco was standing marco began to say theres where i tied him i fastened him strong to that tree but isaiah paid no attention to what he said but ran directly to the road he did not stop to look both ways but taking the road which led towards his home he ran along as fast as he could go marco followed him as far as into the road and looked after him as long as he could see him isaiah was however soon out of sight and marco went back to find forester forester was coming up the path very leisurely bringing the bag with the remaining provisions in it in one hand and the hatchet in the other  well cousin forester said marco we are in a fine condition our horse and wagon have run away and now isaiah has run away too  i think isaiah will come back pretty soon said forester as to the horse and wagon that is more doubtful  and then what shall we do asked marco  i dont know said forester we are ten miles from any house in one direction and fifteen in another but im not commander its nothing to me ive only to obey orders ill do whatever you say  yes but i should think you might advise me said marco generals get advice from their captains and colonels in battle  oh yes said forester ill advise you i think we had better wait first till isaiah comes back perhaps hell find the horse  they waited about fifteen minutes and then isaiah came back but he had no horse he said he went on until he reached the top of a hill where he could see the road for a long distance before him but that the horse was not to be seen  hell get home before i should overtake him said isaiah  yes said marco unless he stopped where the tree fell across the road  true said isaiah perhaps he has stopped there  or would not he find his way round the tree through the woods asked marco  i dont know said isaiah perhaps he would  is he a pretty sensible horse asked marco  yes replied isaiah we have to keep the granary door locked or else he will open the latch with his teeth and go in and get the corn  then said marco ive no doubt that he will find his way around the tree and go home and so weve got nothing to do but to walk back fifteen miles  or forward ten said forester  yes said marco we can go on to be sure if we only knew the way  here followed a long discussion as to what it was best to do marco thought that if there was any probability that the horse would have stopped at the tree it would be better for him to go back and get him but that if he had got by the tree and had gone home it would be better for isaiah to go back and get him while they went forward to the end of the days journey he said that the trunk might be sent on  forester was himself very much at a loss to know what it was best to do as it was farther to go back than it was to go forward it would be plainly best for them to keep on were it not for the difficulty of finding their way but isaiah told them he thought they would not have any difficulty on that account as there were very few roads in such a new country he said that if they kept the principal road they could get along without any trouble  so marco and forester concluded to go on while isaiah returned isaiah said that he was not afraid to return alone he said also that if he found the horse at the tree he would turn about and come and overtake them and if he did not find him there he would walk on home and come the next day with their trunk  marco and forester then went back to the place where they had dined and collected together all the food which had been left thinking that they might possibly have occasion to use it before getting to the end of their journey they also took the hatchet with them and bidding isaiah goodby they set forth upon their solitary journey  the road though rough and narrow for wheels was very good for a footpath and the travellers went on for several miles without difficulty and with good courage there was an unbroken forest on each side of the way with here and there a solitary bird in the topmost branches singing in melancholy notes which echoed far and wide under the endless colonnades of trees after they had gone on about four miles they met a man coming with a team who told them that there was no road of any consequence to turn them off and that they would therefore probably find their way without much trouble they were quite pleased to hear this in fact it was some relief to them to know that they were right so far  marco was however not much accustomed to walk and forester to accommodate him advanced slowly when they had gone about five or six miles the shades of evening began to draw on the days were getting shorter at this season of the year and then besides it happened that on this evening there were some dark clouds in the west and the sun was darkened behind them before the regular hour of his going down then besides the trees of the forest made it darker in the road in which marco and forester were travelling  now just as it was thus beginning to grow dark they happened to come to a place where the road divided and marco and forester were both puzzled to decide which was the one which they must take the roads seemed to be nearly equally travelled though it was so dark that they could not see very well they examined both as carefully as they could and finally decided according to the best of their judgment and went on  they had some doubt whether they were right and forester thought as they proceeded that the road appeared somewhat different from the one in which they had been travelling however they thought it best to go on after advancing about two miles in a very circuitous direction they came at last to a place where several trees seemed to have been cut away and there were remains of several log huts marco was very much interested in this discovery and he wanted to examine the huts very particularly but forester when he found that they were not inhabited thought it best to lose no time especially as it was now beginning to be quite dark and he urged marco to leave the huts and press on  they went on for half a mile farther when marco seeing a glimmer through the trees exclaimed that they were coming to some water  so it is said forester it looks like a pond or a river if it is a river were lost  they walked on a short distance farther and then they began to hear the rippling of the water in a few minutes they were down upon the bank it was a small river flowing rapidly along between banks overhung with bushes marco looked for a bridge or for some place to cross but they found none in fact the road did not go down to the water but seemed to lose itself among the trees before reaching the bank  this is not our road said forester we must go back  what road can this be asked marco it seems to lead nowhere  i presume it is a logging road replied forester  what do you mean by that asked marco why i suppose that those huts must have been a logging camp where the men lived in the winter when they came here to cut logs and this is the road that they drew the logs by down to the water but this summer it has been neglected they dont cut the logs in the summer  and what shall we do asked marco  we must go back to the place where the road branched off replied forester  or else go and stay in the huts all night said marco  yes replied forester we can do that let us go back and see  they accordingly went back to the huts marco asked forester whether he thought they had better stay there  i dont know said forester let us strike a light and see how the huts look  marco took out his matchbox and after first gathering a few dry sticks he struck a light and soon made a little fire they found a birch tree growing near and they stripped off some pieces of the bark these they laid upon the fire holding the ends of two long sticks upon them in such a manner that as the pieces of birch bark curled up under the influence of the heat they curled around the ends of these sticks thus making flambeaux these flambeaux though of rude construction gave a very excellent light and marco and forester walked about the huts waving them in the air and illuminating the whole scene in a very brilliant manner  they found that the huts were in a ruinous state only one of them had a roof and that had been originally made of hemlock branches which had now become entirely dry by long exposure this covered hut was only a sort of booth being entirely open on one side forester said that he recollected having heard of such huts and that the men built their fire not in them but on the ground opposite the open side  forester and marco concluded to remain in this hut for the night they got together a great many hemlock branches which they spread in the bottom of it for a bed and they built a fire opposite the open part to keep them warm  marco took a great interest in this fire he piled the dry sticks upon it until he had a very warm and cheerful blaze and then he collected by the side of it a heap of fuel to use during the night  in fact marco raised his fire too high for from the column of smoke and sparks one little brilliant fragment lighted upon their roof and it was slowly burning and smoking there while forester and marco were opening their bag of provisions to see what they could make out for supper  marco was counting out the potatoes saying two for you and two for me when his attention was arrested by a spark which at that instant fell into his lap he looked up to see where it came from and saw that the fire which had spread from the original spark which had fallen upon the roof had burned a hole through and the air which was drawn up through the opening was at that moment fanning it into a flame  marco ran out calling out get some water get some water  there was plenty of water in a brook which flowed with a murmuring sound down a little glen behind the huts but there were no buckets and marco called in vain it would have been equally useless to have raised an alarm of fire as there was nobody within ten miles to hear the cry the flames spread rapidly and forester and marco soon saw that there was nothing to be done but for them to stand quietly by and witness the conflagration the flames rose very high and raged fiercely and the light shone far into the forest bringing into distinct view the whole scene around which had been involved in deep obscurity the roof was soon consumed but the logs of which the walls had been built were much longer in burning the fire made by these logs when they fell in together upon the bed which forester and marco had prepared was so intensely hot that it could not be approached for a long time  as soon as the intensity of this fire had a little declined forester said that they must go to work and build themselves another hut they examined the ruins of those which remained but they concluded that it would be better to build a new one than to attempt to repair one of these they accordingly determined to build one anew  they found two young trees growing pretty near each other which had branches about six feet from the ground so situated that they could place a strong pole across from one tree to the other resting the ends upon the branches this marco called the ridgepole they then cut other poles which they placed with the end on one side upon the ground and the other ends upon the ridgepole these were rafters and upon the rafters they placed a great many branches of hemlock which formed a roof this roof however was only upon one side the other side of the hut was open and they built a fire opposite this opening feeling safe in regard to their roof as it was made of green branches  illustration  this work occupied them an hour at the end of that time they put their potatoes into the fire to roast and then laid down upon the hemlock beds which they made to rest themselves a little while till the potatoes should be done wearied with their long walk and the labors of the evening they fell asleep and did not wake again till four oclock the next morning     chapter x  lost in the woods   when marco awoke he at first supposed that he had been asleep about an hour and he was surprised to see how much the fire had burned down in that time he crept towards it and began to put the brands together when suddenly he recollected the potatoes so he began to feel for them in the ashes by means of a long stick which they had obtained for a poker the potatoes were all burnt to a cinder  marco then awoke forester saying  cousin forester cousin forester wake up the fire has gone out and our potatoes are all burnt up  forester awoke and after looking at the fire and at the charred and blackened remains of the potatoes a moment he took out his watch and said  why marco it is four oclock it is almost morning  is it said marco then we have not got much more time to sleep let us build up a good fire and then lie down again  yes replied forester we must keep up a good fire or we shall take cold it is such a cool night it looks as if it were going to rain  what shall we do in that case asked marco  i dont know replied forester it would be rather a hard case for us  we could stay here i suppose said marco i dont think the rain would come through our roof  no said forester not much but then we have nothing to eat  could not we get anything to eat about here asked marco  not very well replied forester we have got money enough but this is a case where money does not seem to be of any use  how do the men who come here in the winter to cut down the trees get anything to eat asked marco  o they bring it all with them said forester the roads are better in the winter for sleds and sleighs than they are now for wheels for then all the stumps and roughnesses are covered up with the snow so wherever there is a camp there is a road leading to it and sleigh loads of provisions are brought up for the men from time to time all the winter  i wish one would come now said marco to us  i wish so too said forester but it is of no use to wish and so we may as well lie down and go to sleep again  but forester said marco i dont see what we are going to do if it rains  nor do i said forester but this is not the time for forming a plan this is the time for going to sleep i make it a rule in all perplexities and troubles when there is nothing to be done immediately in order to get out of them to lie down and go to sleep  marco said no more and forester was soon asleep again marco himself felt so much concern about his situation that he could not go to sleep for some time he lay watching the flames which were creeping slowly around the logs which he and forester had put upon the fire for while they had been holding the conversation above described they had been employed in replenishing the fire  marco heard a sound which at first he thought was a bear he was on the point of awakening forester but after listening a little longer he concluded that it was only the roaring of the wind upon the tops of the trees after lifting his head from his pillow of hemlock branches for a moment until he satisfied himself that it was no wild beast he lay down again and went to sleep  he was awakened again about three hours afterwards by a long rumbling clap of thunder  what is that said forester thunder  i believe it is said marco  and it rains i believe said forester  marco raised his head and looked out through the open part of the hut he saw the drops of rain descending and he heard the murmuring sound which the rain makes when falling upon the leaves in a forest he saw too that everything was wet in the opening about the hut although it seemed dry in the forest beyond where the drops of rain had been intercepted by the leaves of the trees  we must get our wood under cover said marco or it will get wet and wont burn and then our fire will go out  true said forester there is room for some of it in this hut let us get up and put it in  so marco and forester arose and as they were already dressed they were soon at work putting the logs into the hut marco then proposed that they should go into the forest where it did not rain and get some more wood but forester said he thought that would be of no service as they had no provisions and of course could not stay there we must go said he at any rate whether it rains or not for it is better to get wet than to starve  we have got something left in our bag said marco  yes replied forester just enough for breakfast  how i wish i had a bushel of potatoes said marco then we could stay here a week only we should want a little salt too  forester opened the bag and took out the provisions which were left they found about enough for a breakfast for them but they concluded to eat but half of their supply as forester thought it was best that they should put themselves upon short allowance  you see it is possible said forester that we may be kept here in the woods a day or two so we must use our provisions economically  after breakfast they went into the forest a little way where they found that they were protected from the rain by the trees this proved as forester said that it had not been raining very long and he thought from appearances that it would soon clear up  at a little distance from their encampment they found another hut which was in better condition than either of those which they had seen before it was covered with strips of birch bark which made a very good roof some of these strips or rather sheets for they were quite large had fallen down and marco ran and got one of them exclaiming  what a monstrous sheet of birch bark  this sheet which marco lifted up from the ground where it was lying was about four feet long and two feet wide marco wondered that so large a sheet could be got from any tree  what a monstrous tree it must have been said he to forester  no said forester not very large this sheet is about four feet long which would make the tree only about sixteen inches in diameter  how do you prove that asked marco  why the distance through a tree is about one third the distance round it replied forester now this bark grew around the tree and it is about four feet long four feet is fortyeight inches and onethird of fortyeight is sixteen now sixteen inches in diameter would not be a very large tree  i mean to try this bark on some of these trees said marco to see how big a tree it will fit  so marco took up the sheet of bark it was white and clean especially on the outside having been blanched by the summer rains marco in order to carry the sheet more easily put it upon his shoulders drawing it up around his neck like a shawl  cousin forester said he see my shawl it would do for an umbrella if i only had a handle  so saying marco drew the sheet of bark up higher holding it in such a manner that it covered his cap rising into a point above his head he held it in such a manner as to leave a little crevice open in front to peep through in order that he might see where he was going  see forester said hesee my umbrella  forester looked at marcos contrivance and he immediately thought that such a sheet would be an important protection to the head and neck in case they had to walk in the rain he accordingly went to the hut and selected a sheet for himself saying  this is not a bad plan the most important point is to protect the head and neck and this will do it pretty well we can roll the sheets up and carry them under our arms unless it rains fast and then we can wrap them around us  illustration  having thus found a rude substitute for an umbrella forester thought that it would be best for them to set out on their journey they accordingly returned to their encampment and made preparations for resuming their march as it was raining but very little at that time they rolled up their umbrellas and carried them under their arms marco took the hatchet and forester the bag of provisions marco wanted to set fire to the hut which had sheltered them for the night he wanted forester to hear what a loud crackling the green hemlock branches which they had put upon the roof would make when the flames from the wood below should envelop them  but forester would not consent to this he said that some accident might possibly happen by which they should be obliged to come back and spend another night there though he hoped such a measure would not be necessary  i hope so too said marco  we may lose our way again said forester  but then said marco we shall not come back to this place  why i have heard said forester of people losing their way in the woods and after a great deal of wandering getting back to the place they started from so that possibly we may wander about all day and get back here at night  i hope not im sure said marco i am tired of this old hovel  why the lumbermen stay in these places all winter said forester  yes replied marco but then they know that they can get out whenever they please we dont know that we can ever get out  that is true said forester and it makes a great difference  dont you feel concerned about our finding our way out asked marco  no said forester i make it a rule never to be concerned about anything  oh forester said marcoi think we ought to be concerned when we get lost in the woods  no replied forester we ought to do the best we can to get out but not to be concerned to be concerned is to be anxious and unhappy this does no good being concerned would never help us find our way out of the woods  thus talking the two unfortunate travellers walked on with their rolls under their arms it was well that they took them for after they had been walking about half an hour the sky grew dark and a short time afterwards the rain began to come down in torrents forester and marco unrolled their umbrellas and wrapped them about their shoulders and heads and at the same time they fled for shelter under an enormous pine tree which grew in such a spot that its branches extended in every direction and formed a canopy above them which kept off a great deal of the rain when the rain abated a little they walked on  their plan was to get back to the place where they had left the main road the day before but they were somewhat perplexed to find it in fact they met with several roads which branched off from the one in which they were walking these were old tracks made by the lumbermen and were partly grown up to bushes they wandered about among these paths for some time and at last to their great joy they came out into a good beaten road which forester immediately thought was the one which they had been travelling in the day before notwithstanding foresters philosophical resolution never to be concerned he could not help confessing that he felt somewhat relieved to find the right road again and as the sun was just breaking through the clouds at this time they both thought that their prospects were brightening considerably     chapter xi  the shingle weavers   the travellers walked on with fresh strength and courage now that they thought they were in the right road the road was however monotonous being for most of the way through a dense forest and it was so very similar to the road by which they had come the day before that they were convinced they were now right  they went on without any special adventure for nearly two hours when they arrived at what had the appearance of being an old wood road which branched off at right angles to the one in which they were travelling the trees were somewhat more open here this admitted the sun and there were several raspberry bushes growing at the entrance of the wood road with ripe raspberries hanging upon them for the season of raspberries had now arrived  marco seized this fruit with great avidity forester followed his example and began gathering the berries the bushes were however not entirely dry and they had to advance cautiously among them in fact they found it better to keep along the wood road gathering the berries as they advanced it was not a road strictly speaking for there were no marks of wheels upon it or tracks of any sort made by travelling it was only a space for a road made by cutting away the trees and bushes  along this opening forester and marco slowly advanced eating the raspberries which grew by the side of the way after going on for a few rods in this manner marco suddenly exclaimed  why here is another camp  forester looked up and saw just before them the remains of a sort of hut somewhat similar to those which they had seen the evening before there was a large heap of chips and shavings about it  what can this be asked marco  i presume said forester that it is an old shingle weavers establishment  what is a shingle weaver asked marco  a man who makes shingles replied forester such as they use for covering houses they make them of clear straightgrained pine which will split easily and true  so saying forester advanced towards the hut and took up one of the pieces of pine which had been split out for a shingle there were several of such pieces lying about among the chips and shavings it was somewhat browned by exposure to the weather but it had a very smooth and glossy appearance shining with a sort of silken lustre  this is a beautiful piece of pine said forester  let us carry some of it home rejoined marco  what good would it do us asked forester  why we might make something of it said marco perhaps i could make a little box  and that would serve as a souvenir of this expedition added forester  a souvenir said marcowhat is that  why something to remember it by replied forester hereafter whenever you should see the box you would be reminded of our wanderings and perils in this wilderness  well said marco let us take it  the farther conversation of our adventurers was interrupted by a sound like that of wagon wheels coming along the main road which they had just left  there comes some traveller exclaimed forester let us go and enquire about our way  hark said marco  at this instant the sound of the wheels suddenly stopped and marco and forester heard the voice of a man calling out earnestly to his horse whoa whoa as if something had happened marco and forester hastened to the spot where they found that the horse had fallen down and the man was trying in vain to get him up the harness was drawn so tight about the horses limbs by the constrained position in which he was lying that he could not get up and the man could not extricate him the man had gone behind and had drawn the wagon back so as to loosen the pressure of the harness upon the horse but until forester and marco came there was no one to unbuckle the straps when they were thus loosened and if the man let go of the wagon to go and unbuckle the harness it was drawn back again at once by the tension of the straps and made as tight as before  he was therefore very glad to see forester and marco coming he asked them to come and help him  forester and marco were immediately going to attempt to unbuckle the harness but the man told them that there was danger of their getting kicked by the horse in case he should suddenly begin to struggle  come here said the man and hold the wagon back and i will loosen the harness  by means of this plan of operations the horse was soon liberated from his confinement and he got up the man seemed very thankful to forester and marco and he asked them where they were going  we are going to no 3 said forester is this the right way  the townships in a new country are numbered at first not named the place to which marco and forester were going had yet very few inhabitants and it had no name but no 3  yes replied the man this is the right road i wish i was going that way i would take you along in my wagon  this answer puzzled marco a little on two accounts first the man was going the same way with them but then marco thought that perhaps he was going to turn off pretty soon into some other road then secondly he did not see how the man could possibly carry him and forester in any event as the wagon seemed completely filled with bags and kegs and firkins leaving scarcely room for the man himself to sit  forester told the man that they could walk very well but he said that they were hungry and if the man had anything to eat in his wagon they should be glad to buy something of him  yes replied the man ive a loaf of bread that i can spare and a jug of milk  that will be just the thing said marco  at first the man was not willing to receive anything for the bread and milk but as forester insisted upon it he consented to take a little pay he then told forester that he had some honey in his wagon and a few apples and forester bought a supply of these at first they thought they should not have anything to put the honey in but marco ran to the shingle weavers hut and got one of the thin pieces which had been split out for shingles and it made a very good plate forester bought a pound of the honey and half a dozen apples  they then bade the man goodby and he resumed his journey forester and marco went back to the hut where they had a most excellent dinner they built a fire and roasted the apples and toasted the bread they cut it into slices with marcos knife they made wooden spoons for the honey out of pieces of pine which answered very well indeed marco said it was the very best dinner he ever ate in his life  after dinner they returned to the main road and resumed their walk forester said he wished he had asked the man how far it was to no 3 but he thought it could not be very far as they had been travelling nearly three hours and it was only about ten miles in the morning  as he was saying this they were just ascending a hill and when they reached the top of it they had a prospect of the road for a considerable distance before them marco thought he saw something coming and he asked forester what it was  i think it is only a stump or something like that said forester  no it moves said marco  it is another wagon said forester i really believe now we can find out how far it is to no 3  it was very soon quite evident that it was a wagon and that it was coming on apace as it drew nearer it appeared that there was a boy in it  he is just about as big as isaiah said marco  yes said forester and the horse looks very much like the horse isaiah had  i verily believe it is isaiah said marco  this supposition was confirmed as the wagon drew near the boy was isaiah but he stared at marco and forester with a look of perplexity and wonder as if he was very much surprised to see them  isaiah said marco accosting him as soon as isaiah drew up the reins and stopped the horse opposite to them  what are you coming back for asked isaiah  coming back repeated forester not knowing exactly what isaiah meant  yes said isaiah i thought you were going to stay at no 3 and i was going to carry your trunk there  it immediately flashed upon foresters mind that they had got turned about in their wanderings and instead of going on towards no 3 as they supposed they were in reality though in the right road going the wrong way in it  forester had a hearty laugh at this discovery in which marco joined as soon as he fairly understood the case at first he was very much perplexed he could not believe that they could have got their ideas of direction so completely reversed  besides said he that man told us that we were in the right way  yes said forester but he did not tell us that we were going right in it  i suppose he did not know which way we were going said marco  the question then arose what was to be done forester proposed that they should get into the wagon and let isaiah drive them to no 3 but marco said that he was commander and he was not going to try to get to no 3 any more he had been travelling back and forth through those woods long enough and he declared that he would not vote to go through them again if he had to go round the world to get to the other side of them  forester laughed and submitted to the decision so they all returned to isaiahs fathers  the next morning they formed a different plan for pursuing their journey they wanted to get to the quebec road now as soon as possible and they found by enquiry that by taking a boat upon a large pond or lake a few miles distant they could go about twenty miles by water through a chain of ponds which led in the direction in which they wished to go  so forester hired a man to go with them and bring back the boat they went in a wagon to a place very near the landing at the pond the landing was in a small cove surrounded by forests the cove opened out into the pond by two points of land rocky and precipitous and crowned with evergreen trees the water was smooth and the whole scene highly picturesque when marco came in sight of it he was much pleased with the prospect of a voyage on such a sheet of water  there was considerable water in the boat when the party arrived on the beach and forester undertook to bail it out the man who was going with them went and cut a bush with a thick top to use as a sail in case there should be a fair wind while he was bringing the bush and forester was bailing out the boat marco stood upon the beach looking at the paddles  does she leak cousin forester asked marco  illustration  no said forester i presume not this water all comes from the rain  im glad to hear that said marco for i dont want to go to sea in a leaky ship  there was a great basket of provisions on the beach by the side of marco while these preparations were making for they were resolved not to expose themselves a second time to the danger of famine when all was ready the bush the basket and the paddles were put on board and our adventurers after gliding smoothly through the water to the outlet of the cove doubled one of the rocky points of land and pushed boldly out upon the waters of the pond     chapter xii  a voyage on the pond   as the boat moved on propelled by the paddles which forester and the man who accompanied them were plying marco sat upon a thwart and gazed upon the picturesque and romantic scene around him the shores of the lake or pond formed many beautiful points and promontories with deep bays between them there were a great many islands too scattered over its surface marco wanted to land upon some of these but forester thought that they had better make the best of their way towards their destined port  marco contented himself therefore with gazing on the changing scenery as they passed in succession one island and promontory after another the whole country was covered with forests except that here and there was an opening with the house and barn of a settler in the middle of it smokes were rising too in various directions where new clearings were in progress there was one in particular on the side of a distant hill which rose in such dense white volumes as especially to attract marcos attention  when marco had admired these objects long enough he leaned a little over the side of the boat and began to look down into the water the water was not deep and the bottom was smooth and sandy they glided rapidly along over these sands marcos leaning caused the boat to incline a little to one side but forester instead of asking him not to lean over so just moved himself a little in the contrary direction and thus restored the equilibrium  there forester said marco suddenly raising himself i forgot one thing  what is that said forester  i forgot my piece of wood to make a box of  i am very sorry said forester but then you can get another piece perhaps before we get to the end of our journey  but i wanted a piece from that very hut so as to make the box a souvenir of our having got lost in the woods said marco  yes rejoined forester that would have been very pleasantbut perhaps we shall meet with some other odd adventure which will be as good as being lost in the woods  i dont think being lost in the woods is anything very good said marco  it is not a very good thing at the time but the recollection of such adventures and dangers is always pleasant afterwards you see you specially want a souvenir of it  but marco continued forester i have thought of something which will be perhaps better than a box at any rate it will be more convenient to make  what is it said marco  a little press for pressing flowers replied forester  how could i make it asked marco  have two pieces of pine wood planed out thin said forester they might be varnished and that would make them look very neat and pretty  how large must they be asked marco  oh about as large replied forester as the covers of a small book just large enough to make it convenient to carry in the pocket then you must have some pieces of soft paper of the same size and shape to put between them you must also have a piece of cord or braid or something of that kind to tie around them to keep them together then when you are travelling if you find any pretty flower you can put it into this press and put the press in your pocket thus the press will not only be a souvenir itself but it will procure for you a great many other souvenirs  thats an excellent plan said marco i like it very much that will be better than a box  it will be easier to make at any rate replied forester any joiner can plane out and square the boards for you  yes said marco i mean to get a piece of pine to make them of the first time i find any  marco had an opportunity to get a piece of pine suitable for this purpose and at the same time a souvenir itself of an adventure sooner than he anticipated for after having paddled many miles towards noon a breeze sprung up which though really not against them retarded them somewhat as it tended to drive them out of their course their intention had been to have stopped upon the water about noon to eat their dinner but as this breeze would prevent the boat from remaining at rest they concluded to land upon an island which was near where they were at the time and take their dinner there marco was particularly pleased with this plan as it would enable him to build a fire and he always wanted to build a fire on such occasions whether there was anything to be cooked by it or not  the island was rocky and it was covered with trees on the sheltered side of it there was a beach where the party landed although this beach was somewhat protected from the wind still the waves which rolled in kept the water in a state of agitation they however landed here running the head of the boat upon the sand  there was a large tree lying here with its top in the water and buttend upon the beach it was a tree which some settler had cut down at some place near the shore of the pond and when the water was high it had been washed off and after drifting about the pond for some time it had got lodged upon this beach where it remained in the position in which our adventurers found it it had been lying there for more than a year and the branches which were out of the water were dead and dry the foliage had long since disappeared  the boatman brought the boat up alongside of this tree so that forester and marco stepped out upon the trunk and walked to the land the boatman then tied the boat to one of the dead branches of the tree and taking the basket of provisions and the hatchet they all walked along in search of a place for their dinner  they found a sheltered and pleasant place at a little distance under the trees marco soon struck a light and began to build a fire he found it somewhat difficult however to procure dry wood enough for the fire until at last he thought of the branches of the tree to which the boat was fastened he accordingly went to the place and began to cut them off  the boat was somewhat in the way while he was doing this and he thought he would move it he could fasten it just as well he thought by a stake driven into the sand he therefore cut off one of the branches and after squaring one end and sharpening the other he drove it down as well as he could into the sand he then fastened the boat to this stake thus removing it from the tree and clearing the way so that he could conveniently cut off the branches  this was not however a very wise operation for it is very difficult to drive a stake securely into sand sand even when wet has so little tenacity that it yields to the slightest force and the stake soon began to work loose by the motion of the boat agitated by the waves and in fact before marco had finished carrying away the branches the stake was entirely loosened from its bed and was just ready to topple over  as the boat continued to pull upon it this way and that as it was agitated by the fluctuation of the water it soon drew it down and the boat being now entirely at liberty began to move slowly off from the shore it soon drifted out where it was more fully exposed to the action of the wind when it began to move much faster and thus while our party of voyagers were eating their dinner seated on a flat rock by the side of a good fire in fancied security their boat was quietly drifting away thus apparently cutting them off from all communication with the main land  marco made the discovery that the boat was gone just after finishing his dinner and he immediately gave the alarm forester and the boatman came at once to the spot they could just see the boat half a mile distant under a ledge of rocks which formed the shore in that place  this was the third time on this journey that marco had found himself isolated in circumstances of difficulty and danger and cut off apparently from all convenient means of retreat and at first he thought that this was the worst and the most dangerous of the three in fact he did not see in what possible way they could escape  what shall we do asked forester  we must make a raft somehow or other said the boatman if i had a log i could go after the boat on that  wont this tree answer for a log asked marco  the boatman looked at the tree he said that if he had an axe he thought he could cut off the top and roll the trunk into the water but it would take him a long time he said to hack it off with the hatchet  there seemed to be however no alternative so he set himself at work and in due time he cut off the stem of the tree just where it entered the water they all three then took levers which the boatman made with his hatchet and by making great exertion they got the log out of the sand and rolled it round into the water where it floated the man then cut a long pole and mounting upon the log he pushed himself out over the surface of the water  forester and marco watched his progress with great interest marco thought that he would certainly roll off the log but he seemed to stand and to walk upon it perfectly at his ease he would advance to the forward end of the log and then planting the foot of his pole in the sand on the bottom he would push walking along as the log advanced until he came to the stern end of the log when he would draw out his pole and walk back again in this way he propelled the log until the water became too deep for his pole to reach the bottom and then he ceased these efforts and standing upright he left himself to be driven along slowly by the wind  illustration  forester and marco saw plainly that he would be gone for some time and they amused themselves during his absence in wandering about the shores of the island in one place marco found upon a rock a little above the water a slab of pine wood which was bleached by the sun and rain it had drifted down the summer before from some stream emptying into the pond in the winter it had been frozen into the ice and when the ice broke up on the following spring the cake to which the slab was attached had been crowded up upon the shore where the slab had been left when the ice melted  marco immediately thought that this slab would furnish him with a good piece of wood to make a flower press of and he accordingly dragged it up where he could work upon it with his hatchet he soon cut off a piece of the proper length and hewed it down so as to make it of a convenient shape to carry  when forester came to examine it he said he thought it was a very good piece and when it was planed smooth and varnished he thought from its appearance that it would be of a very pretty color  you can get it made at the first shop we come to said forester and then you can collect and preserve a great many flowers in it when we get to canada when you get home you can put them in a book and call them the canadian flora  thats just what ill do said marco and then when i get home ill give some of them to my cousins they will like them because they came from canada but i cant put a great many into such a press  no said forester you only collect them in the press which you always carry with you in your pocket you put them all in a book or in a larger press as soon as you get home and then you have the small press ready for use again  while they were talking thus they watched the boatman who had by this time reached the land and recovered the boat he came back quite rapidly propelling the boat with the paddle marco and forester embarked on board of her and they finished their voyage without any further adventure the next day they reached the quebec road and leaving the region of the kennebec they went on their way towards canada
