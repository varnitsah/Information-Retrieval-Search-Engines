3329128	a pair of blue eyes  by thomas hardy          a violet in the youth of primy nature        forward not permanent sweet not lasting        the perfume and suppliance of a minute        no more     preface  the following chapters were written at a time when the craze for indiscriminate churchrestoration had just reached the remotest nooks of western england where the wild and tragic features of the coast had long combined in perfect harmony with the crude gothic art of the ecclesiastical buildings scattered along it throwing into extraordinary discord all architectural attempts at newness there to restore the grey carcases of a mediaevalism whose spirit had fled seemed a not less incongruous act than to set about renovating the adjoining crags themselves  hence it happened that an imaginary history of three human hearts whose emotions were not without correspondence with these material circumstances found in the ordinary incidents of such churchrenovations a fitting frame for its presentation  the shore and country about castle boterel is now getting well known and will be readily recognized the spot is i may add the furthest westward of all those convenient corners wherein i have ventured to erect my theatre for these imperfect little dramas of country life and passions and it lies near to or no great way beyond the vague border of the wessex kingdom on that side which like the westering verge of modern american settlements was progressive and uncertain  this however is of little importance the place is preeminently for one person at least the region of dream and mystery the ghostly birds the palllike sea the frothy wind the eternal soliloquy of the waters the bloom of dark purple cast that seems to exhale from the shoreward precipices in themselves lend to the scene an atmosphere like the twilight of a night vision  one enormous seabord cliff in particular figures in the narrative and for some forgotten reason or other this cliff was described in the story as being without a name accuracy would require the statement to be that a remarkable cliff which resembles in many points the cliff of the description bears a name that no event has made famous                                           t h march 1899                               the persons          elfride swancourt            a young lady         christopher swancourt        a

maidservant    other servants masons labourers grooms nondescripts etc etc   the scene  mostly on the outskirts of lower wessex     chapter i       a fair vestal throned in the west   elfride swancourt was a girl whose emotions lay very near the surface their nature more precisely and as modified by the creeping hours of time was known only to those who watched the circumstances of her history  personally she was the combination of very interesting particulars whose rarity however lay in the combination itself rather than in the individual elements combined as a matter of fact you did not see the form and substance of her features when conversing with her and this charming power of preventing a material study of her lineaments by an interlocutor originated not in the cloaking effect of a wellformed manner for her manner was childish and scarcely formed but in the attractive crudeness of the remarks themselves she had lived all her life in retirementthe monstrari gigito of idle men had not flattered her and at the age of nineteen or twenty she was no further on in social consciousness than an urban young lady of fifteen  one point in her however you did notice that was her eyes in them was seen a sublimation of all of her it was not necessary to look further there she lived  these eyes were blue blue as autumn distanceblue as the blue we see between the retreating mouldings of hills and woody slopes on a sunny september morning a misty and shady blue that had no beginning or surface and was looked into rather than at  as to her presence it was not powerful it was weak some women can make their personality pervade the atmosphere of a whole banqueting hall elfrides was no more pervasive than that of a kitten  elfride had as her own the thoughtfulness which appears in the face of the madonna della sedia without its rapture the warmth and spirit of the type of womans feature most common to the beautiesmortal and immortalof rubens without their insistent fleshiness the characteristic expression of the female faces of correggiothat of the yearning human thoughts that lie too deep for tearswas hers sometimes but seldom under ordinary conditions  the point in elfride swancourts life at which a deeper current may be said to have permanently set in was one winter afternoon when she found herself standing in the character of hostess face to face with a man she had never seen beforemoreover looking at him with a mirandalike curiosity and interest that she had never yet bestowed on a mortal  on this particular day her father the vicar of a parish on the seaswept outskirts of lower wessex and a widower was suffering from an attack of gout after finishing her household supervisions elfride became restless and several times left the room ascended the staircase and knocked at her fathers chamberdoor  come in was always answered in a hearty outofdoor voice from the inside  papa she said on one occasion to the fine redfaced handsome man of forty who puffing and fizzing like a bursting bottle lay on the bed wrapped in a dressinggown and every now and then enunciating in spite of himself about one letter of some word or words that were almost oaths papa will you not come downstairs this evening she spoke distinctly he was rather deaf  afraid notehhhvery much afraid i shall not elfride piphphph i cant bear even a handkerchief upon this deuced toe of mine much less a stocking or slipperpiphphph there tis again no i shant get up till tomorrow  then i hope this london man wont come for i dont know what i should do papa  well it would be awkward certainly  i should hardly think he would come today  why  because the wind blows so  wind what ideas you have elfride who ever heard of wind stopping a man from doing his business the idea of this toe of mine coming on so suddenlyif he should come you must send him up to me i suppose and then give him some food and put him to bed in some way dear me what a nuisance all this is  must he have dinner  too heavy for a tired man at the end of a tedious journey  tea then  not substantial enough  high tea then there is cold fowl rabbitpie some pasties and things of that kind  yes high tea  must i pour out his tea papa  of course you are the mistress of the house  what sit there all the time with a stranger just as if i knew him and not anybody to introduce us  nonsense child about introducing you know better than that a practical professional man tired and hungry who has been travelling ever since daylight this morning will hardly be inclined to talk and air courtesies tonight he wants food and shelter and you must see that he has it simply because i am suddenly laid up and cannot there is nothing so dreadful in that i hope you get all kinds of stuff into your head from reading so many of those novels  oh no there is nothing dreadful in it when it becomes plainly a case of necessity like this but you see you are always there when people come to dinner even if we know them and this is some strange london man of the world who will think it odd perhaps  very well let him  is he mr hewbys partner  i should scarcely think so he may be  how old is he i wonder  that i cannot tell you will find the copy of my letter to mr hewby and his answer upon the table in the study you may read them and then youll know as much as i do about our visitor  i have read them  well whats the use of asking questions then they contain all i know ughhhod plague you you young scamp dont put anything there i cant bear the weight of a fly  oh i am sorry papa i forgot i thought you might be cold she said hastily removing the rug she had thrown upon the feet of the sufferer and waiting till she saw that consciousness of her offence had passed from his face she withdrew from the room and retired again downstairs     chapter ii       twas on the evening of a winters day   when two or three additional hours had merged the same afternoon in evening some moving outlines might have been observed against the sky on the summit of a wild lone hill in that district they circumscribed two men having at present the aspect of silhouettes sitting in a dogcart and pushing along in the teeth of the wind scarcely a solitary house or man had been visible along the whole dreary distance of open country they were traversing and now that night had begun to fall the faint twilight which still gave an idea of the landscape to their observation was enlivened by the quiet appearance of the planet jupiter momentarily gleaming in intenser brilliancy in front of them and by sirius shedding his rays in rivalry from his position over their shoulders the only lights apparent on earth were some spots of dull red glowing here and there upon the distant hills which as the driver of the vehicle gratuitously remarked to the hirer were smouldering fires for the consumption of peat and gorseroots where the common was being broken up for agricultural purposes the wind prevailed with but little abatement from its daytime boisterousness three or four small clouds delicate and pale creeping along under the sky southward to the channel  fourteen of the sixteen miles intervening between the railway terminus and the end of their journey had been gone over when they began to pass along the brink of a valley some miles in extent wherein the wintry skeletons of a more luxuriant vegetation than had hitherto surrounded them proclaimed an increased richness of soil which showed signs of far more careful enclosure and management than had any slopes they had yet passed a little farther and an opening in the elms stretching up from this fertile valley revealed a mansion  thats endelstow house lord luxellians said the driver  endelstow house lord luxellians repeated the other mechanically he then turned himself sideways and keenly scrutinized the almost invisible house with an interest which the indistinct picture itself seemed far from adequate to create yes thats lord luxellians he said yet again after a while as he still looked in the same direction  what be we going there  no endelstow vicarage as i have told you  i thought you mt have altered your mind sir as ye have stared that way at nothing so long  oh no i am interested in the house thats all  most people be as the saying is  not in the sense that i am  ohwell his family is no better than my own a blieve  how is that  hedgers and ditchers by rights but once in ancient times one of em when he was at work changed clothes with king charles the second and saved the kings life king charles came up to him like a common man and said offhand man in the smockfrock my name is charles the second and thats the truth ont will you lend me your clothes i dont mind if i do said hedger luxellian and they changed there and then now mind ye king charles the second said like a common man as he rode away if ever i come to the crown you come to court knock at the door and say out bold is king charles the second at home tell your name and they shall let you in and you shall be made a lord now that was very nice of master charley  very nice indeed  well as the story is the king came to the throne and some years after that away went hedger luxellian knocked at the kings door and asked if king charles the second was in no he isnt they said then is charles the third said hedger luxellian yes said a young feller standing by like a common man only he had a crown on my name is charles the third and  i really fancy that must be a mistake i dont recollect anything in english history about charles the third said the other in a tone of mild remonstrance  oh thats right history enough only twasnt prented he was rather a queertempered man if you remember  very well go on  and by hook or by crook hedger luxellian was made a lord and everything went on well till some time after when he got into a most terrible row with king charles the fourth  i cant stand charles the fourth upon my word thats too much  why there was a george the fourth wasnt there  certainly  well charleses be as common as georges however ill say no more about itah well tis the funniest world ever i lived inupon my life tis ah that such should be  the dusk had thickened into darkness while they thus conversed and the outline and surface of the mansion gradually disappeared the windows which had before been as black blots on a lighter expanse of wall became illuminated and were transfigured to squares of light on the general dark body of the night landscape as it absorbed the outlines of the edifice into its gloomy monochrome  not another word was spoken for some time and they climbed a hill then another hill piled on the summit of the first an additional mile of plateau followed from which could be discerned two lighthouses on the coast they were nearing reposing on the horizon with a calm lustre of benignity another oasis was reached a little dell lay like a nest at their feet towards which the driver pulled the horse at a sharp angle and descended a steep slope which dived under the trees like a rabbits burrow they sank lower and lower  endelstow vicarage is inside here continued the man with the reins this part about here is west endelstow lord luxellians is east endelstow and has a church to itself pason swancourt is the pason of both and bobs backward and forward ah well tis a funny world a blieve there was once a quarry where this house stands the man who built it in past time scraped all the glebe for earth to put round the vicarage and laid out a little paradise of flowers and trees in the soil he had got together in this way whilst the fields he scraped have been good for nothing ever since  how long has the present incumbent been here  maybe about a year or a year and half tisnt two years for they dont scandalize him yet and as a rule a parish begins to scandalize the pason at the end of two years among em familiar but hes a very nice party ay pason swancourt knows me pretty well from often driving over and i know pason swancourt  they emerged from the bower swept round in a curve and the chimneys and gables of the vicarage became darkly visible not a light showed anywhere they alighted the man felt his way into the porch and rang the bell  at the end of three or four minutes spent in patient waiting without hearing any sounds of a response the stranger advanced and repeated the call in a more decided manner he then fancied he heard footsteps in the hall and sundry movements of the doorknob but nobody appeared  perhaps they beant at home sighed the driver and i promised myself a bit of supper in pason swancourts kitchen sich lovely matepize and figged keakes and cider and drops o cordial that they do keep here  all right naibours be ye rich men or be ye poor men that ye must needs come to the worlds end at this time o night exclaimed a voice at this instant and turning their heads they saw a rickety individual shambling round from the back door with a horn lantern dangling from his hand  time o night a blieve and the clock only gone seven of em show a light and let us in william worm  oh that you robert lickpan  nobody else william worm  and is the visiting man acome  yes said the stranger is mr swancourt at home  that a is sir and would ye mind coming round by the back way the front door is got stuck wi the wet as he will do sometimes and the turk cant open en i know i am only a poor wambling man that ill never pay the lord for my making sir but i can show the way in sir  the new arrival followed his guide through a little door in a wall and then promenaded a scullery and a kitchen along which he passed with eyes rigidly fixed in advance an inbred horror of prying forbidding him to gaze around apartments that formed the back side of the household tapestry entering the hall he was about to be shown to his room when from the inner lobby of the front entrance whither she had gone to learn the cause of the delay sailed forth the form of elfride her start of amazement at the sight of the visitor coming forth from under the stairs proved that she had not been expecting this surprising flank movement which had been originated entirely by the ingenuity of william worm  she appeared in the prettiest of all feminine guises that is to say in demitoilette with plenty of loose curly hair tumbling down about her shoulders an expression of uneasiness pervaded her countenance and altogether she scarcely appeared woman enough for the situation the visitor removed his hat and the first words were spoken elfride prelusively looking with a deal of interest not unmixed with surprise at the person towards whom she was to do the duties of hospitality  i am mr smith said the stranger in a musical voice  i am miss swancourt said elfride  her constraint was over the great contrast between the reality she beheld before her and the dark taciturn sharp elderly man of business who had lurked in her imaginationa man with clothes smelling of city smoke skin sallow from want of sun and talk flavoured with epigramwas such a relief to her that elfride smiled almost laughed in the newcomers face  stephen smith who has hitherto been hidden from us by the darkness was at this time of his life but a youth in appearance and barely a man in years judging from his look london was the last place in the world that one would have imagined to be the scene of his activities such a face surely could not be nourished amid smoke and mud and fog and dust such an open countenance could never even have seen anything of the weariness the fever and the fret of babylon the second  his complexion was as fine as elfrides own the pink of his cheeks as delicate his mouth as perfect as cupids bow in form and as cherryred in colour as hers bright curly hair bright sparkling bluegray eyes a boys blush and manner neither whisker nor moustache unless a little lightbrown fur on his upper lip deserved the latter title this composed the london professional man the prospect of whose advent had so troubled elfride  elfride hastened to say she was sorry to tell him that mr swancourt was not able to receive him that evening and gave the reason why mr smith replied in a voice boyish by nature and manly by art that he was very sorry to hear this news but that as far as his reception was concerned it did not matter in the least  stephen was shown up to his room in his absence elfride stealthily glided into her fathers  hes come papa such a young man for a business man  oh indeed  his face iswellpretty just like mine  hm what next  nothing thats all i know of him yet it is rather nice is it not  well we shall see that when we know him better go down and give the poor fellow something to eat and drink for heavens sake and when he has done eating say i should like to have a few words with him if he doesnt mind coming up here  the young lady glided downstairs again and whilst she awaits young smiths entry the letters referring to his visit had better be given   1mr swancourt to mr hewby  endelstow vicarage feb 18 18  sirwe are thinking of restoring the tower and aisle of the church in this parish and lord luxellian the patron of the living has mentioned your name as that of a trustworthy architect whom it would be desirable to ask to superintend the work  i am exceedingly ignorant of the necessary preliminary steps probably however the first is that should you be as lord luxellian says you are disposed to assist us yourself or some member of your staff come and see the building and report thereupon for the satisfaction of parishioners and others  the spot is a very remote one we have no railway within fourteen miles and the nearest place for putting up atcalled a town though merely a large villageis castle boterel two miles further on so that it would be most convenient for you to stay at the vicaragewhich i am glad to place at your disposalinstead of pushing on to the hotel at castle boterel and coming back again in the morning  any day of the next week that you like to name for the visit will find us quite ready to receive youyours very truly  christopher swancourt   2mr hewby to mr swancourt  percy place charing cross feb 20 18  dear siragreeably to your request of the 18th instant i have arranged to survey and make drawings of the aisle and tower of your parish church and of the dilapidations which have been suffered to accrue thereto with a view to its restoration  my assistant mr stephen smith will leave london by the early train tomorrow morning for the purpose many thanks for your proposal to accommodate him he will take advantage of your offer and will probably reach your house at some hour of the evening you may put every confidence in him and may rely upon his discernment in the matter of church architecture  trusting that the plans for the restoration which i shall prepare from the details of his survey will prove satisfactory to yourself and lord luxellian i am dear sir yours faithfully  walter hewby     chapter iii       melodious birds sing madrigals   that first repast in endelstow vicarage was a very agreeable one to young stephen smith the table was spread as elfride had suggested to her father with the materials for the heterogeneous meal called high teaa class of refection welcome to all when away from men and towns and particularly attractive to youthful palates the table was prettily decked with winter flowers and leaves amid which the eye was greeted by chops chicken pie c and two huge pasties overhanging the sides of the dish with a cheerful aspect of abundance  at the end towards the fireplace appeared the teaservice of oldfashioned worcester porcelain and behind this arose the slight form of elfride attempting to add matronly dignity to the movement of pouring out tea and to have a weighty and concerned look in matters of marmalade honey and clotted cream having made her own meal before he arrived she found to her embarrassment that there was nothing left for her to do but talk when not assisting him she asked him if he would excuse her finishing a letter she had been writing at a sidetable and after sitting down to it tingled with a sense of being grossly rude however seeing that he noticed nothing personally wrong in her and that he too was embarrassed when she attentively watched his cup to refill it elfride became better at ease and when furthermore he accidentally kicked the leg of the table and then nearly upset his teacup just as schoolboys did she felt herself mistress of the situation and could talk very well in a few minutes ingenuousness and a common term of years obliterated all recollection that they were strangers just met stephen began to wax eloquent on extremely slight experiences connected with his professional pursuits and she having no experiences to fall back upon recounted with much animation stories that had been related to her by her father which would have astonished him had he heard with what fidelity of action and tone they were rendered upon the whole a very interesting picture of sweetandtwenty was on view that evening in mr swancourts house  ultimately stephen had to go upstairs and talk loud to the vicar receiving from him between his puffs a great many apologies for calling him so unceremoniously to a strangers bedroom but continued mr swancourt i felt that i wanted to say a few words to you before the morning on the business of your visit ones patience gets exhausted by staying a prisoner in bed all day through a sudden freak of ones enemynew to me thoughfor i have known very little of gout as yet however hes gone to my other toe in a very mild manner and i expect hell slink off altogether by the morning i hope you have been well attended to downstairs  perfectly and though it is unfortunate and i am sorry to see you laid up i beg you will not take the slightest notice of my being in the house the while  i will not but i shall be down tomorrow my daughter is an excellent doctor a dose or two of her mild mixtures will fetch me round quicker than all the drug stuff in the world well now about the church business take a seat do we cant afford to stand upon ceremony in these parts as you see and for this reason that a civilized human being seldom stays long with us and so we cannot waste time in approaching him or he will be gone before we have had the pleasure of close acquaintance this tower of ours is as you will notice entirely gone beyond the possibility of restoration but the church itself is well enough you should see some of the churches in this county floors rotten ivy lining the walls  dear me  oh thats nothing the congregation of a neighbour of mine whenever a storm of rain comes on during service open their umbrellas and hold them up till the dripping ceases from the roof now if you will kindly bring me those papers and letters you see lying on the table i will show you how far we have got  stephen crossed the room to fetch them and the vicar seemed to notice more particularly the slim figure of his visitor  i suppose you are quite competent he said  quite said the young man colouring slightly  you are very young i fancyi should say you are not more than nineteen  i am nearly twentyone  exactly half my age i am fortytwo  by the way said mr swancourt after some conversation you said your whole name was stephen fitzmaurice and that your grandfather came originally from caxbury since i have been speaking it has occurred to me that i know something of you you belong to a wellknown ancient county familynot ordinary smiths in the least  i dont think we have any of their blood in our veins  nonsense you must hand me the landed gentry now let me see there stephen fitzmaurice smithhe lies in st marys church doesnt he well out of that family sprang the leaseworthy smiths and collaterally came general sir stephen fitzmaurice smith of caxbury  yes i have seen his monument there shouted stephen but there is no connection between his family and mine there cannot be  there is none possibly to your knowledge but look at this my dear sir said the vicar striking his fist upon the bedpost for emphasis here are you stephen fitzmaurice smith living in london but springing from caxbury here in this book is a genealogical tree of the stephen fitzmaurice smiths of caxbury manor you may be only a family of professional men nowi am not inquisitive i dont ask questions of that kind it is not in me to do sobut it is as plain as the nose in your face that theres your origin and mr smith i congratulate you upon your blood blue blood sir and upon my life a very desirable colour as the world goes  i wish you could congratulate me upon some more tangible quality said the younger man sadly no less than modestly  nonsense that will come with time you are young all your life is before you now looksee how far back in the mists of antiquity my own family of swancourt have a root here you see he continued turning to the page is geoffrey the one among my ancestors who lost a barony because he would cut his joke ah its the sort of us but the story is too long to tell now ay im a poor mana poor gentleman in fact those i would be friends with wont be friends with me those who are willing to be friends with me i am above being friends with beyond dining with a neighbouring incumbent or two and an occasional chatsometimes dinnerwith lord luxellian a connection of mine i am in absolute solitudeabsolute  you have your studies your books and yourdaughter  oh yes yes and i dont complain of poverty canto coram latrone well mr smith dont let me detain you any longer in a sick room ha that reminds me of a story i once heard in my younger days here the vicar began a series of small private laughs and stephen looked inquiry oh no no it is too badtoo bad to tell continued mr swancourt in undertones of grim mirth well go downstairs my daughter must do the best she can with you this evening ask her to sing to youshe plays and sings very nicely goodnight i feel as if i had known you for five or six years ill ring for somebody to show you down  never mind said stephen i can find the way and he went downstairs thinking of the delightful freedom of manner in the remoter counties in comparison with the reserve of london   i forgot to tell you that my father was rather deaf said elfride anxiously when stephen entered the little drawingroom  never mind i know all about it and we are great friends the man of business replied enthusiastically and miss swancourt will you kindly sing to me  to miss swancourt this request seemed what in fact it was exceptionally pointblank though she guessed that her father had some hand in framing it knowing rather to her cost of his unceremonious way of utilizing her for the benefit of dull sojourners at the same time as mr smiths manner was too frank to provoke criticism and his age too little to inspire fear she was readynot to say pleasedto accede selecting from the canterbury some old family ditties that in years gone by had been played and sung by her mother elfride sat down to the pianoforte and began twas on the evening of a winters day in a pretty contralto voice  do you like that old thing mr smith she said at the end  yes i do much said stephenwords he would have uttered and sincerely to anything on earth from glee to requiem that she might have chosen  you shall have a little one by de leyre that was given me by a young french lady who was staying at endelstow house        je lai plante je lai vu naitre        ce beau rosier ou les oiseaux c   and then i shall want to give you my own favourite for the very last shelleys when the lamp is shattered as set to music by my poor mother i so much like singing to anybody who really cares to hear me  every woman who makes a permanent impression on a man is usually recalled to his minds eye as she appeared in one particular scene which seems ordained to be her special form of manifestation throughout the pages of his memory as the patron saint has her attitude and accessories in mediaeval illumination so the sweetheart may be said to have hers upon the table of her true loves fancy without which she is rarely introduced there except by effort and this though she may on further acquaintance have been observed in many other phases which one would imagine to be far more appropriate to loves young dream  miss elfrides image chose the form in which she was beheld during these minutes of singing for her permanent attitude of visitation to stephens eyes during his sleeping and waking hours in after days the profile is seen of a young woman in a pale gray silk dress with trimmings of swansdown and opening up from a point in front like a waistcoat without a shirt the cool colour contrasting admirably with the warm bloom of her neck and face the furthermost candle on the piano comes immediately in a line with her head and half invisible itself forms the accidentally frizzled hair into a nebulous haze of light surrounding her crown like an aureola her hands are in their place on the keys her lips parted and trilling forth in a tender diminuendo the closing words of the sad apostrophe     o love who bewailest      the frailty of all things here    why choose you the frailest      for your cradle your home and your bier   her head is forward a little and her eyes directed keenly upward to the top of the page of music confronting her then comes a rapid look into stephens face and a still more rapid look back again to her business her face having dropped its sadness and acquired a certain expression of mischievous archness the while which lingered there for some time but was never developed into a positive smile of flirtation  stephen suddenly shifted his position from her right hand to her left where there was just room enough for a small ottoman to stand between the piano and the corner of the room into this nook he squeezed himself and gazed wistfully up into elfrides face so long and so earnestly gazed he that her cheek deepened to a more and more crimson tint as each line was added to her song concluding and pausing motionless after the last word for a minute or two she ventured to look at him again his features wore an expression of unutterable heaviness  you dont hear many songs do you mr smith to take so much notice of these of mine  perhaps it was the means and vehicle of the song that i was noticing i mean yourself he answered gently  now mr smith  it is perfectly true i dont hear much singing you mistake what i am i fancy because i come as a stranger to a secluded spot you think i must needs come from a life of bustle and know the latest movements of the day but i dont my life is as quiet as yours and more solitary solitary as death  the death which comes from a plethora of life but seriously i can quite see that you are not the least what i thought you would be before i saw you you are not critical or experienced ormuch to mind thats why i dont mind singing airs to you that i only half know finding that by this confession she had vexed him in a way she did not intend she added naively i mean mr smith that you are better not worse for being only young and not very experienced you dont think my life here so very tame and dull i know  i do not indeed he said with fervour it must be delightfully poetical and sparkling and fresh and  there you go mr smith well men of another kind when i get them to be honest enough to own the truth think just the reverse that my life must be a dreadful bore in its normal state though pleasant for the exceptional few days they pass here  i could live here always he said and with such a tone and look of unconscious revelation that elfride was startled to find that her harmonies had fired a small troy in the shape of stephens heart she said quickly  but you cant live here always  oh no and he drew himself in with the sensitiveness of a snail  elfrides emotions were sudden as his in kindling but the least of womans lesser infirmitieslove of admirationcaused an inflammable disposition on his part so exactly similar to her own to appear as meritorious in him as modesty made her own seem culpable in her     chapter iv       where heaves the turf in many a mouldring heap   for reasons of his own stephen smith was stirring a short time after dawn the next morning from the window of his room he could see first two bold escarpments sloping down together like the letter v towards the bottom like liquid in a funnel appeared the sea gray and small on the brow of one hill of rather greater altitude than its neighbour stood the church which was to be the scene of his operations the lonely edifice was black and bare cutting up into the sky from the very tip of the hill it had a square mouldering tower owning neither battlement nor pinnacle and seemed a monolithic termination of one substance with the ridge rather than a structure raised thereon round the church ran a low wall overtopping the wall in general level was the graveyard not as a graveyard usually is a fragment of landscape with its due variety of chiarooscuro but a mere profile against the sky serrated with the outlines of graves and a very few memorial stones not a tree could exist up there nothing but the monotonous graygreen grass  five minutes after this casual survey was made his bedroom was empty and its occupant had vanished quietly from the house  at the end of two hours he was again in the room looking warm and glowing he now pursued the artistic details of dressing which on his first rising had been entirely omitted and a very blooming boy he looked after that mysterious morning scamper his mouth was a triumph of its class it was the cleanlycut piquantly pursedup mouth of william pitt as represented in the well or little known bust by nollekensa mouth which is in itself a young mans fortune if properly exercised his round chin where its upper part turned inward still continued its perfect and full curve seeming to press in to a point the bottom of his nether lip at their place of junction  once he murmured the name of elfride ah there she was on the lawn in a plain dress without hat or bonnet running with a boys velocity superadded to a girls lightness after a tame rabbit she was endeavouring to capture her strategic intonations of coaxing words alternating with desperate rushes so much out of keeping with them that the hollowness of such expressions was but too evident to her pet who darted and dodged in carefully timed counterpart  the scene down there was altogether different from that of the hills a thicket of shrubs and trees enclosed the favoured spot from the wilderness without even at this time of the year the grass was luxuriant there no wind blew inside the protecting belt of evergreens wasting its force upon the higher and stronger trees forming the outer margin of the grove  then he heard a heavy person shuffling about in slippers and calling mr smith smith proceeded to the study and found mr swancourt the young man expressed his gladness to see his host downstairs  oh yes i knew i should soon be right again i have not made the acquaintance of gout for more than two years and it generally goes off the second night well where have you been this morning i saw you come in just now i think  yes i have been for a walk  start early  yes  very early i think  yes it was rather early  which way did you go to the sea i suppose everybody goes seaward  no i followed up the river as far as the park wall  you are different from your kind well i suppose such a wild place is a novelty and so tempted you out of bed  not altogether a novelty i like it  the youth seemed averse to explanation  you must you must to go cockwatching the morning after a journey of fourteen or sixteen hours but theres no accounting for tastes and i am glad to see that yours are no meaner after breakfast but not before i shall be good for a ten miles walk master smith  certainly there seemed nothing exaggerated in that assertion mr swancourt by daylight showed himself to be a man who in common with the other two people under his roof had really strong claims to be considered handsomehandsome that is in the sense in which the moon is bright the ravines and valleys which on a close inspection are seen to diversify its surface being left out of the argument his face was of a tint that never deepened upon his cheeks nor lightened upon his forehead but remained uniform throughout the usual neutral salmoncolour of a man who feeds wellnot to say too welland does not think hard every pore being in visible working order his tout ensemble was that of a highly improved class of farmer dressed up in the wrong clothes that of a firmstanding perpendicular man whose fall would have been backwards in direction if he had ever lost his balance  the vicars background was at present what a vicars background should be his study here the consistency ends all along the chimneypiece were ranged bottles of horse pig and cow medicines and against the wall was a high table made up of the fragments of an old oak iychgate upon this stood stuffed specimens of owls divers and gulls and over them bunches of wheat and barley ears labelled with the date of the year that produced them some cases and shelves more or less laden with books the prominent titles of which were dr browns notes on the romans dr smiths notes on the corinthians and dr robinsons notes on the galatians ephesians and philippians just saved the character of the place in spite of a girls dollshouse standing above them a marine aquarium in the window and elfrides hat hanging on its corner  business business said mr swancourt after breakfast he began to find it necessary to act the part of a flywheel towards the somewhat irregular forces of his visitor  they prepared to go to the church the vicar on second thoughts mounting his coalblack mare to avoid exerting his foot too much at starting stephen said he should want a man to assist him worm the vicar shouted  a minute or two after a voice was heard round the corner of the building mumbling ah i used to be strong enough but tis altered now well there im as independent as one here and there even if they do write squire after their names  whats the matter said the vicar as william worm appeared when the remarks were repeated to him  worm says some very true things sometimes mr swancourt said turning to stephen now as regards that word esquire why mr smith that word esquire is gone to the dogsused on the letters of every jackanapes who has a black coat anything else worm  ay the folk have begun frying again  dear me im sorry to hear that  yes worm said groaningly to stephen ive got such a noise in my head that theres no living night nor day tis just for all the world like people frying fish fry fry fry all day long in my poor head till i dont know wher im here or yonder there god amighty will find it out sooner or later i hope and relieve me  now my deafness said mr swancourt impressively is a dead silence but william worms is that of people frying fish in his head very remarkable isnt it  i can hear the fryingpan afizzing as naterel as life said worm corroboratively  yes it is remarkable said mr smith  very peculiar very peculiar echoed the vicar and they all then followed the path up the hill bounded on each side by a little stone wall from which gleamed fragments of quartz and bloodred marbles apparently of inestimable value in their setting of brown alluvium stephen walked with the dignity of a man close to the horses head worm stumbled along a stones throw in the rear and elfride was nowhere in particular yet everywhere sometimes in front sometimes behind sometimes at the sides hovering about the procession like a butterfly not definitely engaged in travelling yet somehow chiming in at points with the general progress  the vicar explained things as he went on the fact is mr smith i didnt want this bother of church restoration at all but it was necessary to do something in selfdefence on account of those ddissenters i use the word in its scriptural meaning of course not as an expletive  how very odd said stephen with the concern demanded of serious friendliness  odd thats nothing to how it is in the parish of twinkley both the churchwardens are there i wont say what they are and the clerk and the sexton as well  how very strange said stephen  strange my dear sir thats nothing to how it is in the parish of sinnerton however as to our own parish i hope we shall make some progress soon  you must trust to circumstances  there are no circumstances to trust to we may as well trust in providence if we trust at all but here we are a wild place isnt it but i like it on such days as these  the churchyard was entered on this side by a stone stile over which having clambered you remained still on the wild hill the within not being so divided from the without as to obliterate the sense of open freedom a delightful place to be buried in postulating that delight can accompany a man to his tomb under any circumstances there was nothing horrible in this churchyard in the shape of tight mounds bonded with sticks which shout imprisonment in the ears rather than whisper rest or trim gardenflowers which only raise images of people in new black crape and white handkerchiefs coming to tend them or wheelmarks which remind us of hearses and mourning coaches or cypressbushes which make a parade of sorrow or coffinboards and bones lying behind trees showing that we are only leaseholders of our graves no nothing but long wild untutored grass diversifying the forms of the mounds it coveredthemselves irregularly shaped with no eye to effect the impressive presence of the old mountain that all this was a part of being nowhere excluded by disguising art outside were similar slopes and similar grass and then the serene impassive sea visible to a width of half the horizon and meeting the eye with the effect of a vast concave like the interior of a blue vessel detached rocks stood upright afar a collar of foam girding their bases and repeating in its whiteness the plumage of a countless multitude of gulls that restlessly hovered about  now worm said mr swancourt sharply and worm started into an attitude of attention at once to receive orders stephen and himself were then left in possession and the work went on till early in the afternoon when dinner was announced by unity of the vicarage kitchen running up the hill without a bonnet   elfride did not make her appearance inside the building till late in the afternoon and came then by special invitation from stephen during dinner she looked so intensely living and full of movement as she came into the old silent place that young smiths world began to be lit by the purple light in all its definiteness worm was got rid of by sending him to measure the height of the tower  what could she do but come closeso close that a minute arc of her skirt touched his footand asked him how he was getting on with his sketches and set herself to learn the principles of practical mensuration as applied to irregular buildings then she must ascend the pulpit to reimagine for the hundredth time how it would seem to be a preacher  presently she leant over the front of the pulpit  dont you tell papa will you mr smith if i tell you something she said with a sudden impulse to make a confidence  oh no that i wont said he staring up  well i write papas sermons for him very often and he preaches them better than he does his own and then afterwards he talks to people and to me about what he said in his sermon today and forgets that i wrote it for him isnt it absurd  how clever you must be said stephen i couldnt write a sermon for the world  oh its easy enough she said descending from the pulpit and coming close to him to explain more vividly you do it like this did you ever play a game of forfeits called when is it where is it what is it  no never  ah thats a pity because writing a sermon is very much like playing that game you take the text you think why is it what is it and so on you put that down under generally then you proceed to the first secondly and thirdly papa wont have fourthlyssays they are all my eye then you have a final collectively several pages of this being put in great black brackets writing opposite leave this out if the farmers are falling asleep then comes your in conclusion then a few words and i have done well all this time you have put on the back of each page keep your voice downi mean she added correcting herself thats how i do in papas sermonbook because otherwise he gets louder and louder till at last he shouts like a farmer up afield oh papa is so funny in some things  then after this childish burst of confidence she was frightened as if warned by womanly instinct which for the moment her ardour had outrun that she had been too forward to a comparative stranger  elfride saw her father then and went away into the wind being caught by a gust as she ascended the churchyard slope in which gust she had the motions without the motives of a hoiden the grace without the selfconsciousness of a pirouetter she conversed for a minute or two with her father and proceeded homeward mr swancourt coming on to the church to stephen the wind had freshened his warm complexion as it freshens the glow of a brand he was in a mood of jollity and watched elfride down the hill with a smile  you little flyaway you look wild enough now he said and turned to stephen but shes not a wild child at all mr smith as steady as you and that you are steady i see from your diligence here  i think miss swancourt very clever stephen observed  yes she is certainly she is said papa turning his voice as much as possible to the neutral tone of disinterested criticism now smith ill tell you something but she mustnt know it for the worldnot for the world mind for she insists upon keeping it a dead secret why she writes my sermons for me often and a very good job she makes of them  she can do anything  she can do that the little rascal has the very trick of the trade but mind you smith not a word about it to her not a single word  not a word said smith  look there said mr swancourt what do you think of my roofing he pointed with his walkingstick at the chancel roof  did you do that sir  yes i worked in shirtsleeves all the time that was going on i pulled down the old rafters fixed the new ones put on the battens slated the roof all with my own hands worm being my assistant we worked like slaves didnt we worm  ay sure we did harder than some here and therehee hee said william worm cropping up from somewhere like slaves a blievehee hee and werent ye foaming mad sir when the nails wouldnt go straight mighty i there tisnt so bad to cuss and keep it in as to cuss and let it out is it sir  wellwhy  because you sir when ye were aputting on the roof only used to cuss in your mind which is i suppose no harm at all  i dont think you know what goes on in my mind worm  oh doant i sirhee hee maybe im but a poor wambling thing sir and cant read much but i can spell as well as some here and there doant ye mind sir that blustrous night when ye asked me to hold the candle to ye in yer workshop when you were making a new chair for the chancel  yes what of that  i stood with the candle and you said you liked company if twas only a dog or catmaning me and the chair wouldnt do nohow  ah i remember  no the chair wouldnt do nohow a was very well to look at but lord  worm how often have i corrected you for irreverent speaking  a was very well to look at but you couldnt sit in the chair nohow twas all atwist wi the chair like the letter z directly you sat down upon the chair get up worm says you when you seed the chair go all asway wi me up you took the chair and flung en like fire and brimstone to tother end of your shopall in a passion damn the chair says i just what i was thinking says you sir i could see it in your face sir says i and i hope you and god will forgie me for saying what you wouldnt to save your life you couldnt help laughing sir at a poor wambler reading your thoughts so plain ay im as wise as one here and there  i thought you had better have a practical man to go over the church and tower with you mr swancourt said to stephen the following morning so i got lord luxellians permission to send for a man when you came i told him to be there at ten oclock hes a very intelligent man and he will tell you all you want to know about the state of the walls his name is john smith  elfride did not like to be seen again at the church with stephen i will watch here for your appearance at the top of the tower she said laughingly i shall see your figure against the sky  and when i am up there ill wave my handkerchief to you miss swancourt said stephen in twelve minutes from this present moment he added looking at his watch ill be at the summit and look out for you  she went round to the corner of the shrubbery whence she could watch him down the slope leading to the foot of the hill on which the church stood there she saw waiting for him a white spota mason in his working clothes stephen met this man and stopped  to her surprise instead of their moving on to the churchyard they both leisurely sat down upon a stone close by their meetingplace and remained as if in deep conversation elfride looked at the time nine of the twelve minutes had passed and stephen showed no signs of moving more minutes passedshe grew cold with waiting and shivered it was not till the end of a quarter of an hour that they began to slowly wend up the hill at a snails pace  rude and unmannerly she said to herself colouring with pique anybody would think he was in love with that horrid mason instead of with  the sentence remained unspoken though not unthought  she returned to the porch  is the man you sent for a lazy sitstill donothing kind of man she inquired of her father  no he said surprised quite the reverse he is lord luxellians mastermason john smith  oh said elfride indifferently and returned towards her bleak station and waited and shivered again it was a trifle after alla childish thinglooking out from a tower and waving a handkerchief but her new friend had promised and why should he tease her so the effect of a blow is as proportionate to the texture of the object struck as to its own momentum and she had such a superlative capacity for being wounded that little hits struck her hard  it was not till the end of half an hour that two figures were seen above the parapet of the dreary old pile motionless as bitterns on a ruined mosque even then stephen was not true enough to perform what he was so courteous to promise and he vanished without making a sign  he returned at midday elfride looked vexed when unconscious that his eyes were upon her when conscious severe however her attitude of coldness had long outlived the coldness itself and she could no longer utter feigned words of indifference  ah you werent kind to keep me waiting in the cold and break your promise she said at last reproachfully in tones too low for her fathers powers of hearing  forgive forgive me said stephen with dismay i had forgottenquite forgotten something prevented my remembering  any further explanation said miss capricious pouting  he was silent for a few minutes and looked askance  none he said with the accent of one who concealed a sin     chapter v       bosomd high in tufted trees   it was breakfast time  as seen from the vicarage diningroom which took a warm tone of light from the fire the weather and scene outside seemed to have stereotyped themselves in unrelieved shades of gray the longarmed trees and shrubs of juniper cedar and pine varieties were grayish black those of the broadleaved sort together with the herbage were grayishgreen the eternal hills and tower behind them were grayishbrown the sky dropping behind all gray of the purest melancholy  yet in spite of this sombre artistic effect the morning was not one which tended to lower the spirits it was even cheering for it did not rain nor was rain likely to fall for many days to come  elfride had turned from the table towards the fire and was idly elevating a handscreen before her face when she heard the click of a little gate outside  ah heres the postman she said as a shuffling active man came through an opening in the shrubbery and across the lawn she vanished and met him in the porch afterwards coming in with her hands behind her back  how many are there three for papa one for mr smith none for miss swancourt and papa look here one of yours is fromwhom do you thinklord luxellian and it has something hard in ita lump of something ive been feeling it through the envelope and cant think what it is  what does luxellian write for i wonder mr swancourt had said simultaneously with her words he handed stephen his letter and took his own putting on his countenance a higher class of look than was customary as became a poor gentleman who was going to read a letter from a peer  stephen read his missive with a countenance quite the reverse of the vicars                    percy place thursday evening dear smithold h is in a towering rage with you for being so long about the church sketches swears you are more trouble than you are worth he says i am to write and say you are to stay no longer on any considerationthat he would have done it all in three hours very easily i told him that you were not like an experienced hand which he seemed to forget but it did not make much difference however between you and me privately if i were you i would not alarm myself for a day or so if i were not inclined to return i would make out the week and finish my spree he will blow up just as much if you appear here on saturday as if you keep away till monday morningyours very truly  simpkins jenkins    dear mevery awkward said stephen rather en lair and confused with the kind of confusion that assails an understrapper when he has been enlarged by accident to the dimensions of a superior and is somewhat rudely pared down to his original size  what is awkward said miss swancourt  smith by this time recovered his equanimity and with it the professional dignity of an experienced architect  important business demands my immediate presence in london i regret to say he replied  what must you go at once said mr swancourt looking over the edge of his letter important business a young fellow like you to have important business  the truth is said stephen blushing and rather ashamed of having pretended even so slightly to a consequence which did not belong to himthe truth is mr hewby has sent to say i am to come home and i must obey him  i see i see it is politic to do so you mean now i can see more than you think you are to be his partner i booked you for that directly i read his letter to me the other day and the way he spoke of you he thinks a great deal of you mr smith or he wouldnt be so anxious for your return  unpleasant to stephen such remarks as these could not sound to have the expectancy of partnership with one of the largestpractising architects in london thrust upon him was cheering however untenable he felt the idea to be he saw that whatever mr hewby might think mr swancourt certainly thought much of him to entertain such an idea on such slender ground as to be absolutely no ground at all and then unaccountably his speaking face exhibited a cloud of sadness which a reflection on the remoteness of any such contingency could hardly have sufficed to cause  elfride was struck with that look of his even mr swancourt noticed it  well he said cheerfully never mind that now you must come again on your own account not on business come to see me as a visitor you knowsay in your holidaysall you town men have holidays like schoolboys when are they  in august i believe  very well come in august and then you need not hurry away so i am glad to get somebody decent to talk to or at in this outlandish ultima thule but by the bye i have something to sayyou wont go today  no i need not said stephen hesitatingly i am not obliged to get back before monday morning  very well then that brings me to what i am going to propose this is a letter from lord luxellian i think you heard me speak of him as the resident landowner in this district and patron of this living  iknow of him  he is in london now it seems that he has run up on business for a day or two and taken lady luxellian with him he has written to ask me to go to his house and search for a paper among his private memoranda which he forgot to take with him  what did he send in the letter inquired elfride  the key of a private desk in which the papers are he doesnt like to trust such a matter to any body else i have done such things for him before and what i propose is that we make an afternoon of itall three of us go for a drive to targan bay come home by way of endelstow house and whilst i am looking over the documents you can ramble about the rooms where you like i have the run of the house at any time you know the building though nothing but a mass of gables outside has a splendid hall staircase and gallery within and there are a few good pictures  yes there are said stephen  have you seen the place then  i saw it as i came by he said hastily  oh yes but i was alluding to the interior and the churchst evalsis much older than our st agnes here i do duty in that and this alternately you know the fact is i ought to have some help riding across that park for two miles on a wet morning is not at all the thing if my constitution were not well seasoned as thank god it ishere mr swancourt looked down his front as if his constitution were visible therei should be coughing and barking all the year round and when the family goes away there are only about three servants to preach to when i get there well that shall be the arrangement then elfride you will like to go  elfride assented and the little breakfastparty separated stephen rose to go and take a few final measurements at the church the vicar following him to the door with a mysterious expression of inquiry on his face  youll put up with our not having family prayer this morning i hope he whispered  yes quite so said stephen  to tell you the truth he continued in the same undertone we dont make a regular thing of it but when we have strangers visiting us i am strongly of opinion that it is the proper thing to do and i always do it i am very strict on that point but you smith there is something in your face which makes me feel quite at home no nonsense about you in short ah it reminds me of a splendid story i used to hear when i was a helterskelter young fellowsuch a story buthere the vicar shook his head selfforbiddingly and grimly laughed  was it a good story said young smith smiling too  oh yes but tis too badtoo bad couldnt tell it to you for the world  stephen went across the lawn hearing the vicar chuckling privately at the recollection as he withdrew   they started at three oclock the gray morning had resolved itself into an afternoon bright with a pale pervasive sunlight without the sun itself being visible lightly they trotted alongthe wheels nearly silent the horses hoofs clapping almost ringing upon the hard white turnpike road as it followed the level ridge in a perfectly straight line seeming to be absorbed ultimately by the white of the sky  targan baywhich had the merit of being easily got atwas duly visited they then swept round by innumerable lanes in which not twenty consecutive yards were either straight or level to the domain of lord luxellian a woman with a double chin and thick neck like queen anne by dahl threw open the lodge gate a little boy standing behind her  ill give him something poor little fellow said elfride pulling out her purse and hastily opening it from the interior of her purse a host of bits of paper like a flock of white birds floated into the air and were blown about in all directions  well to be sure said stephen with a slight laugh  what the dickens is all that said mr swancourt not halves of banknotes elfride  elfride looked annoyed and guilty they are only something of mine papa she faltered whilst stephen leapt out and assisted by the lodgekeepers little boy crept about round the wheels and horses hoofs till the papers were all gathered together again he handed them back to her and remounted  i suppose you are wondering what those scraps were she said as they bowled along up the sycamore avenue and so i may as well tell you they are notes for a romance i am writing  she could not help colouring at the confession much as she tried to avoid it  a story do you mean said stephen mr swancourt half listening and catching a word of the conversation now and then  yes the court of kellyon castle a romance of the fifteenth century such writing is out of date now i know but i like doing it  a romance carried in a purse if a highwayman were to rob you he would be taken in  yes thats my way of carrying manuscript the real reason is that i mostly write bits of it on scraps of paper when i am on horseback and i put them there for convenience  what are you going to do with your romance when you have written it said stephen  i dont know she replied and turned her head to look at the prospect  for by this time they had reached the precincts of endelstow house driving through an ancient gateway of duncoloured stone spanned by the highshouldered tudor arch they found themselves in a spacious court closed by a facade on each of its three sides the substantial portions of the existing building dated from the reign of henry viii but the picturesque and sheltered spot had been the site of an erection of a much earlier date a licence to crenellate mansum infra manerium suum was granted by edward ii to hugo luxellen chivaler but though the faint outline of the ditch and mound was visible at points no sign of the original building remained  the windows on all sides were long and manymullioned the roof lines broken up by dormer lights of the same pattern the apex stones of these dormers together with those of the gables were surmounted by grotesque figures in rampant passant and couchant variety tall octagonal and twisted chimneys thrust themselves high up into the sky surpassed in height however by some poplars and sycamores at the back which showed their gently rocking summits over ridge and parapet in the corners of the court polygonal bays whose surfaces were entirely occupied by buttresses and windows broke into the squareness of the enclosure and a farprojecting oriel springing from a fantastic series of mouldings overhung the archway of the chief entrance to the house  as mr swancourt had remarked he had the freedom of the mansion in the absence of its owner upon a statement of his errand they were all admitted to the library and left entirely to themselves mr swancourt was soon up to his eyes in the examination of a heap of papers he had taken from the cabinet described by his correspondent stephen and elfride had nothing to do but to wander about till her father was ready  elfride entered the gallery and stephen followed her without seeming to do so it was a long sombre apartment enriched with fittings a century or so later in style than the walls of the mansion pilasters of renaissance workmanship supported a cornice from which sprang a curved ceiling panelled in the awkward twists and curls of the period the old gothic quarries still remained in the upper portion of the large window at the end though they had made way for a more modern form of glazing elsewhere  stephen was at one end of the gallery looking towards elfride who stood in the midst beginning to feel somewhat depressed by the society of luxellian shades of cadaverous complexion fixed by holbein kneller and lely and seeming to gaze at and through her in a moralizing mood the silence which cast almost a spell upon them was broken by the sudden opening of a door at the far end  out bounded a pair of little girls lightly yet warmly dressed their eyes were sparkling their hair swinging about and around their red mouths laughing with unalloyed gladness  ah miss swancourt dearest elfie we heard you are you going to stay here you are our little mamma are you notour big mamma is gone to london said one  let me tiss you said the other in appearance very much like the first but to a smaller pattern  their pink cheeks and yellow hair were speedily intermingled with the folds of elfrides dress she then stooped and tenderly embraced them both  such an odd thing said elfride smiling and turning to stephen they have taken it into their heads lately to call me little mamma because i am very fond of them and wore a dress the other day something like one of lady luxellians  these two young creatures were the honourable mary and the honourable katescarcely appearing large enough as yet to bear the weight of such ponderous prefixes they were the only two children of lord and lady luxellian and as it proved had been left at home during their parents temporary absence in the custody of nurse and governess lord luxellian was dotingly fond of the children rather indifferent towards his wife since she had begun to show an inclination not to please him by giving him a boy  all children instinctively ran after elfride looking upon her more as an unusually nice large specimen of their own tribe than as a grownup elder it had now become an established rule that whenever she met themindoors or outofdoors weekdays or sundaysthey were to be severally pressed against her face and bosom for the space of a quarter of a minute and otherwise made much of on the delightful system of cumulative epithet and caress to which unpractised girls will occasionally abandon themselves  a look of misgiving by the youngsters towards the door by which they had entered directed attention to a maidservant appearing from the same quarter to put an end to this sweet freedom of the poor honourables mary and kate  i wish you lived here miss swancourt piped one like a melancholy bullfinch  so do i piped the other like a rather more melancholy bullfinch mamma cant play with us so nicely as you do i dont think she ever learnt playing when she was little when shall we come to see you  as soon as you like dears  and sleep at your house all night thats what i mean by coming to see you i dont care to see people with hats and bonnets on and all standing up and walking about  as soon as we can get mammas permission you shall come and stay as long as ever you like goodbye  the prisoners were then led off elfride again turning her attention to her guest whom she had left standing at the remote end of the gallery on looking around for him he was nowhere to be seen elfride stepped down to the library thinking he might have rejoined her father there but mr swancourt now cheerfully illuminated by a pair of candles was still alone untying packets of letters and papers and tying them up again  as elfride did not stand on a sufficiently intimate footing with the object of her interest to justify her as a proper young lady to commence the active search for him that youthful impulsiveness prompted and as nevertheless for a nascent reason connected with those divinely cut lips of his she did not like him to be absent from her side she wandered desultorily back to the oak staircase pouting and casting her eyes about in hope of discerning his boyish figure  though daylight still prevailed in the rooms the corridors were in a depth of shadowchill sad and silent and it was only by looking along them towards light spaces beyond that anything or anybody could be discerned therein one of these light spots she found to be caused by a sidedoor with glass panels in the upper part elfride opened it and found herself confronting a secondary or inner lawn separated from the principal lawn front by a shrubbery  and now she saw a perplexing sight at right angles to the face of the wing she had emerged from and within a few feet of the door jutted out another wing of the mansion lower and with less architectural character immediately opposite to her in the wall of this wing was a large broad window having its blind drawn down and illuminated by a light in the room it screened  on the blind was a shadow from somebody close inside ita person in profile the profile was unmistakably that of stephen it was just possible to see that his arms were uplifted and that his hands held an article of some kind then another shadow appearedalso in profileand came close to him this was the shadow of a woman she turned her back towards stephen he lifted and held out what now proved to be a shawl or mantleplaced it carefullyso carefullyround the lady disappeared reappeared in her frontfastened the mantle did he then kiss her surely not yet the motion might have been a kiss then both shadows swelled to colossal dimensionsgrew distortedvanished  two minutes elapsed  ah miss swancourt i am so glad to find you i was looking for you said a voice at her elbowstephens voice she stepped into the passage  do you know any of the members of this establishment said she  not a single one how should i he replied     chapter vi       fare thee weel awhile   simultaneously with the conclusion of stephens remark the sound of the closing of an external door in their immediate neighbourhood reached elfrides ears it came from the further side of the wing containing the illuminated room she then discerned by the aid of the dusky departing light a figure whose sex was undistinguishable walking down the gravelled path by the parterre towards the river the figure grew fainter and vanished under the trees  mr swancourts voice was heard calling out their names from a distant corridor in the body of the building they retraced their steps and found him with his coat buttoned up and his hat on awaiting their advent in a mood of selfsatisfaction at having brought his search to a successful close the carriage was brought round and without further delay the trio drove away from the mansion under the echoing gateway arch and along by the leafless sycamores as the stars began to kindle their trembling lights behind the maze of branches and twigs  no words were spoken either by youth or maiden her unpractised mind was completely occupied in fathoming its recent acquisition the young man who had inspired her with such novelty of feeling who had come directly from london on business to her father having been brought by chance to endelstow house had by some means or other acquired the privilege of approaching some lady he had found therein and of honouring her by petits soins of a marked kindall in the space of half an hour  what room were they standing in thought elfride as nearly as she could guess it was lord luxellians businessroom or office what people were in the house none but the governess and servants as far as she knew and of these he had professed a total ignorance had the person she had indistinctly seen leaving the house anything to do with the performance it was impossible to say without appealing to the culprit himself and that she would never do the more elfride reflected the more certain did it appear that the meeting was a chance rencounter and not an appointment on the ultimate inquiry as to the individuality of the woman elfride at once assumed that she could not be an inferior stephen smith was not the man to care about passagesatlove with women beneath him though gentle ambition was visible in his kindling eyes he evidently hoped for much hoped indefinitely but extensively elfride was puzzled and being puzzled was by a natural sequence of girlish sensations vexed with him no more pleasure came in recognizing that from liking to attract him she was getting on to love him boyish as he was and innocent as he had seemed  they reached the bridge which formed a link between the eastern and western halves of the parish situated in a valley that was bounded outwardly by the sea it formed a point of depression from which the road ascended with great steepness to west endelstow and the vicarage there was no absolute necessity for either of them to alight but as it was the vicars custom after a long journey to humour the horse in making this winding ascent elfride moved by an imitative instinct suddenly jumped out when pleasant had just begun to adopt the deliberate stalk he associated with this portion of the road  the young man seemed glad of any excuse for breaking the silence why miss swancourt what a risky thing to do he exclaimed immediately following her example by jumping down on the other side  oh no not at all replied she coldly the shadow phenomenon at endelstow house still paramount within her  stephen walked along by himself for two or three minutes wrapped in the rigid reserve dictated by her tone then apparently thinking that it was only for girls to pout he came serenely round to her side and offered his arm with castilian gallantry to assist her in ascending the remaining threequarters of the steep  here was a temptation it was the first time in her life that elfride had been treated as a grownup woman in this wayoffered an arm in a manner implying that she had a right to refuse it till tonight she had never received masculine attentions beyond those which might be contained in such homely remarks as elfride give me your hand elfride take hold of my arm from her father her callow heart made an epoch of the incident she considered her array of feelings for and against collectively they were for taking this offered arm the single one of pique determined her to punish stephen by refusing  no thank you mr smith i can get along better by myself  it was elfrides first fragile attempt at browbeating a lover fearing more the issue of such an undertaking than what a gentle young man might think of her waywardness she immediately afterwards determined to please herself by reversing her statement  on second thoughts i will take it she said  they slowly went their way up the hill a few yards behind the carriage  how silent you are miss swancourt stephen observed  perhaps i think you silent too she returned  i may have reason to be  scarcely it is sadness that makes people silent and you can have none  you dont know i have a trouble though some might think it less a trouble than a dilemma  what is it she asked impulsively  stephen hesitated i might tell he said at the same time perhaps it is as well  she let go his arm and imperatively pushed it from her tossing her head she had just learnt that a good deal of dignity is lost by asking a question to which an answer is refused even ever so politely for though politeness does good service in cases of requisition and compromise it but little helps a direct refusal i dont wish to know anything of it i dont wish it she went on the carriage is waiting for us at the top of the hill we must get in and elfride flitted to the front papa here is your elfride she exclaimed to the dusky figure of the old gentleman as she sprang up and sank by his side without deigning to accept aid from stephen  ah yes uttered the vicar in artificially alert tones awaking from a most profound sleep and suddenly preparing to alight  why what are you doing papa we are not home yet  oh no no of course not we are not at home yet mr swancourt said very hastily endeavouring to dodge back to his original position with the air of a man who had not moved at all the fact is i was so lost in deep meditation that i forgot whereabouts we were and in a minute the vicar was snoring again   that evening being the last seemed to throw an exceptional shade of sadness over stephen smith and the repeated injunctions of the vicar that he was to come and revisit them in the summer apparently tended less to raise his spirits than to unearth some misgiving  he left them in the gray light of dawn whilst the colours of earth were sombre and the sun was yet hidden in the east elfride had fidgeted all night in her little bed lest none of the household should be awake soon enough to start him and also lest she might miss seeing again the bright eyes and curly hair to which their owners possession of a hidden mystery added a deeper tinge of romance to some extentso soon does womanly interest take a solicitous turnshe felt herself responsible for his safe conduct they breakfasted before daylight mr swancourt being more and more taken with his guests ingenuous appearance having determined to rise early and bid him a friendly farewell it was however rather to the vicars astonishment that he saw elfride walk in to the breakfasttable candle in hand  whilst william worm performed his toilet during which performance the inmates of the vicarage were always in the habit of waiting with exemplary patience elfride wandered desultorily to the summer house stephen followed her thither the copsecovered valley was visible from this position a mist now lying all along its length hiding the stream which trickled through it though the observers themselves were in clear air  they stood close together leaning over the rustic balustrading which bounded the arbour on the outward side and formed the crest of a steep slope beneath elfride constrainedly pointed out some features of the distant uplands rising irregularly opposite but the artistic eye was either from nature or circumstance very faint in stephen now and he only half attended to her description as if he spared time from some other thought going on within him  well goodbye he said suddenly i must never see you again i suppose miss swancourt in spite of invitations  his genuine tribulation played directly upon the delicate chords of her nature she could afford to forgive him for a concealment or two moreover the shyness which would not allow him to look her in the face lent bravery to her own eyes and tongue  oh do come again mr smith she said prettily  i should delight in it but it will be better if i do not  why  certain circumstances in connection with me make it undesirable not on my account on yours  goodness as if anything in connection with you could hurt me she said with serene supremacy but seeing that this plan of treatment was inappropriate she tuned a smaller note ah i know why you will not come you dont want to youll go home to london and to all the stirring people there and will never want to see us any more  you know i have no such reason  and go on writing letters to the lady you are engaged to just as before  what does that mean i am not engaged  you wrote a letter to a miss somebody i saw it in the letterrack  pooh an elderly woman who keeps a stationers shop and it was to tell her to keep my newspapers till i get back  you neednt have explained it was not my business at all miss elfride was rather relieved to hear that statement nevertheless and you wont come again to see my father she insisted  i should like toand to see you again but  will you reveal to me that matter you hide she interrupted petulantly  no not now  she could not but go on graceless as it might seem  tell me this she importuned with a trembling mouth does any meeting of yours with a lady at endelstow vicarage clash withany interest you may take in me  he started a little it does not he said emphatically and looked into the pupils of her eyes with the confidence that only honesty can give and even that to youth alone  the explanation had not come but a gloom left her she could not but believe that utterance whatever enigma might lie in the shadow on the blind it was not an enigma of underhand passion  she turned towards the house entering it through the conservatory stephen went round to the front door mr swancourt was standing on the step in his slippers worm was adjusting a buckle in the harness and murmuring about his poor head and everything was ready for stephens departure  you named august for your visit august it shall be that is if you care for the society of such a fossilized tory said mr swancourt  mr smith only responded hesitatingly that he should like to come again  you said you would and you must insisted elfride coming to the door and speaking under her fathers arm  whatever reason the youth may have had for not wishing to enter the house as a guest it no longer predominated he promised and bade them adieu and got into the ponycarriage which crept up the slope and bore him out of their sight  i never was so much taken with anybody in my life as i am with that young fellownever i cannot understand itcant understand it anyhow said mr swancourt quite energetically to himself and went indoors     chapter vii       no more of me you knew my love   stephen smith revisited endelstow vicarage agreeably to his promise he had a genuine artistic reason for coming though no such reason seemed to be required sixandthirty old seat ends of exquisite fifteenthcentury workmanship were rapidly decaying in an aisle of the church and it became politic to make drawings of their wormeaten contours ere they were battered past recognition in the turmoil of the socalled restoration  he entered the house at sunset and the world was pleasant again to the two fairhaired ones a momentary pang of disappointment had nevertheless passed through elfride when she casually discovered that he had not come that minute posthaste from london but had reached the neighbourhood the previous evening surprise would have accompanied the feeling had she not remembered that several tourists were haunting the coast at this season and that stephen might have chosen to do likewise  they did little besides chat that evening mr swancourt beginning to question his visitor closely yet paternally and in good part on his hopes and prospects from the profession he had embraced stephen gave vague answers the next day it rained in the evening when twentyfour hours of elfride had completely rekindled her admirers ardour a game of chess was proposed between them  the game had its value in helping on the developments of their future  elfride soon perceived that her opponent was but a learner she next noticed that he had a very odd way of handling the pieces when castling or taking a man antecedently she would have supposed that the same performance must be gone through by all players in the same manner she was taught by his differing action that all ordinary players who learn the game by sight unconsciously touch the men in a stereotyped way this impression of indescribable oddness in stephens touch culminated in speech when she saw him at the taking of one of her bishops push it aside with the taking man instead of lifting it as a preliminary to the move  how strangely you handle the men mr smith  do i i am sorry for that  oh nodont be sorry it is not a matter great enough for sorrow but who taught you to play  nobody miss swancourt he said i learnt from a book lent me by my friend mr knight the noblest man in the world  but you have seen people play  i have never seen the playing of a single game this is the first time i ever had the opportunity of playing with a living opponent i have worked out many games from books and studied the reasons of the different moves but that is all  this was a full explanation of his mannerism but the fact that a man with the desire for chess should have grown up without being able to see or engage in a game astonished her not a little she pondered on the circumstance for some time looking into vacancy and hindering the play  mr swancourt was sitting with his eyes fixed on the board but apparently thinking of other things half to himself he said pending the move of elfride  quae finis aut quod me manet stipendium  stephen replied instantly  effare jussas cum fide poenas luam  excellentpromptgratifying said mr swancourt with feeling bringing down his hand upon the table and making three pawns and a knight dance over their borders by the shaking i was musing on those words as applicable to a strange course i am steeringbut enough of that i am delighted with you mr smith for it is so seldom in this desert that i meet with a man who is gentleman and scholar enough to continue a quotation however trite it may be  i also apply the words to myself said stephen quietly  you the last man in the world to do that i should have thought  come murmured elfride poutingly and insinuating herself between them tell me all about it come construe construe  stephen looked steadfastly into her face and said slowly and in a voice full of a faroff meaning that seemed quaintly premature in one so young  quae finis what will be the end aut or quod stipendium what fine manet me awaits me effare speak out luam i will pay cum fide with faith jussas poenas the penalty required  the vicar who had listened with a critical compression of the lips to this schoolboy recitation and by reason of his imperfect hearing had missed the marked realism of stephens tone in the english words now said hesitatingly by the bye mr smith i know youll excuse my curiosity though your translation was unexceptionably correct and close you have a way of pronouncing your latin which to me seems most peculiar not that the pronunciation of a dead language is of much importance yet your accents and quantities have a grotesque sound to my ears i thought first that you had acquired your way of breathing the vowels from some of the northern colleges but it cannot be so with the quantities what i was going to ask was if your instructor in the classics could possibly have been an oxford or cambridge man  yes he was an oxford manfellow of st cyprians  really  oh yes theres no doubt about it  the oddest thing ever i heard of said mr swancourt starting with astonishment that the pupil of such a man  the best and cleverest man in england cried stephen enthusiastically  that the pupil of such a man should pronounce latin in the way you pronounce it beats all i ever heard how long did he instruct you  four years  four years  it is not so strange when i explain stephen hastened to say it was done in this wayby letter i sent him exercises and construing twice a week and twice a week he sent them back to me corrected with marginal notes of instruction that is how i learnt my latin and greek such as it is he is not responsible for my scanning he has never heard me scan a line  a novel case and a singular instance of patience cried the vicar  on his part not on mine ah henry knight is one in a thousand i remember his speaking to me on this very subject of pronunciation he says that much to his regret he sees a time coming when every man will pronounce even the common words of his own tongue as seems right in his own ears and be thought none the worse for it that the speaking age is passing away to make room for the writing age  both elfride and her father had waited attentively to hear stephen go on to what would have been the most interesting part of the story namely what circumstances could have necessitated such an unusual method of education but no further explanation was volunteered and they saw by the young mans manner of concentrating himself upon the chessboard that he was anxious to drop the subject  the game proceeded elfride played by rote stephen by thought it was the cruellest thing to checkmate him after so much labour she considered what was she dishonest enough to do in her compassion to let him checkmate her a second game followed and being herself absolutely indifferent as to the result her playing was above the average among women and she knew it she allowed him to give checkmate again a final game in which she adopted the muzio gambit as her opening was terminated by elfrides victory at the twelfth move  stephen looked up suspiciously his heart was throbbing even more excitedly than was hers which itself had quickened when she seriously set to work on this last occasion mr swancourt had left the room  you have been trifling with me till now he exclaimed his face flushing you did not play your best in the first two games  elfrides guilt showed in her face stephen became the picture of vexation and sadness which relishable for a moment caused her the next instant to regret the mistake she had made  mr smith forgive me she said sweetly i see now though i did not at first that what i have done seems like contempt for your skill but indeed i did not mean it in that sense i could not upon my conscience win a victory in those first and second games over one who fought at such a disadvantage and so manfully  he drew a long breath and murmured bitterly ah you are cleverer than i you can do everythingi can do nothing o miss swancourt he burst out wildly his heart swelling in his throat i must tell you how i love you all these months of my absence i have worshipped you  he leapt from his seat like the impulsive lad that he was slid round to her side and almost before she suspected it his arm was round her waist and the two sets of curls intermingled  so entirely new was fullblown love to elfride that she trembled as much from the novelty of the emotion as from the emotion itself then she suddenly withdrew herself and stood upright vexed that she had submitted unresistingly even to his momentary pressure she resolved to consider this demonstration as premature  you must not begin such things as those she said with coquettish hauteur of a very transparent nature andyou must not do so againand papa is coming  let me kiss youonly a little one he said with his usual delicacy and without reading the factitiousness of her manner  no not one  only on your cheek  no  forehead  certainly not  you care for somebody else then ah i thought so  i am sure i do not  nor for me either  how can i tell she said simply the simplicity lying merely in the broad outlines of her manner and speech there were the semitone of voice and halfhidden expression of eyes which tell the initiated how very fragile is the ice of reserve at these times  footsteps were heard mr swancourt then entered the room and their private colloquy ended  the day after this partial revelation mr swancourt proposed a drive to the cliffs beyond targan bay a distance of three or four miles  half an hour before the time of departure a crash was heard in the back yard and presently worm came in saying partly to the world in general partly to himself and slightly to his auditors  ay ay sure that frying of fish will be the end of william worm they be at it again this morningsame as everfizz fizz fizz  your head bad again worm said mr swancourt what was that noise we heard in the yard  ay sir a weak wambling man am i and the frying have been going on in my poor head all through the long night and this morning as usual and i was so dazed wi it that down fell a piece of legwood across the shaft of the ponyshay and splintered it off ay says i i feel it as if twas my own shay and though ive done it and parish pay is my lot if i go from here perhaps i am as independent as one here and there  dear me the shaft of the carriage broken cried elfride she was disappointed stephen doubly so the vicar showed more warmth of temper than the accident seemed to demand much to stephens uneasiness and rather to his surprise he had not supposed so much latent sternness could coexist with mr swancourts frankness and goodnature  you shall not be disappointed said the vicar at length it is almost too long a distance for you to walk elfride can trot down on her pony and you shall have my old nag smith  elfride exclaimed triumphantly you have never seen me on horsebackoh you must she looked at stephen and read his thoughts immediately ah you dont ride mr smith  i am sorry to say i dont  fancy a man not able to ride said she rather pertly  the vicar came to his rescue thats common enough he has had other lessons to learn now i recommend this plan let elfride ride on horseback and you mr smith walk beside her  the arrangement was welcomed with secret delight by stephen it seemed to combine in itself all the advantages of a long slow ramble with elfride without the contingent possibility of the enjoyment being spoilt by her becoming weary the pony was saddled and brought round  now mr smith said the lady imperatively coming downstairs and appearing in her ridinghabit as she always did in a change of dress like a new edition of a delightful volume you have a task to perform today these earrings are my very favourite darling ones but the worst of it is that they have such short hooks that they are liable to be dropped if i toss my head about much and when i am riding i cant give my mind to them it would be doing me knight service if you keep your eyes fixed upon them and remember them every minute of the day and tell me directly i drop one they have had such hairbreadth escapes havent they unity she continued to the parlourmaid who was standing at the door  yes miss that they have said unity with roundeyed commiseration  once twas in the lane that i found one of them pursued elfride reflectively  and then twas by the gate into eighteen acres unity chimed in  and then twas on the carpet in my own room rejoined elfride merrily  and then twas dangling on the embroidery of your petticoat miss and then twas down your back miss wasnt it and oh what a way you was in miss wasnt you my until you found it  stephen took elfrides slight foot upon his hand one two three and up she said  unfortunately not so he staggered and lifted and the horse edged round and elfride was ultimately deposited upon the ground rather more forcibly than was pleasant smith looked all contrition  never mind said the vicar encouragingly try again tis a little accomplishment that requires some practice although it looks so easy stand closer to the horses head mr smith  indeed i shant let him try again said she with a microscopic look of indignation worm come here and help me to mount worm stepped forward and she was in the saddle in a trice  then they moved on going for some distance in silence the hot air of the valley being occasionally brushed from their faces by a cool breeze which wound its way along ravines leading up from the sea  i suppose said stephen that a man who can neither sit in a saddle himself nor help another person into one seems a useless incumbrance but miss swancourt ill learn to do it all for your sake i will indeed  what is so unusual in you she said in a didactic tone justifiable in a horsewomans address to a benighted walker is that your knowledge of certain things should be combined with your ignorance of certain other things  stephen lifted his eyes earnestly to hers  you know he said it is simply because there are so many other things to be learnt in this wide world that i didnt trouble about that particular bit of knowledge i thought it would be useless to me but i dont think so now i will learn riding and all connected with it because then you would like me better do you like me much less for this  she looked sideways at him with critical meditation tenderly rendered  do i seem like la belle dame sans merci she began suddenly without replying to his question fancy yourself saying mr smith       i sat her on my pacing steed         and nothing else saw all day long      for sidelong would she bend and sing             a fairys song    she found me roots of relish sweet         and honey wild and manna dew   and thats all she did  no no said the young man stilly and with a rising colour      and sure in language strange she said            i love thee true    not at all she rejoined quickly see how i can gallop now pansy off and elfride started and stephen beheld her light figure contracting to the dimensions of a bird as she sank into the distanceher hair flowing  he walked on in the same direction and for a considerable time could see no signs of her returning dull as a flower without the sun he sat down upon a stone and not for fifteen minutes was any sound of horse or rider to be heard then elfride and pansy appeared on the hill in a round trot  such a delightful scamper as we have had she said her face flushed and her eyes sparkling she turned the horses head stephen arose and they went on again  well what have you to say to me mr smith after my long absence  do you remember a question you could not exactly answer last nightwhether i was more to you than anybody else said he  i cannot exactly answer now either  why cant you  because i dont know if i am more to you than any one else  yes indeed you are he exclaimed in a voice of intensest appreciation at the same time gliding round and looking into her face  eyes in eyes he murmured playfully and she blushingly obeyed looking back into his  and why not lips on lips continued stephen daringly  no certainly not anybody might look and it would be the death of me you may kiss my hand if you like  he expressed by a look that to kiss a hand through a glove and that a ridingglove was not a great treat under the circumstances  there then ill take my glove off isnt it a pretty white hand ah you dont want to kiss it and you shall not now  if i do not may i never kiss again you severe elfride you know i think more of you than i can tell that you are my queen i would die for you elfride  a rapid red again filled her cheeks and she looked at him meditatively what a proud moment it was for elfride then she was ruling a heart with absolute despotism for the first time in her life  stephen stealthily pounced upon her hand  no i wont i wont she said intractably and you shouldnt take me by surprise  there ensued a mild form of tussle for absolute possession of the muchcoveted hand in which the boisterousness of boy and girl was far more prominent than the dignity of man and woman then pansy became restless elfride recovered her position and remembered herself  you make me behave in not a nice way at all she exclaimed in a tone neither of pleasure nor anger but partaking of both i ought not to have allowed such a romp we are too old now for that sort of thing  i hope you dont think me tootoo much of a creepinground sort of man said he in a penitent tone conscious that he too had lost a little dignity by the proceeding  you are too familiar and i cant have it considering the shortness of the time we have known each other mr smith you take too much upon you you think i am a country girl and it doesnt matter how you behave to me  i assure you miss swancourt that i had no idea of freak in my mind i wanted to imprint a sweetserious kiss upon your hand and thats all  now thats creeping round again and you mustnt look into my eyes so she said shaking her head at him and trotting on a few paces in advance thus she led the way out of the lane and across some fields in the direction of the cliffs at the boundary of the fields nearest the sea she expressed a wish to dismount the horse was tied to a post and they both followed an irregular path which ultimately terminated upon a flat ledge passing round the face of the huge blueblack rock at a height about midway between the sea and the topmost verge there far beneath and before them lay the everlasting stretch of ocean there upon detached rocks were the white screaming gulls seeming ever intending to settle and yet always passing on right and left ranked the toothed and zigzag line of stormtorn heights forming the series which culminated in the one beneath their feet  behind the youth and maiden was a tempting alcove and seat formed naturally in the beetling mass and wide enough to admit two or three persons elfride sat down and stephen sat beside her  i am afraid it is hardly proper of us to be here either she said half inquiringly we have not known each other long enough for this kind of thing have we  oh yes he replied judicially quite long enough  how do you know  it is not length of time but the manner in which our minutes beat that makes enough or not enough in our acquaintanceship  yes i see that but i wish papa suspected or knew what a very new thing i am doing he does not think of it at all  darling elfie i wish we could be married it is wrong for me to say iti know it isbefore you know more but i wish we might be all the same do you love me deeply deeply  no she said in a fluster  at this pointblank denial stephen turned his face away decisively and preserved an ominous silence the only objects of interest on earth for him being apparently the three or fourscore seabirds circling in the air afar off  i didnt mean to stop you quite she faltered with some alarm and seeing that he still remained silent she added more anxiously if you say that again perhaps i will not be quitequite so obstinateifif you dont like me to be  oh my elfride he exclaimed and kissed her  it was elfrides first kiss and so awkward and unused was she full of strivingno relenting there was none of those apparent struggles to get out of the trap which only results in getting further in no final attitude of receptivity no easy close of shoulder to shoulder hand upon hand face upon face and in spite of coyness the lips in the right place at the supreme moment that graceful though apparently accidental falling into position which many have noticed as precipitating the end and making sweethearts the sweeter was not here why because experience was absent a woman must have had many kisses before she kisses well  in fact the art of tendering the lips for these amatory salutes follows the principles laid down in treatises on legerdemain for performing the trick called forcing a card the card is to be shifted nimbly withdrawn edged under and withal not to be offered till the moment the unsuspecting persons hand reaches the pack this forcing to be done so modestly and yet so coaxingly that the person trifled with imagines he is really choosing what is in fact thrust into his hand  well there were no such facilities now and stephen was conscious of itfirst with a momentary regret that his kiss should be spoilt by her confused receipt of it and then with the pleasant perception that her awkwardness was her charm  and you do care for me and love me said he  yes  very much  yes  and i mustnt ask you if youll wait for me and be my wife some day  why not she said naively  there is a reason why my elfride  not any one that i know of  suppose there is something connected with me which makes it almost impossible for you to agree to be my wife or for your father to countenance such an idea  nothing shall make me cease to love you no blemish can be found upon your personal nature that is pure and generous i know and having that how can i be cold to you  and shall nothing else affect usshall nothing beyond my nature be a part of my quality in your eyes elfie  nothing whatever she said with a breath of relief is that all some outside circumstance what do i care  you can hardly judge dear till you know what has to be judged for that we will stop till we get home i believe in you but i cannot feel bright  love is new and fresh to us as the dew and we are together as the lovers world goes this is a great deal stephen i fancy i see the difference between me and youbetween men and women generally perhaps i am content to build happiness on any accidental basis that may lie near at hand you are for making a world to suit your happiness  elfride you sometimes say things which make you seem suddenly to become five years older than you are or than i am and that remark is one i couldnt think so old as that try how i mightand no lover has ever kissed you before  never  i knew that you were so unused you ride well but you dont kiss nicely at all and i was told once by my friend knight that that is an excellent fault in woman  now come i must mount again or we shall not be home by dinnertime and they returned to where pansy stood tethered instead of entrusting my weight to a young mans unstable palm she continued gaily i prefer a surer uppingstock as the villagers call it in the form of a gate therenow i am myself again  they proceeded homeward at the same walking pace  her blitheness won stephen out of his thoughtfulness and each forgot everything but the tone of the moment  what did you love me for she said after a long musing look at a flying bird  i dont know he replied idly  oh yes you do insisted elfride  perhaps for your eyes  what of themnow dont vex me by a light answer what of my eyes  oh nothing to be mentioned they are indifferently good  come stephen i wont have that what did you love me for  it might have been for your mouth  well what about my mouth  i thought it was a passable mouth enough  thats not very comforting  with a pretty pout and sweet lips but actually nothing more than what everybody has  dont make up things out of your head as you go on theres a dear stephen nowwhatdidyoulovemefor  perhaps twas for your neck and hair though i am not sure or for your idle blood that did nothing but wander away from your cheeks and back again but i am not sure or your hands and arms that they eclipsed all other hands and arms or your feet that they played about under your dress like little mice or your tongue that it was of a dear delicate tone but i am not altogether sure  ah thats pretty to say but i dont care for your love if it made a mere flat picture of me in that way and not being sure and such cold reasoning but what you felt i was you know stephen at this a stealthy laugh and frisky look into his face when you said to yourself ill certainly love that young lady  i never said it  when you said to yourself then i never will love that young lady  i didnt say that either  then was it i suppose i must love that young lady  no  what then  twas much more fluctuatingnot so definite  tell me do do  it was that i ought not to think about you if i loved you truly  ah that i dont understand theres no getting it out of you and ill not ask you ever any morenever moreto say out of the deep reality of your heart what you loved me for  sweet tantalizer whats the use it comes to this sole simple thing that at one time i had never seen you and i didnt love you that then i saw you and i did love you is that enough  yes i will make it doi know i think what i love you for you are nicelooking of course but i didnt mean for that it is because you are so docile and gentle  those are not quite the correct qualities for a man to be loved for said stephen in rather a dissatisfied tone of selfcriticism well never mind i must ask your father to allow us to be engaged directly we get indoors it will be for a long time  i like it the betterstephen dont mention it till tomorrow  why  because if he should objecti dont think he will but if he shouldwe shall have a day longer of happiness from our ignorancewell what are you thinking of so deeply  i was thinking how my dear friend knight would enjoy this scene i wish he could come here  you seem very much engrossed with him she answered with a jealous little toss he must be an interesting man to take up so much of your attention  interesting said stephen his face glowing with his fervour noble you ought to say  oh yes yes i forgot she said half satirically the noblest man in england as you told us last night  he is a fine fellow laugh as you will miss elfie  i know he is your hero but what does he do anything  he writes  what does he write i have never heard of his name  because his personality and that of several others like him is absorbed into a huge we namely the impalpable entity called the presenta social and literary review  is he only a reviewer  only elfie why i can tell you it is a fine thing to be on the staff of the present finer than being a novelist considerably  thats a hit at me and my poor court of kellyon castle  no elfride he whispered i didnt mean that i mean that he is really a literary man of some eminence and not altogether a reviewer he writes things of a higher class than reviews though he reviews a book occasionally his ordinary productions are social and ethical essaysall that the present contains which is not literary reviewing  i admit he must be talented if he writes for the present we have it sent to us irregularly i want papa to be a subscriber but hes so conservative now the next point in this mr knighti suppose he is a very good man  an excellent man i shall try to be his intimate friend some day  but arent you now  no not so much as that replied stephen as if such a supposition were extravagant you see it was in this wayhe came originally from the same place as i and taught me things but i am not intimate with him shant i be glad when i get richer and better known and hob and nob with him stephens eyes sparkled  a pout began to shape itself upon elfrides soft lips you think always of him and like him better than you do me  no indeed elfride the feeling is different quite but i do like him and he deserves even more affection from me than i give  you are not nice now and you make me as jealous as possible she exclaimed perversely i know you will never speak to any third person of me so warmly as you do to me of him  but you dont understand elfride he said with an anxious movement you shall know him some day he is so brilliantno it isnt exactly brilliant so thoughtfulnor does thoughtful express himthat it would charm you to talk to him hes a most desirable friend and that isnt half i could say  i dont care how good he is i dont want to know him because he comes between me and you you think of him night and day ever so much more than of anybody else and when you are thinking of him i am shut out of your mind  no dear elfride i love you dearly  and i dont like you to tell me so warmly about him when you are in the middle of loving me stephen suppose that i and this man knight of yours were both drowning and you could only save one of us  yesthe stupid old propositionwhich would i save  well which not me  both of you he said pressing her pendent hand  no that wont do only one of us  i cannot say i dont know it is disagreeablequite a horrid idea to have to handle  aha i know you would save him and let me drown drown drown and i dont care about your love  she had endeavoured to give a playful tone to her words but the latter speech was rather forced in its gaiety  at this point in the discussion she trotted off to turn a corner which was avoided by the footpath the road and the path reuniting at a point a little further on on again making her appearance she continually managed to look in a direction away from him and left him in the cool shade of her displeasure stephen was soon beaten at this game of indifference he went round and entered the range of her vision  are you offended elfie why dont you talk  save me then and let that mr clever of yours drown i hate him now which would you  really elfride you should not press such a hard question it is ridiculous  then i wont be alone with you any more unkind to wound me so she laughed at her own absurdity but persisted  come elfie lets make it up and be friends  say you would save me then and let him drown  i would save youand him too  and let him drown come or you dont love me she teasingly went on  and let him drown he ejaculated despairingly  there now i am yours she said and a womans flush of triumph lit her eyes    only one earring miss as im alive said unity on their entering the hall  with a face expressive of wretched misgiving elfrides hand flew like an arrow to her ear  there she exclaimed to stephen looking at him with eyes full of reproach  i quite forgot indeed if i had only remembered he answered with a consciencestricken face  she wheeled herself round and turned into the shrubbery stephen followed  if you had told me to watch anything stephen i should have religiously done it she capriciously went on as soon as she heard him behind her  forgetting is forgivable  well you will find it if you want me to respect you and be engaged to you when we have asked papa she considered a moment and added more seriously i know now where i dropped it stephen it was on the cliff i remember a faint sensation of some change about me but i was too absent to think of it then and thats where it is now and you must go and look there  ill go at once  and he strode away up the valley under a broiling sun and amid the deathlike silence of early afternoon he ascended with giddypaced haste the windy range of rocks to where they had sat felt and peered about the stones and crannies but elfrides stray jewel was nowhere to be seen next stephen slowly retraced his steps and pausing at a crossroad to reflect a while he left the plateau and struck downwards across some fields in the direction of endelstow house  he walked along the path by the river without the slightest hesitation as to its bearing apparently quite familiar with every inch of the ground as the shadows began to lengthen and the sunlight to mellow he passed through two wicketgates and drew near the outskirts of endelstow park the river now ran along under the park fence previous to entering the grove itself a little further on  here stood a cottage between the fence and the stream on a slightly elevated spot of ground round which the river took a turn the characteristic feature of this snug habitation was its one chimney in the gable end its squareness of form disguised by a huge cloak of ivy which had grown so luxuriantly and extended so far from its base as to increase the apparent bulk of the chimney to the dimensions of a tower some little distance from the back of the house rose the park boundary and over this were to be seen the sycamores of the grove making slow inclinations to the justawakening air  stephen crossed the little wood bridge in front went up to the cottage door and opened it without knock or signal of any kind  exclamations of welcome burst from some person or persons when the door was thrust ajar followed by the scrape of chairs on a stone floor as if pushed back by their occupiers in rising from a table the door was closed again and nothing could now be heard from within save a lively chatter and the rattle of plates     chapter viii       allenadale is no baron or lord   the mists were creeping out of pools and swamps for their pilgrimages of the night when stephen came up to the front door of the vicarage elfride was standing on the step illuminated by a lemonhued expanse of western sky  you never have been all this time looking for that earring she said anxiously  oh no and i have not found it  never mind though i am much vexed they are my prettiest but stephen what ever have you been doingwhere have you been i have been so uneasy i feared for you knowing not an inch of the country i thought suppose he has fallen over the cliff but now i am inclined to scold you for frightening me so  i must speak to your father now he said rather abruptly i have so much to say to himand to you elfride  will what you have to say endanger this nice time of ours and is it that same shadowy secret you allude to so frequently and will it make me unhappy  possibly  she breathed heavily and looked around as if for a prompter  put it off till tomorrow she said  he involuntarily sighed too  no it must come tonight where is your father elfride  somewhere in the kitchen garden i think she replied that is his favourite evening retreat i will leave you now say all thats to be saiddo all there is to be done think of me waiting anxiously for the end and she reentered the house  she waited in the drawingroom watching the lights sink to shadows the shadows sink to darkness until her impatience to know what had occurred in the garden could no longer be controlled she passed round the shrubbery unlatched the garden door and skimmed with her keen eyes the whole twilighted space that the four walls enclosed and sheltered they were not there she mounted a little ladder which had been used for gathering fruit and looked over the wall into the field this field extended to the limits of the glebe which was enclosed on that side by a privethedge under the hedge was mr swancourt walking up and down and talking aloudto himself as it sounded at first no another voice shouted occasional replies and this interlocutor seemed to be on the other side of the hedge the voice though soft in quality was not stephens  the second speaker must have been in the longneglected garden of an old manorhouse hard by which together with a small estate attached had lately been purchased by a person named troyton whom elfride had never seen her father might have struck up an acquaintanceship with some member of that family through the privethedge or a stranger to the neighbourhood might have wandered thither  well there was no necessity for disturbing him  and it seemed that after all stephen had not yet made his desired communication to her father again she went indoors wondering where stephen could be for want of something better to do she went upstairs to her own little room here she sat down at the open window and leaning with her elbow on the table and her cheek upon her hand she fell into meditation  it was a hot and still august night every disturbance of the silence which rose to the dignity of a noise could be heard for miles and the merest sound for a long distance so she remained thinking of stephen and wishing he had not deprived her of his company to no purpose as it appeared how delicate and sensitive he was she reflected and yet he was man enough to have a private mystery which considerably elevated him in her eyes thus looking at things with an inward vision she lost consciousness of the flight of time  strange conjunctions of circumstances particularly those of a trivial everyday kind are so frequent in an ordinary life that we grow used to their unaccountableness and forget the question whether the very long odds against such juxtaposition is not almost a disproof of it being a matter of chance at all what occurred to elfride at this moment was a case in point she was vividly imagining for the twentieth time the kiss of the morning and putting her lips together in the position another such a one would demand when she heard the identical operation performed on the lawn immediately beneath her window  a kissnot of the quiet and stealthy kind but decisive loud and smart  her face flushed and she looked out but to no purpose the dark rim of the upland drew a keen sad line against the pale glow of the sky unbroken except where a young cedar on the lawn that had outgrown its fellow trees shot its pointed head across the horizon piercing the firmamental lustre like a sting  it was just possible that had any persons been standing on the grassy portions of the lawn elfride might have seen their dusky forms but the shrubs which once had merely dotted the glade had now grown bushy and large till they hid at least half the enclosure containing them the kissing pair might have been behind some of these at any rate nobody was in sight  had no enigma ever been connected with her lover by his hints and absences elfride would never have thought of admitting into her mind a suspicion that he might be concerned in the foregoing enactment but the reservations he at present insisted on while they added to the mystery without which perhaps she would never have seriously loved him at all were calculated to nourish doubts of all kinds and with a slow flush of jealousy she asked herself might he not be the culprit  elfride glided downstairs on tiptoe and out to the precise spot on which she had parted from stephen to enable him to speak privately to her father thence she wandered into all the nooks around the place from which the sound seemed to proceedamong the huge laurestines about the tufts of pampas grasses amid the variegated hollies under the weeping wychelmnobody was there returning indoors she called unity  she is gone to her aunts to spend the evening said mr swancourt thrusting his head out of his study door and letting the light of his candles stream upon elfrides faceless revealing than as it seemed to herself creating the blush of uneasy perplexity that was burning upon her cheek  i didnt know you were indoors papa she said with surprise surely no light was shining from the window when i was on the lawn and she looked and saw that the shutters were still open  oh yes i am in he said indifferently what did you want unity for i think she laid supper before she went out  did shei have not been to seei didnt want her for that  elfride scarcely knew now that a definite reason was required what that reason was her mind for a moment strayed to another subject unimportant as it seemed the red ember of a match was lying inside the fender which explained that why she had seen no rays from the window was because the candles had only just been lighted  ill come directly said the vicar i thought you were out somewhere with mr smith  even the inexperienced elfride could not help thinking that her father must be wonderfully blind if he failed to perceive what was the nascent consequence of herself and stephen being so unceremoniously left together wonderfully careless if he saw it and did not think about it wonderfully good if as seemed to her by far the most probable supposition he saw it and thought about it and approved of it these reflections were cut short by the appearance of stephen just outside the porch silvered about the head and shoulders with touches of moonlight that had begun to creep through the trees  has your trouble anything to do with a kiss on the lawn she asked abruptly almost passionately  kiss on the lawn  yes she said imperiously now  i didnt comprehend your meaning nor do i now exactly i certainly have kissed nobody on the lawn if that is really what you want to know elfride  you know nothing about such a performance  nothing whatever what makes you ask  dont press me to tell it is nothing of importance and stephen you have not yet spoken to papa about our engagement  no he said regretfully i could not find him directly and then i went on thinking so much of what you said about objections refusalsbitter words possiblyending our happiness that i resolved to put it off till tomorrow that gives us one more day of delightdelight of a tremulous kind  yes but it would be improper to be silent too long i think she said in a delicate voice which implied that her face had grown warm i want him to know we love stephen why did you adopt as your own my thought of delay  i will explain but i want to tell you of my secret firstto tell you now it is two or three hours yet to bedtime let us walk up the hill to the church  elfride passively assented and they went from the lawn by a side wicket and ascended into the open expanse of moonlight which streamed around the lonely edifice on the summit of the hill  the door was locked they turned from the porch and walked hand in hand to find a restingplace in the churchyard stephen chose a flat tomb showing itself to be newer and whiter than those around it and sitting down himself gently drew her hand towards him  no not there she said  why not here  a mere fancy but never mind and she sat down  elfie will you love me in spite of everything that may be said against me  o stephen what makes you repeat that so continually and so sadly you know i will yes indeed she said drawing closer whatever may be said of youand nothing bad can bei will cling to you just the same your ways shall be my ways until i die  did you ever think what my parents might be or what society i originally moved in  no not particularly i have observed one or two little points in your manners which are rather quaintno more i suppose you have moved in the ordinary society of professional people  supposing i have notthat none of my family have a profession except me  i dont mind what you are only concerns me  where do you think i went to schooli mean to what kind of school  dr somebodys academy she said simply  no to a dame school originally then to a national school  only to those well i love you just as much stephen dear stephen she murmured tenderly i do indeed and why should you tell me these things so impressively what do they matter to me  he held her closer and proceeded  what do you think my father isdoes for his living that is to say  he practises some profession or calling i suppose  no he is a mason  a freemason  no a cottager and journeyman mason  elfride said nothing at first after a while she whispered  that is a strange idea to me but never mind what does it matter  but arent you angry with me for not telling you before  no not at all is your mother alive  yes  is she a nice lady  verythe best mother in the world her people had been welltodo yeomen for centuries but she was only a dairymaid  o stephen came from her in whispered exclamation  she continued to attend to a dairy long after my father married her pursued stephen without further hesitation and i remember very well how when i was very young i used to go to the milking look on at the skimming sleep through the churning and make believe i helped her ah that was a happy time enough  no nevernot happy  yes it was  i dont see how happiness could be where the drudgery of dairywork had to be done for a livingthe hands red and chapped and the shoes cloggedstephen i do own that it seems odd to regard you in the light ofofhaving been so rough in your youth and done menial things of that kind stephen withdrew an inch or two from her side but i do love you just the same she continued getting closer under his shoulder again and i dont care anything about the past and i see that you are all the worthier for having pushed on in the world in such a way  it is not my worthiness it is knights who pushed me  ah always healways he  yes and properly so now elfride you see the reason of his teaching me by letter i knew him years before he went to oxford but i had not got far enough in my reading for him to entertain the idea of helping me in classics till he left home then i was sent away from the village and we very seldom met but he kept up this system of tuition by correspondence with the greatest regularity i will tell you all the story but not now there is nothing more to say now beyond giving places persons and dates his voice became timidly slow at this point  no dont take trouble to say more you are a dear honest fellow to say so much as you have and it is not so dreadful either it has become a normal thing that millionaires commence by going up to london with their tools at their back and halfacrown in their pockets that sort of origin is getting so respected she continued cheerfully that it is acquiring some of the odour of norman ancestry  ah if i had made my fortune i shouldnt mind but i am only a possible maker of it as yet  it is quite enough and so this is what your trouble was  i thought i was doing wrong in letting you love me without telling you my story and yet i feared to do so elfie i dreaded to lose you and i was cowardly on that account  how plain everything about you seems after this explanation your peculiarities in chessplaying the pronunciation papa noticed in your latin your odd mixture of bookknowledge with ignorance of ordinary social accomplishments are accounted for in a moment and has this anything to do with what i saw at lord luxellians  what did you see  i saw the shadow of yourself putting a cloak round a lady i was at the side door you two were in a room with the window towards me you came to me a moment later  she was my mother  your mother there she withdrew herself to look at him silently in her interest  elfride said stephen i was going to tell you the remainder tomorrowi have been keeping it backi must tell it now after all the remainder of my revelation refers to where my parents are where do you think they live you know themby sight at any rate  i know them she said in suspended amazement  yes my father is john smith lord luxellians mastermason who lives under the park wall by the river  o stephen can it be  he builtor assisted at the building of the house you live in years ago he put up those stone gate piers at the lodge entrance to lord luxellians park my grandfather planted the trees that belt in your lawn my grandmotherwho worked in the fields with himheld each tree upright whilst he filled in the earth they told me so when i was a child he was the sexton too and dug many of the graves around us  and was your unaccountable vanishing on the first morning of your arrival and again this afternoon a run to see your father and motheri understand now no wonder you seemed to know your way about the village  no wonder but remember i have not lived here since i was nine years old i then went to live with my uncle a blacksmith near exonbury in order to be able to attend a national school as a day scholar there was none on this remote coast then it was there i met with my friend knight and when i was fifteen and had been fairly educated by the schoolmasterand more particularly by knighti was put as a pupil in an architects office in that town because i was skilful in the use of the pencil a full premium was paid by the efforts of my mother and father rather against the wishes of lord luxellian who likes my father however and thinks a great deal of him there i stayed till six months ago when i obtained a situation as improver as it is called in a london office thats all of me  to think you the london visitor the town man should have been born here and have known this village so many years before i did how strangehow very strange it seems to me she murmured  my mother curtseyed to you and your father last sunday said stephen with a pained smile at the thought of the incongruity and your papa said to her i am glad to see you so regular at church jane  i remember it but i have never spoken to her we have only been here eighteen months and the parish is so large  contrast with this said stephen with a miserable laugh your fathers belief in my blue blood which is still prevalent in his mind the first night i came he insisted upon proving my descent from one of the most ancient westcounty families on account of my second christian name when the truth is it was given me because my grandfather was assistant gardener in the fitzmauricesmith family for thirty years having seen your face my darling i had not heart to contradict him and tell him what would have cut me off from a friendly knowledge of you  she sighed deeply yes i see now how this inequality may be made to trouble us she murmured and continued in a low sad whisper i wouldnt have minded if they had lived far away papa might have consented to an engagement between us if your connection had been with villagers a hundred miles off remoteness softens family contrasts but he will not likeo stephen stephen what can i do  do he said tentatively yet with heaviness give me up let me go back to london and think no more of me  no no i cannot give you up this hopelessness in our affairs makes me care more for youi see what did not strike me at first stephen why do we trouble why should papa object an architect in london is an architect in london who inquires there nobody we shall live there shall we not why need we be so alarmed  and elfie said stephen his hopes kindling with hers knight thinks nothing of my being only a cottagers son he says i am as worthy of his friendship as if i were a lords and if i am worthy of his friendship i am worthy of you am i not elfride  i not only have never loved anybody but you she said instead of giving an answer but i have not even formed a strong friendship such as you have for knight i wish you hadnt it diminishes me  now elfride you know better he said wooingly and had you really never any sweetheart at all  none that was ever recognized by me as such  but did nobody ever love you  yesa man did once very much he said  how long ago  oh a long time  how long dearest  a twelvemonth  thats not very long rather disappointedly  i said long not very long  and did he want to marry you  i believe he did but i didnt see anything in him he was not good enough even if i had loved him  may i ask what he was  a farmer  a farmer not good enoughhow much better than my family stephen murmured  where is he now he continued to elfride  here  here what do you mean by that  i mean that he is here  where here  under us he is under this tomb he is dead and we are sitting on his grave  elfie said the young man standing up and looking at the tomb how odd and sad that revelation seems it quite depresses me for the moment  stephen i didnt wish to sit here but you would do so  you never encouraged him  never by look word or sign she said solemnly he died of consumption and was buried the day you first came  let us go away i dont like standing by him even if you never loved him he was before me  worries make you unreasonable she half pouted following stephen at the distance of a few steps perhaps i ought to have told you before we sat down yes let us go     chapter ix      her father did fume   oppressed in spite of themselves by a foresight of impending complications elfride and stephen returned down the hill hand in hand at the door they paused wistfully like children late at school  women accept their destiny more readily than men elfride had now resigned herself to the overwhelming idea of her lovers sorry antecedents stephen had not forgotten the trifling grievance that elfride had known earlier admiration than his own  what was that young mans name he inquired  felix jethway a widows only son  i remember the family  she hates me now she says i killed him  stephen mused and they entered the porch  stephen i love only you she tremulously whispered he pressed her fingers and the trifling shadow passed away to admit again the mutual and more tangible trouble  the study appeared to be the only room lighted up they entered each with a demeanour intended to conceal the inconcealable fact that reciprocal love was their dominant chord elfride perceived a man sitting with his back towards herself talking to her father she would have retired but mr swancourt had seen her  come in he said it is only martin cannister come for a copy of the register for poor mrs jethway  martin cannister the sexton was rather a favourite with elfride he used to absorb her attention by telling her of his strange experiences in digging up after long years the bodies of persons he had known and recognizing them by some little sign though in reality he had never recognized any he had shrewd small eyes and a great wealth of double chin which compensated in some measure for considerable poverty of nose  the appearance of a slip of paper in cannisters hand and a few shillings lying on the table in front of him denoted that the business had been transacted and the tenor of their conversation went to show that a summary of village news was now engaging the attention of parishioner and parson  mr cannister stood up and touched his forehead over his eye with his finger in respectful salutation of elfride gave half as much salute to stephen whom he in common with other villagers had never for a moment recognized then sat down again and resumed his discourse  where had i got on to sir  to driving the pile said mr swancourt  the pile twas so as i was saying nat was driving the pile in this manner as i might say here mr cannister held his walkingstick scrupulously vertical with his left hand and struck a blow with great force on the knob of the stick with his right john was steadying the pile so as i might say here he gave the stick a slight shake and looked firmly in the various eyes around to see that before proceeding further his listeners well grasped the subject at that stage well when nat had struck some halfdozen blows more upon the pile a stopped for a second or two john thinking he had done striking put his hand upon the top o the pile to gie en a pull and see if a were firm in the ground mr cannister spread his hand over the top of the stick completely covering it with his palm well so to speak nat hadnt maned to stop striking and when john had put his hand upon the pile the beetle  oh dreadful said elfride  the beetle was already coming down you see sir nat just caught sight of his hand but couldnt stop the blow in time down came the beetle upon poor john smiths hand and squashed en to a pummy  dear me dear me poor fellow said the vicar with an intonation like the groans of the wounded in a pianoforte performance of the battle of prague  john smith the mastermason cried stephen hurriedly  ay no other and a betterhearted man god amighty never made  is he so much hurt  i have heard said mr swancourt not noticing stephen that he has a son in london a very promising young fellow  oh how he must be hurt repeated stephen  a beetle couldnt hurt very little well sir goodnight tye and ye sir and you miss im sure  mr cannister had been making unnoticeable motions of withdrawal and by the time this farewell remark came from his lips he was just outside the door of the room he tramped along the hall stayed more than a minute endeavouring to close the door properly and then was lost to their hearing  stephen had meanwhile turned and said to the vicar  please excuse me this evening i must leave john smith is my father  the vicar did not comprehend at first  what did you say he inquired  john smith is my father said stephen deliberately  a surplus tinge of redness rose from mr swancourts neck and came round over his face the lines of his features became more firmly defined and his lips seemed to get thinner it was evident that a series of little circumstances hitherto unheeded were now fitting themselves together and forming a lucid picture in mr swancourts mind in such a manner as to render useless further explanation on stephens part  indeed the vicar said in a voice dry and without inflection  this being a word which depends entirely upon its tone for its meaning mr swancourts enunciation was equivalent to no expression at all  i have to go now said stephen with an agitated bearing and a movement as if he scarcely knew whether he ought to run off or stay longer on my return sir will you kindly grant me a few minutes private conversation  certainly though antecedently it does not seem possible that there can be anything of the nature of private business between us  mr swancourt put on his straw hat crossed the drawingroom into which the moonlight was shining and stepped out of the french window into the verandah it required no further effort to perceive what indeed reasoning might have foretold as the natural colour of a mind whose pleasures were taken amid genealogies good dinners and patrician reminiscences that mr swancourts prejudices were too strong for his generosity and that stephens moments as his friend and equal were numbered or had even now ceased  stephen moved forward as if he would follow the vicar then as if he would not and in absolute perplexity whither to turn himself went awkwardly to the door elfride followed lingeringly behind him before he had receded two yards from the doorstep unity and ann the housemaid came home from their visit to the village  have you heard anything about john smith the accident is not so bad as was reported is it said elfride intuitively  oh no the doctor says it is only a bad bruise  i thought so cried elfride gladly  he says that although nat believes he did not check the beetle as it came down he must have done so without knowing itchecked it very considerably too for the full blow would have knocked his hand abroad and in reality it is only made blackandblue like  how thankful i am said stephen  the perplexed unity looked at him with her mouth rather than with her eyes  that will do unity said elfride magisterially and the two maids passed on  elfride do you forgive me said stephen with a faint smile no man is fair in love and he took her fingers lightly in his own  with her head thrown sideways in the greuze attitude she looked a tender reproach at his doubt and pressed his hand stephen returned the pressure threefold then hastily went off to his fathers cottage by the wall of endelstow park  elfride what have you to say to this inquired her father coming up immediately stephen had retired  with feminine quickness she grasped at any straw that would enable her to plead his cause he had told me of it she faltered so that it is not a discovery in spite of him he was just coming in to tell you  coming to tell why hadnt he already told i object as much if not more to his underhand concealment of this than i do to the fact itself it looks very much like his making a fool of me and of you too you and he have been about together and corresponding together in a way i dont at all approve ofin a most unseemly way you should have known how improper such conduct is a woman cant be too careful not to be seen alone with idontknowwhom  you saw us papa and have never said a word  my fault of course my fault what the deuce could i be thinking of he a villagers son and we swancourts connections of the luxellians we have been coming to nothing for centuries and now i believe we have got there what shall i next invite here i wonder  elfride began to cry at this very unpropitious aspect of affairs o papa papa forgive me and him we care so much for one another papao so much and what he was going to ask you is if you will allow of an engagement between us till he is a gentleman as good as you we are not in a hurry dear papa we dont want in the least to marry now not until he is richer only will you let us be engaged because i love him so and he loves me  mr swancourts feelings were a little touched by this appeal and he was annoyed that such should be the case certainly not he replied he pronounced the inhibition lengthily and sonorously so that the not sounded like nooot  no no no dont say it  foh a fine story it is not enough that i have been deluded and disgraced by having him herethe son of one of my village peasantsbut now i am to make him my soninlaw heavens above us are you mad elfride  you have seen his letters come to me ever since his first visit papa and you knew they were a sort ofloveletters and since he has been here you have let him be alone with me almost entirely and you guessed you must have guessed what we were thinking of and doing and you didnt stop him next to lovemaking comes lovewinning and you knew it would come to that papa  the vicar parried this commonsense thrust i knowsince you press me soi know i did guess some childish attachment might arise between you i own i did not take much trouble to prevent it but i have not particularly countenanced it and elfride how can you expect that i should now it is impossible no father in england would hear of such a thing  but he is the same man papa the same in every particular and how can he be less fit for me than he was before  he appeared a young man with welltodo friends and a little property but having neither he is another man  you inquired nothing about him  i went by hewbys introduction he should have told me so should the young man himself of course he should i consider it a most dishonourable thing to come into a mans house like a treacherous idontknowwhat  but he was afraid to tell you and so should i have been he loved me too well to like to run the risk and as to speaking of his friends on his first visit i dont see why he should have done so at all he came here on business it was no affair of ours who his parents were and then he knew that if he told you he would never be asked here and would perhaps never see me again and he wanted to see me who can blame him for trying by any means to stay near methe girl he loves all is fair in love i have heard you say so yourself papa and you yourself would have done just as he hasso would any man  and any man on discovering what i have discovered would also do as i do and mend my mistake that is get shot of him again as soon as the laws of hospitality will allow but mr swancourt then remembered that he was a christian i would not for the world seem to turn him out of doors he added but i think he will have the tact to see that he cannot stay long after this with good taste  he will because hes a gentleman see how graceful his manners are elfride went on though perhaps stephens manners like the feats of euryalus owed their attractiveness in her eyes rather to the attractiveness of his person than to their own excellence  ay anybody can be what you call graceful if he lives a little time in a city and keeps his eyes open and he might have picked up his gentlemanliness by going to the galleries of theatres and watching stage drawingroom manners he reminds me of one of the worst stories i ever heard in my life  what story was that  oh no thank you i wouldnt tell you such an improper matter for the world  if his father and mother had lived in the north or east of england gallantly persisted elfride though her sobs began to interrupt her articulation anywhere but hereyouwould haveonly regardedhim and not them his stationwould havebeen whathis profession makes itand not fixed byhis fathers humble positionat all whom he never lives withnow though john smith has saved lots of money and is better off than we are they say or he couldnt have put his son to such an expensive profession and it is clever andhonourableof stephen to be the best of his family  yes let a beast be lord of beasts and his crib shall stand at the kings mess  you insult me papa she burst out you do you do he is my own stephen he is  that may or may not be true elfride returned her father again uncomfortably agitated in spite of himself you confuse future probabilities with present factswhat the young man may be with what he is we must look at what he is not what an improbable degree of success in his profession may make him the case is this the son of a workingman in my parish who may or may not be able to buy me upa youth who has not yet advanced so far into life as to have any income of his own deserving the name and therefore of his fathers degree as regards stationwants to be engaged to you his family are living in precisely the same spot in england as yours so throughout this countywhich is the world to usyou would always be known as the wife of jack smith the masons son and not under any circumstances as the wife of a london professional man it is the drawback not the compensating fact that is talked of always there say no more you may argue all night and prove what you will ill stick to my words  elfride looked silently and hopelessly out of the window with large heavy eyes and wet cheeks  i call it great temerityand long to call it audacityin hewby resumed her father i never heard such a thinggiving such a hobbledehoy native of this place such an introduction to me as he did naturally you were deceived as well as i was i dont blame you at all so far he went and searched for mr hewbys original letter heres what he said to me dear siragreeably to your request of the 18th instant i have arranged to survey and make drawings et cetera my assistant mr stephen smithassistant you see he called him and naturally i understood him to mean a sort of partner why didnt he say clerk  they never call them clerks in that profession because they do not write stephenmr smithtold me so so that mr hewby simply used the accepted word  let me speak please elfride my assistant mr stephen smith will leave london by the early train tomorrow morningmany thanks for your proposal to accommodate himyou may put every confidence in him and may rely upon his discernment in the matter of church architecture well i repeat that hewby ought to be ashamed of himself for making so much of a poor lad of that sort  professional men in london elfride argued dont know anything about their clerks fathers and mothers they have assistants who come to their offices and shops for years and hardly even know where they live what they can dowhat profits they can bring the firmthats all london men care about and that is helped in him by his faculty of being uniformly pleasant  uniform pleasantness is rather a defect than a faculty it shows that a man hasnt sense enough to know whom to despise  it shows that he acts by faith and not by sight as those you claim succession from directed  thats some more of what hes been telling you i suppose yes i was inclined to suspect him because he didnt care about sauces of any kind i always did doubt a mans being a gentleman if his palate had no acquired tastes an unedified palate is the irrepressible cloven foot of the upstart the idea of my bringing out a bottle of my 40 martinezonly eleven of them left nowto a man who didnt know it from eighteenpenny then the latin line he gave to my quotation it was very cutanddried very or i who havent looked into a classical author for the last eighteen years shouldnt have remembered it well elfride you had better go to your room youll get over this bit of tomfoolery in time  no no no papa she moaned for of all the miseries attaching to miserable love the worst is the misery of thinking that the passion which is the cause of them all may cease  elfride said her father with rough friendliness i have an excellent scheme on hand which i cannot tell you of now a scheme to benefit you and me it has been thrust upon me for some little timeyes thrust upon mebut i didnt dream of its value till this afternoon when the revelation came i should be most unwise to refuse to entertain it  i dont like that word she returned wearily you have lost so much already by schemes is it those wretched mines again  no not a mining scheme  railways  nor railways it is like those mysterious offers we see advertised by which any gentleman with no brains at all may make so much a week without risk trouble or soiling his fingers however i am intending to say nothing till it is settled though i will just say this much that you soon may have other fish to fry than to think of stephen smith remember i wish not to be angry but friendly to the young man for your sake ill regard him as a friend in a certain sense but this is enough in a few days you will be quite my way of thinking there now go to your bedroom unity shall bring you up some supper i wish you not to be here when he comes back     chapter x       beneath the shelter of an aged tree   stephen retraced his steps towards the cottage he had visited only two or three hours previously he drew near and under the rich foliage growing about the outskirts of endelstow park the spotty lights and shades from the shining moon maintaining a race over his head and down his back in an endless gambol when he crossed the plank bridge and entered the gardengate he saw an illuminated figure coming from the enclosed plot towards the house on the other side it was his father with his hand in a sling taking a general moonlight view of the garden and particularly of a plot of the youngest of young turnips previous to closing the cottage for the night  he saluted his son with customary force hallo stephen we should ha been in bed in another ten minutes come to see whats the matter wi me i suppose my lad  the doctor had come and gone and the hand had been pronounced as injured but slightly though it might possibly have been considered a far more serious case if mr smith had been a more important man stephens anxious inquiry drew from his father words of regret at the inconvenience to the world of his doing nothing for the next two days rather than of concern for the pain of the accident together they entered the house  john smithbrown as autumn as to skin white as winter as to clotheswas a satisfactory specimen of the village artificer in stone in common with most rural mechanics he had too much individuality to be a typical workingmana resultant of that beachpebble attrition with his kind only to be experienced in large towns which metamorphoses the unit self into a fraction of the unit class  there was not the speciality in his labour which distinguishes the handicraftsmen of towns though only a mason strictly speaking he was not above handling a brick if bricks were the order of the day or a slate or tile if a roof had to be covered before the wet weather set in and nobody was near who could do it better indeed on one or two occasions in the depth of winter when frost peremptorily forbids all use of the trowel making foundations to settle stones to fly and mortar to crumble he had taken to felling and sawing trees moreover he had practised gardening in his own plot for so many years that on an emergency he might have made a living by that calling  probably our countryman was not such an accomplished artificer in a particular direction as his town brethren in the trades but he was in truth like that clumsy pinmaker who made the whole pin and who was despised by adam smith on that account and respected by macaulay much more the artist nevertheless  appearing now indoors by the light of the candle his stalwart healthiness was a sight to see his beard was close and knotted as that of a chiselled hercules his shirt sleeves were partly rolled up his waistcoat unbuttoned the difference in hue between the snowy linen and the ruddy arms and face contrasting like the white of an egg and its yolk mrs smith on hearing them enter advanced from the pantry  mrs smith was a matron whose countenance addressed itself to the mind rather than to the eye though not exclusively she retained her personal freshness even now in the prosy afternoontime of her life but what her features were primarily indicative of was a sound common sense behind them as a whole appearing to carry with them a sort of argumentative commentary on the world in general  the details of the accident were then rehearsed by stephens father in the dramatic manner also common to martin cannister other individuals of the neighbourhood and the rural world generally mrs smith threw in her sentiments between the acts as coryphaeus of the tragedy to make the description complete the story at last came to an end as the longest will and stephen directed the conversation into another channel  well mother they know everything about me now he said quietly  well done replied his father now my minds at peace  i blame myselfi never shall forgive myselffor not telling them before continued the young man  mrs smith at this point abstracted her mind from the former subject i dont see what you have to grieve about stephen she said people who accidentally get friends dont as a first stroke tell the history of their families  yeve done no wrong certainly said his father  no but i should have spoken sooner theres more in this visit of mine than you thinka good deal more  not more than i think mrs smith replied looking contemplatively at him stephen blushed and his father looked from one to the other in a state of utter incomprehension  shes a pretty piece enough mrs smith continued and very ladylike and clever too but though shes very well fit for you as far as that is why mercy pon me what ever do you want any woman at all for yet  john made his naturally short mouth a long one and wrinkled his forehead thats the way the wind dblow is it he said  mother exclaimed stephen how absurdly you speak criticizing whether shes fit for me or no as if there were room for doubt on the matter why to marry her would be the great blessing of my lifesocially and practically as well as in other respects no such good fortune as that im afraid shes too far above me her family doesnt want such country lads as i in it  then if they dont want you id see them dead corpses before id want them and go to better families who do want you  ah yes but i could never put up with the distaste of being welcomed among such people as you mean whilst i could get indifference among such people as hers  what crazy twist o thinking will enter your head next said his mother and come to that shes not a bit too high for you or you too low for her see how careful i be to keep myself up im sure i never stop for more than a minute together to talk to any journeymen people and i never invite anybody to our party o christmases who are not in business for themselves and i talk to several toppermost carriage people that come to my lords without saying maam or sir to em and they take it as quiet as lambs  you curtseyed to the vicar mother and i wish you hadnt  but it was before he called me by my christian name or he would have got very little curtseying from me said mrs smith bridling and sparkling with vexation you go on at me stephen as if i were your worst enemy what else could i do with the man to get rid of him banging it into me and your father by side and by seam about his greatness and what happened when he was a young fellow at college and i dont know whatall the tongue o en flopping round his mouth like a moprag round a dairy that a did didnt he john  thats about the size ot replied her husband  every woman nowadays resumed mrs smith if she marry at all must expect a fatherinlaw of a rank lower than her father the men have gone up so and the women have stood still every man you meet is more the dand than his father and you are just level wi her  thats what she thinks herself  it only shows her sense i knew she was after ee stepheni knew it  after me good lord what next  and i really must say again that you ought not to be in such a hurry and wait for a few years you might go higher than a bankrupt pasons girl then  the fact is mother said stephen impatiently you dont know anything about it i shall never go higher because i dont want to nor should i if i lived to be a hundred as to you saying that shes after me i dont like such a remark about her for it implies a scheming woman and a man worth scheming for both of which are not only untrue but ludicrously untrue of this case isnt it so father  im afraid i dont understand the matter well enough to gie my opinion said his father in the tone of the fox who had a cold and could not smell  she couldnt have been very backward anyhow considering the short time you have known her said his mother well i think that five years hence youll be plenty young enough to think of such things and really she can very well afford to wait and will too take my word living down in an outstep place like this i am sure she ought to be very thankful that you took notice of her shed most likely have died an old maid if you hadnt turned up  all nonsense said stephen but not aloud  a nice little thing she is mrs smith went on in a more complacent tone now that stephen had been talked down theres not a word to say against her ill own i see her sometimes decked out like a horse going to fair and i admire her fort a perfect little lady but people cant help their thoughts and if shed learnt to make figures instead of letters when she was at school twould have been better for her pocket for as i said there never were worse times for such as she than now  now now mother said stephen with smiling deprecation  but i will said his mother with asperity i dont read the papers for nothing and i know men all move up a stage by marriage men of her class that is parsons marry squires daughters squires marry lords daughters lords marry dukes daughters dukes marry queens daughters all stages of gentlemen mate a stage higher and the lowest stage of gentlewomen are left single or marry out of their class  but you said just now dear mother retorted stephen unable to resist the temptation of showing his mother her inconsistency then he paused  well what did i say and mrs smith prepared her lips for a new campaign  stephen regretting that he had begun since a volcano might be the consequence was obliged to go on  you said i wasnt out of her class just before  yes there there thats you thats my own flesh and blood ill warrant that youll pick holes in everything your mother says if you can stephen you are just like your father for that take anybodys part but mine whilst i am speaking and talking and trying and slaving away for your good you are waiting to catch me out in that way so you are in her class but tis what her people would call marrying out of her class dont be so quarrelsome stephen  stephen preserved a discreet silence in which he was imitated by his father and for several minutes nothing was heard but the ticking of the greenfaced caseclock against the wall  im sure added mrs smith in a more philosophic tone and as a terminative speech if thered been so much trouble to get a husband in my time as there is in these dayswhen you must make a godalmighty of a man to get en to hae yeid have trod clay for bricks before id ever have lowered my dignity to marry or theres no bread in nine loaves  the discussion now dropped and as it was getting late stephen bade his parents farewell for the evening his mother none the less warmly for their sparring for although mrs smith and stephen were always contending they were never at enmity  and possibly said stephen i may leave here altogether tomorrow i dont know so that if i shouldnt call again before returning to london dont be alarmed will you  but didnt you come for a fortnight said his mother and havent you a months holiday altogether they are going to turn you out then  not at all i may stay longer i may go if i go you had better say nothing about my having been here for her sake at what time of the morning does the carrier pass endelstow lane  seven oclock  and then he left them his thoughts were that should the vicar permit him to become engaged to hope for an engagement or in any way to think of his beloved elfride he might stay longer should he be forbidden to think of any such thing he resolved to go at once and the latter even to young hopefulness seemed the more probable alternative  stephen walked back to the vicarage through the meadows as he had come surrounded by the soft musical purl of the water through little weirs the modest light of the moon the freshening smell of the dews outspread around it was a time when mere seeing is meditation and meditation peace stephen was hardly philosopher enough to avail himself of natures offer his constitution was made up of very simple particulars was one which rare in the springtime of civilizations seems to grow abundant as a nation gets older individuality fades and education spreads that is his brain had extraordinary receptive powers and no great creativeness quickly acquiring any kind of knowledge he saw around him and having a plastic adaptability more common in woman than in man he changed colour like a chameleon as the society he found himself in assumed a higher and more artificial tone he had not many original ideas and yet there was scarcely an idea to which under proper training he could not have added a respectable coordinate  he saw nothing outside himself tonight and what he saw within was a weariness to his flesh yet to a dispassionate observer his pretensions to elfride though rather premature were far from absurd as marriages go unless the accidental proximity of simple but honest parents could be said to make them so  the clock struck eleven when he entered the house elfride had been waiting with scarcely a movement since he departed before he had spoken to her she caught sight of him passing into the study with her father she saw that he had by some means obtained the private interview he desired  a nervous headache had been growing on the excitable girl during the absence of stephen and now she could do nothing beyond going up again to her room as she had done before instead of lying down she sat again in the darkness without closing the door and listened with a beating heart to every sound from downstairs the servants had gone to bed she ultimately heard the two men come from the study and cross to the diningroom where supper had been lingering for more than an hour the door was left open and she found that the meal such as it was passed off between her father and her lover without any remark save commonplaces as to cucumbers and melons their wholesomeness and culture uttered in a stiff and formal way it seemed to prefigure failure  shortly afterwards stephen came upstairs to his bedroom and was almost immediately followed by her father who also retired for the night not inclined to get a light she partly undressed and sat on the bed where she remained in pained thought for some time possibly an hour then rising to close her door previously to fully unrobing she saw a streak of light shining across the landing her fathers door was shut and he could be heard snoring regularly the light came from stephens room and the slight sounds also coming thence emphatically denoted what he was doing in the perfect silence she could hear the closing of a lid and the clicking of a lockhe was fastening his hatbox then the buckling of straps and the click of another keyhe was securing his portmanteau with trebled foreboding she opened her door softly and went towards his one sensation pervaded her to distraction stephen her handsome youth and darling was going away and she might never see him again except in secret and in sadnessperhaps never more at any rate she could no longer wait till the morning to hear the result of the interview as she had intended she flung her dressinggown round her tapped lightly at his door and whispered stephen he came instantly opened the door and stepped out  tell me are we to hope  he replied in a disturbed whisper and a tear approached its outlet though none fell  i am not to think of such a preposterous thingthats what he said and i am going tomorrow i should have called you up to bid you goodbye  but he didnt say you were to goo stephen he didnt say that  no not in words but i cannot stay  oh dont dont go do come and let us talk let us come down to the drawingroom for a few minutes he will hear us here  she preceded him down the staircase with the taper light in her hand looking unnaturally tall and thin in the long dovecoloured dressinggown she wore she did not stop to think of the propriety or otherwise of this midnight interview under such circumstances she thought that the tragedy of her life was beginning and for the first time almost felt that her existence might have a grave side the shade of which enveloped and rendered invisible the delicate gradations of custom and punctilio elfride softly opened the drawingroom door and they both went in when she had placed the candle on the table he enclosed her with his arms dried her eyes with his handkerchief and kissed their lids  stephen it is overhappy love is over and there is no more sunshine now  i will make a fortune and come to you and have you yes i will  papa will never hear of itnevernever you dont know him i do he is either biassed in favour of a thing or prejudiced against it argument is powerless against either feeling  no i wont think of him so said stephen if i appear before him some time hence as a man of established name he will accept mei know he will he is not a wicked man  no he is not wicked but you say some time hence as if it were no time to you among bustle and excitement it will be comparatively a short time perhaps oh to me it will be its real length trebled every summer will be a yearautumn a yearwinter a year o stephen and you may forget me  forget that was and is the real sting of waiting to fondhearted woman the remark awoke in stephen the converse fear you too may be persuaded to give me up when time has made me fainter in your memory for remember your love for me must be nourished in secret there will be no long visits from me to support you circumstances will always tend to obliterate me  stephen she said filled with her own misgivings and unheeding his last words there are beautiful women where you liveof course i know there areand they may win you away from me her tears came visibly as she drew a mental picture of his faithlessness and it wont be your fault she continued looking into the candle with doleful eyes no you will think that our family dont want you and get to include me with them and there will be a vacancy in your heart and some others will be let in  i could not i would not elfie do not be so full of forebodings  oh yes they will she replied and you will look at them not caring at first and then you will look and be interested and after a while you will think ah they know all about city life and assemblies and coteries and the manners of the titled and poor little elfie with all the fuss thats made about her having me doesnt know about anything but a little house and a few cliffs and a space of sea far away and then youll be more interested in them and theyll make you have them instead of me on purpose to be cruel to me because i am silly and they are clever and hate me and i hate them too yes i do  her impulsive words had power to impress him at any rate with the recognition of the uncertainty of all that is not accomplished and worse than that general feeling there of course remained the sadness which arose from the special features of his own case however remote a desired issue may be the mere fact of having entered the groove which leads to it cheers to some extent with a sense of accomplishment had mr swancourt consented to an engagement of no less length than ten years stephen would have been comparatively cheerful in waiting they would have felt that they were somewhere on the road to cupids garden but with a possibility of a shorter probation they had not as yet any prospect of the beginning the zero of hope had yet to be reached mr swancourt would have to revoke his formidable words before the waiting for marriage could even set in and this was despair  i wish we could marry now murmured stephen as an impossible fancy  so do i said she also as if regarding an idle dream tis the only thing that ever does sweethearts good  secretly would do would it not elfie  yes secretly would do secretly would indeed be best she said and went on reflectively all we want is to render it absolutely impossible for any future circumstance to upset our future intention of being happy together not to begin being happy now  exactly he murmured in a voice and manner the counterpart of hers to marry and part secretly and live on as we are living now merely to put it out of anybodys power to force you away from me dearest  or you away from me stephen  or me from you it is possible to conceive a force of circumstance strong enough to make any woman in the world marry against her will no conceivable pressure up to torture or starvation can make a woman once married to her lover anybody elses wife  now up to this point the idea of an immediate secret marriage had been held by both as an untenable hypothesis wherewith simply to beguile a miserable moment during a pause which followed stephens last remark a fascinating perception then an alluring conviction flashed along the brain of both the perception was that an immediate marriage could be contrived the conviction that such an act in spite of its daring its fathomless results its deceptiveness would be preferred by each to the life they must lead under any other conditions  the youth spoke first and his voice trembled with the magnitude of the conception he was cherishing how strong we should feel elfride going on our separate courses as before without the fear of ultimate separation o elfride think of it think of it  it is certain that the young girls love for stephen received a fanning from her fathers opposition which made it blaze with a dozen times the intensity it would have exhibited if left alone never were conditions more favourable for developing a girls first passing fancy for a handsome boyish facea fancy rooted in inexperience and nourished by seclusioninto a wild unreflecting passion fervid enough for anything all the elements of such a development were there the chief one being hopelessnessa necessary ingredient always to perfect the mixture of feelings united under the name of loving to distraction  we would tell papa soon would we not she inquired timidly nobody else need know he would then be convinced that hearts cannot be played with love encouraged be ready to grow love discouraged be ready to die at a moments notice stephen do you not think that if marriages against a parents consent are ever justifiable they are when young people have been favoured up to a point as we have and then have had that favour suddenly withdrawn  yes it is not as if we had from the beginning acted in opposition to your papas wishes only think elfie how pleasant he was towards me but six hours ago he liked me praised me never objected to my being alone with you  i believe he must like you now she cried and if he found that you irremediably belonged to me he would own it and help you o stephen stephen she burst out again as the remembrance of his packing came afresh to her mind i cannot bear your going away like this it is too dreadful all i have been expecting miserably killed within me like this  stephen flushed hot with impulse i will not be a doubt to youthought of you shall not be a misery to me he said we will be wife and husband before we part for long  she hid her face on his shoulder anything to make sure she whispered  i did not like to propose it immediately continued stephen it seemed to meit seems to me nowlike trying to catch youa girl better in the world than i  not that indeed and am i better in worldly station whats the use of have beens we may have been something once we are nothing now  then they whispered long and earnestly together stephen hesitatingly proposing this and that plan elfride modifying them with quick breathings and hectic flush and unnaturally bright eyes it was two oclock before an arrangement was finally concluded  she then told him to leave her giving him his light to go up to his own room they parted with an agreement not to meet again in the morning after his door had been some time closed he heard her softly gliding into her chamber     chapter xi       journeys end in lovers meeting   stephen lay watching the great bear elfride was regarding a monotonous parallelogram of window blind neither slept that night  early the next morningthat is to say four hours after their stolen interview and just as the earliest servant was heard moving aboutstephen smith went downstairs portmanteau in hand throughout the night he had intended to see mr swancourt again but the sharp rebuff of the previous evening rendered such an interview particularly distasteful perhaps there was another and less honest reason he decided to put it off whatever of moral timidity or obliquity may have lain in such a decision no perception of it was strong enough to detain him he wrote a note in his room which stated simply that he did not feel happy in the house after mr swancourts sudden veto on what he had favoured a few hours before but that he hoped a time would come and that soon when his original feelings of pleasure as mr swancourts guest might be recovered  he expected to find the downstairs rooms wearing the gray and cheerless aspect that early morning gives to everything out of the sun he found in the dining room a breakfast laid of which somebody had just partaken  stephen gave the maidservant his note of adieu she stated that mr swancourt had risen early that morning and made an early breakfast he was not going away that she knew of  stephen took a cup of coffee left the house of his love and turned into the lane it was so early that the shaded places still smelt like night time and the sunny spots had hardly felt the sun the horizontal rays made every shallow dip in the ground to show as a wellmarked hollow even the channel of the path was enough to throw shade and the very stones of the road cast tapering dashes of darkness westward as long as jaels tentnail  at a spot not more than a hundred yards from the vicars residence the lane leading thence crossed the high road stephen reached the point of intersection stood still and listened nothing could be heard save the lengthy murmuring line of the sea upon the adjacent shore he looked at his watch and then mounted a gate upon which he seated himself to await the arrival of the carrier whilst he sat he heard wheels coming in two directions  the vehicle approaching on his right he soon recognized as the carriers there were the accompanying sounds of the owners voice and the smack of his whip distinct in the still morning air by which he encouraged his horses up the hill  the other set of wheels sounded from the lane stephen had just traversed on closer observation he perceived that they were moving from the precincts of the ancient manorhouse adjoining the vicarage grounds a carriage then left the entrance gates of the house and wheeling round came fully in sight it was a plain travelling carriage with a small quantity of luggage apparently a ladys the vehicle came to the junction of the four ways halfaminute before the carrier reached the same spot and crossed directly in his front proceeding by the lane on the other side  inside the carriage stephen could just discern an elderly lady with a younger woman who seemed to be her maid the road they had taken led to stratleigh a small wateringplace sixteen miles north  he heard the manorhouse gates swing again and looking up saw another person leaving them and walking off in the direction of the parsonage ah how much i wish i were moving that way felt he parenthetically the gentleman was tall and resembled mr swancourt in outline and attire he opened the vicarage gate and went in mr swancourt then it certainly was instead of remaining in bed that morning mr swancourt must have taken it into his head to see his new neighbour off on a journey he must have been greatly interested in that neighbour to do such an unusual thing  the carriers conveyance had pulled up and stephen now handed in his portmanteau and mounted the shafts who is that lady in the carriage he inquired indifferently of lickpan the carrier  that sir is mrs troyton a widder wi a mint o money shes the owner of all that part of endelstow that is not lord luxellians only been here a short time she came into it by law the owner formerly was a terrible mysterious partynever lived herehardly ever was seen here except in the month of september as i might say  the horses were started again and noise rendered further discourse a matter of too great exertion stephen crept inside under the tilt and was soon lost in reverie  three hours and a half of straining up hills and jogging down brought them to st launces the market town and railway station nearest to endelstow and the place from which stephen smith had journeyed over the downs on the to him memorable winter evening at the beginning of the same year the carriers van was so timed as to meet a starting uptrain which stephen entered two or three hours railway travel through vertical cuttings in metamorphic rock through oak copses rich and green stretching over slopes and down delightful valleys glens and ravines sparkling with water like manyrilled ida and he plunged amid the hundred and fifty thousand people composing the town of plymouth  there being some time upon his hands he left his luggage at the cloakroom and went on foot along bedford street to the nearest church here stephen wandered among the multifarious tombstones and looked in at the chancel window dreaming of something that was likely to happen by the altar there in the course of the coming month he turned away and ascended the hoe viewed the magnificent stretch of sea and massive promontories of land but without particularly discerning one feature of the varied perspective he still saw that inner prospectthe event he hoped for in yonder church the wide sound the breakwater the lighthouse on faroff eddystone the dark steam vessels brigs barques and schooners either floating stilly or gliding with tiniest motion were as the dream then the dreamedof event was as the reality  soon stephen went down from the hoe and returned to the railway station he took his ticket and entered the london train   that day was an irksome time at endelstow vicarage neither father nor daughter alluded to the departure of stephen mr swancourts manner towards her partook of the compunctious kindness that arises from a misgiving as to the justice of some previous act  either from lack of the capacity to grasp the whole coup doeil or from a natural endowment for certain kinds of stoicism women are cooler than men in critical situations of the passive form probably in elfrides case at least it was blindness to the greater contingencies of the future she was preparing for herself which enabled her to ask her father in a quiet voice if he could give her a holiday soon to ride to st launces and go on to plymouth  now she had only once before gone alone to plymouth and that was in consequence of some unavoidable difficulty being a country girl and a good not to say a wild horsewoman it had been her delight to canter without the ghost of an attendant over the fourteen or sixteen miles of hard road intervening between their home and the station at st launces put up the horse and go on the remainder of the distance by train returning in the same manner in the evening it was then resolved that though she had successfully accomplished this journey once it was not to be repeated without some attendance  but elfride must not be confounded with ordinary young feminine equestrians the circumstances of her lonely and narrow life made it imperative that in trotting about the neighbourhood she must trot alone or else not at all usage soon rendered this perfectly natural to herself her father who had had other experiences did not much like the idea of a swancourt whose pedigree could be as distinctly traced as a thread in a skein of silk scampering over the hills like a farmers daughter even though he could habitually neglect her but what with his not being able to afford her a regular attendant and his inveterate habit of letting anything be to save himself trouble the circumstance grew customary and so there arose a chronic notion in the villagers minds that all ladies rode without an attendant like miss swancourt except a few who were sometimes visiting at lord luxellians  i dont like your going to plymouth alone particularly going to st launces on horseback why not drive and take the man  it is not nice to be so overlooked worms company would not seriously have interfered with her plans but it was her humour to go without him  when do you want to go said her father  she only answered soon  i will consider he said  only a few days elapsed before she asked again a letter had reached her from stephen it had been timed to come on that day by special arrangement between them in it he named the earliest morning on which he could meet her at plymouth her father had been on a journey to stratleigh and returned in unusual buoyancy of spirit it was a good opportunity and since the dismissal of stephen her father had been generally in a mood to make small concessions that he might steer clear of large ones connected with that outcast lover of hers  next thursday week i am going from home in a different direction said her father in fact i shall leave home the night before you might choose the same day for they wish to take up the carpets or some such thing i think as i said i dont like you to be seen in a town on horseback alone but go if you will  thursday week her father had named the very day that stephen also had named that morning as the earliest on which it would be of any use to meet her that was about fifteen days from the day on which he had left endelstow fifteen daysthat fragment of duration which has acquired such an interesting individuality from its connection with the english marriage law  she involuntarily looked at her father so strangely that on becoming conscious of the look she paled with embarrassment her father too looked confused what was he thinking of  there seemed to be a special facility offered her by a power external to herself in the circumstance that mr swancourt had proposed to leave home the night previous to her wishedfor day her father seldom took long journeys seldom slept from home except perhaps on the night following a remote visitation well she would not inquire too curiously into the reason of the opportunity nor did he as would have been natural proceed to explain it of his own accord in matters of fact there had hitherto been no reserve between them though they were not usually confidential in its full sense but the divergence of their emotions on stephens account had produced an estrangement which just at present went even to the extent of reticence on the most ordinary household topics  elfride was almost unconsciously relieved persuading herself that her fathers reserve on his business justified her in secrecy as regarded her owna secrecy which was necessarily a foregone decision with her so anxious is a young conscience to discover a palliative that the ex post facto nature of a reason is of no account in excluding it  the intervening fortnight was spent by her mostly in walking by herself among the shrubs and trees indulging sometimes in sanguine anticipations more far more frequently in misgivings all her flowers seemed dull of hue her pets seemed to look wistfully into her eyes as if they no longer stood in the same friendly relation to her as formerly she wore melancholy jewellery gazed at sunsets and talked to old men and women it was the first time that she had had an inner and private world apart from the visible one about her she wished that her father instead of neglecting her even more than usual would make some advancejust one word she would then tell all and risk stephens displeasure thus brought round to the youth again she saw him in her fancy standing touching her his eyes full of sad affection hopelessly renouncing his attempt because she had renounced hers and she could not recede  on the wednesday she was to receive another letter she had resolved to let her father see the arrival of this one be the consequences what they might the dread of losing her lover by this deed of honesty prevented her acting upon the resolve five minutes before the postmans expected arrival she slipped out and down the lane to meet him she met him immediately upon turning a sharp angle which hid her from view in the direction of the vicarage the man smilingly handed one missive and was going on to hand another a circular from some tradesman  no she said take that on to the house  why miss you are doing what your father has done for the last fortnight  she did not comprehend  why come to this corner and take a letter of me every morning all writ in the same handwriting and letting any others for him go on to the house and on the postman went  no sooner had he turned the corner behind her back than she heard her father meet and address the man she had saved her letter by two minutes her father audibly went through precisely the same performance as she had just been guilty of herself  this stealthy conduct of his was to say the least peculiar   given an impulsive inconsequent girl neglected as to her inner life by her only parent and the following forces alive within her to determine a resultant  first love acted upon by a deadly fear of separation from its object inexperience guiding onward a frantic wish to prevent the abovenamed issue misgivings as to propriety met by hope of ultimate exoneration indignation at parental inconsistency in first encouraging then forbidding a chilling sense of disobedience overpowered by a conscientious inability to brook a breaking of plighted faith with a man who in essentials had remained unaltered from the beginning a blessed hope that opposition would turn an erroneous judgement a bright faith that things would mend thereby and wind up well  probably the result would after all have been nil had not the following few remarks been made one day at breakfast  her father was in his old hearty spirits he smiled to himself at stories too bad to tell and called elfride a little scamp for surreptitiously preserving some blind kittens that ought to have been drowned after this expression she said to him suddenly  if mr smith had been already in the family you would not have been made wretched by discovering he had poor relations  do you mean in the family by marriage he replied inattentively and continuing to peel his egg  the accumulating scarlet told that was her meaning as much as the affirmative reply  i should have put up with it no doubt mr swancourt observed  so that you would not have been driven into hopeless melancholy but have made the best of him  elfrides erratic mind had from her youth upwards been constantly in the habit of perplexing her father by hypothetical questions based on absurd conditions the present seemed to be cast so precisely in the mould of previous ones that not being given to syntheses of circumstances he answered it with customary complacency  if he were allied to us irretrievably of course i or any sensible man should accept conditions that could not be altered certainly not be hopelessly melancholy about it i dont believe anything in the world would make me hopelessly melancholy and dont let anything make you so either  i wont papa she cried with a serene brightness that pleased him  certainly mr swancourt must have been far from thinking that the brightness came from an exhilarating intention to hold back no longer from the mad action she had planned  in the evening he drove away towards stratleigh quite alone it was an unusual course for him at the door elfride had been again almost impelled by her feelings to pour out all  why are you going to stratleigh papa she said and looked at him longingly  i will tell you tomorrow when i come back he said cheerily not before then elfride thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know and so far will i trust thee gentle elfride  she was repressed and hurt  i will tell you my errand to plymouth too when i come back she murmured  he went away his jocularity made her intention seem the lighter as his indifference made her more resolved to do as she liked  it was a familiar september sunset darkblue fragments of cloud upon an orangeyellow sky these sunsets used to tempt her to walk towards them as any beautiful thing tempts a near approach she went through the field to the privet hedge clambered into the middle of it and reclined upon the thick boughs after looking westward for a considerable time she blamed herself for not looking eastward to where stephen was and turned round ultimately her eyes fell upon the ground  a peculiarity was observable beneath her a green field spread itself on each side of the hedge one belonging to the glebe the other being a part of the land attached to the manorhouse adjoining on the vicarage side she saw a little footpath the distinctive and altogether exceptional feature of which consisted in its being only about ten yards long it terminated abruptly at each end  a footpath suddenly beginning and suddenly ending coming from nowhere and leading nowhere she had never seen before  yes she had on second thoughts she had seen exactly such a path trodden in the front of barracks by the sentry  and this recollection explained the origin of the path here her father had trodden it by pacing up and down as she had once seen him doing  sitting on the hedge as she sat now her eyes commanded a view of both sides of it and a few minutes later elfride looked over to the manor side  here was another sentry path it was like the first in length and it began and ended exactly opposite the beginning and ending of its neighbour but it was thinner and less distinct  two reasons existed for the difference this one might have been trodden by a similar weight of tread to the other exercised a less number of times or it might have been walked just as frequently but by lighter feet  probably a gentleman from scotlandyard had he been passing at the time might have considered the latter alternative as the more probable elfride thought otherwise so far as she thought at all but her own great tomorrow was now imminent all thoughts inspired by casual sights of the eye were only allowed to exercise themselves in inferior corners of her brain previously to being banished altogether  elfride was at length compelled to reason practically upon her undertaking all her definite perceptions thereon when the emotion accompanying them was abstracted amounted to no more than these  say an hour and threequarters to ride to st launces  say half an hour at the falcon to change my dress  say two hours waiting for some train and getting to plymouth  say an hour to spare before twelve oclock  total time from leaving endelstow till twelve oclock five hours  therefore i shall have to start at seven   no surprise or sense of unwontedness entered the minds of the servants at her early ride the monotony of life we associate with people of small incomes in districts out of the sound of the railway whistle has one exception which puts into shade the experience of dwellers about the great centres of populationthat is in travelling every journey there is more or less an adventure adventurous hours are necessarily chosen for the most commonplace outing miss elfride had to leave earlythat was all  elfride never went out on horseback but she brought home somethingsomething found or something bought if she trotted to town or village her burden was books if to hills woods or the seashore it was wonderful mosses abnormal twigs a handkerchief of wet shells or seaweed  once in muddy weather when pansy was walking with her down the street of castle boterel on a fairday a packet in front of her and a packet under her arm an accident befell the packets and they slipped down on one side of her three volumes of fiction lay kissing the mud on the other numerous skeins of polychromatic wools lay absorbing it unpleasant women smiled through windows at the mishap the men all looked round and a boy who was minding a gingerbread stall whilst the owner had gone to get drunk laughed loudly the blue eyes turned to sapphires and the cheeks crimsoned with vexation  after that misadventure she set her wits to work and was ingenious enough to invent an arrangement of small straps about the saddle by which a great deal could be safely carried thereon in a small compass here she now spread out and fastened a plain dark walkingdress and a few other trifles of apparel worm opened the gate for her and she vanished away  one of the brightest mornings of late summer shone upon her the heather was at its purplest the furze at its yellowest the grasshoppers chirped loud enough for birds the snakes hissed like little engines and elfride at first felt lively sitting at ease upon pansy in her orthodox ridinghabit and nondescript hat she looked what she felt but the mercury of those days had a trick of falling unexpectedly first only for one minute in ten had she a sense of depression then a large cloud that had been hanging in the north like a black fleece came and placed itself between her and the sun it helped on what was already inevitable and she sank into a uniformity of sadness  she turned in the saddle and looked back they were now on an open tableland whose altitude still gave her a view of the sea by endelstow she looked longingly at that spot  during this little revulsion of feeling pansy had been still advancing and elfride felt it would be absurd to turn her little mares head the other way still she thought if i had a mamma at home i would go back  and making one of those stealthy movements by which women let their hearts juggle with their brains she did put the horses head about as if unconsciously and went at a handgallop towards home for more than a mile by this time from the inveterate habit of valuing what we have renounced directly the alternative is chosen the thought of her forsaken stephen recalled her and she turned about and cantered on to st launces again  this miserable strife of thought now began to rage in all its wildness overwrought and trembling she dropped the rein upon pansys shoulders and vowed she would be led whither the horse would take her  pansy slackened her pace to a walk and walked on with her agitated burden for three or four minutes at the expiration of this time they had come to a little byway on the right leading down a slope to a pool of water the pony stopped looked towards the pool and then advanced and stooped to drink  elfride looked at her watch and discovered that if she were going to reach st launces early enough to change her dress at the falcon and get a chance of some early train to plymouththere were only two availableit was necessary to proceed at once  she was impatient it seemed as if pansy would never stop drinking and the repose of the pool the idle motions of the insects and flies upon it the placid waving of the flags the leafskeletons like genoese filigree placidly sleeping at the bottom by their contrast with her own turmoil made her impatience greater  pansy did turn at last and went up the slope again to the highroad the pony came upon it and stood crosswise looking up and down elfrides heart throbbed erratically and she thought horses if left to themselves make for where they are best fed pansy will go home  pansy turned and walked on towards st launces  pansy at home during summer had little but grass to live on after a run to st launces she always had a feed of corn to support her on the return journey therefore being now more than half way she preferred st launces  but elfride did not remember this now all she cared to recognize was a dreamy fancy that todays rash action was not her own she was disabled by her moods and it seemed indispensable to adhere to the programme so strangely involved are motives that more than by her promise to stephen more even than by her love she was forced on by a sense of the necessity of keeping faith with herself as promised in the inane vow of ten minutes ago  she hesitated no longer pansy went like the steed of adonis as if she told the steps presently the quaint gables and jumbled roofs of st launces were spread beneath her and going down the hill she entered the courtyard of the falcon mrs buckle the landlady came to the door to meet her  the swancourts were well known here the transition from equestrian to the ordinary guise of railway travellers had been more than once performed by father and daughter in this establishment  in less than a quarter of an hour elfride emerged from the door in her walking dress and went to the railway she had not told mrs buckle anything as to her intentions and was supposed to have gone out shopping  an hour and forty minutes later and she was in stephens arms at the plymouth station not upon the platformin the secret retreat of a deserted waitingroom  stephens face boded ill he was pale and despondent  what is the matter she asked  we cannot be married here today my elfie i ought to have known it and stayed here in my ignorance i did not i have the licence but it can only be used in my parish in london i only came down last night as you know  what shall we do she said blankly  theres only one thing we can do darling  whats that  go on to london by a train just starting and be married there tomorrow  passengers for the 115 uptrain take their seats said a guards voice on the platform  will you go elfride  i will  in three minutes the train had moved off bearing away with it stephen and elfride     chapter xii       adieu she cries and waved her lily hand   the few tattered clouds of the morning enlarged and united the sun withdrew behind them to emerge no more that day and the evening drew to a close in drifts of rain the waterdrops beat like duck shot against the window of the railwaycarriage containing stephen and elfride  the journey from plymouth to paddington by even the most headlong express allows quite enough leisure for passion of any sort to cool elfrides excitement had passed off and she sat in a kind of stupor during the latter half of the journey she was aroused by the clanging of the maze of rails over which they traced their way at the entrance to the station  is this london she said  yes darling said stephen in a tone of assurance he was far from feeling to him no less than to her the reality so greatly differed from the prefiguring  she peered out as well as the window beaded with drops would allow her and saw only the lamps which had just been lit blinking in the wet atmosphere and rows of hideous zinc chimneypipes in dim relief against the sky she writhed uneasily as when a thought is swelling in the mind which must cause much pain at its deliverance in words elfride had known no more about the stings of evil report than the native wildfowl knew of the effects of crusoes first shot now she saw a little further and a little further still  the train stopped stephen relinquished the soft hand he had held all the day and proceeded to assist her on to the platform  this act of alighting upon strange ground seemed all that was wanted to complete a resolution within her  she looked at her betrothed with despairing eyes  o stephen she exclaimed i am so miserable i must go home againi musti must forgive my wretched vacillation i dont like it herenor myselfnor you  stephen looked bewildered and did not speak  will you allow me to go home she implored i wont trouble you to go with me i will not be any weight upon you only say you will agree to my returning that you will not hate me for it stephen it is better that i should return again indeed it is stephen  but we cant return now he said in a deprecatory tone  i must i will  how when do you want to go  now can we go at once  the lad looked hopelessly along the platform  if you must go and think it wrong to remain dearest said he sadly you shall you shall do whatever you like my elfride but would you in reality rather go now than stay till tomorrow and go as my wife  yes yesmuchanything to go now i must i must she cried  we ought to have done one of two things he answered gloomily never to have started or not to have returned without being married i dont like to say it elfrideindeed i dont but you must be told this that going back unmarried may compromise your good name in the eyes of people who may hear of it  they will not and i must go  o elfride i am to blame for bringing you away  not at all i am the elder  by a month and whats that but never mind that now he looked around is there a train for plymouth tonight he inquired of a guard the guard passed on and did not speak  is there a train for plymouth tonight said elfride to another  yes miss the 810leaves in ten minutes you have come to the wrong platform it is the other side change at bristol into the night mail down that staircase and under the line  they ran down the staircaseelfride firstto the bookingoffice and into a carriage with an official standing beside the door show your tickets please they are locked inmen about the platform accelerate their velocities till they fly up and down like shuttles in a looma whistlethe waving of a flaga human crya steam groanand away they go to plymouth again just catching these words as they glide off  those two youngsters had a near run for it and no mistake  elfride found her breath  and have you come too stephen why did you  i shall not leave you till i see you safe at st launces do not think worse of me than i am elfride  and then they rattled along through the night back again by the way they had come the weather cleared and the stars shone in upon them their two or three fellowpassengers sat for most of the time with closed eyes stephen sometimes slept elfride alone was wakeful and palpitating hour after hour  the day began to break and revealed that they were by the sea red rocks overhung them and receding into distance grew livid in the blue grey atmosphere the sun rose and sent penetrating shafts of light in upon their weary faces another hour and the world began to be busy they waited yet a little and the train slackened its speed in view of the platform at st launces  she shivered and mused sadly  i did not see all the consequences she said appearances are wofully against me if anybody finds me out i am i suppose disgraced  then appearances will speak falsely and how can that matter even if they do i shall be your husband sooner or later for certain and so prove your purity  stephen once in london i ought to have married you she said firmly it was my only safe defence i see more things now than i did yesterday my only remaining chance is not to be discovered and that we must fight for most desperately  they stepped out elfride pulled a thick veil over her face  a woman with red and scaly eyelids and glistening eyes was sitting on a bench just inside the officedoor she fixed her eyes upon elfride with an expression whose force it was impossible to doubt but the meaning of which was not clear then upon the carriage they had left she seemed to read a sinister story in the scene  elfride shrank back and turned the other way  who is that woman said stephen she looked hard at you  mrs jethwaya widow and mother of that young man whose tomb we sat on the other night stephen she is my enemy would that god had had mercy enough upon me to have hidden this from her  do not talk so hopelessly he remonstrated i dont think she recognized us  i pray that she did not  he put on a more vigorous mood  now we will go and get some breakfast  no no she begged i cannot eat i must get back to endelstow  elfride was as if she had grown years older than stephen now  but you have had nothing since last night but that cup of tea at bristol  i cant eat stephen  wine and biscuit  no  nor tea nor coffee  no  a glass of water  no i want something that makes people strong and energetic for the present that borrows the strength of tomorrow for use todayleaving tomorrow without any at all for that matter or even that would take all life away tomorrow so long as it enabled me to get home again now brandy thats what i want that womans eyes have eaten my heart away  you are wild and you grieve me darling must it be brandy  yes if you please  how much  i dont know i have never drunk more than a teaspoonful at once all i know is that i want it dont get it at the falcon  he left her in the fields and went to the nearest inn in that direction presently he returned with a small flask nearly full and some slices of breadandbutter thin as wafers in a paperbag elfride took a sip or two  it goes into my eyes she said wearily i cant take any more yes i will i will close my eyes ah it goes to them by an inside route i dont want it throw it away  however she could eat and did eat her chief attention was concentrated upon how to get the horse from the falcon stables without suspicion stephen was not allowed to accompany her into the town she acted now upon conclusions reached without any aid from him his power over her seemed to have departed  you had better not be seen with me even here where i am so little known we have begun stealthily as thieves and we must end stealthily as thieves at all hazards until papa has been told by me myself a discovery would be terrible  walking and gloomily talking thus they waited till nearly nine oclock at which time elfride thought she might call at the falcon without creating much surprise behind the railwaystation was the river spanned by an old tudor bridge whence the road diverged in two directions one skirting the suburbs of the town and winding round again into the highroad to endelstow beside this road stephen sat and awaited her return from the falcon  he sat as one sitting for a portrait motionless watching the chequered lights and shades on the treetrunks the children playing opposite the school previous to entering for the morning lesson the reapers in a field afar off the certainty of possession had not come and there was nothing to mitigate the youths gloom that increased with the thought of the parting now so near  at length she came trotting round to him in appearance much as on the romantic morning of their visit to the cliff but shorn of the radiance which glistened about her then however her comparative immunity from further risk and trouble had considerably composed her elfrides capacity for being wounded was only surpassed by her capacity for healing which rightly or wrongly is by some considered an index of transientness of feeling in general  elfride what did they say at the falcon  nothing nobody seemed curious about me they knew i went to plymouth and i have stayed there a night now and then with miss bicknell i rather calculated upon that  and now parting arose like a death to these children for it was imperative that she should start at once stephen walked beside her for nearly a mile during the walk he said sadly  elfride fourandtwenty hours have passed and the thing is not done  but you have insured that it shall be done  how have i  o stephen you ask how do you think i could marry another man on earth after having gone thus far with you have i not shown beyond possibility of doubt that i can be nobody elses have i not irretrievably committed myselfpride has stood for nothing in the face of my great love you misunderstood my turning back and i cannot explain it it was wrong to go with you at all and though it would have been worse to go further it would have been better policy perhaps be assured of this that whenever you have a home for mehowever poor and humbleand come and claim me i am ready she added bitterly when my father knows of this days work he may be only too glad to let me go  perhaps he may then insist upon our marriage at once stephen answered seeing a ray of hope in the very focus of her remorse i hope he may even if we had still to part till i am ready for you as we intended  elfride did not reply  you dont seem the same woman elfie that you were yesterday  nor am i but goodbye go back now and she reined the horse for parting o stephen she cried i feel so weak i dont know how to meet him cannot you after all come back with me  shall i come  elfride paused to think  no it will not do it is my utter foolishness that makes me say such words but he will send for you  say to him continued stephen that we did this in the absolute despair of our minds tell him we dont wish him to favour usonly to deal justly with us if he says marry now so much the better if not say that all may be put right by his promise to allow me to have you when i am good enough for youwhich may be soon say i have nothing to offer him in exchange for his treasurethe more sorry i but all the love and all the life and all the labour of an honest man shall be yours as to when this had better be told i leave you to judge  his words made her cheerful enough to toy with her position  and if ill report should come stephen she said smiling why the orangetree must save me as it saved virgins in st georges time from the poisonous breath of the dragon there forgive me for forwardness i am going  then the boy and girl beguiled themselves with words of halfparting only  own wifie god bless you till we meet again  till we meet again goodbye  and the pony went on and she spoke to him no more he saw her figure diminish and her blue veil grow graysaw it with the agonizing sensations of a slow death  after thus parting from a man than whom she had known none greater as yet elfride rode rapidly onwards a tear being occasionally shaken from her eyes into the road what yesterday had seemed so desirable so promising even trifling had now acquired the complexion of a tragedy  she saw the rocks and sea in the neighbourhood of endelstow and heaved a sigh of relief  when she passed a field behind the vicarage she heard the voices of unity and william worm they were hanging a carpet upon a line unity was uttering a sentence that concluded with when miss elfride comes  when dye expect her  not till evening now shes safe enough at miss bicknells bless ye  elfride went round to the door she did not knock or ring and seeing nobody to take the horse elfride led her round to the yard slipped off the bridle and saddle drove her towards the paddock and turned her in then elfride crept indoors and looked into all the groundfloor rooms her father was not there  on the mantelpiece of the drawingroom stood a letter addressed to her in his handwriting she took it and read it as she went upstairs to change her habit   stratleigh thursday  dear elfrideon second thoughts i will not return today but only come as far as wadcombe i shall be at home by tomorrow afternoon and bring a friend with meyours in haste  c s   after making a quick toilet she felt more revived though still suffering from a headache on going out of the door she met unity at the top of the stair  o miss elfride i said to myself tis her sperrit we didnt dream o you not coming home last night you didnt say anything about staying  i intended to come home the same evening but altered my plan i wished i hadnt afterwards papa will be angry i suppose  better not tell him miss said unity  i do fear to she murmured unity would you just begin telling him when he comes home  what and get you into trouble  i deserve it  no indeed i wont said unity it is not such a mighty matter miss elfride i says to myself masters taking a hollerday and because hes not been kind lately to miss elfride she  is imitating him well do as you like and will you now bring me some luncheon  after satisfying an appetite which the fresh marine air had given her in its victory over an agitated mind she put on her hat and went to the garden and summerhouse she sat down and leant with her head in a corner here she fell asleep  halfawake she hurriedly looked at the time she had been there three hours at the same moment she heard the outer gate swing together and wheels sweep round the entrance some prior noise from the same source having probably been the cause of her awaking next her fathers voice was heard calling to worm  elfride passed along a walk towards the house behind a belt of shrubs she heard a tongue holding converse with her father which was not that of either of the servants her father and the stranger were laughing together then there was a rustling of silk and mr swancourt and his companion or companions to all seeming entered the door of the house for nothing more of them was audible elfride had turned back to meditate on what friends these could be when she heard footsteps and her father exclaiming behind her  o elfride here you are i hope you got on well  elfrides heart smote her and she did not speak  come back to the summerhouse a minute continued mr swancourt i have to tell you of that i promised to  they entered the summerhouse and stood leaning over the knotty woodwork of the balustrade  now said her father radiantly guess what i have to say he seemed to be regarding his own existence so intently that he took no interest in nor even saw the complexion of hers  i cannot papa she said sadly  try dear  i would rather not indeed  you are tired you look worn the ride was too much for you well this is what i went away for i went to be married  married she faltered and could hardly check an involuntary so did i a moment after and her resolve to confess perished like a bubble  yes to whom do you think mrs troyton the new owner of the estate over the hedge and of the old manorhouse it was only finally settled between us when i went to stratleigh a few days ago he lowered his voice to a sly tone of merriment now as to your stepmother youll find she is not much to look at though a good deal to listen to she is twenty years older than myself for one thing  you forget that i know her she called here once after we had been and found her away from home  of course of course well whatever her looks are shes as excellent a woman as ever breathed she has had lately left her as absolute property three thousand five hundred a year besides the devise of this estateand by the way a large legacy came to her in satisfaction of dower as it is called  three thousand five hundred a year  and a largewell a fairsizedmansion in town and a pedigree as long as my walkingstick though that bears evidence of being rather a rakedup affairdone since the family got richpeople do those things now as they build ruins on maiden estates and cast antiques at birmingham  elfride merely listened and said nothing  he continued more quietly and impressively yes elfride she is wealthy in comparison with us though with few connections however she will introduce you to the world a little we are going to exchange her house in baker street for one at kensington for your sake everybody is going there now she says at easters we shall fly to town for the usual three monthsi shall have a curate of course by that time elfride i am past love you know and i honestly confess that i married her for your sake why a woman of her standing should have thrown herself away upon me god knows but i suppose her age and plainness were too pronounced for a town man with your good looks if you now play your cards well you may marry anybody of course a little contrivance will be necessary but theres nothing to stand between you and a husband with a title that i can see lady luxellian was only a squires daughter now dont you see how foolish the old fancy was but come she is indoors waiting to see you it is as good as a play too continued the vicar as they walked towards the house i courted her through the privet hedge yonder not entirely you know but we used to walk there of an eveningnearly every evening at last but i neednt tell you details now everything was terribly matteroffact i assure you at last that day i saw her at stratleigh we determined to settle it offhand  and you never said a word to me replied elfride not reproachfully either in tone or thought indeed her feeling was the very reverse of reproachful she felt relieved and even thankful where confidence had not been given how could confidence be expected  her father mistook her dispassionateness for a veil of politeness over a sense of illusage i am not altogether to blame he said there were two or three reasons for secrecy one was the recent death of her relative the testator though that did not apply to you but remember elfride he continued in a stiffer tone you had mixed yourself up so foolishly with those low people the smithsand it was just too when mrs troyton and myself were beginning to understand each otherthat i resolved to say nothing even to you how did i know how far you had gone with them and their son you might have made a point of taking tea with them every day for all that i knew  elfride swallowed her feelings as she best could and languidly though flatly asked a question  did you kiss mrs troyton on the lawn about three weeks ago that evening i came into the study and found you had just had candles in  mr swancourt looked rather red and abashed as middleaged lovers are apt to do when caught in the tricks of younger ones  well yes i think i did he stammered just to please her you know and then recovering himself he laughed heartily  and was this what your horatian quotation referred to  it was elfride  they stepped into the drawingroom from the verandah at that moment mrs swancourt came downstairs and entered the same room by the door  here charlotte is my little elfride said mr swancourt with the increased affection of tone often adopted towards relations when newly produced  poor elfride not knowing what to do did nothing at all but stood receptive of all that came to her by sight hearing and touch  mrs swancourt moved forward took her stepdaughters hand then kissed her  ah darling she exclaimed goodhumouredly you didnt think when you showed a strange old woman over the conservatory a month or two ago and explained the flowers to her so prettily that she would so soon be here in new colours nor did she i am sure  the new mother had been truthfully enough described by mr swancourt she was not physically attractive she was darkvery darkin complexion portly in figure and with a plentiful residuum of hair in the proportion of half a dozen white ones to half a dozen black ones though the latter were black indeed no further observed she was not a woman to like but there was more to see to the most superficial critic it was apparent that she made no attempt to disguise her age she looked sixty at the first glance and close acquaintanceship never proved her older  another and still more winning trait was one attaching to the corners of her mouth before she made a remark these often twitched gently not backwards and forwards the index of nervousness not down upon the jaw the sign of determination but palpably upwards in precisely the curve adopted to represent mirth in the broad caricatures of schoolboys only this element in her face was expressive of anything within the woman but it was unmistakable it expressed humour subjective as well as objectivewhich could survey the peculiarities of self in as whimsical a light as those of other people  this is not all of mrs swancourt she had held out to elfride hands whose fingers were literally stiff with rings signis auroque rigentes like helens robe these rows of rings were not worn in vanity apparently they were mostly antique and dull though a few were the reverse   right hand  1st plainly set oval onyx representing a devils head 2nd green jasper intaglio with red veins 3rd entirely gold bearing figure of a hideous griffin 4th a seagreen monster diamond with small diamonds round it 5th antique cornelian intaglio of dancing figure of a satyr 6th an angular band chased with dragons heads 7th a facetted carbuncle accompanied by ten little twinkling emeralds c c   left hand  1st a reddishyellow toadstone 2nd a heavy ring enamelled in colours and bearing a jacynth 3rd an amethystine sapphire 4th a polished ruby surrounded by diamonds 5th the engraved ring of an abbess 6th a gloomy intaglio c c   beyond this rather quaint array of stone and metal mrs swancourt wore no ornament whatever  elfride had been favourably impressed with mrs troyton at their meeting about two months earlier but to be pleased with a woman as a momentary acquaintance was different from being taken with her as a stepmother however the suspension of feeling was but for a moment elfride decided to like her still  mrs swancourt was a woman of the world as to knowledge the reverse as to action as her marriage suggested elfride and the lady were soon inextricably involved in conversation and mr swancourt left them to themselves  and what do you find to do with yourself here mrs swancourt said after a few remarks about the wedding you ride i know  yes i ride but not much because papa doesnt like my going alone  you must have somebody to look after you  and i read and write a little  you should write a novel the regular resource of people who dont go enough into the world to live a novel is to write one  i have done it said elfride looking dubiously at mrs swancourt as if in doubt whether she would meet with ridicule there  thats right now then what is it about dear  aboutwell it is a romance of the middle ages  knowing nothing of the present age which everybody knows about for safety you chose an age known neither to you nor other people thats it eh no no i dont mean it dear  well i have had some opportunities of studying mediaeval art and manners in the library and private museum at endelstow house and i thought i should like to try my hand upon a fiction i know the time for these tales is past but i was interested in it very much interested  when is it to appear  oh never i suppose  nonsense my dear girl publish it by all means all ladies do that sort of thing now not for profit you know but as a guarantee of mental respectability to their future husbands  an excellent idea of us ladies  though i am afraid it rather resembles the melancholy ruse of throwing loaves over castlewalls at besiegers and suggests desperation rather than plenty inside  did you ever try it  no i was too far gone even for that  papa says no publisher will take my book  that remains to be proved ill give my word my dear that by this time next year it shall be printed  will you indeed said elfride partially brightening with pleasure though she was sad enough in her depths i thought brains were the indispensable even if the only qualification for admission to the republic of letters a mere commonplace creature like me will soon be turned out again  oh no once you are there youll be like a drop of water in a piece of rockcrystalyour medium will dignify your commonness  it will be a great satisfaction elfride murmured and thought of stephen and wished she could make a great fortune by writing romances and marry him and live happily  and then well go to london and then to paris said mrs swancourt i have been talking to your father about it but we have first to move into the manorhouse and we think of staying at torquay whilst that is going on meanwhile instead of going on a honeymoon scamper by ourselves we have come home to fetch you and go all together to bath for two or three weeks  elfride assented pleasantly even gladly but she saw that by this marriage her father and herself had ceased for ever to be the close relations they had been up to a few weeks ago it was impossible now to tell him the tale of her wild elopement with stephen smith  he was still snugly housed in her heart his absence had regained for him much of that aureola of saintship which had been nearly abstracted during her reproachful mood on that miserable journey from london rapture is often cooled by contact with its cause especially if under awkward conditions and that last experience with stephen had done anything but make him shine in her eyes his very kindness in letting her return was his offence elfride had her sexs love of sheer force in a man however illdirected and at that critical juncture in london stephens only chance of retaining the ascendancy over her that his face and not his parts had acquired for him would have been by doing what for one thing he was too youthful to undertakethat was dragging her by the wrist to the rails of some altar and peremptorily marrying her decisive action is seen by appreciative minds to be frequently objectless and sometimes fatal but decision however suicidal has more charm for a woman than the most unequivocal fabian success  however some of the unpleasant accessories of that occasion were now out of sight again and stephen had resumed not a few of his fancy colours     chapter xiii       he set in order many proverbs   it is london in octobertwo months further on in the story  bedes inn has this peculiarity that it faces receives from and discharges into a bustling thoroughfare speaking only of wealth and respectability whilst its postern abuts on as crowded and povertystricken a network of alleys as are to be found anywhere in the metropolis the moral consequences are first that those who occupy chambers in the inn may see a great deal of shirtless humanitys habits and enjoyments without doing more than look down from a back window and second they may hear wholesome though unpleasant social reminders through the medium of a harsh voice an unequal footstep the echo of a blow or a fall which originates in the person of some drunkard or wifebeater as he crosses and interferes with the quiet of the square characters of this kind frequently pass through the inn from a little foxhole of an alley at the back but they never loiter there  it is hardly necessary to state that all the sights and movements proper to the inn are most orderly on the fine october evening on which we follow stephen smith to this place a placid porter is sitting on a stool under a sycamoretree in the midst with a little cane in his hand we notice the thick coat of soot upon the branches hanging underneath them in flakes as in a chimney the blackness of these boughs does not at present improve the treenearly forsaken by its leaves as it isbut in the spring their green fresh beauty is made doubly beautiful by the contrast within the railings is a flowergarden of respectable dahlias and chrysanthemums where a man is sweeping the leaves from the grass  stephen selects a doorway and ascends an old though wide wooden staircase with moulded balusters and handrail which in a country manorhouse would be considered a noteworthy specimen of renaissance workmanship he reaches a door on the first floor over which is painted in black letters mr henry knightbarristeratlaw being understood but not expressed the wall is thick and there is a door at its outer and inner face the outer one happens to be ajar stephen goes to the other and taps  come in from distant penetralia  first was a small anteroom divided from the inner apartment by a wainscoted archway two or three yards wide across this archway hung a pair of darkgreen curtains making a mystery of all within the arch except the spasmodic scratching of a quill pen here was grouped a chaotic assemblage of articlesmainly old framed prints and paintingsleaning edgewise against the wall like roofing slates in a builders yard all the books visible here were folios too big to be stolensome lying on a heavy oak table in one corner some on the floor among the pictures the whole intermingled with old coats hats umbrellas and walkingsticks  stephen pushed aside the curtain and before him sat a man writing away as if his life depended upon itwhich it did  a man of thirty in a speckled coat with dark brown hair curly beard and crisp moustache the latter running into the beard on each side of the mouth and as usual hiding the real expression of that organ under a chronic aspect of impassivity  ah my dear fellow i knew twas you said knight looking up with a smile and holding out his hand  knights mouth and eyes came to view now both features were good and had the peculiarity of appearing younger and fresher than the brow and face they belonged to which were getting sicklied oer by the unmistakable pale cast the mouth had not quite relinquished rotundity of curve for the firm angularities of middle life and the eyes though keen permeated rather than penetrated what they had lost of their boytime brightness by a dozen years of hard reading lending a quietness to their gaze which suited them well  a lady would have said there was a smell of tobacco in the room a man that there was not  knight did not rise he looked at a timepiece on the mantelshelf then turned again to his letters pointing to a chair  well i am glad you have come i only returned to town yesterday now dont speak stephen for ten minutes i have just that time to the late post at the eleventh minute im your man  stephen sat down as if this kind of reception was by no means new and away went knights pen beating up and down like a ship in a storm  cicero called the library the soul of the house here the house was all soul portions of the floor and half the wallspace were taken up by bookshelves ordinary and extraordinary the remaining parts together with brackets sidetables c being occupied by casts statuettes medallions and plaques of various descriptions picked up by the owner in his wanderings through france and italy  one stream only of evening sunlight came into the room from a window quite in the corner overlooking a court an aquarium stood in the window it was a dull parallelopipedon enough for living creatures at most hours of the day but for a few minutes in the evening as now an errant kindly ray lighted up and warmed the little world therein when the manycoloured zoophytes opened and put forth their arms the weeds acquired a rich transparency the shells gleamed of a more golden yellow and the timid community expressed gladness more plainly than in words  within the prescribed ten minutes knight flung down his pen rang for the boy to take the letters to the post and at the closing of the door exclaimed there thank god thats done now stephen pull your chair round and tell me what you have been doing all this time have you kept up your greek  no  hows that  i havent enough spare time  thats nonsense  well i have done a great many things if not that and i have done one extraordinary thing  knight turned full upon stephen ahha now then let me look into your face put two and two together and make a shrewd guess  stephen changed to a redder colour  why smith said knight after holding him rigidly by the shoulders and keenly scrutinising his countenance for a minute in silence you have fallen in love  wellthe fact is  now out with it but seeing that stephen looked rather distressed he changed to a kindly tone now smith my lad you know me well enough by this time or you ought to and you know very well that if you choose to give me a detailed account of the phenomenon within you i shall listen if you dont i am the last man in the world to care to hear it  ill tell this much i have fallen in love and i want to be married  knight looked ominous as this passed stephens lips  dont judge me before you have heard more cried stephen anxiously seeing the change in his friends countenance  i dont judge does your mother know about it  nothing definite  father  no but ill tell you the young person  come thats dreadfully ungallant but perhaps i understand the frame of mind a little so go on your sweetheart  she is rather higher in the world than i am  as it should be  and her father wont hear of it as i now stand  not an uncommon case  and now comes what i want your advice upon something has happened at her house which makes it out of the question for us to ask her father again now so we are keeping silent in the meantime an architect in india has just written to mr hewby to ask whether he can find for him a young assistant willing to go over to bombay to prepare drawings for work formerly done by the engineers the salary he offers is 350 rupees a month or about 35 pounds hewby has mentioned it to me and i have been to dr wray who says i shall acclimatise without much illness now would you go  you mean to say because it is a possible road to the young lady  yes i was thinking i could go over and make a little money and then come back and ask for her i have the option of practising for myself after a year  would she be staunch  oh yes for everto the end of her life  how do you know  why how do people know of course she will  knight leant back in his chair now though i know her thoroughly as she exists in your heart stephen i dont know her in the flesh all i want to ask is is this idea of going to india based entirely upon a belief in her fidelity  yes i should not go if it were not for her  well stephen you have put me in rather an awkward position if i give my true sentiments i shall hurt your feelings if i dont i shall hurt my own judgment and remember i dont know much about women  but you have had attachments although you tell me very little about them  and i only hope youll continue to prosper till i tell you more  stephen winced at this rap i have never formed a deep attachment continued knight i never have found a woman worth it nor have i been once engaged to be married  you write as if you had been engaged a hundred times if i may be allowed to say so said stephen in an injured tone  yes that may be but my dear stephen it is only those who half know a thing that write about it those who know it thoroughly dont take the trouble all i know about women or men either is a mass of generalities i plod along and occasionally lift my eyes and skim the weltering surface of mankind lying between me and the horizon as a crow might no more  knight stopped as if he had fallen into a train of thought and stephen looked with affectionate awe at a master whose mind he believed could swallow up at one meal all that his own head contained  there was affective sympathy but no great intellectual fellowship between knight and stephen smith knight had seen his young friend when the latter was a cherrycheeked happy boy had been interested in him had kept his eye upon him and generously helped the lad to books till the mere connection of patronage grew to acquaintance and that ripened to friendship and so though smith was not at all the man knight would have deliberately chosen as a friendor even for one of a group of a dozen friendshe somehow was his friend circumstance as usual did it all how many of us can say of our most intimate alter ego leaving alone friends of the outer circle that he is the man we should have chosen as embodying the net result after adding up all the points in human nature that we love and principles we hold and subtracting all that we hate the man is really somebody we got to know by mere physical juxtaposition long maintained and was taken into our confidence and even heart as a makeshift  and what do you think of her stephen ventured to say after a silence  taking her merits on trust from you said knight as we do those of the roman poets of whom we know nothing but that they lived i still think she will not stick to you through say three years of absence in india  but she will cried stephen desperately she is a girl all delicacy and honour and no woman of that kind who has committed herself so into a mans hands as she has into mine could possibly marry another  how has she committed herself asked knight cunously  stephen did not answer knight had looked on his love so sceptically that it would not do to say all that he had intended to say by any means  well dont tell said knight but you are begging the question which is i suppose inevitable in love  and ill tell you another thing the younger man pleaded you remember what you said to me once about women receiving a kiss dont you why that instead of our being charmed by the fascination of their bearing at such a time we should immediately doubt them if their confusion has any grace in itthat awkward bungling was the true charm of the occasion implying that we are the first who has played such a part with them  it is true quite said knight musingly  it often happened that the disciple thus remembered the lessons of the master long after the master himself had forgotten them  well that was like her cried stephen triumphantly she was in such a flurry that she didnt know what she was doing  splendid splendid said knight soothingly so that all i have to say is that if you see a good opening in bombay theres no reason why you should not go without troubling to draw fine distinctions as to reasons no man fully realizes what opinions he acts upon or what his actions mean  yes i go to bombay ill write a note here if you dont mind  sleep over itit is the best planand write tomorrow meantime go there to that window and sit down and look at my humanity show i am going to dine out this evening and have to dress here out of my portmanteau i bring up my things like this to save the trouble of going down to my place at richmond and back again  knight then went to the middle of the room and flung open his portmanteau and stephen drew near the window the streak of sunlight had crept upward edged away and vanished the zoophytes slept a dusky gloom pervaded the room and now another volume of light shone over the window  there said knight where is there in england a spectacle to equal that i sit there and watch them every night before i go home softly open the sash  beneath them was an alley running up to the wall and thence turning sideways and passing under an arch so that knights back window was immediately over the angle and commanded a view of the alley lengthwise crowdsmostly of womenwere surging bustling and pacing up and down gaslights glared from butchers stalls illuminating the lumps of flesh to splotches of orange and vermilion like the wild colouring of turners later pictures whilst the purl and babble of tongues of every pitch and mood was to this human wildwood what the ripple of a brook is to the natural forest  nearly ten minutes passed then knight also came to the window  well now i call a cab and vanish down the street in the direction of berkeley square he said buttoning his waistcoat and kicking his morning suit into a corner stephen rose to leave  what a heap of literature remarked the young man taking a final longing survey round the room as if to abide there for ever would be the great pleasure of his life yet feeling that he had almost outstayed his welcomewhile his eyes rested upon an armchair piled full of newspapers magazines and bright new volumes in green and red  yes said knight also looking at them and breathing a sigh of weariness something must be done with several of them soon i suppose stephen you neednt hurry away for a few minutes you know if you want to stay i am not quite ready overhaul those volumes whilst i put on my coat and ill walk a little way with you  stephen sat down beside the armchair and began to tumble the books about among the rest he found a novelette in one volume the court of kellyon castle by ernest field  are you going to review this inquired stephen with apparent unconcern and holding up elfrides effusion  which oh that i maythough i dont do much light reviewing now but it is reviewable  how do you mean  knight never liked to be asked what he meant mean i mean that the majority of books published are neither good enough nor bad enough to provoke criticism and that that book does provoke it  by its goodness or its badness stephen said with some anxiety on poor little elfrides score  its badness it seems to be written by some girl in her teens  stephen said not another word he did not care to speak plainly of elfride after that unfortunate slip his tongue had made in respect of her having committed herself and apart from that knights severealmost dogged and selfwilledhonesty in criticizing was unassailable by the humble wish of a youthful friend like stephen  knight was now ready turning off the gas and slamming together the door they went downstairs and into the street     chapter xiv       we frolic while tis may   it has now to be realized that nearly threequarters of a year have passed away in place of the autumnal scenery which formed a setting to the previous enactments we have the culminating blooms of summer in the year following  stephen is in india slaving away at an office in bombay occasionally going up the country on professional errands and wondering why people who had been there longer than he complained so much of the effect of the climate upon their constitutions never had a young man a finer start than seemed now to present itself to stephen it was just in that exceptional heyday of prosperity which shone over bombay some few years ago that he arrived on the scene building and engineering partook of the general impetus speculation moved with an accelerated velocity every successive day the only disagreeable contingency connected with it being the possibility of a collapse  elfride had never told her father of the fourandtwentyhours escapade with stephen nor had it to her knowledge come to his ears by any other route it was a secret trouble and grief to the girl for a short time and stephens departure was another ingredient in her sorrow but elfride possessed special facilities for getting rid of trouble after a decent interval whilst a slow nature was imbibing a misfortune little by little she had swallowed the whole agony of it at a draught and was brightening again she could slough off a sadness and replace it by a hope as easily as a lizard renews a diseased limb  and two such excellent distractions had presented themselves one was bringing out the romance and looking for notices in the papers which though they had been significantly short so far had served to divert her thoughts the other was migrating from the vicarage to the more commodious old house of mrs swancourts overlooking the same valley mr swancourt at first disliked the idea of being transplanted to feminine soil but the obvious advantages of such an accession of dignity reconciled him to the change so there was a radical move the two ladies staying at torquay as had been arranged the vicar going to and fro  mrs swancourt considerably enlarged elfrides ideas in an aristocratic direction and she began to forgive her father for his politic marriage certainly in a worldly sense a handsome face at threeandforty had never served a man in better stead   the new house at kensington was ready and they were all in town  the hyde park shrubs had been transplanted as usual the chairs ranked in line the grass edgings trimmed the roads made to look as if they were suffering from a heavy thunderstorm carriages had been called for by the easeful horses by the brisk and the drive and row were again the groove of gaiety for an hour we gaze upon the spectacle at six oclock on this midsummer afternoon in a melonframe atmosphere and beneath a violet sky the swancourt equipage formed one in the stream  mrs swancourt was a talker of talk of the incisive kind which her low musical voicethe only beautiful point in the old womanprevented from being wearisome  now she said to elfride who like aeneas at carthage was full of admiration for the brilliant scene you will find that our companionless state will give us as it does everybody an extraordinary power in reading the features of our fellowcreatures here i always am a listener in such places as thesenot to the narratives told by my neighbours tongues but by their facesthe advantage of which is that whether i am in row boulevard rialto or prado they all speak the same language i may have acquired some skill in this practice through having been an ugly lonely woman for so many years with nobody to give me information a thing you will not consider strange when the parallel case is borne in mindhow truly people who have no clocks will tell the time of day  ay that they will said mr swancourt corroboratively i have known labouring men at endelstow and other farms who had framed complete systems of observation for that purpose by means of shadows winds clouds the movements of sheep and oxen the singing of birds the crowing of cocks and a hundred other sights and sounds which people with watches in their pockets never know the existence of they are able to pronounce within ten minutes of the hour almost at any required instant that reminds me of an old story which im afraid is too badtoo bad to repeat here the vicar shook his head and laughed inwardly  tell itdo said the ladies  i mustnt quite tell it  thats absurd said mrs swancourt  it was only about a man who by the same careful system of observation was known to deceive persons for more than two years into the belief that he kept a barometer by stealth so exactly did he foretell all changes in the weather by the braying of his ass and the temper of his wife  elfride laughed  exactly said mrs swancourt and in just the way that those learnt the signs of nature i have learnt the language of her illegitimate sisterartificiality and the fibbing of eyes the contempt of nosetips the indignation of back hair the laughter of clothes the cynicism of footsteps and the various emotions lying in walkingstick twirls hatliftings the elevation of parasols the carriage of umbrellas become as a b c to me  just look at that daughters sister class of mamma in the carriage across there she continued to elfride pointing with merely a turn of her eye the absorbing selfconsciousness of her position that is shown by her countenance is most humiliating to a lover of ones country you would hardly believe would you that members of a fashionable world whose professed zero is far above the highest degree of the humble could be so ignorant of the elementary instincts of reticence  how  why to bear on their faces as plainly as on a phylactery the inscription do pray look at the coronet on my panels  really charlotte said the vicar you see as much in faces as mr puff saw in lord burleighs nod  elfride could not but admire the beauty of her fellow countrywomen especially since herself and her own few acquaintances had always been slightly sunburnt or marked on the back of the hands by a bramblescratch at this time of the year  and what lovely flowers and leaves they wear in their bonnets she exclaimed  oh yes returned mrs swancourt some of them are even more striking in colour than any real ones look at that beautiful rose worn by the lady inside the rails elegant vinetendrils introduced upon the stem as an improvement upon prickles and all growing so naturally just over her eari say growing advisedly for the pink of the petals and the pink of her handsome cheeks are equally from natures hand to the eyes of the most casual observer  but praise them a little they do deserve it said generous elfride  well i do see how the duchess ofwaves to and fro in her seat utilizing the sway of her landau by looking around only when her head is swung forward with a passive pride which forbids a resistance to the force of circumstance look at the pretty pout on the mouths of that family there retaining no traces of being arranged beforehand so well is it done look at the demure close of the little fists holding the parasols the tiny alert thumb sticking up erect against the ivory stem as knowing as can be the satin of the parasol invariably matching the complexion of the face beneath it yet seemingly by an accident which makes the thing so attractive theres the red book lying on the opposite seat bespeaking the vast numbers of their acquaintance and i particularly admire the aspect of that abundantly daughtered woman on the other sidei mean her look of unconsciousness that the girls are stared at by the walkers and above all the look of the girls themselveslosing their gaze in the depths of handsome mens eyes without appearing to notice whether they are observing masculine eyes or the leaves of the trees theres praise for you but i am only jesting childyou know that  piphphphhow warm it is to be sure said mr swancourt as if his mind were a long distance from all he saw i declare that my watch is so hot that i can scarcely bear to touch it to see what the time is and all the world smells like the inside of a hat  how the men stare at you elfride said the elder lady you will kill me quite i am afraid  kill you  as a diamond kills an opal in the same setting  i have noticed several ladies and gentlemen looking at me said elfride artlessly showing her pleasure at being observed  my dear you mustnt say gentlemen nowadays her stepmother answered in the tones of arch concern that so well became her ugliness we have handed over gentlemen to the lower middle class where the word is still to be heard at tradesmens balls and provincial teaparties i believe it is done with here  what must i say then  ladies and men always  at this moment appeared in the stream of vehicles moving in the contrary direction a chariot presenting in its general surface the rich indigo hue of a midnight sky the wheels and margins being picked out in delicate lines of ultramarine the servants liveries were darkblue coats and silver lace and breeches of neutral indian red the whole concern formed an organic whole and moved along behind a pair of dark chestnut geldings who advanced in an indifferently zealous trot very daintily performed and occasionally shrugged divers points of their veiny surface as if they were rather above the business  in this sat a gentleman with no decided characteristics more than that he somewhat resembled a goodnatured commercial traveller of the superior class beside him was a lady with skimmilky eyes and complexion belonging to the interesting class of women where that class merges in the sickly her greatest pleasure being apparently to enjoy nothing opposite this pair sat two little girls in white hats and blue feathers  the lady saw elfride smiled and bowed and touched her husbands elbow who turned and received elfrides movement of recognition with a gallant elevation of his hat then the two children held up their arms to elfride and laughed gleefully  who is that  why lord luxellian isnt it said mrs swancourt who with the vicar had been seated with her back towards them  yes replied elfride he is the one man of those i have seen here whom i consider handsomer than papa  thank you dear said mr swancourt  yes but your father is so much older when lord luxellian gets a little further on in life he wont be half so goodlooking as our man  thank you dear likewise said mr swancourt  see exclaimed elfride still looking towards them how those little dears want me actually one of them is crying for me to come  we were talking of bracelets just now look at lady luxellians said mrs swancourt as that baroness lifted up her arm to support one of the children it is slipping up her armtoo large by half i hate to see daylight between a bracelet and a wrist i wonder women havent better taste  it is not on that account indeed elfride expostulated it is that her arm has got thin poor thing you cannot think how much she has altered in this last twelvemonth  the carriages were now nearer together and there was an exchange of more familiar greetings between the two families then the luxellians crossed over and drew up under the planetrees just in the rear of the swancourts lord luxellian alighted and came forward with a musical laugh  it was his attraction as a man people liked him for those tones and forgot that he had no talents acquaintances remembered mr swancourt by his manner they remembered stephen smith by his face lord luxellian by his laugh  mr swancourt made some friendly remarksamong others things upon the heat  yes said lord luxellian we were driving by a furriers window this afternoon and the sight filled us all with such a sense of suffocation that we were glad to get away haha he turned to elfride miss swancourt i have hardly seen or spoken to you since your literary feat was made public i had no idea a chiel was taking notes down at quiet endelstow or i should certainly have put myself and friends upon our best behaviour swancourt why didnt you give me a hint  elfride fluttered blushed laughed said it was nothing to speak of c c  well i think you were rather unfairly treated by the present i certainly do writing a heavy review like that upon an elegant trifle like the court of kellyon castle was absurd  what said elfride opening her eyes was i reviewed in the present  oh yes didnt you see it why it was four or five months ago  no i never saw it how sorry i am what a shame of my publishers they promised to send me every notice that appeared  ah then i am almost afraid i have been giving you disagreeable information intentionally withheld out of courtesy depend upon it they thought no good would come of sending it and so would not pain you unnecessarily  oh no i am indeed glad you have told me lord luxellian it is quite a mistaken kindness on their part is the review so much against me she inquired tremulously  no no not that exactlythough i almost forget its exact purport now it was merelymerely sharp you knowungenerous i might say but really my memory does not enable me to speak decidedly  well drive to the present office and get one directly shall we papa  if you are so anxious dear we will or send but tomorrow will do  and do oblige me in a little matter now elfride said lord luxellian warmly and looking as if he were sorry he had brought news that disturbed her i am in reality sent here as a special messenger by my little polly and katie to ask you to come into our carriage with them for a short time i am just going to walk across into piccadilly and my wife is left alone with them i am afraid they are rather spoilt children but i have half promised them you shall come  the steps were let down and elfride was transferredto the intense delight of the little girls and to the mild interest of loungers with red skins and long necks who cursorily eyed the performance with their walkingsticks to their lips occasionally laughing from far down their throats and with their eyes their mouths not being concerned in the operation at all lord luxellian then told the coachman to drive on lifted his hat smiled a smile that missed its mark and alighted on a total stranger who bowed in bewilderment lord luxellian looked long at elfride  the look was a manly open and genuine look of admiration a momentary tribute of a kind which any honest englishman might have paid to fairness without being ashamed of the feeling or permitting it to encroach in the slightest degree upon his emotional obligations as a husband and head of a family then lord luxellian turned away and walked musingly to the upper end of the promenade  mr swancourt had alighted at the same time with elfride crossing over to the row for a few minutes to speak to a friend he recognized there and his wife was thus left sole tenant of the carriage  now whilst this little act had been in course of performance there stood among the promenading spectators a man of somewhat different description from the rest behind the general throng in the rear of the chairs and leaning against the trunk of a tree he looked at elfride with quiet and critical interest  three points about this unobtrusive person showed promptly to the exercised eye that he was not a row man pur sang first an irrepressible wrinkle or two in the waist of his frockcoatdenoting that he had not damned his tailor sufficiently to drive that tradesman up to the orthodox high pressure of cunning workmanship second a slight slovenliness of umbrella occasioned by its owners habit of resting heavily upon it and using it as a veritable walkingstick instead of letting its point touch the ground in the most coquettish of kisses as is the proper row manner to do third and chief reason that try how you might you could scarcely help supposing on looking at his face that your eyes were not far from a wellfinished mind instead of the wellfinished skin et praeterea nihil which is by rights the mark of the row  the probability is that had not mrs swancourt been left alone in her carriage under the tree this man would have remained in his unobserved seclusion but seeing her thus he came round to the front stooped under the rail and stood beside the carriagedoor  mrs swancourt looked reflectively at him for a quarter of a minute then held out her hand laughingly  why henry knightof course it is mysecondthirdfourth cousinwhat shall i say at any rate my kinsman  yes one of a remnant not yet cut off i scarcely was certain of you either from where i was standing  i have not seen you since you first went to oxford consider the number of years you know i suppose of my marriage  and there sprang up a dialogue concerning family matters of birth death and marriage which it is not necessary to detail knight presently inquired  the young lady who changed into the other carriage is then your stepdaughter  yes elfride you must know her  and who was the lady in the carriage elfride entered who had an illdefined and watery look as if she were only the reflection of herself in a pool  lady luxellian very weakly elfride says my husband is remotely connected with them but there is not much intimacy on account of however henry youll come and see us of course 24 chevron square come this week we shall only be in town a week or two longer  let me see ive got to run up to oxford tomorrow where i shall be for several days so that i must i fear lose the pleasure of seeing you in london this year  then come to endelstow why not return with us  i am afraid if i were to come before august i should have to leave again in a day or two i should be delighted to be with you at the beginning of that month and i could stay a nice long time i have thought of going westward all the summer  very well now remember thats a compact and wont you wait now and see mr swancourt he will not be away ten minutes longer  no ill beg to be excused for i must get to my chambers again this evening before i go home indeed i ought to have been there nowi have such a press of matters to attend to just at present you will explain to him please goodbye  and let us know the day of your appearance as soon as you can  i will     chapter xv      a wandering voice   though sheer and intelligible griefs are not charmed away by being confided to mere acquaintances the process is a palliative to certain illhumours among these perplexed vexation is onea species of trouble which like a stream gets shallower by the simple operation of widening it in any quarter  on the evening of the day succeeding that of the meeting in the park elfride and mrs swancourt were engaged in conversation in the dressingroom of the latter such a treatment of such a case was in course of adoption here  elfride had just before received an affectionate letter from stephen smith in bombay which had been forwarded to her from endelstow but since this is not the case referred to it is not worth while to pry further into the contents of the letter than to discover that with rash though pardonable confidence in coming times he addressed her in high spirits as his darling future wife probably there cannot be instanced a briefer and surer ruleofthumb test of a mans temperamentsanguine or cautiousthan this did he or does he antedate the word wife in corresponding with a sweetheart he honestly loves  she had taken this epistle into her own room read a little of it then saved the rest for tomorrow not wishing to be so extravagant as to consume the pleasure all at once nevertheless she could not resist the wish to enjoy yet a little more so out came the letter again and in spite of misgivings as to prodigality the whole was devoured the letter was finally reperused and placed in her pocket  what was this also a newspaper for elfride which she had overlooked in her hurry to open the letter it was the old number of the present containing the article upon her book forwarded as had been requested  elfride had hastily read it through shrunk perceptibly smaller and had then gone with the paper in her hand to mrs swancourts dressingroom to lighten or at least modify her vexation by a discriminating estimate from her stepmother  she was now looking disconsolately out of the window  never mind my child said mrs swancourt after a careful perusal of the matter indicated i dont see that the review is such a terrible one after all besides everybody has forgotten about it by this time im sure the opening is good enough for any book ever written just listenit sounds better read aloud than when you pore over it silently the court of kellyon castle a romance of the middle ages by ernest field in the belief that we were for a while escaping the monotonous repetition of wearisome details in modern social scenery analyses of uninteresting character or the unnatural unfoldings of a sensation plot we took this volume into our hands with a feeling of pleasure we were disposed to beguile ourselves with the fancy that some new change might possibly be rung upon donjon keeps chain and plate armour deeply scarred cheeks tender maidens disguised as pages to which we had not listened long ago now thats a very good beginning in my opinion and one to be proud of having brought out of a man who has never seen you  ah yes murmured elfride wofully but then see further on  well the next bit is rather unkind i must own said mrs swancourt and read on instead of this we found ourselves in the hands of some young lady hardly arrived at years of discretion to judge by the silly device it has been thought worth while to adopt on the titlepage with the idea of disguising her sex  i am not silly said elfride indignantly he might have called me anything but that  you are not indeed wellhands of a young ladywhose chapters are simply devoted to impossible tournaments towers and escapades which read like flat copies of like scenes in the stories of mr g p r james and the most unreal portions of ivanhoe the bait is so palpably artificial that the most credulous gudgeon turns away now my dear i dont see overmuch to complain of in that it proves that you were clever enough to make him think of sir walter scott which is a great deal  oh yes though i cannot romance myself i am able to remind him of those who can elfride intended to hurl these words sarcastically at her invisible enemy but as she had no more satirical power than a woodpigeon they merely fell in a pretty murmur from lips shaped to a pout  certainly and thats something your book is good enough to be bad in an ordinary literary manner and doesnt stand by itself in a melancholy position altogether worse than assailablethat interest in an historical romance may nowadays have any chance of being sustained it is indispensable that the reader find himself under the guidance of some nearly extinct species of legendary who in addition to an impulse towards antiquarian research and an unweakened faith in the mediaeval halo shall possess an inventive faculty in which delicacy of sentiment is far overtopped by a power of welding to stirring incident a spirited variety of the elementary human passions well that longwinded effusion doesnt refer to you at all elfride merely something put in to fill up let me see when does he come to you againnot till the very end actually here you are finally polished off  but to return to the little work we have used as the text of this article we are far from altogether disparaging the authors powers she has a certain versatility that enables her to use with effect a style of narration peculiar to herself which may be called a murmuring of delicate emotional trifles the particular gift of those to whom the social sympathies of a peaceful time are as daily food hence where matters of domestic experience and the natural touches which make people real can be introduced without anachronisms too striking she is occasionally felicitous and upon the whole we feel justified in saying that the book will bear looking into for the sake of those portions which have nothing whatever to do with the story  well i suppose it is intended for satire but dont think anything more of it now my dear it is seven oclock and mrs swancourt rang for her maid  attack is more piquant than concord stephens letter was concerning nothing but oneness with her the review was the very reverse and a stranger with neither name nor shape age nor appearance but a mighty voice is naturally rather an interesting novelty to a lady he chooses to address when elfride fell asleep that night she was loving the writer of the letter but thinking of the writer of that article     chapter xvi       then fancy shapesas fancy can   on a day about three weeks later the swancourt trio were sitting quietly in the drawingroom of the crags mrs swancourts house at endelstow chatting and taking easeful survey of their previous month or two of towna tangible weariness even to people whose acquaintances there might be counted on the fingers  a mere season in london with her practised stepmother had so advanced elfrides perceptions that her courtship by stephen seemed emotionally meagre and to have drifted back several years into a childish past in regarding our mental experiences as in visual observation our own progress reads like a dwindling of that we progress from  she was seated on a low chair looking over her romance with melancholy interest for the first time since she had become acquainted with the remarks of the present thereupon  still thinking of that reviewer elfie  not of him personally but i am thinking of his opinion really on looking into the volume after this long time has elapsed he seems to have estimated one part of it fairly enough  no no i wouldnt show the white feather now fancy that of all people in the world the writer herself should go over to the enemy how shall monmouths men fight when monmouth runs away  i dont do that but i think he is right in some of his arguments though wrong in others and because he has some claim to my respect i regret all the more that he should think so mistakenly of my motives in one or two instances it is more vexing to be misunderstood than to be misrepresented and he misunderstands me i cannot be easy whilst a person goes to rest night after night attributing to me intentions i never had  he doesnt know your name or anything about you and he has doubtless forgotten there is such a book in existence by this time  i myself should certainly like him to be put right upon one or two matters said the vicar who had hitherto been silent you see critics go on writing and are never corrected or argued with and therefore are never improved  papa said elfride brightening write to him  i would as soon write to him as look at him for the matter of that said mr swancourt  do and say the young person who wrote the book did not adopt a masculine pseudonym in vanity or conceit but because she was afraid it would be thought presumptuous to publish her name and that she did not mean the story for such as he but as a sweetener of history for young people who might thereby acquire a taste for what went on in their own country hundreds of years ago and be tempted to dive deeper into the subject oh there is so much to explain i wish i might write myself  now elfie ill tell you what we will do answered mr swancourt tickled with a sort of bucolic humour at the idea of criticizing the critic you shall write a clear account of what he is wrong in and i will copy it and send it as mine  yes now directly said elfride jumping up when will you send it papa  oh in a day or two i suppose he returned then the vicar paused and slightly yawned and in the manner of elderly people began to cool from his ardour for the undertaking now that it came to the point but really it is hardly worth while he said  o papa said elfride with much disappointment you said you would and now you wont that is not fair  but how can we send it if we dont know whom to send it to  if you really want to send such a thing it can easily be done said mrs swancourt coming to her stepdaughters rescue an envelope addressed to the critic of the court of kellyon castle care of the editor of the present would find him  yes i suppose it would  why not write your answer yourself elfride mrs swancourt inquired  i might she said hesitatingly and send it anonymously that would be treating him as he has treated me  no use in the world  but i dont like to let him know my exact name suppose i put my initials only the less you are known the more you are thought of  yes you might do that  elfride set to work there and then her one desire for the last fortnight seemed likely to be realized as happens with sensitive and secluded minds a continual dwelling upon the subject had magnified to colossal proportions the space she assumed herself to occupy or to have occupied in the occult critics mind at noon and at night she had been pestering herself with endeavours to perceive more distinctly his conception of her as a woman apart from an author whether he really despised her whether he thought more or less of her than of ordinary young women who never ventured into the fire of criticism at all now she would have the satisfaction of feeling that at any rate he knew her true intent in crossing his path and annoying him so by her performance and be taught perhaps to despise it a little less  four days later an envelope directed to miss swancourt in a strange hand made its appearance from the postbag  oh said elfride her heart sinking within her can it be from that mana lecture for impertinence and actually one for mrs swancourt in the same handwriting she feared to open hers yet how can he know my name no it is somebody else  nonsense said her father grimly you sent your initials and the directory was available though he wouldnt have taken the trouble to look there unless he had been thoroughly savage with you i thought you wrote with rather more asperity than simple literary discussion required this timely clause was introduced to save the character of the vicars judgment under any issue of affairs  well here i go said elfride desperately tearing open the seal  to be sure of course exclaimed mrs swancourt and looking up from her own letter christopher i quite forgot to tell you when i mentioned that i had seen my distant relative harry knight that i invited him here for whatever length of time he could spare and now he says he can come any day in august  write and say the first of the month replied the indiscriminate vicar  she read on goodness meand that isnt all he is actually the reviewer of elfrides book how absurd to be sure i had no idea he reviewed novels or had anything to do with the present he is a barristerand i thought he only wrote in the quarterlies why elfride you have brought about an odd entanglement what does he say to you  elfride had put down her letter with a dissatisfied flush on her face i dont know the idea of his knowing my name and all about mewhy he says nothing particular only this   my dear madamthough i am sorry that my remarks should have seemed harsh to you it is a pleasure to find that they have been the means of bringing forth such an ingeniously argued reply unfortunately it is so long since i wrote my review that my memory does not serve me sufficiently to say a single word in my defence even supposing there remains one to be said which is doubtful you will find from a letter i have written to mrs swancourt that we are not such strangers to each other as we have been imagining possibly i may have the pleasure of seeing you soon when any argument you choose to advance shall receive all the attention it deserves   that is dim sarcasmi know it is  oh no elfride  and then his remarks didnt seem harshi mean i did not say so  he thinks you are in a frightful temper said mr swancourt chuckling in undertones  and he will come and see me and find the authoress as contemptible in speech as she has been impertinent in manner i do heartily wish i had never written a word to him  never mind said mrs swancourt also laughing in low quiet jerks it will make the meeting such a comical affair and afford splendid byplay for your father and myself the idea of our running our heads against harry knight all the time i cannot get over that  the vicar had immediately remembered the name to be that of stephen smiths preceptor and friend but having ceased to concern himself in the matter he made no remark to that effect consistently forbearing to allude to anything which could restore recollection of the to him disagreeable mistake with regard to poor stephens lineage and position elfride had of course perceived the same thing which added to the complication of relationship a mesh that her stepmother knew nothing of  the identification scarcely heightened knights attractions now though a twelvemonth ago she would only have cared to see him for the interest he possessed as stephens friend fortunately for knights advent such a reason for welcome had only begun to be awkward to her at a time when the interest he had acquired on his own account made it no longer necessary   these coincidences in common with all relating to him tended to keep elfrides mind upon the stretch concerning knight as was her custom when upon the horns of a dilemma she walked off by herself among the laurel bushes and there standing still and splitting up a leaf without removing it from its stalk fetched back recollections of stephens frequent words in praise of his friend and wished she had listened more attentively then still pulling the leaf she would blush at some fancied mortification that would accrue to her from his words when they met in consequence of her intrusiveness as she now considered it in writing to him  the next development of her meditations was the subject of what this mans personal appearance might bewas he tall or short dark or fair gay or grim she would have asked mrs swancourt but for the risk she might thereby incur of some teasing remark being returned ultimately elfride would say oh what a plague that reviewer is to me and turn her face to where she imagined india lay and murmur to herself ah my little husband what are you doing now let me see where are yousouth east where behind that hill ever so far behind     chapter xvii       her welcome spoke in faltering phrase   there is henry knight i declare said mrs swancourt one day  they were gazing from the jutting angle of a wild enclosure not far from the crags which almost overhung the valley already described as leading up from the sea and little port of castle boterel the stony escarpment upon which they stood had the contour of a mans face and it was covered with furze as with a beard people in the field above were preserved from an accidental roll down these prominences and hollows by a hedge on the very crest which was doing that kindly service for elfride and her mother now  scrambling higher into the hedge and stretching her neck further over the furze elfride beheld the individual signified he was walking leisurely along the little green path at the bottom beside the stream a satchel slung upon his left hip a stout walkingstick in his hand and a brownholland sunhat upon his head the satchel was worn and old and the outer polished surface of the leather was cracked and peeling off  knight having arrived over the hills to castle boterel upon the top of a crazy omnibus preferred to walk the remaining two miles up the valley leaving his luggage to be brought on  behind him wandered helterskelter a boy of whom knight had briefly inquired the way to endelstow and by that natural law of physics which causes lesser bodies to gravitate towards the greater this boy had kept near to knight and trotted like a little dog close at his heels whistling as he went with his eyes fixed upon knights boots as they rose and fell  when they had reached a point precisely opposite that in which mrs and miss swancourt lay in ambush knight stopped and turned round  look here my boy he said  the boy parted his lips opened his eyes and answered nothing  heres sixpence for you on condition that you dont again come within twenty yards of my heels all the way up the valley  the boy who apparently had not known he had been looking at knights heels at all took the sixpence mechanically and knight went on again wrapt in meditation  a nice voice elfride thought but what a singular temper  now we must get indoors before he ascends the slope said mrs swancourt softly and they went across by a short cut over a stile entering the lawn by a side door and so on to the house  mr swancourt had gone into the village with the curate and elfride felt too nervous to await their visitors arrival in the drawingroom with mrs swancourt so that when the elder lady entered elfride made some pretence of perceiving a new variety of crimson geranium and lingered behind among the flower beds  there was nothing gained by this after all she thought and a few minutes after boldly came into the house by the glass sidedoor she walked along the corridor and entered the drawingroom nobody was there  a window at the angle of the room opened directly into an octagonal conservatory enclosing the corner of the building from the conservatory came voices in conversationmrs swancourts and the strangers  she had expected him to talk brilliantly to her surprise he was asking questions in quite a learners manner on subjects connected with the flowers and shrubs that she had known for years when after the lapse of a few minutes he spoke at some length she considered there was a hard square decisiveness in the shape of his sentences as if unlike her own and stephens they were not there and then newly constructed but were drawn forth from a large store readymade they were now approaching the window to come in again  that is a fleshcoloured variety said mrs swancourt but oleanders though they are such bulky shrubs are so very easily wounded as to be unprunablegiants with the sensitiveness of young ladies oh here is elfride  elfride looked as guilty and crestfallen as lady teazle at the dropping of the screen mrs swancourt presented him half comically and knight in a minute or two placed himself beside the young lady  a complexity of instincts checked elfrides conventional smiles of complaisance and hospitality and to make her still less comfortable mrs swancourt immediately afterwards left them together to seek her husband mr knight however did not seem at all incommoded by his feelings and he said with light easefulness  so miss swancourt i have met you at last you escaped me by a few minutes only when we were in london  yes i found that you had seen mrs swancourt  and now reviewer and reviewed are face to face he added unconcernedly  yes though the fact of your being a relation of mrs swancourts takes off the edge of it it was strange that you should be one of her family all the time elfride began to recover herself now and to look into knights face i was merely anxious to let you know my real meaning in writing the bookextremely anxious  i can quite understand the wish and i was gratified that my remarks should have reached home they very seldom do i am afraid  elfride drew herself in here he was sticking to his opinions as firmly as if friendship and politeness did not in the least require an immediate renunciation of them  you made me very uneasy and sorry by writing such things she murmured suddenly dropping the mere cacueterie of a fashionable first introduction and speaking with some of the dudgeon of a child towards a severe schoolmaster  that is rather the object of honest critics in such a case not to cause unnecessary sorrow but to make you sorry after a proper manner that ye may receive damage by us in nothing as a powerful pen once wrote to the gentiles are you going to write another romance  write another she said that somebody may pen a condemnation and nailt wi scripture again as you do now mr knight  you may do better next time he said placidly i think you will but i would advise you to confine yourself to domestic scenes  thank you but never again  well you may be right that a young woman has taken to writing is not by any means the best thing to hear about her  what is the best  i prefer not to say  do you know then do tell me please  wellknight was evidently changing his meaningi suppose to hear that she has married  elfride hesitated and what when she has been married she said at last partly in order to withdraw her own person from the argument  then to hear no more about her it is as smeaton said of his lighthouse her greatest real praise when the novelty of her inauguration has worn off is that nothing happens to keep the talk of her alive  yes i see said elfride softly and thoughtfully but of course it is different quite with men why dont you write novels mr knight  because i couldnt write one that would interest anybody  why  for several reasons it requires a judicious omission of your real thoughts to make a novel popular for one thing  is that really necessary well i am sure you could learn to do that with practice said elfride with an excathedra air as became a person who spoke from experience in the art you would make a great name for certain she continued  so many people make a name nowadays that it is more distinguished to remain in obscurity  tell me seriouslyapart from the subjectwhy dont you write a volume instead of loose articles she insisted  since you are pleased to make me talk of myself i will tell you seriously said knight not less amused at this catechism by his young friend than he was interested in her appearance as i have implied i have not the wish and if i had the wish i could not now concentrate sufficiently we all have only our one cruse of energy given us to make the best of and where that energy has been leaked away week by week quarter by quarter as mine has for the last nine or ten years there is not enough dammed back behind the mill at any given period to supply the force a complete book on any subject requires then there is the selfconfidence and waiting power where quick results have grown customary they are fatal to a lively faith in the future  yes i comprehend and so you choose to write in fragments  no i dont choose to do it in the sense you mean choosing from a whole world of professions all possible it was by the constraint of accident merely not that i object to the accident  why dont you objecti mean why do you feel so quiet about things elfride was half afraid to question him so but her intense curiosity to see what the inside of literary mr knight was like kept her going on  knight certainly did not mind being frank with her instances of this trait in men who are not without feeling but are reticent from habit may be recalled by all of us when they find a listener who can by no possibility make use of them rival them or condemn them reserved and even suspicious men of the world become frank keenly enjoying the inner side of their frankness  why i dont mind the accidental constraint he replied is because in making beginnings a chance limitation of direction is often better than absolute freedom  i seethat is i should if i quite understood what all those generalities mean  why this that an arbitrary foundation for ones work which no length of thought can alter leaves the attention free to fix itself on the work itself and make the best of it  lateral compression forcing altitude as would be said in that tongue she said mischievously and i suppose where no limit exists as in the case of a rich man with a wide taste who wants to do something it will be better to choose a limit capriciously than to have none  yes he said meditatively i can go as far as that  well resumed elfride i think it better for a mans nature if he does nothing in particular  there is such a case as being obliged to  yes yes i was speaking of when you are not obliged for any other reason than delight in the prospect of fame i have thought many times lately that a thin widespread happiness commencing now and of a piece with the days of your life is preferable to an anticipated heap far away in the future and none now  why thats the very thing i said just now as being the principle of all ephemeral doers like myself  oh i am sorry to have parodied you she said with some confusion yes of course that is what you meant about not trying to be famous and she added with the quickness of conviction characteristic of her mind there is much littleness in trying to be great a man must think a good deal of himself and be conceited enough to believe in himself before he tries at all  but it is soon enough to say there is harm in a mans thinking a good deal of himself when it is proved he has been thinking wrong and too soon then sometimes besides we should not conclude that a man who strives earnestly for success does so with a strong sense of his own merit he may see how little success has to do with merit and his motive may be his very humility  this manner of treating her rather provoked elfride no sooner did she agree with him than he ceased to seem to wish it and took the other side ah she thought inwardly i shall have nothing to do with a man of this kind though he is our visitor  i think you will find resumed knight pursuing the conversation more for the sake of finishing off his thoughts on the subject than for engaging her attention that in actual life it is merely a matter of instinct with menthis trying to push on they awake to a recognition that they have without premeditation begun to try a little and they say to themselves since i have tried thus much i will try a little more they go on because they have begun  elfride in her turn was not particularly attending to his words at this moment she had unconsciously to herself a way of seizing any point in the remarks of an interlocutor which interested her and dwelling upon it and thinking thoughts of her own thereupon totally oblivious of all that he might say in continuation on such occasions she artlessly surveyed the person speaking and then there was a time for a painter her eyes seemed to look at you and past you as you were then into your future and past your future into your eternitynot reading it but gazing in an unused unconscious wayher mind still clinging to its original thought  this is how she was looking at knight  suddenly elfride became conscious of what she was doing and was painfully confused  what were you so intent upon in me he inquired  as far as i was thinking of you at all i was thinking how clever you are she said with a want of premeditation that was startling in its honesty and simplicity  feeling restless now that she had so unwittingly spoken she arose and stepped to the window having heard the voices of her father and mrs swancourt coming up below the terrace here they are she said going out knight walked out upon the lawn behind her she stood upon the edge of the terrace close to the stone balustrade and looked towards the sun hanging over a glade just now fair as tempes vale up which her father was walking  knight could not help looking at her the sun was within ten degrees of the horizon and its warm light flooded her face and heightened the bright rose colour of her cheeks to a vermilion red their moderate pink hue being only seen in its natural tone where the cheek curved round into shadow the ends of her hanging hair softly dragged themselves backwards and forwards upon her shoulder as each faint breeze thrust against or relinquished it fringes and ribbons of her dress moved by the same breeze licked like tongues upon the parts around them and fluttering forward from shady folds caught likewise their share of the lustrous orange glow  mr swancourt shouted out a welcome to knight from a distance of about thirty yards and after a few preliminary words proceeded to a conversation of deep earnestness on knights fine old family name and theories as to lineage and intermarriage connected therewith knights portmanteau having in the meantime arrived they soon retired to prepare for dinner which had been postponed two hours later than the usual time of that meal  an arrival was an event in the life of elfride now that they were again in the country and that of knight necessarily an engrossing one and that evening she went to bed for the first time without thinking of stephen at all     chapter xviii       he heard her musical pants   the old tower of west endelstow church had reached the last weeks of its existence it was to be replaced by a new one from the designs of mr hewby the architect who had sent down stephen planks and poles had arrived in the churchyard iron bars had been thrust into the venerable crack extending down the belfry wall to the foundation the bells had been taken down the owls had forsaken this home of their forefathers and six iconoclasts in white fustian to whom a cracked edifice was a species of mumbo jumbo had taken lodgings in the village previous to beginning the actual removal of the stones  this was the day after knights arrival to enjoy for the last time the prospect seaward from the summit the vicar mrs swancourt knight and elfride all ascended the winding turretmr swancourt stepping forward with many loud breaths his wife struggling along silently but suffering none the less they had hardly reached the top when a large lurid cloud palpably a reservoir of rain thunder and lightning was seen to be advancing overhead from the north  the two cautious elders suggested an immediate return and proceeded to put it in practice as regarded themselves  dear me i wish i had not come up exclaimed mrs swancourt  we shall be slower than you two in going down the vicar said over his shoulder and so dont you start till we are nearly at the bottom or you will run over us and break our necks somewhere in the darkness of the turret  accordingly elfride and knight waited on the leads till the staircase should be clear knight was not in a talkative mood that morning elfride was rather wilful by reason of his inattention which she privately set down to his thinking her not worth talking to whilst knight stood watching the rise of the cloud she sauntered to the other side of the tower and there remembered a giddy feat she had performed the year before it was to walk round upon the parapet of the towerwhich was quite without battlement or pinnacle and presented a smooth flat surface about two feet wide forming a pathway on all the four sides without reflecting in the least upon what she was doing she now stepped upon the parapet in the old way and began walking along  we are down cousin henry cried mrs swancourt up the turret follow us when you like  knight turned and saw elfride beginning her elevated promenade his face flushed with mingled concern and anger at her rashness  i certainly gave you credit for more common sense he said  she reddened a little and walked on  miss swancourt i insist upon your coming down he exclaimed  i will in a minute i am safe enough i have done it often  at that moment by reason of a slight perturbation his words had caused in her elfrides foot caught itself in a little tuft of grass growing in a joint of the stonework and she almost lost her balance knight sprang forward with a face of horror by what seemed the special interposition of a considerate providence she tottered to the inner edge of the parapet instead of to the outer and reeled over upon the lead roof two or three feet below the wall  knight seized her as in a vice and he said panting that ever i should have met a woman fool enough to do a thing of that kind good god you ought to be ashamed of yourself  the close proximity of the shadow of death had made her sick and pale as a corpse before he spoke already lowered to that state his words completely overpowered her and she swooned away as he held her  elfrides eyes were not closed for more than forty seconds she opened them and remembered the position instantly his face had altered its expression from stern anger to pity but his severe remarks had rather frightened her and she struggled to be free  if you can stand of course you may he said and loosened his arms i hardly know whether most to laugh at your freak or to chide you for its folly  she immediately sank upon the leadwork knight lifted her again are you hurt he said  she murmured an incoherent expression and tried to smile saying with a fitful aversion of her face i am only frightened put me down do put me down  but you cant walk said knight  you dont know that how can you i am only frightened i tell you she answered petulantly and raised her hand to her forehead knight then saw that she was bleeding from a severe cut in her wrist apparently where it had descended upon a salient corner of the leadwork elfride too seemed to perceive and feel this now for the first time and for a minute nearly lost consciousness again knight rapidly bound his handkerchief round the place and to add to the complication the thundercloud he had been watching began to shed some heavy drops of rain knight looked up and saw the vicar striding towards the house and mrs swancourt waddling beside him like a harddriven duck  as you are so faint it will be much better to let me carry you down said knight or at any rate inside out of the rain but her objection to be lifted made it impossible for him to support her for more than five steps  this is folly great folly he exclaimed setting her down  indeed she murmured with tears in her eyes i say i will not be carried and you say this is folly  so it is  no it isnt  it is folly i think at any rate the origin of it all is  i dont agree to it and you neednt get so angry with me i am not worth it  indeed you are you are worth the enmity of princes as was said of such another now then will you clasp your hands behind my neck that i may carry you down without hurting you  no no  you had better or i shall foreclose  whats that  deprive you of your chance  elfride gave a little toss  now dont writhe so when i attempt to carry you  i cant help it  then submit quietly  i dont care i dont care she murmured in languid tones and with closed eyes  he took her into his arms entered the turret and with slow and cautious steps descended round and round then with the gentleness of a nursing mother he attended to the cut on her arm during his progress through the operations of wiping it and binding it up anew her face changed its aspect from pained indifference to something like bashful interest interspersed with small tremors and shudders of a trifling kind  in the centre of each pale cheek a small red spot the size of a wafer had now made its appearance and continued to grow larger elfride momentarily expected a recurrence to the lecture on her foolishness but knight said no more than this  promise me never to walk on that parapet again  it will be pulled down soon so i do in a few minutes she continued in a lower tone and seriously you are familiar of course as everybody is with those strange sensations we sometimes have that our life for the moment exists in duplicate  that we have lived through that moment before  or shall again well i felt on the tower that something similar to that scene is again to be common to us both  god forbid said knight promise me that you will never again walk on any such place on any consideration  i do  that such a thing has not been before we know that it shall not be again you vow therefore think no more of such a foolish fancy  there had fallen a great deal of rain but unaccompanied by lightning a few minutes longer and the storm had ceased  now take my arm please  oh no it is not necessary this relapse into wilfulness was because he had again connected the epithet foolish with her  nonsense it is quite necessary it will rain again directly and you are not half recovered and without more ado knight took her hand drew it under his arm and held it there so firmly that she could not have removed it without a struggle feeling like a colt in a halter for the first time at thus being led along yet afraid to be angry it was to her great relief that she saw the carriage coming round the corner to fetch them  her fall upon the roof was necessarily explained to some extent upon their entering the house but both forbore to mention a word of what she had been doing to cause such an accident during the remainder of the afternoon elfride was invisible but at dinnertime she appeared as bright as ever  in the drawingroom after having been exclusively engaged with mr and mrs swancourt through the intervening hour knight again found himself thrown with elfride she had been looking over a chess problem in one of the illustrated periodicals  you like chess miss swancourt  yes it is my favourite scientific game indeed excludes every other do you play  i have played though not lately  challenge him elfride said the vicar heartily she plays very well for a lady mr knight  shall we play asked elfride tentatively  oh certainly i shall be delighted  the game began mr swancourt had forgotten a similar performance with stephen smith the year before elfride had not but she had begun to take for her maxim the undoubted truth that the necessity of continuing faithful to stephen without suspicion dictated a fickle behaviour almost as imperatively as fickleness itself a fact however which would give a startling advantage to the latter quality should it ever appear  knight by one of those inexcusable oversights which will sometimes afflict the best of players placed his rook in the arms of one of her pawns it was her first advantage she looked triumphanteven ruthless  by george what was i thinking of said knight quietly and then dismissed all concern at his accident  club laws well have wont we mr knight said elfride suasively  oh yes certainly said mr knight a thought however just occurring to his mind that he had two or three times allowed her to replace a man on her religiously assuring him that such a move was an absolute blunder  she immediately took up the unfortunate rook and the contest proceeded elfride having now rather the better of the game then he won the exchange regained his position and began to press her hard elfride grew flurried and placed her queen on his remaining rooks file  therehow stupid upon my word i did not see your rook of course nobody but a fool would have put a queen there knowingly  she spoke excitedly half expecting her antagonist to give her back the move  nobody of course said knight serenely and stretched out his hand towards his royal victim  it is not very pleasant to have it taken advantage of then she said with some vexation  club laws i think you said returned knight blandly and mercilessly appropriating the queen  she was on the brink of pouting but was ashamed to show it tears almost stood in her eyes she had been trying so hardso very hardthinking and thinking till her brain was in a whirl and it seemed so heartless of him to treat her so after all  i think it is she began  what  unkind to take advantage of a pure mistake i make in that way  i lost my rook by even a purer mistake said the enemy in an inexorable tone without lifting his eyes  yes but however as his logic was absolutely unanswerable she merely registered a protest i cannot endure those coldblooded ways of clubs and professional players like staunton and morphy just as if it really mattered whether you have raised your fingers from a man or no  knight smiled as pitilessly as before and they went on in silence  checkmate said knight  another game said elfride peremptorily and looking very warm  with all my heart said knight  checkmate said knight again at the end of forty minutes  another game she returned resolutely  ill give you the odds of a bishop knight said to her kindly  no thank you elfride replied in a tone intended for courteous indifference but as a fact very cavalier indeed  checkmate said her opponent without the least emotion  oh the difference between elfrides condition of mind now and when she purposely made blunders that stephen smith might win  it was bedtime her mind as distracted as if it would throb itself out of her head she went off to her chamber full of mortification at being beaten time after time when she herself was the aggressor having for two or three years enjoyed the reputation throughout the globe of her fathers brainwhich almost constituted her entire worldof being an excellent player this fiasco was intolerable for unfortunately the person most dogged in the belief in a false reputation is always that one the possessor who has the best means of knowing that it is not true  in bed no sleep came to soothe her that gentle thing being the very middleofsummer friend in this respect of flying away at the merest troublous cloud after lying awake till two oclock an idea seemed to strike her she softly arose got a light and fetched a chess praxis from the library returning and sitting up in bed she diligently studied the volume till the clock struck five and her eyelids felt thick and heavy she then extinguished the light and lay down again  you look pale elfride said mrs swancourt the next morning at breakfast isnt she cousin harry  a young girl who is scarcely ill at all can hardly help becoming so when regarded as such by all eyes turning upon her at the table in obedience to some remark everybody looked at elfride she certainly was pale  am i pale she said with a faint smile i did not sleep much i could not get rid of armies of bishops and knights try how i would  chess is a bad thing just before bedtime especially for excitable people like yourself dear dont ever play late again  ill play early instead cousin knight she said in imitation of mrs swancourt will you oblige me in something  even to half my kingdom  well it is to play one game more  when  now instantly the moment we have breakfasted  nonsense elfride said her father making yourself a slave to the game like that  but i want to papa honestly i am restless at having been so ignominiously overcome and mr knight doesnt mind so what harm can there be  let us play by all means if you wish it said knight  so when breakfast was over the combatants withdrew to the quiet of the library and the door was closed elfride seemed to have an idea that her conduct was rather illregulated and startlingly free from conventional restraint and worse she fancied upon knights face a slightly amused look at her proceedings  you think me foolish i suppose she said recklessly but i want to do my very best just once and see whether i can overcome you  certainly nothing more natural though i am afraid it is not the plan adopted by women of the world after a defeat  why pray  because they know that as good as overcoming is skill in effacing recollection of being overcome and turn their attention to that entirely  i am wrong again of course  perhaps your wrong is more pleasing than their right  i dont quite know whether you mean that or whether you are laughing at me she said looking doubtingly at him yet inclining to accept the more flattering interpretation i am almost sure you think it vanity in me to think i am a match for you well if you do i say that vanity is no crime in such a case  well perhaps not though it is hardly a virtue  oh yes in battle nelsons bravery lay in his vanity  indeed then so did his death  oh no no for it is written in the book of the prophet shakespeare      fear and be slain no worse can come to fight     and fight and die is death destroying death   and down they sat and the contest began elfride having the first move the game progressed elfrides heart beat so violently that she could not sit still her dread was lest he should hear it and he did discover it at lastsome flowers upon the table being set throbbing by its pulsations  i think we had better give over said knight looking at her gently it is too much for you i know let us write down the position and finish another time  no please not she implored i should not rest if i did not know the result at once it is your move  ten minutes passed  she started up suddenly i know what you are doing she cried an angry colour upon her cheeks and her eyes indignant you were thinking of letting me win to please me  i dont mind owning that i was knight responded phlegmatically and appearing all the more so by contrast with her own turmoil  but you must not i wont have it  very well  no that will not do i insist that you promise not to do any such absurd thing it is insulting me  very well madam i wont do any such absurd thing you shall not win  that is to be proved she returned proudly and the play went on  nothing is now heard but the ticking of a quaint old timepiece on the summit of a bookcase ten minutes pass he captures her knight she takes his knight and looks a very rhadamanthus  more minutes tick away she takes his pawn and has the advantage showing her sense of it rather prominently  five minutes more he takes her bishop she brings things even by taking his knight  three minutes she looks bold and takes his queen he looks placid and takes hers  eight or ten minutes pass he takes a pawn she utters a little pooh but not the ghost of a pawn can she take in retaliation  ten minutes pass he takes another pawn and says check she flushes extricates herself by capturing his bishop and looks triumphant he immediately takes her bishop she looks surprised  five minutes longer she makes a dash and takes his only remaining bishop he replies by taking her only remaining knight  two minutes he gives check her mind is now in a painful state of tension and she shades her face with her hand  yet a few minutes more he takes her rook and checks again she literally trembles now lest an artful surprise she has in store for him shall be anticipated by the artful surprise he evidently has in store for her  five minutes checkmate in two moves exclaims elfride  if you can says knight  oh i have miscalculated that is cruel  checkmate says knight and the victory is won  elfride arose and turned away without letting him see her face once in the hall she ran upstairs and into her room and flung herself down upon her bed weeping bitterly   where is elfride said her father at luncheon  knight listened anxiously for the answer he had been hoping to see her again before this time  she isnt well sir was the reply  mrs swancourt rose and left the room going upstairs to elfrides apartment  at the door was unity who occupied in the new establishment a position between young ladys maid and middlehousemaid  she is sound asleep maam unity whispered  mrs swancourt opened the door elfride was lying fulldressed on the bed her face hot and red her arms thrown abroad at intervals of a minute she tossed restlessly from side to side and indistinctly moaned words used in the game of chess  mrs swancourt had a turn for doctoring and felt her pulse it was twanging like a harpstring at the rate of nearly a hundred and fifty a minute softly moving the sleeping girl to a little less cramped position she went downstairs again  she is asleep now said mrs swancourt she does not seem very well cousin knight what were you thinking of her tender brain wont bear cudgelling like your great head you should have strictly forbidden her to play again  in truth the essayists experience of the nature of young women was far less extensive than his abstract knowledge of them led himself and others to believe he could pack them into sentences like a workman but practically was nowhere  i am indeed sorry said knight feeling even more than he expressed but surely the young lady knows best what is good for her  bless you thats just what she doesnt know she never thinks of such things does she christopher her father and i have to command her and keep her in order as you would a child she will say things worthy of a french epigrammatist and act like a robin in a greenhouse but i think we will send for dr gransonthere can be no harm  a man was straightway despatched on horseback to castle boterel and the gentleman known as dr granson came in the course of the afternoon he pronounced her nervous system to be in a decided state of disorder forwarded some soothing draught and gave orders that on no account whatever was she to play chess again  the next morning knight much vexed with himself waited with a curiously compounded feeling for her entry to breakfast the women servants came in to prayers at irregular intervals and as each entered he could not to save his life avoid turning his head with the hope that she might be elfride mr swancourt began reading without waiting for her then somebody glided in noiselessly knight softly glanced up it was only the little kitchenmaid knight thought reading prayers a bore  he went out alone and for almost the first time failed to recognize that holding converse with natures charms was not solitude on nearing the house again he perceived his young friend crossing a slope by a path which ran into the one he was following in the angle of the field here they met elfride was at once exultant and abashed coming into his presence had upon her the effect of entering a cathedral  knight had his notebook in his hand and had in fact been in the very act of writing therein when they came in view of each other he left off in the midst of a sentence and proceeded to inquire warmly concerning her state of health she said she was perfectly well and indeed had never looked better her health was as inconsequent as her actions her lips were red without the polish that cherries have and their redness margined with the white skin in a clearly defined line which had nothing of jagged confusion in it altogether she stood as the last person in the world to be knocked over by a game of chess because too ephemerallooking to play one  are you taking notes she inquired with an alacrity plainly arising less from interest in the subject than from a wish to divert his thoughts from herself  yes i was making an entry and with your permission i will complete it knight then stood still and wrote elfride remained beside him a moment and afterwards walked on  i should like to see all the secrets that are in that book she gaily flung back to him over her shoulder  i dont think you would find much to interest you  i know i should  then of course i have no more to say  but i would ask this question first is it a book of mere facts concerning journeys and expenditure and so on or a book of thoughts  well to tell the truth it is not exactly either it consists for the most part of jottings for articles and essays disjointed and disconnected of no possible interest to anybody but myself  it contains i suppose your developed thoughts in embryo  yes  if they are interesting when enlarged to the size of an article what must they be in their concentrated form pure rectified spirit above proof before it is lowered to be fit for human consumption words that burn indeed  rather like a balloon before it is inflated flabby shapeless dead you could hardly read them  may i try she said coaxingly i wrote my poor romance in that wayi mean in bits out of doorsand i should like to see whether your way of entering things is the same as mine  really thats rather an awkward request i suppose i can hardly refuse now you have asked so directly but  you think me illmannered in asking but does not this justify meyour writing in my presence mr knight if i had lighted upon your book by chance it would have been different but you stand before me and say excuse me without caring whether i do or not and write on and then tell me they are not private facts but public ideas  very well miss swancourt if you really must see the consequences be upon your own head remember my advice to you is to leave my book alone  but with that caution i have your permission  yes  she hesitated a moment looked at his hand containing the book then laughed and saying i must see it withdrew it from his fingers  knight rambled on towards the house leaving her standing in the path turning over the leaves by the time he had reached the wicketgate he saw that she had moved and waited till she came up  elfride had closed the notebook and was carrying it disdainfully by the corner between her finger and thumb her face wore a nettled look she silently extended the volume towards him raising her eyes no higher than her hand was lifted  take it said elfride quickly i dont want to read it  could you understand it said knight  as far as i looked but i didnt care to read much  why miss swancourt  only because i didnt wish tothats all  i warned you that you might not  yes but i never supposed you would have put me there  your name is not mentioned once within the four corners  not my namei know that  nor your description nor anything by which anybody would recognize you  except myself for what is this she exclaimed taking it from him and opening a page august 7 thats the day before yesterday but i wont read it elfride said closing the book again with pretty hauteur why should i i had no business to ask to see your book and it serves me right  knight hardly recollected what he had written and turned over the book to see he came to this  aug 7 girl gets into her teens and her selfconsciousness is born after a certain interval passed in infantine helplessness it begins to act simple young and inexperienced at first persons of observation can tell to a nicety how old this consciousness is by the skill it has acquired in the art necessary to its successthe art of hiding itself generally begins career by actions which are popularly termed showingoff method adopted depends in each case upon the disposition rank residence of the young lady attempting it townbred girl will utter some moral paradox on fast men or love country miss adopts the more material media of taking a ghastly fence whistling or making your blood run cold by appearing to risk her neck mem on endelstow tower  an innocent vanity is of course the origin of these displays look at me say these youthful beginners in womanly artifice without reflecting whether or not it be to their advantage to show so very much of themselves amplify and correct for paper on artless arts  yes i remember now said knight the notes were certainly suggested by your manoeuvre on the church tower but you must not think too much of such random observations he continued encouragingly as he noticed her injured looks a mere fancy passing through my head assumes a factitious importance to you because it has been made permanent by being written down all mankind think thoughts as bad as those of people they most love on earth but such thoughts never getting embodied on paper it becomes assumed that they never existed i daresay that you yourself have thought some disagreeable thing or other of me which would seem just as bad as this if written i challenge you now to tell me  the worst thing i have thought of you  yes  i must not  oh yes  i thought you were rather roundshouldered  knight looked slightly redder  and that there was a little bald spot on the top of your head  hehheh two ineradicable defects said knight there being a faint ghastliness discernible in his laugh they are much worse in a ladys eye than being thought selfconscious i suppose  ah thats very fine she said too inexperienced to perceive her hit and hence not quite disposed to forgive his notes you alluded to me in that entry as if i were such a child too everybody does that i cannot understand it i am quite a woman you know how old do you think i am  how old why seventeen i should say all girls are seventeen  you are wrong i am nearly nineteen which class of women do you like best those who seem younger or those who seem older than they are  offhand i should be inclined to say those who seem older  so it was not elfrides class  but it is well known she said eagerly and there was something touching in the artless anxiety to be thought much of which she revealed by her words that the slower a nature is to develop the richer the nature youths and girls who are men and women before they come of age are nobodies by the time that backward people have shown their full compass  yes said knight thoughtfully there is really something in that remark but at the risk of offence i must remind you that you there take it for granted that the woman behind her time at a given age has not reached the end of her tether her backwardness may be not because she is slow to develop but because she soon exhausted her capacity for developing  elfride looked disappointed by this time they were indoors mrs swancourt to whom matchmaking by any honest means was meat and drink had now a little scheme of that nature concerning this pair the morningroom in which they both expected to find her was empty the old lady having for the above reason vacated it by the second door as they entered by the first  knight went to the chimneypiece and carelessly surveyed two portraits on ivory  though these pink ladies had very rudimentary features judging by what i see here he observed they had unquestionably beautiful heads of hair  yes and that is everything said elfride possibly conscious of her own possibly not  not everything though a great deal certainly  which colour do you like best she ventured to ask  more depends on its abundance than on its colour  abundances being equal may i inquire your favourite colour  dark  i mean for women she said with the minutest fall of countenance and a hope that she had been misunderstood  so do i knight replied  it was impossible for any man not to know the colour of elfrides hair in women who wear it plainly such a feature may be overlooked by men not given to ocular intentness but hers was always in the way you saw her hair as far as you could see her sex and knew that it was the palest brown she knew instantly that knight being perfectly aware of this had an independent standard of admiration in the matter  elfride was thoroughly vexed she could not but be struck with the honesty of his opinions and the worst of it was that the more they went against her the more she respected them and now like a reckless gambler she hazarded her last and best treasure her eyes they were her all now  what coloured eyes do you like best mr knight she said slowly  honestly or as a compliment  of course honestly i dont want anybodys compliment  and yet elfride knew otherwise that a compliment or word of approval from that man then would have been like a well to a famished arab  i prefer hazel he said serenely  she had played and lost again     chapter xix       love was in the next degree   knight had none of those light familiarities of speech which by judicious touches of epigrammatic flattery obliterate a womans recollection of the speakers abstract opinions so no more was said by either on the subject of hair eyes or development elfrides mind had been impregnated with sentiments of her own smallness to an uncomfortable degree of distinctness and her discomfort was visible in her face the whole tendency of the conversation latterly had been to quietly but surely disparage her and she was fain to take stephen into favour in selfdefence he would not have been so unloving she said as to admire an idiosyncrasy and features different from her own true stephen had declared he loved her mr knight had never done anything of the sort somehow this did not mend matters and the sensation of her smallness in knights eyes still remained had the position been reversedhad stephen loved her in spite of a differing taste and had knight been indifferent in spite of her resemblance to his ideal it would have engendered far happier thoughts as matters stood stephens admiration might have its root in a blindness the result of passion perhaps any keen mans judgment was condemnatory of her  during the remainder of saturday they were more or less thrown with their seniors and no conversation arose which was exclusively their own when elfride was in bed that night her thoughts recurred to the same subject at one moment she insisted that it was illnatured of him to speak so decisively as he had done the next that it was sterling honesty  ah what a poor nobody i am she said sighing people like him who go about the great world dont care in the least what i am like either in mood or feature  perhaps a man who has got thoroughly into a womans mind in this manner is half way to her heart the distance between those two stations is proverbially short  and are you really going away this week said mrs swancourt to knight on the following evening which was sunday  they were all leisurely climbing the hill to the church where a last service was now to be held at the rather exceptional time of evening instead of in the afternoon previous to the demolition of the ruinous portions  i am intending to cross to cork from bristol returned knight and then i go on to dublin  return this way and stay a little longer with us said the vicar a week is nothing we have hardly been able to realize your presence yet i remember a story which  the vicar suddenly stopped he had forgotten it was sunday and would probably have gone on in his weekday mode of thought had not a turn in the breeze blown the skirt of his college gown within the range of his vision and so reminded him he at once diverted the current of his narrative with the dexterity the occasion demanded  the story of the levite who journeyed to bethlehemjudah from which i took my text the sunday before last is quite to the point he continued with the pronunciation of a man who far from having intended to tell a weekday story a moment earlier had thought of nothing but sabbath matters for several weeks what did he gain after all by his restlessness had he remained in the city of the jebusites and not been so anxious for gibeah none of his troubles would have arisen  but he had wasted five days already said knight closing his eyes to the vicars commendable diversion his fault lay in beginning the tarrying system originally  true true my illustration fails  but not the hospitality which prompted the story  so you are to come just the same urged mrs swancourt for she had seen an almost imperceptible fall of countenance in her stepdaughter at knights announcement  knight half promised to call on his return journey but the uncertainty with which he spoke was quite enough to fill elfride with a regretful interest in all he did during the few remaining hours the curate having already officiated twice that day in the two churches mr swancourt had undertaken the whole of the evening service and knight read the lessons for him the sun streamed across from the dilapidated west window and lighted all the assembled worshippers with a golden glow knight as he read being illuminated by the same mellow lustre elfride at the organ regarded him with a throbbing sadness of mood which was fed by a sense of being far removed from his sphere as he went deliberately through the chapter appointeda portion of the history of elijahand ascended that magnificent climax of the wind the earthquake the fire and the still small voice his deep tones echoed past with such apparent disregard of her existence that his presence inspired her with a forlorn sense of unapproachableness which his absence would hardly have been able to cause  at the same time turning her face for a moment to catch the glory of the dying sun as it fell on his form her eyes were arrested by the shape and aspect of a woman in the west gallery it was the bleak barren countenance of the widow jethway whom elfride had not seen much of since the morning of her return with stephen smith possessing the smallest of competencies this unhappy woman appeared to spend her life in journeyings between endelstow churchyard and that of a village near southampton where her father and mother were laid  she had not attended the service here for a considerable time and she now seemed to have a reason for her choice of seat from the gallery window the tomb of her son was plainly visiblestanding as the nearest object in a prospect which was closed outwardly by the changeless horizon of the sea  the streaming rays too flooded her face now bent towards elfride with a hard and bitter expression that the solemnity of the place raised to a tragic dignity it did not intrinsically possess the girl resumed her normal attitude with an added disquiet  elfrides emotion was cumulative and after a while would assert itself on a sudden a slight touch was enough to set it freea poem a sunset a cunningly contrived chord of music a vague imagining being the usual accidents of its exhibition the longing for knights respect which was leading up to an incipient yearning for his love made the present conjuncture a sufficient one whilst kneeling down previous to leaving when the sunny streaks had gone upward to the roof and the lower part of the church was in soft shadow she could not help thinking of coleridges morbid poem the three graves and shuddering as she wondered if mrs jethway were cursing her she wept as if her heart would break  they came out of church just as the sun went down leaving the landscape like a platform from which an eloquent speaker has retired and nothing remains for the audience to do but to rise and go home mr and mrs swancourt went off in the carriage knight and elfride preferring to walk as the skilful old matchmaker had imagined they descended the hill together  i liked your reading mr knight elfride presently found herself saying you read better than papa  i will praise anybody that will praise me you played excellently miss swancourt and very correctly  correctlyyes  it must be a great pleasure to you to take an active part in the service  i want to be able to play with more feeling but i have not a good selection of music sacred or secular i wish i had a nice little musiclibrarywell chosen and that the only new pieces sent me were those of genuine merit  i am glad to hear such a wish from you it is extraordinary how many women have no honest love of music as an end and not as a means even leaving out those who have nothing in them they mostly like it for its accessories i have never met a woman who loves music as do ten or a dozen men i know  how would you draw the line between women with something and women with nothing in them  well said knight reflecting a moment i mean by nothing in them those who dont care about anything solid this is an instance i knew a man who had a young friend in whom he was much interested in fact they were going to be married she was seemingly poetical and he offered her a choice of two editions of the british poets which she pretended to want badly he said which of them would you like best for me to send she said a pair of the prettiest earrings in bond street if you dont mind would be nicer than either now i call her a girl with not much in her but vanity and so do you i daresay  oh yes replied elfride with an effort  happening to catch a glimpse of her face as she was speaking and noticing that her attempt at heartiness was a miserable failure he appeared to have misgivings  you miss swancourt would not under such circumstances have preferred the nicknacks  no i dont think i should indeed she stammered  ill put it to you said the inflexible knight which will you have of these two things of about equal valuethe wellchosen little library of the best music you spoke ofbound in morocco walnut case lock and keyor a pair of the very prettiest earrings in bond street windows  of course the music elfride replied with forced earnestness  you are quite certain he said emphatically  quite she faltered if i could for certain buy the earrings afterwards  knight somewhat blamably keenly enjoyed sparring with the palpitating mobile creature whose excitable nature made any such thing a species of cruelty  he looked at her rather oddly and said fie  forgive me she said laughing a little a little frightened and blushing very deeply  ah miss elfie why didnt you say at first as any firm woman would have said i am as bad as she and shall choose the same  i dont know said elfride wofully and with a distressful smile  i thought you were exceptionally musical  so i am i think but the test is so severequite painful  i dont understand  music doesnt do any real good or rather  that is a thing to say miss swancourt why what  you dont understand you dont understand  why what conceivable use is there in jimcrack jewellery  no no no no she cried petulantly i didnt mean what you think i like the music best only i like  earrings betterown it he said in a teasing tone well i think i should have had the moral courage to own it at once without pretending to an elevation i could not reach  like the french soldiery elfride was not brave when on the defensive so it was almost with tears in her eyes that she answered desperately  my meaning is that i like earrings best just now because i lost one of my prettiest pair last year and papa said he would not buy any more or allow me to myself because i was careless and now i wish i had some like themthats what my meaning isindeed it is mr knight  i am afraid i have been very harsh and rude said knight with a look of regret at seeing how disturbed she was but seriously if women only knew how they ruin their good looks by such appurtenances i am sure they would never want them  they were lovely and became me so  not if they were like the ordinary hideous things women stuff their ears with nowadayslike the governor of a steamengine or a pair of scales or gold gibbets and chains and artists palettes and compensation pendulums and heaven knows what besides  no they were not one of those things so prettylike this she said with eager animation and she drew with the point of her parasol an enlarged view of one of the lamented darlings to a scale that would have suited a giantess halfamile high  yes very prettyvery said knight dryly how did you come to lose such a precious pair of articles  i only lost onenobody ever loses both at the same time  she made this remark with embarrassment and a nervous movement of the fingers seeing that the loss occurred whilst stephen smith was attempting to kiss her for the first time on the cliff her confusion was hardly to be wondered at the question had been awkward and received no direct answer  knight seemed not to notice her manner  oh nobody ever loses bothi see and certainly the fact that it was a case of loss takes away all odour of vanity from your choice  as i never know whether you are in earnest i dont now she said looking up inquiringly at the hairy face of the oracle and coming gallantly to her own rescue if i really seem vain it is that i am only vain in my waysnot in my heart the worst women are those vain in their hearts and not in their ways  an adroit distinction well they are certainly the more objectionable of the two said knight  is vanity a mortal or a venial sin you know what life is tell me  i am very far from knowing what life is a just conception of life is too large a thing to grasp during the short interval of passing through it  will the fact of a woman being fond of jewellery be likely to make her life in its higher sense a failure  nobodys life is altogether a failure  well you know what i mean even though my words are badly selected and commonplace she said impatiently because i utter commonplace words you must not suppose i think only commonplace thoughts my poor stock of words are like a limited number of rough moulds i have to cast all my materials in good and bad and the novelty or delicacy of the substance is often lost in the coarse triteness of the form  very well ill believe that ingenious representation as to the subject in handlives which are failuresyou need not trouble yourself anybodys life may be just as romantic and strange and interesting if he or she fails as if he or she succeed all the difference is that the last chapter is wanting in the story if a man of power tries to do a great deed and just falls short of it by an accident not his fault up to that time his history had as much in it as that of a great man who has done his great deed it is whimsical of the world to hold that particulars of how a lad went to school and so on should be as an interesting romance or as nothing to them precisely in proportion to his after renown  they were walking between the sunset and the moonrise with the dropping of the sun a nearly full moon had begun to raise itself their shadows as cast by the western glare showed signs of becoming obliterated in the interest of a rival pair in the opposite direction which the moon was bringing to distinctness  i consider my life to some extent a failure said knight again after a pause during which he had noticed the antagonistic shadows  you how  i dont precisely know but in some way i have missed the mark  really to have done it is not much to be sad about but to feel that you have done it must be a cause of sorrow am i right  partly though not quite for a sensation of being profoundly experienced serves as a sort of consolation to people who are conscious of having taken wrong turnings contradictory as it seems there is nothing truer than that people who have always gone right dont know half as much about the nature and ways of going right as those do who have gone wrong however it is not desirable for me to chill your summertime by going into this  you have not told me even now if i am really vain  if i say yes i shall offend you if i say no youll think i dont mean it he replied looking curiously into her face  ah well she replied with a little breath of distress that which is exceeding deep who will find it out i suppose i must take you as i do the biblefind out and understand all i can and on the strength of that swallow the rest in a lump by simple faith think me vain if you will worldly greatness requires so much littleness to grow up in that an infirmity more or less is not a matter for regret  as regards women i cant say answered knight carelessly but it is without doubt a misfortune for a man who has a living to get to be born of a truly noble nature a high soul will bring a man to the workhouse so you may be right in sticking up for vanity  no no i dont do that she said regretfully  mr knight when you are gone will you send me something you have written i think i should like to see whether you write as you have lately spoken or in your better mood which is your true selfthe cynic you have been this evening or the nice philosopher you were up to tonight  ah which you know as well as i  their conversation detained them on the lawn and in the portico till the stars blinked out elfride flung back her head and said idly  theres a bright star exactly over me  each bright star is overhead somewhere  is it oh yes of course where is that one and she pointed with her finger  that is poised like a white hawk over one of the cape verde islands  and that  looking down upon the source of the nile  and that lonely quietlooking one  he watches the north pole and has no less than the whole equator for his horizon and that idle one low down upon the ground that we have almost rolled away from is in indiaover the head of a young friend of mine who very possibly looks at the star in our zenith as it hangs low upon his horizon and thinks of it as marking where his true love dwells  elfride glanced at knight with misgiving did he mean her she could not see his features but his attitude seemed to show unconsciousness  the star is over my head she said with hesitation  or anybody elses in england  oh yes i see she breathed her relief  his parents i believe are natives of this county i dont know them though i have been in correspondence with him for many years till lately fortunately or unfortunately for him he fell in love and then went to bombay since that time i have heard very little of him  knight went no further in his volunteered statement and though elfride at one moment was inclined to profit by the lessons in honesty he had just been giving her the flesh was weak and the intention dispersed into silence there seemed a reproach in knights blind words and yet she was not able to clearly define any disloyalty that she had been guilty of     chapter xx       a distant dearness in the hill   knight turned his back upon the parish of endelstow and crossed over to cork  one day of absence superimposed itself on another and proportionately weighted his heart he pushed on to the lakes of killarney rambled amid their luxuriant woods surveyed the infinite variety of island hill and dale there to be found listened to the marvellous echoes of that romantic spot but altogether missed the glory and the dream he formerly found in such favoured regions  whilst in the company of elfride her girlish presence had not perceptibly affected him to any depth he had not been conscious that her entry into his sphere had added anything to himself but now that she was taken away he was very conscious of a great deal being abstracted the superfluity had become a necessity and knight was in love  stephen fell in love with elfride by looking at her knight by ceasing to do so when or how the spirit entered into him he knew not certain he was that when on the point of leaving endelstow he had felt none of that exquisite nicety of poignant sadness natural to such severances seeing how delightful a subject of contemplation elfride had been ever since had he begun to love her when she met his eye after her mishap on the tower he had simply thought her weak had he grown to love her whilst standing on the lawn brightened all over by the evening sun he had thought her complexion good no more was it her conversation that had sown the seed he had thought her words ingenious and very creditable to a young woman but not noteworthy had the chessplaying anything to do with it certainly not he had thought her at that time a rather conceited child  knights experience was a complete disproof of the assumption that love always comes by glances of the eye and sympathetic touches of the fingers that like flame it makes itself palpable at the moment of generation not till they were parted and she had become sublimated in his memory could he be said to have even attentively regarded her  thus having passively gathered up images of her which his mind did not act upon till the cause of them was no longer before him he appeared to himself to have fallen in love with her soul which had temporarily assumed its disembodiment to accompany him on his way  she began to rule him so imperiously now that accustomed to analysis he almost trembled at the possible result of the introduction of this new force among the nicely adjusted ones of his ordinary life he became restless then he forgot all collateral subjects in the pleasure of thinking about her  yet it must be said that knight loved philosophically rather than with romance  he thought of her manner towards him simplicity verges on coquetry was she flirting he said to himself no forcible translation of favour into suspicion was able to uphold such a theory the performance had been too well done to be anything but real it had the defects without which nothing is genuine no actress of twenty years standing no baldnecked lady whose earliest season out was lost in the discreet mist of evasive talk could have played before him the part of ingenuous girl as elfride lived it she had the little artful ways which partly make up ingenuousness  there are bachelors by nature and bachelors by circumstance spinsters there doubtless are also of both kinds though some think only those of the latter however knight had been looked upon as a bachelor by nature what was he coming to it was very odd to himself to look at his theories on the subject of love and reading them now by the full light of a new experience to see how much more his sentences meant than he had felt them to mean when they were written people often discover the real force of a trite old maxim only when it is thrust upon them by a chance adventure but knight had never before known the case of a man who learnt the full compass of his own epigrams by such means  he was intensely satisfied with one aspect of the affair inbred in him was an invincible objection to be any but the first comer in a womans heart he had discovered within himself the condition that if ever he did make up his mind to marry it must be on the certainty that no cropping out of inconvenient old letters no bow and blush to a mysterious stranger casually met should be a possible source of discomposure knights sentiments were only the ordinary ones of a man of his age who loves genuinely perhaps exaggerated a little by his pursuits when men first love as lads it is with the very centre of their hearts nothing else being concerned in the operation with added years more of the faculties attempt a partnership in the passion till at knights age the understanding is fain to have a hand in it it may as well be left out a man in love setting up his brains as a gauge of his position is as one determining a ships longitude from a light at the masthead  knight argued from elfrides unwontedness of manner which was matter of fact to an unwontedness in love which was matter of inference only incredules les plus credules elfride he said had hardly looked upon a man till she saw me  he had never forgotten his severity to her because she preferred ornament to edification and had since excused her a hundred times by thinking how natural to womankind was a love of adornment and how necessary became a mild infusion of personal vanity to complete the delicate and fascinating dye of the feminine mind so at the end of the weeks absence which had brought him as far as dublin he resolved to curtail his tour return to endelstow and commit himself by making a reality of the hypothetical offer of that sunday evening  notwithstanding that he had concocted a great deal of paper theory on social amenities and modern manners generally the special ounce of practice was wanting and now for his life knight could not recollect whether it was considered correct to give a young lady personal ornaments before a regular engagement to marry had been initiated but the day before leaving dublin he looked around anxiously for a highclass jewellery establishment in which he purchased what he considered would suit her best  it was with a most awkward and unwonted feeling that after entering and closing the door of his room he sat down opened the morocco case and held up each of the fragile bits of goldwork before his eyes many things had become old to the solitary man of letters but these were new and he handled like a child an outcome of civilization which had never before been touched by his fingers a sudden fastidious decision that the pattern chosen would not suit her after all caused him to rise in a flurry and tear down the street to change them for others after a great deal of trouble in reselecting during which his mind became so bewildered that the critical faculty on objects of art seemed to have vacated his person altogether knight carried off another pair of earrings these remained in his possession till the afternoon when after contemplating them fifty times with a growing misgiving that the last choice was worse than the first he felt that no sleep would visit his pillow till he had improved upon his previous purchases yet again in a perfect heat of vexation with himself for such tergiversation he went anew to the shopdoor was absolutely ashamed to enter and give further trouble went to another shop bought a pair at an enormously increased price because they seemed the very thing asked the goldsmiths if they would take the other pair in exchange was told that they could not exchange articles bought of another maker paid down the money and went off with the two pairs in his possession wondering what on earth to do with the superfluous pair he almost wished he could lose them or that somebody would steal them and was burdened with an interposing sense that as a capable man with true ideas of economy he must necessarily sell them somewhere which he did at last for a mere song mingled with a blank feeling of a whole day being lost to him in running about the city on this new and extraordinary class of errand and of several pounds being lost through his bungling was a slight sense of satisfaction that he had emerged for ever from his antediluvian ignorance on the subject of ladies jewellery as well as secured a truly artistic production at last during the remainder of that day he scanned the ornaments of every lady he met with the profoundly experienced eye of an appraiser  next morning knight was again crossing st georges channelnot returning to london by the holyhead route as he had originally intended but towards bristolavailing himself of mr and mrs swancourts invitation to revisit them on his homeward journey  we flit forward to elfride  womans ruling passionto fascinate and influence those more powerful than shethough operant in elfride was decidedly purposeless she had wanted her friend knights good opinion from the first how much more than that elementary ingredient of friendship she now desired her fears would hardly allow her to think in originally wishing to please the highest class of man she had ever intimately known there was no disloyalty to stephen smith she could notand few women canrealize the possible vastness of an issue which has only an insignificant begetting  her letters from stephen were necessarily few and her sense of fidelity clung to the last she had received as a wrecked mariner clings to flotsam the young girl persuaded herself that she was glad stephen had such a right to her hand as he had acquired in her eyes by the elopement she beguiled herself by saying perhaps if i had not so committed myself i might fall in love with mr knight  all this made the week of knights absence very gloomy and distasteful to her she retained stephen in her prayers and his old letters were rereadas a medicine in reality though she deceived herself into the belief that it was as a pleasure  these letters had grown more and more hopeful he told her that he finished his work every day with a pleasant consciousness of having removed one more stone from the barrier which divided them then he drew images of what a fine figure they two would cut some day people would turn their heads and say what a prize he has won she was not to be sad about that wild runaway attempt of theirs elfride had repeatedly said that it grieved her whatever any other person who knew of it might think he knew well enough the modesty of her nature the only reproach was a gentle one for not having written quite so devotedly during her visit to london her letter had seemed to have a liveliness derived from other thoughts than thoughts of him   knights intention of an early return to endelstow having originally been faint his promise to do so had been fainter he was a man who kept his words well to the rear of his possible actions the vicar was rather surprised to see him again so soon mrs swancourt was not knight found on meeting them all after his arrival had been announced that they had formed an intention to go to st leonards for a few days at the end of the month  no satisfactory conjuncture offered itself on this first evening of his return for presenting elfride with what he had been at such pains to procure he was fastidious in his reading of opportunities for such an intended act the next morning chancing to break fine after a week of cloudy weather it was proposed and decided that they should all drive to barwith strand a local lion which neither mrs swancourt nor knight had seen knight scented romantic occasions from afar and foresaw that such a one might be expected before the coming night  the journey was along a road by neutral green hills upon which hedgerows lay trailing like ropes on a quay gaps in these uplands revealed the blue sea flecked with a few dashes of white and a solitary white sail the whole brimming up to a keen horizon which lay like a line ruled from hillside to hillside then they rolled down a pass the chocolatetoned rocks forming a wall on both sides from one of which fell a heavy jagged shade over half the roadway a spout of fresh water burst from an occasional crevice and pattering down upon broad green leaves ran along as a rivulet at the bottom unkempt locks of heather overhung the brow of each steep whence at divers points a bramble swung forth into midair snatching at their headdresses like a claw  they mounted the last crest and the bay which was to be the end of their pilgrimage burst upon them the ocean blueness deepened its colour as it stretched to the foot of the crags where it terminated in a fringe of whitesilent at this distance though moving and heaving like a counterpane upon a restless sleeper the shadowed hollows of the purple and brown rocks would have been called blue had not that tint been so entirely appropriated by the water beside them  the carriage was put up at a little cottage with a shed attached and an ostler and the coachman carried the hamper of provisions down to the shore  knight found his opportunity i did not forget your wish he began when they were apart from their friends  elfride looked as if she did not understand  and i have brought you these he continued awkwardly pulling out the case and opening it while holding it towards her  o mr knight said elfride confusedly and turning to a lively red i didnt know you had any intention or meaning in what you said i thought it a mere supposition i dont want them  a thought which had flashed into her mind gave the reply a greater decisiveness than it might otherwise have possessed tomorrow was the day for stephens letter  but will you not accept them knight returned feeling less her master than heretofore  i would rather not they are beautifulmore beautiful than any i have ever seen she answered earnestly looking halfwishfully at the temptation as eve may have looked at the apple but i dont want to have them if you will kindly forgive me mr knight  no kindness at all said mr knight brought to a full stop at this unexpected turn of events  a silence followed knight held the open case looking rather wofully at the glittering forms he had forsaken his orbit to procure turning it about and holding it up as if feeling his gift to be slighted by her he were endeavouring to admire it very much himself  shut them up and dont let me see them any longerdo she said laughingly and with a quaint mixture of reluctance and entreaty  why elfie  not elfie to you mr knight oh because i shall want them there i am silly i know to say that but i have a reason for not taking themnow she kept in the last word for a moment intending to imply that her refusal was finite but somehow the word slipped out and undid all the rest  you will take them some day  i dont want to  why dont you want to elfride swancourt  because i dont i dont like to take them  i have read a fact of distressing significance in that said knight since you like them your dislike to having them must be towards me  no it isnt  what then do you like me  elfride deepened in tint and looked into the distance with features shaped to an expression of the nicest criticism as regarded her answer  i like you pretty well she at length murmured mildly  not very much  you are so sharp with me and say hard things and so how can i she replied evasively  you think me a fogey i suppose  no i donti mean i doi dont know what i think you i mean let us go to papa responded elfride with somewhat of a flurried delivery  well ill tell you my object in getting the present said knight with a composure intended to remove from her mind any possible impression of his being what he washer lover you see it was the very least i could do in common civility  elfride felt rather blank at this lucid statement  knight continued putting away the case i felt as anybody naturally would have you know that my words on your choice the other day were invidious and unfair and thought an apology should take a practical shape  oh yes  elfride was sorryshe could not tell whythat he gave such a legitimate reason it was a disappointment that he had all the time a cool motive which might be stated to anybody without raising a smile had she known they were offered in that spirit she would certainly have accepted the seductive gift and the tantalizing feature was that perhaps he suspected her to imagine them offered as a lovers token which was mortifying enough if they were not  mrs swancourt came now to where they were sitting to select a flat boulder for spreading their tablecloth upon and amid the discussion on that subject the matter pending between knight and elfride was shelved for a while he read her refusal so certainly as the bashfulness of a girl in a novel position that upon the whole he could tolerate such a beginning could knight have been told that it was a sense of fidelity struggling against new love whilst no less assuring as to his ultimate victory it might have entirely abstracted the wish to secure it  at the same time a slight constraint of manner was visible between them for the remainder of the afternoon the tide turned and they were obliged to ascend to higher ground the day glided on to its end with the usual quiet dreamy passivity of such occasionswhen every deed done and thing thought is in endeavouring to avoid doing and thinking more looking idly over the verge of a crag they beheld their stone diningtable gradually being splashed upon and their crumbs and fragments all washed away by the incoming sea the vicar drew a moral lesson from the scene knight replied in the same satisfied strain and then the waves rolled in furiouslythe neutral greenandblue tongues of water slid up the slopes and were metamorphosed into foam by a careless blow falling back white and faint and leaving trailing followers behind  the passing of a heavy shower was the next scenedriving them to shelter in a shallow caveafter which the horses were put in and they started to return homeward by the time they reached the higher levels the sky had again cleared and the sunset rays glanced directly upon the wet uphill road they had climbed the ruts formed by their carriagewheels on the ascenta pair of liliputian canalswere as shining bars of gold tapering to nothing in the distance upon this also they turned their backs and night spread over the sea  the evening was chilly and there was no moon knight sat close to elfride and when the darkness rendered the position of a person a matter of uncertainty particularly close elfride edged away  i hope you allow me my place ungrudgingly he whispered  oh yes tis the least i can do in common civility she said accenting the words so that he might recognize them as his own returned  both of them felt delicately balanced between two possibilities thus they reached home  to knight this mild experience was delightful it was to him a gentle innocent timea time which though there may not be much in it seldom repeats itself in a mans life and has a peculiar dearness when glanced at retrospectively he is not inconveniently deep in love and is lulled by a peaceful sense of being able to enjoy the most trivial thing with a childlike enjoyment the movement of a wave the colour of a stone anything was enough for knights drowsy thoughts of that day to precipitate themselves upon even the sermonizing platitudes the vicar had delivered himself ofchiefly because something seemed to be professionally required of him in the presence of a man of knights proclivitieswere swallowed whole the presence of elfride led him not merely to tolerate that kind of talk from the necessities of ordinary courtesy but he listened to ittook in the ideas with an enjoyable makebelieve that they were proper and necessary and indulged in a conservative feeling that the face of things was complete  entering her room that evening elfride found a packet for herself on the dressingtable how it came there she did not know she tremblingly undid the folds of white paper that covered it yes it was the treasure of a morocco case containing those treasures of ornament she had refused in the daytime  elfride dressed herself in them for a moment looked at herself in the glass blushed red and put them away they filled her dreams all that night never had she seen anything so lovely and never was it more clear that as an honest woman she was in duty bound to refuse them why it was not equally clear to her that duty required more vigorous coordinate conduct as well let those who dissect her say  the next morning glared in like a spectre upon her it was stephens letterday and she was bound to meet the postmanto stealthily do a deed she had never liked to secure an end she now had ceased to desire  but she went  there were two letters  one was from the bank at st launces in which she had a small private depositprobably something about interest she put that in her pocket for a moment and going indoors and upstairs to be safer from observation tremblingly opened stephens  what was this he said to her  she was to go to the st launces bank and take a sum of money which they had received private advices to pay her  the sum was two hundred pounds  there was no check order or anything of the nature of guarantee in fact the information amounted to this the money was now in the st launces bank standing in her name  she instantly opened the other letter it contained a depositnote from the bank for the sum of two hundred pounds which had that day been added to her account stephens information then was correct and the transfer made  i have saved this in one year stephens letter went on to say and what so proper as well as pleasant for me to do as to hand it over to you to keep for your use i have plenty for myself independently of this should you not be disposed to let it lie idle in the bank get your father to invest it in your name on good security it is a little present to you from your more than betrothed he will i think elfride feel now that my pretensions to your hand are anything but the dream of a silly boy not worth rational consideration  with a natural delicacy elfride in mentioning her fathers marriage had refrained from all allusion to the pecuniary resources of the lady  leaving this matteroffact subject he went on somewhat after his boyish manner  do you remember darling that first morning of my arrival at your house when your father read at prayers the miracle of healing the sick of the palsywhere he is told to take up his bed and walk i do and i can now so well realize the force of that passage the smallest piece of mat is the bed of the oriental and yesterday i saw a native perform the very action which reminded me to mention it but you are better read than i and perhaps you knew all this long agoone day i bought some small native idols to send home to you as curiosities but afterwards finding they had been cast in england made to look old and shipped over i threw them away in disgust  speaking of this reminds me that we are obliged to import all our housebuilding ironwork from england never was such foresight required to be exercised in building houses as here before we begin we have to order every column lock hinge and screw that will be required we cannot go into the next street as in london and get them cast at a minutes notice mr l says somebody will have to go to england very soon and superintend the selection of a large order of this kind i only wish i may be the man  there before her lay the depositreceipt for the two hundred pounds and beside it the elegant present of knight elfride grew coldthen her cheeks felt heated by beating blood if by destroying the piece of paper the whole transaction could have been withdrawn from her experience she would willingly have sacrificed the money it represented she did not know what to do in either case she almost feared to let the two articles lie in juxtaposition so antagonistic were the interests they represented that a miraculous repulsion of one by the other was almost to be expected  that day she was seen little of by the evening she had come to a resolution and acted upon it the packet was sealed upwith a tear of regret as she closed the case upon the pretty forms it containeddirected and placed upon the writingtable in knights room and a letter was written to stephen stating that as yet she hardly understood her position with regard to the money sent but declaring that she was ready to fulfil her promise to marry him after this letter had been written she delayed posting italthough never ceasing to feel strenuously that the deed must be done  several days passed there was another indian letter for elfride coming unexpectedly her father saw it but made no remarkwhy she could not tell the news this time was absolutely overwhelming stephen as he had wished had been actually chosen as the most fitting to execute the ironwork commission he had alluded to as impending this duty completed he would have three months leave his letter continued that he should follow it in a week and should take the opportunity to plainly ask her father to permit the engagement then came a page expressive of his delight and hers at the reunion and finally the information that he would write to the shipping agents asking them to telegraph and tell her when the ship bringing him home should be in sightknowing how acceptable such information would be  elfride lived and moved now as in a dream knight had at first become almost angry at her persistent refusal of his offeringand no less with the manner than the fact of it but he saw that she began to look worn and illand his vexation lessened to simple perplexity  he ceased now to remain in the house for long hours together as before but made it a mere centre for antiquarian and geological excursions in the neighbourhood throw up his cards and go away he fain would have done but could not and thus availing himself of the privileges of a relative he went in and out the premises as fancy led himbut still lingered on  i dont wish to stay here another day if my presence is distasteful he said one afternoon at first you used to imply that i was severe with you and when i am kind you treat me unfairly  no no dont say so  the origin of their acquaintanceship had been such as to render their manner towards each other peculiar and uncommon it was of a kind to cause them to speak out their minds on any feelings of objection and difference to be reticent on gentler matters  i have a good mind to go away and never trouble you again continued knight  she said nothing but the eloquent expression of her eyes and wan face was enough to reproach him for harshness  do you like me to be here then inquired knight gently  yes she said fidelity to the old love and truth to the new were ranged on opposite sides and truth virtuelessly prevailed  then ill stay a little longer said knight  dont be vexed if i keep by myself a good deal will you perhaps something may happen and i may tell you something  mere coyness said knight to himself and went away with a lighter heart the trick of reading truly the enigmatical forces at work in women at given times which with some men is an unerring instinct is peculiar to minds less direct and honest than knights  the next evening about five oclock before knight had returned from a pilgrimage along the shore a man walked up to the house he was a messenger from camelton a town a few miles off to which place the railway had been advanced during the summer  a telegram for miss swancourt and three and sixpence to pay for the special messenger miss swancourt sent out the money signed the paper and opened her letter with a trembling hand she read   johnson liverpool to miss swancourt endelstow near castle boterel  amaryllis telegraphed off holyhead four oclock expect will dock and land passengers at cannings basin ten oclock tomorrow morning   her father called her into the study  elfride who sent you that message he asked suspiciously  johnson who is johnson for heavens sake  i dont know  the deuce you dont who is to know then  i have never heard of him till now  thats a singular story isnt it  i dont know  come come miss what was the telegram  do you really wish to know papa  well i do  remember i am a fullgrown woman now  well what then  being a woman and not a child i may i think have a secret or two  you will it seems  women have as a rule  but dont keep them so speak out  if you will not press me now i give my word to tell you the meaning of all this before the week is past  on your honour  on my honour  very well i have had a certain suspicion you know and i shall be glad to find it false i dont like your manner lately  at the end of the week i said papa  her father did not reply and elfride left the room  she began to look out for the postman again three mornings later he brought an inland letter from stephen it contained very little matter having been written in haste but the meaning was bulky enough stephen said that having executed a commission in liverpool he should arrive at his fathers house east endelstow at five or six oclock that same evening that he would after dusk walk on to the next village and meet her if she would in the church porch as in the old time he proposed this plan because he thought it unadvisable to call formally at her house so late in the evening yet he could not sleep without having seen her the minutes would seem hours till he clasped her in his arms  elfride was still steadfast in her opinion that honour compelled her to meet him probably the very longing to avoid him lent additional weight to the conviction for she was markedly one of those who sigh for the unattainableto whom superlatively a hope is pleasing because not a possession and she knew it so well that her intellect was inclined to exaggerate this defect in herself  so during the day she looked her duty steadfastly in the face read wordsworths astringent yet depressing ode to that deity committed herself to her guidance and still felt the weight of chance desires  but she began to take a melancholy pleasure in contemplating the sacrifice of herself to the man whom a maidenly sense of propriety compelled her to regard as her only possible husband she would meet him and do all that lay in her power to marry him to guard against a relapse a note was at once despatched to his fathers cottage for stephen on his arrival fixing an hour for the interview     chapter xxi       on thy cold grey stones o sea   stephen had said that he should come by way of bristol and thence by a steamer to castle boterel in order to avoid the long journey over the hills from st launces he did not know of the extension of the railway to camelton  during the afternoon a thought occurred to elfride that from any cliff along the shore it would be possible to see the steamer some hours before its arrival  she had accumulated religious force enough to do an act of supererogation the act was thisto go to some point of land and watch for the ship that brought her future husband home  it was a cloudy afternoon elfride was often diverted from a purpose by a dull sky and though she used to persuade herself that the weather was as fine as possible on the other side of the clouds she could not bring about any practical result from this fancy now her mood was such that the humid sky harmonized with it  having ascended and passed over a hill behind the house elfride came to a small stream she used it as a guide to the coast it was smaller than that in her own valley and flowed altogether at a higher level bushes lined the slopes of its shallow trough but at the bottom where the water ran was a soft green carpet in a strip two or three yards wide  in winter the water flowed over the grass in summer as now it trickled along a channel in the midst  elfride had a sensation of eyes regarding her from somewhere she turned and there was mr knight he had dropped into the valley from the side of the hill she felt a thrill of pleasure and rebelliously allowed it to exist  what utter loneliness to find you in  i am going to the shore by tracking the stream i believe it empties itself not far off in a silver thread of water over a cascade of great height  why do you load yourself with that heavy telescope  to look over the sea with it she said faintly  ill carry it for you to your journeys end and he took the glass from her unresisting hands it cannot be half a mile further see there is the water he pointed to a short fragment of level muddygray colour cutting against the sky  elfride had already scanned the small surface of ocean visible and had seen no ship  they walked along in company sometimes with the brook between themfor it was no wider than a mans stridesometimes close together the green carpet grew swampy and they kept higher up  one of the two ridges between which they walked dwindled lower and became insignificant that on the right hand rose with their advance and terminated in a clearly defined edge against the light as if it were abruptly sawn off a little further and the bed of the rivulet ended in the same fashion  they had come to a bank breasthigh and over it the valley was no longer to be seen it was withdrawn cleanly and completely in its place was sky and boundless atmosphere and perpendicularly down beneath themsmall and far offlay the corrugated surface of the atlantic  the small stream here found its death running over the precipice it was dispersed in spray before it was halfway down and falling like rain upon projecting ledges made minute grassy meadows of them at the bottom the waterdrops soaked away amid the debris of the cliff this was the inglorious end of the river  what are you looking for said knight following the direction of her eyes  she was gazing hard at a black objectnearer to the shore than to the horizonfrom the summit of which came a nebulous haze stretching like gauze over the sea  the puffin a little summer steamboatfrom bristol to castle boterel she said i think that is itlook will you give me the glass  knight pulled open the oldfashioned but powerful telescope and handed it to elfride who had looked on with heavy eyes  i cant keep it up now she said  rest it on my shoulder  it is too high  under my arm  too low you may look instead she murmured weakly  knight raised the glass to his eye and swept the sea till the puffin entered its field  yes it is the puffina tiny craft i can see her figurehead distinctlya bird with a beak as big as its head  can you see the deck  wait a minute yes pretty clearly and i can see the black forms of the passengers against its white surface one of them has taken something from anothera glass i thinkyes it isand he is levelling it in this direction depend upon it we are conspicuous objects against the sky to them now it seems to rain upon them and they put on overcoats and open umbrellas they vanish and go belowall but that one who has borrowed the glass he is a slim young fellow and still watches us  elfride grew pale and shifted her little feet uneasily  knight lowered the glass  i think we had better return he said that cloud which is raining on them may soon reach us why you look ill how is that  something in the air affects my face  those fair cheeks are very fastidious i fear returned knight tenderly this air would make those rosy that were never so before one would thinkeh natures spoilt child  elfrides colour returned again  there is more to see behind us after all said knight  she turned her back upon the boat and stephen smith and saw towering still higher than themselves the vertical face of the hill on the right which did not project seaward so far as the bed of the valley but formed the back of a small cove and so was visible like a concave wall bending round from their position towards the left  the composition of the huge hill was revealed to its backbone and marrow here at its rent extremity it consisted of a vast stratification of blackishgray slate unvaried in its whole height by a single change of shade  it is with cliffs and mountains as with persons they have what is called a presence which is not necessarily proportionate to their actual bulk a little cliff will impress you powerfully a great one not at all it depends as with man upon the countenance of the cliff  i cannot bear to look at that cliff said elfride it has a horrid personality and makes me shudder we will go  can you climb said knight if so we will ascend by that path over the grim old fellows brow  try me said elfride disdainfully i have ascended steeper slopes than that  from where they had been loitering a grassy path wound along inside a bank placed as a safeguard for unwary pedestrians to the top of the precipice and over it along the hill in an inland direction  take my arm miss swancourt said knight  i can get on better without it thank you  when they were one quarter of the way up elfride stopped to take breath knight stretched out his hand  she took it and they ascended the remaining slope together reaching the very top they sat down to rest by mutual consent  heavens what an altitude said knight between his pants and looking far over the sea the cascade at the bottom of the slope appeared a mere span in height from where they were now  elfride was looking to the left the steamboat was in full view again and by reason of the vast surface of sea their higher position uncovered it seemed almost close to the shore  over that edge said knight where nothing but vacancy appears is a moving compact mass the wind strikes the face of the rock runs up it rises like a fountain to a height far above our heads curls over us in an arch and disperses behind us in fact an inverted cascade is thereas perfect as the niagara fallsbut rising instead of falling and air instead of water now look here  knight threw a stone over the bank aiming it as if to go onward over the cliff reaching the verge it towered into the air like a bird turned back and alighted on the ground behind them they themselves were in a dead calm  a boat crosses niagara immediately at the foot of the falls where the water is quite still the fallen mass curving under it we are in precisely the same position with regard to our atmospheric cataract here if you run back from the cliff fifty yards you will be in a brisk wind now i daresay over the bank is a little backward current  knight rose and leant over the bank no sooner was his head above it than his hat appeared to be sucked from his headslipping over his forehead in a seaward direction  thats the backward eddy as i told you he cried and vanished over the little bank after his hat  elfride waited one minute he did not return she waited another and there was no sign of him  a few drops of rain fell then a sudden shower  she arose and looked over the bank on the other side were two or three yards of level groundthen a short steep preparatory slopethen the verge of the precipice  on the slope was knight his hat on his head he was on his hands and knees trying to climb back to the level ground the rain had wetted the shaly surface of the incline a slight superficial wetting of the soil hereabout made it far more slippery to stand on than the same soil thoroughly drenched the inner substance was still hard and was lubricated by the moistened film  i find a difficulty in getting back said knight  elfrides heart fell like lead  but you can get back she wildly inquired  knight strove with all his might for two or three minutes and the drops of perspiration began to bead his brow  no i am unable to do it he answered  elfride by a wrench of thought forced away from her mind the sensation that knight was in bodily danger but attempt to help him she must she ventured upon the treacherous incline propped herself with the closed telescope and gave him her hand before he saw her movements  o elfride why did you said he i am afraid you have only endangered yourself  and as if to prove his statement in making an endeavour by her assistance they both slipped lower and then he was again stayed his foot was propped by a bracket of quartz rock balanced on the verge of the precipice fixed by this he steadied her her head being about a foot below the beginning of the slope elfride had dropped the glass it rolled to the edge and vanished over it into a nether sky  hold tightly to me he said  she flung her arms round his neck with such a firm grasp that whilst he remained it was impossible for her to fall  dont be flurried knight continued so long as we stay above this block we are perfectly safe wait a moment whilst i consider what we had better do  he turned his eyes to the dizzy depths beneath them and surveyed the position of affairs  two glances told him a tale with ghastly distinctness it was that unless they performed their feat of getting up the slope with the precision of machines they were over the edge and whirling in midair  for this purpose it was necessary that he should recover the breath and strength which his previous efforts had cost him so he still waited and looked in the face of the enemy  the crest of this terrible natural facade passed among the neighbouring inhabitants as being seven hundred feet above the water it overhung it had been proved by actual measurement to be not a foot less than six hundred and fifty  that is to say it is nearly three times the height of flamborough half as high again as the south foreland a hundred feet higher than beachy headthe loftiest promontory on the east or south side of this islandtwice the height of st aldhelms thrice as high as the lizard and just double the height of st bees one seabord point on the western coast is known to surpass it in altitude but only by a few feet this is great ormes head in caernarvonshire  and it must be remembered that the cliff exhibits an intensifying feature which some of those are withoutsheer perpendicularity from the halftide level  yet this remarkable rampart forms no headland it rather walls in an inletthe promontory on each side being much lower thus far from being salient its horizontal section is concave the sea rolling direct from the shores of north america has in fact eaten a chasm into the middle of a hill and the giant embayed and unobtrusive stands in the rear of pigmy supporters not least singularly neither hill chasm nor precipice has a name on this account i will call the precipice the cliff without a name        see preface  what gave an added terror to its height was its blackness and upon this dark face the beating of ten thousand west winds had formed a kind of bloom which had a visual effect not unlike that of a hambro grape moreover it seemed to float off into the atmosphere and inspire terror through the lungs  this piece of quartz supporting my feet is on the very nose of the cliff said knight breaking the silence after his rigid stoical meditation now what you are to do is this clamber up my body till your feet are on my shoulders when you are there you will i think be able to climb on to level ground  what will you do  wait whilst you run for assistance  i ought to have done that in the first place ought i not  i was in the act of slipping and should have reached no standpoint without your weight in all probability but dont let us talk be brave elfride and climb  she prepared to ascend saying this is the moment i anticipated when on the tower i thought it would come  this is not a time for superstition said knight dismiss all that  i will she said humbly  now put your foot into my hand next the other thats goodwell done hold to my shoulder  she placed her feet upon the stirrup he made of his hand and was high enough to get a view of the natural surface of the hill over the bank  can you now climb on to level ground  i am afraid not i will try  what can you see  the sloping common  what upon it  purple heather and some grass  nothing moreno man or human being of any kind  nobody  now try to get higher in this way you see that tuft of seapink above you get that well into your hand but dont trust to it entirely then step upon my shoulder and i think you will reach the top  with trembling limbs she did exactly as he told her the preternatural quiet and solemnity of his manner overspread upon herself and gave her a courage not her own she made a spring from the top of his shoulder and was up  then she turned to look at him  by an ill fate the force downwards of her bound added to his own weight had been too much for the block of quartz upon which his feet depended it was indeed originally an igneous protrusion into the enormous masses of black strata which had since been worn away from the sides of the alien fragment by centuries of frost and rain and now left it without much support  it moved knight seized a tuft of seapink with each hand  the quartz rock which had been his salvation was worse than useless now it rolled over out of sight and away into the same nether sky that had engulfed the telescope  one of the tufts by which he held came out at the root and knight began to follow the quartz it was a terrible moment elfride uttered a low wild wail of agony bowed her head and covered her face with her hands  between the turfcovered slope and the gigantic perpendicular rock intervened a weatherworn series of jagged edges forming a face yet steeper than the former slope as he slowly slid inch by inch upon these knight made a last desperate dash at the lowest tuft of vegetationthe last outlying knot of starved herbage ere the rock appeared in all its bareness it arrested his further descent knight was now literally suspended by his arms but the incline of the brow being what engineers would call about a quarter in one it was sufficient to relieve his arms of a portion of his weight but was very far from offering an adequately flat face to support him  in spite of this dreadful tension of body and mind knight found time for a moment of thankfulness elfride was safe  she lay on her side above himher fingers clasped seeing him again steady she jumped upon her feet  now if i can only save you by running for help she cried oh i would have died instead why did you try so hard to deliver me and she turned away wildly to run for assistance  elfride how long will it take you to run to endelstow and back  threequarters of an hour  that wont do my hands will not hold out ten minutes and is there nobody nearer  no unless a chance passer may happen to be  he would have nothing with him that could save me is there a pole or stick of any kind on the common  she gazed around the common was bare of everything but heather and grass  a minuteperhaps more timewas passed in mute thought by both on a sudden the blank and helpless agony left her face she vanished over the bank from his sight  knight felt himself in the presence of a personalized loneliness     chapter xxii       a womans way   haggard cliffs of every ugly altitude are as common as seafowl along the line of coast between exmoor and lands end but this outflanked and encompassed specimen was the ugliest of them all their summits are not safe places for scientific experiment on the principles of aircurrents as knight had now found to his dismay  he still clutched the face of the escarpmentnot with the frenzied hold of despair but with a dogged determination to make the most of his every jot of endurance and so give the longest possible scope to elfrides intentions whatever they might be  he reclined hand in hand with the world in its infancy not a blade not an insect which spoke of the present was between him and the past the inveterate antagonism of these black precipices to all strugglers for life is in no way more forcibly suggested than by the paucity of tufts of grass lichens or confervae on their outermost ledges  knight pondered on the meaning of elfrides hasty disappearance but could not avoid an instinctive conclusion that there existed but a doubtful hope for him as far as he could judge his sole chance of deliverance lay in the possibility of a rope or pole being brought and this possibility was remote indeed the soil upon these high downs was left so untended that they were unenclosed for miles except by a casual bank or dry wall and were rarely visited but for the purpose of collecting or counting the flock which found a scanty means of subsistence thereon  at first when death appeared improbable because it had never visited him before knight could think of no future nor of anything connected with his past he could only look sternly at natures treacherous attempt to put an end to him and strive to thwart her  from the fact that the cliff formed the inner face of the segment of a huge cylinder having the sky for a top and the sea for a bottom which enclosed the cove to the extent of more than a semicircle he could see the vertical face curving round on each side of him he looked far down the facade and realized more thoroughly how it threatened him grimness was in every feature and to its very bowels the inimical shape was desolation  by one of those familiar conjunctions of things wherewith the inanimate world baits the mind of man when he pauses in moments of suspense opposite knights eyes was an imbedded fossil standing forth in low relief from the rock it was a creature with eyes the eyes dead and turned to stone were even now regarding him it was one of the early crustaceans called trilobites separated by millions of years in their lives knight and this underling seemed to have met in their death it was the single instance within reach of his vision of anything that had ever been alive and had had a body to save as he himself had now  the creature represented but a low type of animal existence for never in their vernal years had the plains indicated by those numberless slaty layers been traversed by an intelligence worthy of the name zoophytes mollusca shellfish were the highest developments of those ancient dates the immense lapses of time each formation represented had known nothing of the dignity of man they were grand times but they were mean times too and mean were their relics he was to be with the small in his death  knight was a geologist and such is the supremacy of habit over occasion as a pioneer of the thoughts of men that at this dreadful juncture his mind found time to take in by a momentary sweep the varied scenes that had had their day between this creatures epoch and his own there is no place like a cleft landscape for bringing home such imaginings as these  time closed up like a fan before him he saw himself at one extremity of the years face to face with the beginning and all the intermediate centuries simultaneously fierce men clothed in the hides of beasts and carrying for defence and attack huge clubs and pointed spears rose from the rock like the phantoms before the doomed macbeth they lived in hollows woods and mud hutsperhaps in caves of the neighbouring rocks behind them stood an earlier band no man was there huge elephantine forms the mastodon the hippopotamus the tapir antelopes of monstrous size the megatherium and the myledonall for the moment in juxtaposition further back and overlapped by these were perched hugebilled birds and swinish creatures as large as horses still more shadowy were the sinister crocodilian outlinesalligators and other uncouth shapes culminating in the colossal lizard the iguanodon folded behind were dragon forms and clouds of flying reptiles still underneath were fishy beings of lower development and so on till the lifetime scenes of the fossil confronting him were a present and modern condition of things these images passed before knights inner eye in less than half a minute and he was again considering the actual present was he to die the mental picture of elfride in the world without himself to cherish her smote his heart like a whip he had hoped for deliverance but what could a girl do he dared not move an inch was death really stretching out his hand the previous sensation that it was improbable he would die was fainter now  however knight still clung to the cliff  to those musing weatherbeaten westcountry folk who pass the greater part of their days and nights out of doors nature seems to have moods in other than a poetical sense predilections for certain deeds at certain times without any apparent law to govern or season to account for them she is read as a person with a curious temper as one who does not scatter kindnesses and cruelties alternately impartially and in order but heartless severities or overwhelming generosities in lawless caprice mans case is always that of the prodigals favourite or the misers pensioner in her unfriendly moments there seems a feline fun in her tricks begotten by a foretaste of her pleasure in swallowing the victim  such a way of thinking had been absurd to knight but he began to adopt it now he was first spitted on to a rock new tortures followed the rain increased and persecuted him with an exceptional persistency which he was moved to believe owed its cause to the fact that he was in such a wretched state already an entirely new order of things could be observed in this introduction of rain upon the scene it rained upwards instead of down the strong ascending air carried the raindrops with it in its race up the escarpment coming to him with such velocity that they stuck into his flesh like cold needles each drop was virtually a shaft and it pierced him to his skin the watershafts seemed to lift him on their points no downward rain ever had such a torturing effect in a brief space he was drenched except in two places these were on the top of his shoulders and on the crown of his hat  the wind though not intense in other situations was strong here it tugged at his coat and lifted it we are mostly accustomed to look upon all opposition which is not animate as that of the stolid inexorable hand of indifference which wears out the patience more than the strength here at any rate hostility did not assume that slow and sickening form it was a cosmic agency active lashing eager for conquest determination not an insensate standing in the way  knight had overestimated the strength of his hands they were getting weak already she will never come again she has been gone ten minutes he said to himself  this mistake arose from the unusual compression of his experiences just now she had really been gone but three  as many more minutes will be my end he thought  next came another instance of the incapacity of the mind to make comparisons at such times  this is a summer afternoon he said and there can never have been such a heavy and cold rain on a summer day in my life before  he was again mistaken the rain was quite ordinary in quantity the air in temperature it was as is usual the menacing attitude in which they approached him that magnified their powers  he again looked straight downwards the wind and the waterdashes lifting his moustache scudding up his cheeks under his eyelids and into his eyes this is what he saw down there the surface of the seavisually just past his toes and under his feet actually oneeighth of a mile or more than two hundred yards below them we colour according to our moods the objects we survey the sea would have been a deep neutral blue had happier auspices attended the gazer it was now no otherwise than distinctly black to his vision that narrow white border was foam he knew well but its boisterous tosses were so distant as to appear a pulsation only and its plashing was barely audible a white border to a black seahis funeral pall and its edging  the world was to some extent turned upside down for him rain descended from below beneath his feet was aerial space and the unknown above him was the firm familiar ground and upon it all that he loved best  pitiless nature had then two voices and two only the nearer was the voice of the wind in his ears rising and falling as it mauled and thrust him hard or softly the second and distant one was the moan of that unplummetted ocean below and afarrubbing its restless flank against the cliff without a name  knight perseveringly held fast had he any faith in elfride perhaps love is faith and faith like a gathered flower will rootlessly live on  nobody would have expected the sun to shine on such an evening as this yet it appeared low down upon the sea not with its natural golden fringe sweeping the furthest ends of the landscape not with the strange glare of whiteness which it sometimes puts on as an alternative to colour but as a splotch of vermilion red upon a leaden grounda red face looking on with a drunken leer  most men who have brains know it and few are so foolish as to disguise this fact from themselves or others even though an ostentatious display may be called selfconceit knight without showing it much knew that his intellect was above the average and he thoughthe could not help thinkingthat his death would be a deliberate loss to earth of good material that such an experiment in killing might have been practised upon some less developed life  a fancy some people hold when in a bitter mood is that inexorable circumstance only tries to prevent what intelligence attempts renounce a desire for a longcontested position and go on another tack and after a while the prize is thrown at you seemingly in disappointment that no more tantalizing is possible  knight gave up thoughts of life utterly and entirely and turned to contemplate the dark valley and the unknown future beyond into the shadowy depths of these speculations we will not follow him let it suffice to state what ensued  at that moment of taking no more thought for this life something disturbed the outline of the bank above him a spot appeared it was the head of elfride  knight immediately prepared to welcome life again  the expression of a face consigned to utter loneliness when a friend first looks in upon it is moving in the extreme in rowing seaward to a lightship or seagirt lighthouse where without any immediate terror of death the inmates experience the gloom of monotonous seclusion the grateful eloquence of their countenances at the greeting expressive of thankfulness for the visit is enough to stir the emotions of the most careless observer  knights upward look at elfride was of a nature with but far transcending such an instance as this the lines of his face had deepened to furrows and every one of them thanked her visibly his lips moved to the word elfride though the emotion evolved no sound his eyes passed all description in their combination of the whole diapason of eloquence from lovers deep love to fellowmans gratitude for a token of remembrance from one of his kind  elfride had come back what she had come to do he did not know she could only look on at his death perhaps still she had come back and not deserted him utterly and it was much  it was a novelty in the extreme to see henry knight to whom elfride was but a child who had swayed her as a tree sways a birds nest who mastered her and made her weep most bitterly at her own insignificance thus thankful for a sight of her face she looked down upon him her face glistening with rain and tears he smiled faintly  how calm he is she thought how great and noble he is to be so calm she would have died ten times for him then  the gliding form of the steamboat caught her eye she heeded it no longer  how much longer can you wait came from her pale lips and along the wind to his position  four minutes said knight in a weaker voice than her own  but with a good hope of being saved  seven or eight  he now noticed that in her arms she bore a bundle of white linen and that her form was singularly attenuated so preternaturally thin and flexible was elfride at this moment that she appeared to bend under the light blows of the rainshafts as they struck into her sides and bosom and splintered into spray on her face there is nothing like a thorough drenching for reducing the protuberances of clothes but elfrides seemed to cling to her like a glove  without heeding the attack of the clouds further than by raising her hand and wiping away the spirts of rain when they went more particularly into her eyes she sat down and hurriedly began rending the linen into strips these she knotted end to end and afterwards twisted them like the strands of a cord in a short space of time she had formed a perfect rope by this means six or seven yards long  can you wait while i bind it she said anxiously extending her gaze down to him  yes if not very long hope has given me a wonderful instalment of strength  elfride dropped her eyes again tore the remaining material into narrow tapelike ligaments knotted each to each as before but on a smaller scale and wound the lengthy string she had thus formed round and round the linen rope which without this binding had a tendency to spread abroad  now said knight who watching the proceedings intently had by this time not only grasped her scheme but reasoned further on i can hold three minutes longer yet and do you use the time in testing the strength of the knots one by one  she at once obeyed tested each singly by putting her foot on the rope between each knot and pulling with her hands one of the knots slipped  oh think it would have broken but for your forethought elfride exclaimed apprehensively  she retied the two ends the rope was now firm in every part  when you have let it down said knight already resuming his position of ruling power go back from the edge of the slope and over the bank as far as the rope will allow you then lean down and hold the end with both hands  he had first thought of a safer plan for his own deliverance but it involved the disadvantage of possibly endangering her life  i have tied it round my waist she cried and i will lean directly upon the bank holding with my hands as well  it was the arrangement he had thought of but would not suggest  i will raise and drop it three times when i am behind the bank she continued to signify that i am ready take care oh take the greatest care i beg you  she dropped the rope over him to learn how much of its length it would be necessary to expend on that side of the bank went back and disappeared as she had done before  the rope was trailing by knights shoulders in a few moments it twitched three times  he waited yet a second or two then laid hold  the incline of this upper portion of the precipice to the length only of a few feet useless to a climber emptyhanded was invaluable now not more than half his weight depended entirely on the linen rope half a dozen extensions of the arms alternating with half a dozen seizures of the rope with his feet brought him up to the level of the soil  he was saved and by elfride  he extended his cramped limbs like an awakened sleeper and sprang over the bank  at sight of him she leapt to her feet with almost a shriek of joy knights eyes met hers and with supreme eloquence the glance of each told a longconcealed tale of emotion in that short halfmoment moved by an impulse neither could resist they ran together and into each others arms  at the moment of embracing elfrides eyes involuntarily flashed towards the puffin steamboat it had doubled the point and was no longer to be seen  an overwhelming rush of exultation at having delivered the man she revered from one of the most terrible forms of death shook the gentle girl to the centre of her soul it merged in a defiance of duty to stephen and a total recklessness as to plighted faith every nerve of her will was now in entire subjection to her feelingvolition as a guiding power had forsaken her to remain passive as she remained now encircled by his arms was a sufficiently complete resulta glorious crown to all the years of her life perhaps he was only grateful and did not love her no matter it was infinitely more to be even the slave of the greater than the queen of the less some such sensation as this though it was not recognized as a finished thought raced along the impressionable soul of elfride  regarding their attitude it was impossible for two persons to go nearer to a kiss than went knight and elfride during those minutes of impulsive embrace in the pelting rain yet they did not kiss knights peculiarity of nature was such that it would not allow him to take advantage of the unguarded and passionate avowal she had tacitly made  elfride recovered herself and gently struggled to be free  he reluctantly relinquished her and then surveyed her from crown to toe she seemed as small as an infant he perceived whence she had obtained the rope  elfride my elfride he exclaimed in gratified amazement  i must leave you now she said her face doubling its red with an expression between gladness and shame you follow me but at some distance  the rain and wind pierce you through the chill will kill you god bless you for such devotion take my coat and put it on  no i shall get warm running  elfride had absolutely nothing between her and the weather but her exterior robe or costume the door had been made upon a womans wit and it had found its way out behind the bank whilst knight reclined upon the dizzy slope waiting for death she had taken off her whole clothing and replaced only her outer bodice and skirt every thread of the remainder lay upon the ground in the form of a woollen and cotton rope  i am used to being wet through she added i have been drenched on pansy dozens of times goodbye till we meet clothed and in our right minds by the fireside at home  she then ran off from him through the pelting rain like a hare or more like a pheasant when scampering away with a lowered tail it has a mind to fly but does not elfride was soon out of sight  knight felt uncomfortably wet and chilled but glowing with fervour nevertheless he fully appreciated elfrides girlish delicacy in refusing his escort in the meagre habiliments she wore yet felt that necessary abstraction of herself for a short halfhour as a most grievous loss to him  he gathered up her knotted and twisted plumage of linen lace and embroidery work and laid it across his arm he noticed on the ground an envelope limp and wet in endeavouring to restore this to its proper shape he loosened from the envelope a piece of paper it had contained which was seized by the wind in falling from knights hand it was blown to the right blown to the leftit floated to the edge of the cliff and over the sea where it was hurled aloft it twirled in the air and then flew back over his head  knight followed the paper and secured it having done so he looked to discover if it had been worth securing  the troublesome sheet was a bankers receipt for two hundred pounds placed to the credit of miss swancourt which the impractical girl had totally forgotten she carried with her  knight folded it as carefully as its moist condition would allow put it in his pocket and followed elfride     chapter xxiii       should auld acquaintance be forgot   by this time stephen smith had stepped out upon the quay at castle boterel and breathed his native air  a darker skin a more pronounced moustache and an incipient beard were the chief additions and changes noticeable in his appearance  in spite of the falling rain which had somewhat lessened he took a small valise in his hand and leaving the remainder of his luggage at the inn ascended the hills towards east endelstow this place lay in a vale of its own further inland than the west village and though so near it had little of physical feature in common with the latter east endelstow was more wooded and fertile it boasted of lord luxellians mansion and park and was free from those bleak open uplands which lent such an air of desolation to the vicinage of the coastalways excepting the small valley in which stood the vicarage and mrs swancourts old house the crags  stephen had arrived nearly at the summit of the ridge when the rain again increased its volume and looking about for temporary shelter he ascended a steep path which penetrated dense hazel bushes in the lower part of its course further up it emerged upon a ledge immediately over the turnpikeroad and sheltered by an overhanging face of rubble rock with bushes above for a reason of his own he made this spot his refuge from the storm and turning his face to the left conned the landscape as a book  he was overlooking the valley containing elfrides residence  from this point of observation the prospect exhibited the peculiarity of being either brilliant foreground or the subdued tone of distance a sudden dip in the surface of the country lowering out of sight all the intermediate prospect in apparent contact with the trees and bushes growing close beside him appeared the distant tract terminated suddenly by the brink of the series of cliffs which culminated in the tall giant without a namesmall and unimportant as here beheld a leaf on a bough at stephens elbow blotted out a whole hill in the contrasting district far away a green bunch of nuts covered a complete upland there and the great cliff itself was outvied by a pigmy crag in the bank hard by him stephen had looked upon these things hundreds of times before today but he had never viewed them with such tenderness as now  stepping forward in this direction yet a little further he could see the tower of west endelstow church beneath which he was to meet his elfride that night and at the same time he noticed coming over the hill from the cliffs a white speck in motion it seemed first to be a seagull flying low but ultimately proved to be a human figure running with great rapidity the form flitted on heedless of the rain which had caused stephens halt in this place dropped down the heathery hill entered the vale and was out of sight  whilst he meditated upon the meaning of this phenomenon he was surprised to see swim into his ken from the same point of departure another moving speck as different from the first as well could be insomuch that it was perceptible only by its blackness slowly and regularly it took the same course and there was not much doubt that this was the form of a man he too gradually descended from the upper levels and was lost in the valley below  the rain had by this time again abated and stephen returned to the road looking ahead he saw two men and a cart they were soon obscured by the intervention of a high hedge just before they emerged again he heard voices in conversation  a must soon be in the naibourhood too if so be hes acoming said a tenor tongue which stephen instantly recognized as martin cannisters  a must a blieve said another voicethat of stephens father  stephen stepped forward and came before them face to face his father and martin were walking dressed in their second best suits and beside them rambled along a grizzel horse and brightly painted springcart  all right mr cannister heres the lost man exclaimed young smith entering at once upon the old style of greeting father here i am  all right my sonny and glad i be fort returned john smith overjoyed to see the young man how be ye well come along home and dont lets bide out here in the damp such weather must be terrible bad for a young chap just come from a fiery nation like indy hey naibour cannister  trew trew and about getting home his traps boxes monstrous bales and noble packages of foreign description i make no doubt  hardly all that said stephen laughing  we brought the cart maning to go right on to castle boterel afore ye landed said his father put in the horse says martin ay says i so we will and did it straightway now maybe martin had better go on wi the cart for the things and you and i walk homealong  and i shall be back amost as soon as you peggy is a pretty step still though time d begin to tell upon her as upon the rest o us  stephen told martin where to find his baggage and then continued his journey homeward in the company of his father  owing to your coming a day sooner than we first expected said john youll find us in a turk of a mess sirsir says i to my own son but yeve gone up so stephen weve killed the pig this morning for ye thinking yed be hungry and glad of a morsel of fresh mate and a wont be cut up till tonight however we can make ye a good supper of fry which will chaw up well wi a dab o mustard and a few nice new taters and a drop of shilling ale to wash it down your mother have scrubbed the house through because ye were coming and dusted all the chimmer furniture and bought a new basin and jug of a travelling crockerywoman that came to our door and scoured the cannelsticks and claned the winders ay i dont know what a hant a done never were such a steer a blieve  conversation of this kind and inquiries of stephen for his mothers wellbeing occupied them for the remainder of the journey when they drew near the river and the cottage behind it they could hear the mastermasons clock striking off the bygone hours of the day at intervals of a quarter of a minute during which intervals stephens imagination readily pictured his mothers forefinger wandering round the dial in company with the minutehand  the clock stopped this morning and your mother in putting en right seemingly said his father in an explanatory tone and they went up the garden to the door  when they had entered and stephen had dutifully and warmly greeted his motherwho appeared in a cotton dress of a darkblue ground covered broadcast with a multitude of new and full moons stars and planets with an occasional dash of a cometlike aspect to diversify the scenethe crackle of cartwheels was heard outside and martin cannister stamped in at the doorway in the form of a pair of legs beneath a great box his body being nowhere visible when the luggage had been all taken down and stephen had gone upstairs to change his clothes mrs smiths mind seemed to recover a lost thread  really our clock is not worth a penny she said turning to it and attempting to start the pendulum  stopped again inquired martin with commiseration  yes sure replied mrs smith and continued after the manner of certain matrons to whose tongues the harmony of a subject with a casual mood is a greater recommendation than its pertinence to the occasion john would spend pounds a year upon the jimcrack old thing if he might in having it claned when at the same time you may doctor it yourself as well the clocks stopped again john i say to him better have en claned says he theres five shillings that clock grinds again i say to en better have en claned a says again that clock strikes wrong john says i better have en claned he goes on the wheels would have been polished to skeletons by this time if i had listened to en and i assure you we could have bought a chaineyfaced beauty wi the good money weve flung away these last ten years upon this old greenfaced mortal and martin you must be wet my son is gone up to change john is damper than i should like to be but a calls it nothing some of mrs swancourts servants have been herethey ran in out of the rain when going for a walkand i assure you the state of their bonnets was frightful  hows the folks weve been over to castle boterel and what wi running and stopping out of the storms my poor head is beyond everything fizz fizz fizz tis frying o fish from morning to night said a cracked voice in the doorway at this instant  lord sos whos that said mrs smith in a private exclamation and turning round saw william worm endeavouring to make himself look passing civil and friendly by overspreading his face with a large smile that seemed to have no connection with the humour he was in behind him stood a woman about twice his size with a large umbrella over her head this was mrs worm williams wife  come in william said john smith we dont kill a pig every day and you likewise mrs worm i make ye welcome

who had been all this time engaged in closing her umbrella corroborated this statement and now coming indoors showed herself to be a widefaced comfortablelooking woman with a wart upon her cheek bearing a small tuft of hair in its centre  have ye ever tried anything to cure yer noise maister worm inquired martin cannister  oh ay bless ye ive tried everything ay providence is a merciful man and i have hoped hed have found it out by this time living so many years in a parsons family too as i have but a dont seem to relieve me ay i be a poor wambling man and lifes a mint o trouble  true mournful true william worm tis so the world wants looking to or tis all sixes and sevens wi us  take your things off mrs worm said mrs smith we be rather in a muddle to tell the truth for my son is just dropped in from indy a day sooner than we expected and the pigkiller is coming presently to cut up  mrs barbara worm not wishing to take any mean advantage of persons in a muddle by observing them removed her bonnet and mantle with eyes fixed upon the flowers in the plot outside the door  what beautiful tigerlilies said mrs worm  yes they be very well but such a trouble to me on account of the children that come here they will go eating the berries on the stem and call em currants taste wi junivals is quite fancy really  and your snapdragons look as fierce as ever  well really answered mrs smith entering didactically into the subject they are more like christians than flowers but they make up well enough wi the rest and dont require much tending and the same can be said o these millers wheels tis a flower i like very much though so simple john says he never cares about the flowers o em but men have no eye for anything neat he says his favourite flower is a cauliflower and i assure you i tremble in the springtime for tis perfect murder  you dont say so mrs smith  john digs round the roots you know in goes his blundering spade through roots bulbs everything that hasnt got a good show above ground turning em up cut all to slices only the very last fall i went to move some tulips when i found every bulb upside down and the stems crooked round he had turned em over in the spring and the cunning creatures had soon found that heaven was not where it used to be  whats that longfavoured flower under the hedge  they o lord they are the horrid jacobs ladders instead of praising em i be mad wi em for being so ready to bide where they are not wanted they be very well in their way but i do not care for things that neglect wont kill do what i will dig drag scrap pull i get too many of em i chop the roots up theyll come treble strong throw em over hedge there theyll grow staring me in the face like a hungry dog driven away and creep back again in a week or two the same as before tis jacobs ladder here jacobs ladder there and plant em where nothing in the world will grow you get crowds of em in a month or two john made a new manure mixen last summer and he said maria now if youve got any flowers or such like that you dont want you may plant em round my mixen so as to hide it a bit though tis not likely anything of much value will grow there i thought theres them jacobs ladders ill put them there since they cant do harm in such a place and i planted the jacobs ladders sure enough they growed and they growed in the mixen and out of the mixen all over the litter covering it quite up when john wanted to use it about the garden a said nation seize them jacobs ladders of yours maria theyve eat the goodness out of every morsel of my manure so that tis no better than sand itself sure enough the hungry mortals had tis my belief that in the secret souls o em jacobs ladders be weeds and not flowers at all if the truth was known  robert lickpan pigkiller and carrier arrived at this moment the fatted animal hanging in the back kitchen was cleft down the middle of its backbone mrs smith being meanwhile engaged in cooking supper  between the cutting and chopping ale was handed round and worm and the pigkiller listened to john smiths description of the meeting with stephen with eyes blankly fixed upon the tablecloth in order that nothing in the external world should interrupt their efforts to conjure up the scene correctly  stephen came downstairs in the middle of the story and after the little interruption occasioned by his entrance and welcome the narrative was again continued precisely as if he had not been there at all and was told inclusively to him as to somebody who knew nothing about the matter  ay i said as i catched sight o en through the brimbles thats the lad for i d know en by his grandfathers walk for a stapped out like poor father for all the world still there was a touch o the frisky that set me wondering a got closer and i said thats the lad for i d know en by his carrying a black case like a travelling man still a road is common to all the world and there be more travelling men than one but i kept my eye cocked and i said to martin tis the boy now for i d know en by the wold twirl o the stick and the family step then a come closer and a said all right i could swear to en then  stephens personal appearance was next criticised  he d look a deal thinner in face surely than when i seed en at the parsons and never knowed en if yell believe me said martin  ay there said another without removing his eyes from stephens face i should ha knowed en anywhere tis his fathers nose to a t  it has been often remarked said stephen modestly  and hes certainly taller said martin letting his glance run over stephens form from bottom to top  i was thinking a was exactly the same height worm replied  bless thy soul thats because hes bigger round likewise and the united eyes all moved to stephens waist  i be a poor wambling man but i can make allowances said william worm ah sure and how he came as a stranger and pilgrim to parson swancourts that time not a soul knowing en after so many years ay lifes a strange picter stephen but i suppose i must say sir to ye  oh it is not necessary at present stephen replied though mentally resolving to avoid the vicinity of that familiar friend as soon as he had made pretensions to the hand of elfride  ah well said worm musingly some would have looked for no less than a sir theres a sight of difference in people  and in pigs likewise observed john smith looking at the halved carcass of his own  robert lickpan the pigkiller here seemed called upon to enter the lists of conversation  yes theyve got their particular naters goodnow he remarked initially manys the rumtempered pig ive knowed  i dont doubt it master lickpan answered martin in a tone expressing that his convictions no less than good manners demanded the reply  yes continued the pigkiller as one accustomed to be heard one that i knowed was deaf and dumb and we couldnt make out what was the matter wi the pig a would eat well enough when a seed the trough but when his back was turned you might arattled the bucket all day the poor soul never heard ye ye could play tricks upon en behind his back and a wouldnt find it out no quicker than poor deaf grammer cates but a fatted well and i never seed a pig open better when a was killed and a was very tender eating very as pretty a bit of mate as ever you see you could suck that mate through a quill  and another i knowed resumed the killer after quietly letting a pint of ale run down his throat of its own accord and setting down the cup with mathematical exactness upon the spot from which he had raised itanother went out of his mind  how very mournful murmured mrs worm  ay poor thing a did as clean out of his mind as the cleverest christian could go in early life a was very melancholy and never seemed a hopeful pig by no means twas andrew stainers pigthats whose pig twas  i can mind the pig well enough attested john smith  and a pretty little porker a was and you all know farmer buckles sort every jack o em suffer from the rheumatism to this day owing to a damp sty they lived in when they were striplings as twere  well now well weigh said john  if so be he were not so fine wed weigh en whole but as he is well take a side at a time john you can mind my old joke ey  i do so though twas a good few years ago i first heard en  yes said lickpan that there old familiar joke have been in our family for generations i may say my father used that joke regular at pigkillings for more than five and forty yearsthe time he followed the calling and a told me that a had it from his father when he was quite a chiel who made use o en just the same at every killing more or less and pigkillings were pigkillings in those days  trewly they were  ive never heard the joke said mrs smith tentatively  nor i chimed in mrs worm who being the only other lady in the room felt bound by the laws of courtesy to feel like mrs smith in everything  surely surely you have said the killer looking sceptically at the benighted females however tisnt muchi dont wish to say it is it commences like this bob will tell the weight of your pig a blieve says i the congregation of neighbours think i mane my son bob naturally but the secret is that i mane the bob o the steelyard ha ha ha  haw haw haw laughed martin cannister who had heard the explanation of this striking story for the hundredth time  huh huh huh laughed john smith who had heard it for the thousandth  hee hee hee laughed william worm who had never heard it at all but was afraid to say so  thy grandfather robert must have been a wideawake chap to make that story said martin cannister subsiding to a placid aspect of delighted criticism  he had a head by all account and you see as the firstborn of the lickpans have all been roberts theyve all been bobs so the story was handed down to the present day  poor joseph your second boy will never be able to bring it out in company which is rather unfortunate said mrs worm thoughtfully  a wont yes grandfer was a clever chap as ye say but i knowed a cleverer twas my uncle levi uncle levi made a snuffbox that should be a puzzle to his friends to open he used to hand en round at wedding parties christenings funerals and in other jolly company and let em try their skill this extraordinary snuffbox had a spring behind that would push in and outa hinge where seemed to be the cover a slide at the end a screw in front and knobs and queer notches everywhere one man would try the spring another would try the screw another would try the slide but try as they would the box wouldnt open and they couldnt open en and they didnt open en now what might you think was the secret of that box  all put on an expression that their united thoughts were inadequate to the occasion  why the box wouldnt open at all a were made not to open and ye might have tried till the end of revelations twould have been as naught for the box were glued all round  a very deep man to have made such a box  yes twas like uncle levi all over  twas i can mind the man very well tallest man ever i seed  a was so he never slept upon a bedstead after he growed up a hard boychapnever could get one long enough when a lived in that little small house by the pond he used to have to leave open his chamber door every night at going to his bed and let his feet poke out upon the landing  hes dead and gone now nevertheless poor man as we all shall observed worm to fill the pause which followed the conclusion of robert lickpans speech  the weighing and cutting up was pursued amid an animated discourse on stephens travels and at the finish the firstfruits of the days slaughter fried in onions were then turned from the pan into a dish on the table each piece steaming and hissing till it reached their very mouths  it must be owned that the gentlemanly son of the house looked rather out of place in the course of this operation nor was his mind quite philosophic enough to allow him to be comfortable with these oldestablished persons his fathers friends he had never lived long at homescarcely at all since his childhood the presence of william worm was the most awkward feature of the case for though worm had left the house of mr swancourt the being handinglove with a cidevant servitor reminded stephen too forcibly of the vicars classification of himself before he went from england mrs smith was conscious of the defect in her arrangements which had brought about the undesired conjunction she spoke to stephen privately  i am above having such people here stephen but what could i do and your father is so rough in his nature that hes more mixed up with them than need be  never mind mother said stephen ill put up with it now  when we leave my lords service and get further up the countryas i hope we shall soonit will be different we shall be among fresh people and in a larger house and shall keep ourselves up a bit i hope  is miss swancourt at home do you know stephen inquired  yes your father saw her this morning  do you often see her  scarcely ever mr glim the curate calls occasionally but the swancourts dont come into the village now any more than to drive through it they dine at my lords oftener than they used ah heres a note was brought this morning for you by a boy  stephen eagerly took the note and opened it his mother watching him he read what elfride had written and sent before she started for the cliff that afternoon   yes i will meet you in the church at nine tonighte s   i dont know stephen his mother said meaningly wher you still think about miss elfride but if i were you i wouldnt concern about her they say that none of old mrs swancourts money will come to her stepdaughter  i see the evening has turned out fine i am going out for a little while to look round the place he said evading the direct query probably by the time i return our visitors will be gone and well have a more confidential talk     chapter xxiv       breeze bird and flower confess the hour   the rain had ceased since the sunset but it was a cloudy night and the light of the moon softened and dispersed by its misty veil was distributed over the land in pale gray  a dark figure stepped from the doorway of john smiths riverside cottage and strode rapidly towards west endelstow with a light footstep soon ascending from the lower levels he turned a corner followed a carttrack and saw the tower of the church he was in quest of distinctly shaped forth against the sky in less than half an hour from the time of starting he swung himself over the churchyard stile  the wild irregular enclosure was as much as ever an integral part of the old hill the grass was still long the graves were shaped precisely as passing years chose to alter them from their orthodox form as laid down by martin cannister and by stephens own grandfather before him  a sound sped into the air from the direction in which castle boterel lay it was the striking of the church clock distinct in the still atmosphere as if it had come from the tower hard by which wrapt in its solitary silentness gave out no such sounds of life  one two three four five six seven eight nine stephen carefully counted the strokes though he well knew their number beforehand nine oclock it was the hour elfride had herself named as the most convenient for meeting him  stephen stood at the door of the porch and listened he could have heard the softest breathing of any person within the porch nobody was there he went inside the doorway sat down upon the stone bench and waited with a beating heart  the faint sounds heard only accentuated the silence the rising and falling of the sea far away along the coast was the most important a minor sound was the scurr of a distant nighthawk among the minutest where all were minute were the light settlement of gossamer fragments floating in the air a toad humbly labouring along through the grass near the entrance the crackle of a dead leaf which a worm was endeavouring to pull into the earth a waft of air getting nearer and nearer and expiring at his feet under the burden of a winged seed  among all these soft sounds came not the only soft sound he cared to hearthe footfall of elfride  for a whole quarter of an hour stephen sat thus intent without moving a muscle at the end of that time he walked to the west front of the church turning the corner of the tower a white form stared him in the face he started back and recovered himself it was the tomb of young farmer jethway looking still as fresh and as new as when it was first erected the white stone in which it was hewn having a singular weirdness amid the dark blue slabs from local quarries of which the whole remaining gravestones were formed  he thought of the night when he had sat thereon with elfride as his companion and well remembered his regret that she had received even unwillingly earlier homage than his own but his present tangible anxiety reduced such a feeling to sentimental nonsense in comparison and he strolled on over the graves to the border of the churchyard whence in the daytime could be clearly seen the vicarage and the present residence of the swancourts no footstep was discernible upon the path up the hill but a light was shining from a window in the lastnamed house  stephen knew there could be no mistake about the time or place and no difficulty about keeping the engagement he waited yet longer passing from impatience into a mood which failed to take any account of the lapse of time he was awakened from his reverie by castle boterel clock  one two three four five six seven eight nine ten  one little fall of the hammer in addition to the number it had been sharp pleasure to hear and what a difference to him  he left the churchyard on the side opposite to his point of entrance and went down the hill slowly he drew near the gate of her house this he softly opened and walked up the gravel drive to the door here he paused for several minutes  at the expiration of that time the murmured speech of a manly voice came out to his ears through an open window behind the corner of the house this was responded to by a clear soft laugh it was the laugh of elfride  stephen was conscious of a gnawing pain at his heart he retreated as he had come there are disappointments which wring us and there are those which inflict a wound whose mark we bear to our graves such are so keen that no future gratification of the same desire can ever obliterate them they become registered as a permanent loss of happiness such a one was stephens now the crowning aureola of the dream had been the meeting here by stealth and if elfride had come to him only ten minutes after he had turned away the disappointment would have been recognizable still  when the young man reached home he found there a letter which had arrived in his absence believing it to contain some reason for her nonappearance yet unable to imagine one that could justify her he hastily tore open the envelope  the paper contained not a word from elfride it was the depositnote for his two hundred pounds on the back was the form of a cheque and this she had filled up with the same sum payable to the bearer  stephen was confounded he attempted to divine her motive considering how limited was his knowledge of her later actions he guessed rather shrewdly that between the time of her sending the note in the morning and the evenings silent refusal of his gift something had occurred which had caused a total change in her attitude towards him  he knew not what to do it seemed absurd now to go to her father next morning as he had purposed and ask for an engagement with her a possibility impending all the while that elfride herself would not be on his side only one course recommended itself as wise to wait and see what the days would bring forth to go and execute his commissions in birmingham then to return learn if anything had happened and try what a meeting might do perhaps her surprise at his backwardness would bring her forward to show latent warmth as decidedly as in old times  this act of patience was in keeping only with the nature of a man precisely of stephens constitution nine men out of ten would perhaps have rushed off got into her presence by fair means or foul and provoked a catastrophe of some sort possibly for the better probably for the worse  he started for birmingham the next morning a days delay would have made no difference but he could not rest until he had begun and ended the programme proposed to himself bodily activity will sometimes take the sting out of anxiety as completely as assurance itself     chapter xxv       mine own familiar friend   during these days of absence stephen lived under alternate conditions whenever his emotions were active he was in agony whenever he was not in agony the business in hand had driven out of his mind by sheer force all deep reflection on the subject of elfride and love  by the time he took his return journey at the weeks end stephen had very nearly worked himself up to an intention to call and see her face to face on this occasion also he adopted his favourite routeby the little summer steamer from bristol to castle boterel the time saved by speed on the railway being wasted at junctions and in following a devious course  it was a bright silent evening at the beginning of september when smith again set foot in the little town he felt inclined to linger awhile upon the quay before ascending the hills having formed a romantic intention to go home by way of her house yet not wishing to wander in its neighbourhood till the evening shades should sufficiently screen him from observation  and thus waiting for nights nearer approach he watched the placid scene over which the pale luminosity of the west cast a sorrowful monochrome that became slowly embrowned by the dusk a star appeared and another and another they sparkled amid the yards and rigging of the two coal brigs lying alangside as if they had been tiny lamps suspended in the ropes the masts rocked sleepily to the infinitesimal flux of the tide which clucked and gurgled with idle regularity in nooks and holes of the harbour wall  the twilight was now quite pronounced enough for his purpose and as rather sad at heart he was about to move on a little boat containing two persons glided up the middle of the harbour with the lightness of a shadow the boat came opposite him passed on and touched the landingsteps at the further end one of its occupants was a man as stephen had known by the easy stroke of the oars when the pair ascended the steps and came into greater prominence he was enabled to discern that the second personage was a woman also that she wore a white decorationapparently a featherin her hat or bonnet which spot of white was the only distinctly visible portion of her clothing  stephen remained a moment in their rear and they passed on when he pursued his way also and soon forgot the circumstance having crossed a bridge forsaken the high road and entered the footpath which led up the vale to west endelstow he heard a little wicket click softly together some yards ahead by the time that stephen had reached the wicket and passed it he heard another click of precisely the same nature from another gate yet further on clearly some person or persons were preceding him along the path their footsteps being rendered noiseless by the soft carpet of turf stephen now walked a little quicker and perceived two forms one of them bore aloft the white feather he had noticed in the womans hat on the quay they were the couple he had seen in the boat stephen dropped a little further to the rear  from the bottom of the valley along which the path had hitherto lain beside the margin of the trickling streamlet another path now diverged and ascended the slope of the lefthand hill this footway led only to the residence of mrs swancourt and a cottage or two in its vicinity no grass covered this diverging path in portions of its length and stephen was reminded that the pair in front of him had taken this route by the occasional rattle of loose stones under their feet stephen climbed in the same direction but for some undefined reason he trod more softly than did those preceding him his mind was unconsciously in exercise upon whom the woman might bewhether a visitor to the crags a servant or elfride he put it to himself yet more forcibly could the lady be elfride a possible reason for her unaccountable failure to keep the appointment with him returned with painful force  they entered the grounds of the house by the side wicket whence the path now wide and well trimmed wound fantastically through the shrubbery to an octagonal pavilion called the belvedere by reason of the comprehensive view over the adjacent district that its green seats afforded the path passed this erection and went on to the house as well as to the gardeners cottage on the other side straggling thence to east endelstow so that stephen felt no hesitation in entering a promenade which could scarcely be called private  he fancied that he heard the gate open and swing together again behind him turning he saw nobody  the people of the boat came to the summerhouse one of them spoke  i am afraid we shall get a scolding for being so late  stephen instantly recognised the familiar voice richer and fuller now than it used to be elfride he whispered to himself and held fast by a sapling to steady himself under the agitation her presence caused him his heart swerved from its beat he shunned receiving the meaning he sought  a breeze is rising again how the ash tree rustles said elfride dont you hear it i wonder what the time is  stephen relinquished the sapling  i will get a light and tell you step into the summerhouse the air is quiet there  the cadence of that voiceits peculiarity seemed to come home to him like that of some notes of the northern birds on his return to his native clime as an old natural thing renewed yet not particularly noticed as natural before that renewal  they entered the belvedere in the lower part it was formed of close woodwork nailed crosswise and had openings in the upper by way of windows  the scratch of a striking light was heard and a bright glow radiated from the interior of the building the light gave birth to dancing leafshadows stemshadows lustrous streaks dots sparkles and threads of silver sheen of all imaginable variety and transience it awakened gnats which flew towards it revealed shiny gossamer threads disturbed earthworms stephen gave but little attention to these phenomena and less time he saw in the summerhouse a strongly illuminated picture  first the face of his friend and preceptor henry knight between whom and himself an estrangement had arisen not from any definite causes beyond those of absence increasing age and diverging sympathies  next his bright particular star elfride the face of elfride was more womanly than when she had called herself his but as clear and healthy as ever her plenteous twines of beautiful hair were looking much as usual with the exception of a slight modification in their arrangement in deference to the changes of fashion  their two foreheads were close together almost touching and both were looking down elfride was holding her watch knight was holding the light with one hand his left arm being round her waist part of the scene reached stephens eyes through the horizontal bars of woodwork which crossed their forms like the ribs of a skeleton  knights arm stole still further round the waist of elfride  it is halfpast eight she said in a low voice which had a peculiar music in it seemingly born of a thrill of pleasure at the new proof that she was beloved  the flame dwindled down died away and all was wrapped in a darkness to which the gloom before the illumination bore no comparison in apparent density stephen shattered in spirit and sick to his hearts centre turned away in turning he saw a shadowy outline behind the summerhouse on the other side his eyes grew accustomed to the darkness was the form a human form or was it an opaque bush of juniper  the lovers arose brushed against the laurestines and pursued their way to the house the indistinct figure had moved and now passed across smiths front so completely enveloped was the person that it was impossible to discern him or her any more than as a shape the shape glided noiselessly on  stephen stepped forward fearing any mischief was intended to the other two who are you he said  never mind who i am answered a weak whisper from the enveloping folds what i am may she be perhaps i knew wellah so wella youth whose place you took as he there now takes yours will you let her break your heart and bring you to an untimely grave as she did the one before you  you are mrs jethway i think what do you do here and why do you talk so wildly  because my heart is desolate and nobody cares about it may hers be so that brought trouble upon me  silence said stephen staunch to elfride in spite of himself she would harm nobody wilfully never would she how do you come here  i saw the two coming up the path and wanted to learn if she were not one of them can i help disliking her if i think of the past can i help watching her if i remember my boy can i help illwishing her if i wellwish him  the bowed form went on passed through the wicket and was enveloped by the shadows of the field  stephen had heard that mrs jethway since the death of her son had become a crazed forlorn woman and bestowing a pitying thought upon her he dismissed her fancied wrongs from his mind but not her condemnation of elfrides faithlessness that entered into and mingled with the sensations his new experience had begotten the tale told by the little scene he had witnessed ran parallel with the unhappy womans opinion which however baseless it might have been antecedently had become true enough as regarded himself  a slow weight of despair as distinct from a violent paroxysm as starvation from a mortal shot filled him and wrung him body and soul the discovery had not been altogether unexpected for throughout his anxiety of the last few days since the night in the churchyard he had been inclined to construe the uncertainty unfavourably for himself his hopes for the best had been but periodic interruptions to a chronic fear of the worst  a strange concomitant of his misery was the singularity of its form that his rival should be knight whom once upon a time he had adored as a man is very rarely adored by another in modern times and whom he loved now added deprecation to sorrow and cynicism to both henry knight whose praises he had so frequently trumpeted in her ears of whom she had actually been jealous lest she herself should be lessened in stephens love on account of him had probably won her the more easily by reason of those very praises which he had only ceased to utter by her command she had ruled him like a queen in that matter as in all others stephen could tell by her manner brief as had been his observation of it and by her words few as they were that her position was far different with knight that she looked up at and adored her new lover from below his pedestal was even more perceptible than that she had smiled down upon stephen from a height above him  the suddenness of elfrides renunciation of himself was food for more torture to an unimpassioned outsider it admitted of at least two interpretationsit might either have proceeded from an endeavour to be faithful to her first choice till the lover seen absolutely overpowered the lover remembered or from a wish not to lose his love till sure of the love of another but to stephen smith the motive involved in the latter alternative made it untenable where elfride was the actor  he mused on her letters to him in which she had never mentioned a syllable concerning knight it is desirable however to observe that only in two letters could she possibly have done so one was written about a week before knights arrival when though she did not mention his promised coming to stephen she had hardly a definite reason in her mind for neglecting to do it in the next she did casually allude to knight but stephen had left bombay long before that letter arrived  stephen looked at the black form of the adjacent house where it cut a dark polygonal notch out of the sky and felt that he hated the spot he did not know many facts of the case but could not help instinctively associating elfrides fickleness with the marriage of her father and their introduction to london society he closed the iron gate bounding the shrubbery as noiselessly as he had opened it and went into the grassy field here he could see the old vicarage the house alone that was associated with the sweet pleasant time of his incipient love for elfride turning sadly from the place that was no longer a nook in which his thoughts might nestle when he was far away he wandered in the direction of the east village to reach his fathers house before they retired to rest  the nearest way to the cottage was by crossing the park he did not hurry happiness frequently has reason for haste but it is seldom that desolation need scramble or strain sometimes he paused under the lowhanging arms of the trees looking vacantly on the ground  stephen was standing thus scarcely less crippled in thought than he was blank in vision when a clear sound permeated the quiet air about him and spread on far beyond the sound was the stroke of a bell from the tower of east endelstow church which stood in a dell not forty yards from lord luxellians mansion and within the park enclosure another stroke greeted his ear and gave character to both then came a slow succession of them  somebody is dead he said aloud  the deathknell of an inhabitant of the eastern parish was being tolled  an unusual feature in the tolling was that it had not been begun according to the custom in endelstow and other parishes in the neighbourhood at every death the sex and age of the deceased were announced by a system of changes three times three strokes signified that the departed one was a man three times two a woman twice three a boy twice two a girl the regular continuity of the tolling suggested that it was the resumption rather than the beginning of a knellthe opening portion of which stephen had not been near enough to hear  the momentary anxiety he had felt with regard to his parents passed away he had left them in perfect health and had any serious illness seized either a communication would have reached him ere this at the same time since his way homeward lay under the churchyard yews he resolved to look into the belfry in passing by and speak a word to martin cannister who would be there  stephen reached the brow of the hill and felt inclined to renounce his idea his mood was such that talking to any person to whom he could not unburden himself would be wearisome however before he could put any inclination into effect the young man saw from amid the trees a bright light shining the rays from which radiated like needles through the sad plumy foliage of the yews its direction was from the centre of the churchyard  stephen mechanically went forward never could there be a greater contrast between two places of like purpose than between this graveyard and that of the further village here the grass was carefully tended and formed virtually a part of the manorhouse lawn flowers and shrubs being planted indiscriminately over both whilst the few graves visible were mathematically exact in shape and smoothness appearing in the daytime like chins newly shaven there was no wall the division between gods acre and lord luxellians being marked only by a few square stones set at equidistant points among those persons who have romantic sentiments on the subject of their last dwellingplace probably the greater number would have chosen such a spot as this in preference to any other a few would have fancied a constraint in its trim neatness and would have preferred the wild hilltop of the neighbouring site with nature in her most negligent attire  the light in the churchyard he next discovered to have its source in a point very near the ground and stephen imagined it might come from a lantern in the interior of a partlydug grave but a nearer approach showed him that its position was immediately under the wall of the aisle and within the mouth of an archway he could now hear voices and the truth of the whole matter began to dawn upon him walking on towards the opening smith discerned on his left hand a heap of earth and before him a flight of stone steps which the removed earth had uncovered leading down under the edifice it was the entrance to a large family vault extending under the north aisle  stephen had never before seen it open and descending one or two steps stooped to look under the arch the vault appeared to be crowded with coffins with the exception of an open central space which had been necessarily kept free for ingress and access to the sides round three of which the coffins were stacked in stone bins or niches  the place was well lighted with candles stuck in slips of wood that were fastened to the wall on making the descent of another step the living inhabitants of the vault were recognizable they were his father the mastermason an undermason martin cannister and two or three young and old labouringmen crowbars and workmens hammers were scattered about the whole company sitting round on coffins which had been removed from their places apparently for some alteration or enlargement of the vault were eating bread and cheese and drinking ale from a cup with two handles passed round from each to each  who is dead stephen inquired stepping down     chapter xxvi       to that last nothing under earth   all eyes were turned to the entrance as stephen spoke and the ancientmannered conclave scrutinized him inquiringly  why tis our stephen said his father rising from his seat and still retaining the frothy mug in his left hand he swung forward his right for a grasp your mother is expecting yethought you would have come afore dark but youll wait and go home with me i have all but done for the day and was going directly  yes tis master stephy sure enough glad to see you so soon again master smith said martin cannister chastening the gladness expressed in his words by a strict neutrality of countenance in order to harmonize the feeling as much as possible with the solemnity of a family vault  the same to you martin and you william said stephen nodding around to the rest who having their mouths full of bread and cheese were of necessity compelled to reply merely by compressing their eyes to friendly lines and wrinkles  and who is dead stephen repeated  lady luxellian poor gentlewoman as we all shall said the undermason ay and we be going to enlarge the vault to make room for her  when did she die  early this morning his father replied with an appearance of recurring to a chronic thought yes this morning martin hev been tolling ever since almost there twas expected she was very limber  ay poor soul this morning resumed the undermason a marvellously old man whose skin seemed so much too large for his body that it would not stay in position she must know by this time whether shes to go up or down poor woman  what was her age  not more than seven or eight and twenty by candlelight but lord by day a was forty if a were an hour  ay nighttime or daytime makes a difference of twenty years to rich feymels observed martin  she was one and thirty really said john smith i had it from them that know  not more than that  a looked very bad poor lady in faith ye might say she was dead for years afore a would own it  as my old father used to say dead but wouldnt drop down  i seed her poor soul said a labourer from behind some removed coffins only but last valentinesday of all the world a was arm in crook wi my lord i says to myself you be ticketed churchyard my noble lady although you dont dream ont  i suppose my lord will write to all the other lords anointed in the nation to let em know that she that was is now no more  tis done and past i see a bundle of letters go off an hour after the death sich wonderful black rims as they letters hadhalfaninch wide at the very least  too much observed martin in short tis out of the question that a human being can be so mournful as black edges halfaninch wide im sure people dont feel more than a very narrow border when they feels most of all  and there are two little girls are there not said stephen  nice clane little facesleft motherless now  they used to come to parson swancourts to play with miss elfride when i were there said william worm ah they did sos the latter sentence was introduced to add the necessary melancholy to a remark which intrinsically could hardly be made to possess enough for the occasion yes continued worm theyd run upstairs theyd run down flitting about with her everywhere very fond of her they were ah well  fonder than ever they were of their mother so tis said here and there added a labourer  well you see tis natural lady luxellian stood aloof from em sowas so drowsylike that they couldnt love her in the jollycompanion way children want to like folks only last winter i seed miss elfride talking to my lady and the two children and miss elfride wiped their noses for em so carefulmy lady never once seeing that it wanted doing and naturally children take to people thats their best friend  be as twill the woman is dead and gone and we must make a place for her said john come lads drink up your ale and well just rid this corner so as to have all clear for beginning at the wall as soon as tis light tomorrow  stephen then asked where lady luxellian was to lie  here said his father we are going to set back this wall and make a recess and tis enough for us to do before the funeral when my lords mother died she said john the place must be enlarged before another can be put in but a never expected twould be wanted so soon better move lord george first i suppose simeon  he pointed with his foot to a heavy coffin covered with what had originally been red velvet the colour of which could only just be distinguished now  just as ye think best master john replied the shrivelled mason ah poor lord george he continued looking contemplatively at the huge coffin he and i were as bitter enemies once as any could be when one is a lord and tother only a mortal man poor fellow hed clap his hand upon my shoulder and cuss me as familial and neighbourly as if hed been a common chap ay a cussed me up hill and a cussed me down and then a would rave out again and the goold clamps of his fine new teeth would glisten in the sun like fetters of brass while i being a small man and poor was fain to say nothing at all such a strappen fine gentleman as he was too yes i rather liked en sometimes but once now and then when i looked at his towering height id think in my inside what a weight youll be my lord for our arms to lower under the aisle of endelstow church some day  and was he inquired a young labourer  he was he was five hundredweight if a were a pound what with his lead and his oak and his handles and his one thing and totherhere the ancient man slapped his hand upon the cover with a force that caused a rattle among the bones insidehe half broke my back when i took his feet to lower en down the steps there ah saith i to john theredidnt i johnthat ever one mans glory should be such a weight upon another man but there i liked my lord george sometimes  tis a strange thought said another that while they be all here under one roof a snug united family o luxellians they be really scattered miles away from one another in the form of good sheep and wicked goats isnt it  true tis a thought to look at  and that one if hes gone upward dont know what his wife is doing no more than the man in the moon if shes gone downward and that some unfortunate one in the hot place is ahollering across to a lucky one up in the clouds and quite forgetting their bodies be boxed close together all the time  ay tis a thought to look at too that i can say hullo close to fiery lord george and a cant hear me  and that i be eating my onion close to dainty lady janes nose and she cant smell me  what do em put all their heads one way for inquired a young man  because tis churchyard law you simple the law of the living is that a man shall be upright and downright and the law of the dead is that a man shall be east and west every state of society have its laws  we must break the law wi a few of the poor souls however come buckle to said the mastermason  and they set to work anew  the order of interment could be distinctly traced by observing the appearance of the coffins as they lay piled around on those which had been standing there but a generation or two the trappings still remained those of an earlier period showed bare wood with a few tattered rags dangling therefrom earlier still the wood lay in fragments on the floor of the niche and the coffin consisted of naked lead alone whilst in the case of the very oldest even the lead was bulging and cracking in pieces revealing to the curious eye a heap of dust within the shields upon many were quite loose and removable by the hand their lustreless surfaces still indistinctly exhibiting the name and title of the deceased  overhead the groins and concavities of the arches curved in all directions dropping low towards the walls where the height was no more than sufficient to enable a person to stand upright  the body of george the fourteenth baron together with two or three others all of more recent date than the great bulk of coffins piled there had for want of room been placed at the end of the vault on tressels and not in niches like the others these it was necessary to remove to form behind them the chamber in which they were ultimately to be deposited stephen finding the place and proceedings in keeping with the sombre colours of his mind waited there still  simeon i suppose you can mind poor lady elfride and how she ran away with the actor said john smith after awhile i think it fell upon the time my father was sexton here let us seewhere is she  here somewhere returned simeon looking round him  why ive got my arms round the very gentlewoman at this moment he lowered the end of the coffin he was holding wiped his face and throwing a morsel of rotten wood upon another as an indicator continued thats her husband there they was as fair a couple as you should see anywhere round about and a goodhearted pair likewise ay i can mind it though i was but a chiel at the time she fell in love with this young man of hers and their banns were asked in some church in london and the old lord her father actually heard em asked the three times and didnt notice her name being gabbled on wi a host of others when she had married she told her father and a fleed into a monstrous rage and said she shouldn hae a farthing lady elfride said she didnt think of wishing it if hed forgie her twas all she asked and as for a living she was content to play plays with her husband this frightened the old lord and a gied em a house to live in and a great garden and a little field or two and a carriage and a good few guineas well the poor thing died at her first gossiping and her husbandwho was as tenderhearted a man as ever eat meat and would have died for herwent wild in his mind and broke his heart so twas said anyhow they were buried the same dayfather and motherbut the baby lived ay my lords family made much of that man then and put him here with his wife and there in the corner the man is now the sunday after there was a funeral sermon the text was or ever the silver cord be loosed or the golden bowl be broken and when twas preaching the men drew their hands across their eyes several times and every woman cried out loud  and what became of the baby said stephen who had frequently heard portions of the story  she was brought up by her grandmother and a pretty maid she were and she must needs run away with the curateparson swancourt that is now then her grandmother died and the title and everything went away to another branch of the family altogether parson swancourt wasted a good deal of his wifes money and she left him miss elfride that trick of running away seems to be handed down in families like craziness or gout and they two women be alike as peas  which two  lady elfride and young miss thats alive now the same hair and eyes but miss elfrides mother was darker a good deal  lifes a strangle bubble ye see said william worm musingly for if the lords anointment had descended upon women instead of men miss elfride would be lord luxellianlady i mane but as it is the blood is run out and shes nothing to the luxellian family by law whatever she may be by gospel  i used to fancy said simeon when i seed miss elfride hugging the little ladyships that there was a likeness but i suppose twas only my dream for years must have altered the old family shape  and now well move these two and homealong interposed john smith reviving as became a master the spirit of labour which had showed unmistakable signs of being nearly vanquished by the spirit of chat the flagon of ale we dont want well let bide here till tomorrow none of the poor souls will touch it a blieve  so the evenings work was concluded and the party drew from the abode of the quiet dead closing the old iron door and shooting the lock loudly into the huge copper staplean incongruous act of imprisonment towards those who had no dreams of escape     chapter xxvii       how should i greet thee   love frequently dies of time alonemuch more frequently of displacement with elfride swancourt a powerful reason why the displacement should be successful was that the newcomer was a greater man than the first by the side of the instructive and piquant snubbings she received from knight stephens general agreeableness seemed watery by the side of knights spare lovemaking stephens continual outflow seemed lackadaisical she had begun to sigh for somebody further on in manhood stephen was hardly enough of a man  perhaps there was a proneness to inconstancy in her naturea nature to those who contemplate it from a standpoint beyond the influence of that inconstancy the most exquisite of all in its plasticity and ready sympathies partly too stephens failure to make his hold on her heart a permanent one was his too timid habit of dispraising himself beside hera peculiarity which exercised towards sensible men stirs a kindly chord of attachment that a marked assertiveness would leave untouched but inevitably leads the most sensible woman in the world to undervalue him who practises it directly domineering ceases in the man snubbing begins in the woman the trite but no less unfortunate fact being that the gentler creature rarely has the capacity to appreciate fair treatment from her natural complement the abiding perception of the position of stephens parents had of course a little to do with elfrides renunciation to such girls poverty may not be as to the more worldly masses of humanity a sin in itself but it is a sin because graceful and dainty manners seldom exist in such an atmosphere few women of old family can be thoroughly taught that a fine soul may wear a smockfrock and an admittedly common man in one is but a worm in their eyes john smiths rough hands and clothes his wifes dialect the necessary narrowness of their ways being constantly under elfrides notice were not without their deflecting influence  on reaching home after the perilous adventure by the seashore knight had felt unwell and retired almost immediately the young lady who had so materially assisted him had done the same but she reappeared properly clothed about five oclock she wandered restlessly about the house but not on account of their joint narrow escape from death the storm which had torn the tree had merely bowed the reed and with the deliverance of knight all deep thought of the accident had left her the mutual avowal which it had been the means of precipitating occupied a far longer length of her meditations  elfrides disquiet now was on account of that miserable promise to meet stephen which returned like a spectre again and again the perception of his littleness beside knight grew upon her alarmingly she now thought how sound had been her fathers advice to her to give him up and was as passionately desirous of following it as she had hitherto been averse perhaps there is nothing more hardening to the tone of young minds than thus to discover how their dearest and strongest wishes become gradually attuned by time the cynic to the very note of some selfish policy which in earlier days they despised  the hour of appointment came and with it a crisis and with the crisis a collapse  god forgive mei cant meet stephen she exclaimed to herself i dont love him less but i love mr knight more  yes she would save herself from a man not fit for herin spite of vows she would obey her father and have no more to do with stephen smith thus the fickle resolve showed signs of assuming the complexion of a virtue  the following days were passed without any definite avowal from knights lips such solitary walks and scenes as that witnessed by smith in the summerhouse were frequent but he courted her so intangibly that to any but such a delicate perception as elfrides it would have appeared no courtship at all the time now really began to be sweet with her she dismissed the sense of sin in her past actions and was automatic in the intoxication of the moment the fact that knight made no actual declaration was no drawback knowing since the betrayal of his sentiments that love for her really existed she preferred it for the present in its form of essence and was willing to avoid for awhile the grosser medium of words their feelings having been forced to a rather premature demonstration a reaction was indulged in by both  but no sooner had she got rid of her troubled conscience on the matter of faithlessness than a new anxiety confronted her it was lest knight should accidentally meet stephen in the parish and that herself should be the subject of discourse  elfride learning knight more thoroughly perceived that far from having a notion of stephens precedence he had no idea that she had ever been wooed before by anybody on ordinary occasions she had a tongue so frank as to show her whole mind and a mind so straightforward as to reveal her heart to its innermost shrine but the time for a change had come she never alluded to even a knowledge of knights friend when women are secret they are secret indeed and more often than not they only begin to be secret with the advent of a second lover  the elopement was now a spectre worse than the first and like the spirit in glenfinlas it waxed taller with every attempt to lay it her natural honesty invited her to confide in knight and trust to his generosity for forgiveness she knew also that as mere policy it would be better to tell him early if he was to be told at all the longer her concealment the more difficult would be the revelation but she put it off the intense fear which accompanies intense love in young women was too strong to allow the exercise of a moral quality antagonistic to itself      where love is great the littlest doubts are fear     where little fears grow great great love grows there   the match was looked upon as made by her father and mother the vicar remembered her promise to reveal the meaning of the telegram she had received and two days after the scene in the summerhouse asked her pointedly she was frank with him now  i had been corresponding with stephen smith ever since he left england till lately she calmly said  what cried the vicar aghast under the eyes of mr knight too  no when i found i cared most for mr knight i obeyed you  you were very kind im sure when did you begin to like mr knight  i dont see that that is a pertinent question papa the telegram was from the shipping agent and was not sent at my request it announced the arrival of the vessel bringing him home  home what is he here  yes in the village i believe  has he tried to see you  only by fair means but dont papa question me so it is torture  i will only say one word more he replied have you met him  i have not i can assure you that at the present moment there is no more of an understanding between me and the young man you so much disliked than between him and you you told me to forget him and i have forgotten him  oh well though you did not obey me in the beginning you are a good girl elfride in obeying me at last  dont call me good papa she said bitterly you dont knowand the less said about some things the better remember mr knight knows nothing about the other oh how wrong it all is i dont know what i am coming to  as matters stand i should be inclined to tell him or at any rate i should not alarm myself about his knowing he found out the other day that this was the parish young smiths father lives inwhat puts you in such a flurry  i cant say but promisepray dont let him know it would be my ruin  pooh child knight is a good fellow and a clever man but at the same time it does not escape my perceptions that he is no great catch for you men of his turn of mind are nothing so wonderful in the way of husbands if you had chosen to wait you might have mated with a much wealthier man but remember i have not a word to say against your having him if you like him charlotte is delighted as you know  well papa she said smiling hopefully through a sigh it is nice to feel that in giving way toto caring for him i have pleased my family but i am not good oh no i am very far from that  none of us are good i am sorry to say said her father blandly but girls have a chartered right to change their minds you know it has been recognized by poets from time immemorial catullus says mulier cupido quod dicit amanti in vento what a memory mine is however the passage is that a womans words to a lover are as a matter of course written only on wind and water now dont be troubled about that elfride  ah you dont know  they had been standing on the lawn and knight was now seen lingering some way down a winding walk when elfride met him it was with a much greater lightness of heart things were more straightforward now the responsibility of her fickleness seemed partly shifted from her own shoulders to her fathers still there were shadows  ah could he have known how far i went with stephen and yet have said the same how much happier i should be that was her prevailing thought  in the afternoon the lovers went out together on horseback for an hour or two and though not wishing to be observed by reason of the late death of lady luxellian whose funeral had taken place very privately on the previous day they yet found it necessary to pass east endelstow church  the steps to the vault as has been stated were on the outside of the building immediately under the aisle wall being on horseback both knight and elfride could overlook the shrubs which screened the churchyard  look the vault seems still to be open said knight  yes it is open she answered  who is that man close by it the mason i suppose  yes  i wonder if it is john smith stephens father  i believe it is said elfride with apprehension  ah and can it be i should like to inquire how his son my truant protege is going on and from your fathers description of the vault the interior must be interesting suppose we go in  had we better do you think may not lord luxellian be there  it is not at all likely  elfride then assented since she could do nothing else her heart which at first had quailed in consternation recovered itself when she considered the character of john smith a quiet unassuming man he would be sure to act towards her as before those love passages with his son which might have given a more pretentious mechanic airs so without much alarm she took knights arm after dismounting and went with him between and over the graves the mastermason recognized her as she approached and as usual lifted his hat respectfully  i know you to be mr smith my former friend stephens father said knight directly he had scanned the embrowned and ruddy features of john  yes sir i blieve i be  how is your son now i have only once heard from him since he went to india i daresay you have heard him speak of memr knight who became acquainted with him some years ago in exonbury  ay that i have stephen is very well thank you sir and hes in england in fact hes at home in short sir hes down in the vault there alooking at the departed coffins  elfrides heart fluttered like a butterfly  knight looked amazed well that is extraordinary he murmured did he know i was in the parish  i really cant say sir said john wishing himself out of the entanglement he rather suspected than thoroughly understood  would it be considered an intrusion by the family if we went into the vault  oh bless ye no sir scores of folk have been stepping down tis left open apurpose  we will go down elfride  i am afraid the air is close she said appealingly  oh no maam said john we whitelimed the walls and arches the day twas opened as we always do and again on the morning of the funeral the place is as sweet as a granary  then i should like you to accompany me elfie having originally sprung from the family too  i dont like going where death is so emphatically present ill stay by the horses whilst you go in they may get loose  what nonsense i had no idea your sentiments were so flimsily formed as to be perturbed by a few remnants of mortality but stay out if you are so afraid by all means  oh no i am not afraid dont say that  she held miserably to his arm thinking that perhaps the revelation might as well come at once as ten minutes later for stephen would be sure to accompany his friend to his horse  at first the gloom of the vault which was lighted only by a couple of candles was too great to admit of their seeing anything distinctly but with a further advance knight discerned in front of the black masses lining the walls a young man standing and writing in a pocketbook  knight said one word stephen  stephen smith not being in such absolute ignorance of knights whereabouts as knight had been of smiths instantly recognized his friend and knew by rote the outlines of the fair woman standing behind him  stephen came forward and shook him by the hand without speaking  why have you not written my boy said knight without in any way signifying elfrides presence to stephen to the essayist smith was still the country lad whom he had patronized and tended one to whom the formal presentation of a lady betrothed to himself would have seemed incongruous and absurd  why havent you written to me said stephen  ah yes why havent i why havent we thats always the query which we cannot clearly answer without an unsatisfactory sense of our inadequacies however i have not forgotten you smith and now we have met and we must meet again and have a longer chat than this can conveniently be i must know all you have been doing that you have thriven i know and you must teach me the way  elfride stood in the background stephen had read the position at a glance and immediately guessed that she had never mentioned his name to knight his tact in avoiding catastrophes was the chief quality which made him intellectually respectable in which quality he far transcended knight and he decided that a tranquil issue out of the encounter without any harrowing of the feelings of either knight or elfride was to be attempted if possible his old sense of indebtedness to knight had never wholly forsaken him his love for elfride was generous now  as far as he dared look at her movements he saw that her bearing towards him would be dictated by his own towards her and if he acted as a stranger she would do likewise as a means of deliverance circumstances favouring this course it was desirable also to be rather reserved towards knight to shorten the meeting as much as possible  i am afraid that my time is almost too short to allow even of such a pleasure he said i leave here tomorrow and until i start for the continent and india which will be in a fortnight i shall have hardly a moment to spare  knights disappointment and dissatisfied looks at this reply sent a pang through stephen as great as any he had felt at the sight of elfride the words about shortness of time were literally true but their tone was far from being so he would have been gratified to talk with knight as in past times and saw as a dead loss to himself that to save the woman who cared nothing for him he was deliberately throwing away his friend  oh i am sorry to hear that said knight in a changed tone but of course if you have weighty concerns to attend to they must not be neglected and if this is to be our first and last meeting let me say that i wish you success with all my heart knights warmth revived towards the end the solemn impressions he was beginning to receive from the scene around them abstracting from his heart as a puerility any momentary vexation at words it is a strange place for us to meet in he continued looking round the vault  stephen briefly assented and there was a silence the blackened coffins were now revealed more clearly than at first the whitened walls and arches throwing them forward in strong relief it was a scene which was remembered by all three as an indelible mark in their history knight with an abstracted face was standing between his companions though a little in advance of them elfride being on his right hand and stephen smith on his left the white daylight on his right side gleamed faintly in and was toned to a blueness by contrast with the yellow rays from the candle against the wall elfride timidly shrinking back and nearest the entrance received most of the light therefrom whilst stephen was entirely in candlelight and to him the spot of outer sky visible above the steps was as a steely blue patch and nothing more  i have been here two or three times since it was opened said stephen my father was engaged in the work you know  yes what are you doing knight inquired looking at the notebook and pencil stephen held in his hand  i have been sketching a few details in the church and since then i have been copying the names from some of the coffins here before i left england i used to do a good deal of this sort of thing  yes of course ah thats poor lady luxellian i suppose knight pointed to a coffin of light satinwood which stood on the stone sleepers in the new niche and the remainder of the family are on this side who are those two so snug and close together  stephens voice altered slightly as he replied thats lady elfride kingsmoreborn luxellian and that is arthur her husband i have heard my father say that theyheran away with her and married her against the wish of her parents  then i imagine this to be where you got your christian name miss swancourt said knight turning to her i think you told me it was three or four generations ago that your family branched off from the luxellians  she was my grandmother said elfride vainly endeavouring to moisten her dry lips before she spoke elfride had then the consciencestricken look of guidos magdalen rendered upon a more childlike form she kept her face partially away from knight and stephen and set her eyes upon the sky visible outside as if her salvation depended upon quickly reaching it her left hand rested lightly within knights arm half withdrawn from a sense of shame at claiming him before her old lover yet unwilling to renounce him so that her glove merely touched his sleeve can one be pardoned and retain the offence quoted elfrides heart then  conversation seemed to have no selfsustaining power and went on in the shape of disjointed remarks ones mind gets thronged with thoughts while standing so solemnly here knight said in a measured quiet voice how much has been said on death from time to time how much we ourselves can think upon it we may fancy each of these who lie here saying       for thou to make my fall more great         didst lift me up on high   what comes next elfride it is the hundredandsecond psalm i am thinking of  yes i know it she murmured and went on in a still lower voice seemingly afraid for any words from the emotional side of her nature to reach stephen      my days just hastening to their end         are like an evening shade      my beauty doth like witherd grass         with waning lustre fade   well said knight musingly let us leave them such occasions as these seem to compel us to roam outside ourselves far away from the fragile frame we live in and to expand till our perception grows so vast that our physical reality bears no sort of proportion to it we look back upon the weak and minute stem on which this luxuriant growth depends and ask can it be possible that such a capacity has a foundation so small must i again return to my daily walk in that narrow cell a human body where worldly thoughts can torture me do we not  yes said stephen and elfride  one has a sense of wrong too that such an appreciative breadth as a sentient being possesses should be committed to the frail casket of a body what weakens ones intentions regarding the future like the thought of thishowever let us tune ourselves to a more cheerful chord for theres a great deal to be done yet by us all  as knight meditatively addressed his juniors thus unconscious of the deception practised for different reasons by the severed hearts at his side and of the scenes that had in earlier days united them each one felt that he and she did not gain by contrast with their musing mentor physically not so handsome as either the youthful architect or the vicars daughter the thoroughness and integrity of knight illuminated his features with a dignity not even incipient in the other two it is difficult to frame rules which shall apply to both sexes and elfride an undeveloped girl must perhaps hardly be laden with the moral responsibilities which attach to a man in like circumstances the charm of woman too lies partly in her subtleness in matters of love but if honesty is a virtue in itself elfride having none of it now seemed being for being scarcely good enough for knight stephen though deceptive for no unworthy purpose was deceptive after all and whatever good results grace such strategy if it succeed it seldom draws admiration especially when it fails  on an ordinary occasion had knight been even quite alone with stephen he would hardly have alluded to his possible relationship to elfride but moved by attendant circumstances knight was impelled to be confiding  stephen he said this lady is miss swancourt i am staying at her fathers house as you probably know he stepped a few paces nearer to smith and said in a lower tone i may as well tell you that we are engaged to be married  low as the words had been spoken elfride had heard them and awaited stephens reply in breathless silence if that could be called silence where elfrides dress at each throb of her heart shook and indicated it like a pulseglass rustling also against the wall in reply to the same throbbing the ray of daylight which reached her face lent it a blue pallor in comparison with those of the other two  i congratulate you stephen whispered and said aloud i know miss swancourta little you must remember that my father is a parishioner of mr swancourts  i thought you might possibly not have lived at home since they have been here  i have never lived at home certainly since that time  i have seen mr smith faltered elfride  well there is no excuse for me as strangers to each other i ought i suppose to have introduced you as acquaintances i should not have stood so persistently between you but the fact is smith you seem a boy to me even now  stephen appeared to have a more than previous consciousness of the intense cruelty of his fate at the present moment he could not repress the words uttered with a dim bitterness  you should have said that i seemed still the rural mechanics son i am and hence an unfit subject for the ceremony of introductions  oh no no i wont have that knight endeavoured to give his reply a laughing tone in elfrides ears and an earnestness in stephens in both which efforts he signally failed and produced a forced speech pleasant to neither well let us go into the open air again miss swancourt you are particularly silent you mustnt mind smith i have known him for years as i have told you  yes you have she said  to think she has never mentioned her knowledge of me smith murmured and thought with some remorse how much her conduct resembled his own on his first arrival at her house as a stranger to the place  they ascended to the daylight knight taking no further notice of elfrides manner which as usual he attributed to the natural shyness of a young woman at being discovered walking with him on terms which left not much doubt of their meaning elfride stepped a little in advance and passed through the churchyard  you are changed very considerably smith said knight and i suppose it is no more than was to be expected however dont imagine that i shall feel any the less interest in you and your fortunes whenever you care to confide them to me i have not forgotten the attachment you spoke of as your reason for going away to india a london young lady was it not i hope all is prosperous  no the match is broken off  it being always difficult to know whether to express sorrow or gladness under such circumstancesall depending upon the character of the matchknight took shelter in the safe words i trust it was for the best  i hope it was but i beg that you will not press me further no you have not pressed mei dont mean thatbut i would rather not speak upon the subject  stephens words were hurried  knight said no more and they followed in the footsteps of elfride who still kept some paces in advance and had not heard knights unconscious allusion to her stephen bade him adieu at the churchyardgate without going outside and watched whilst he and his sweetheart mounted their horses  good heavens elfride knight exclaimed how pale you are i suppose i ought not to have taken you into that vault what is the matter  nothing said elfride faintly i shall be myself in a moment all was so strange and unexpected down there that it made me unwell  i thought you said very little shall i get some water  no no  do you think it is safe for you to mount  quiteindeed it is she said with a look of appeal  now thenup she goes whispered knight and lifted her tenderly into the saddle  her old lover still looked on at the performance as he leant over the gate a dozen yards off once in the saddle and having a firm grip of the reins she turned her head as if by a resistless fascination and for the first time since that memorable parting on the moor outside st launces after the passionate attempt at marriage with him elfride looked in the face of the young man she first had loved he was the youth who had called her his inseparable wife many a time and whom she had even addressed as her husband their eyes met measurement of life should be proportioned rather to the intensity of the experience than to its actual length their glance but a moment chronologically was a season in their history to elfride the intense agony of reproach in stephens eye was a nail piercing her heart with a deadliness no words can describe with a spasmodic effort she withdrew her eyes urged on the horse and in the chaos of perturbed memories was oblivious of any presence beside her the deed of deception was complete  gaining a knoll on which the park transformed itself into wood and copse knight came still closer to her side and said are you better now dearest  oh yes she pressed a hand to her eyes as if to blot out the image of stephen a vivid scarlet spot now shone with preternatural brightness in the centre of each cheek leaving the remainder of her face lilywhite as before  elfride said knight rather in his old tone of mentor you know i dont for a moment chide you but is there not a great deal of unwomanly weakness in your allowing yourself to be so overwhelmed by the sight of what after all is no novelty every woman worthy of the name should i think be able to look upon death with something like composure surely you think so too  yes i own it  his obtuseness to the cause of her indisposition by evidencing his entire freedom from the suspicion of anything behind the scenes showed how incapable knight was of deception himself rather than any inherent dulness in him regarding human nature this clearly perceived by elfride added poignancy to her selfreproach and she idolized him the more because of their difference even the recent sight of stephens face and the sound of his voice which for a moment had stirred a chord or two of ancient kindness were unable to keep down the adoration reexistent now that he was again out of view  she had replied to knights question hastily and immediately went on to speak of indifferent subjects after they had reached home she was apart from him till dinnertime when dinner was over and they were watching the dusk in the drawingroom knight stepped out upon the terrace elfride went after him very decisively on the spur of a virtuous intention  mr knight i want to tell you something she said with quiet firmness  and what is it about gaily returned her lover happiness i hope do not let anything keep you so sad as you seem to have been today  i cannot mention the matter until i tell you the whole substance of it she said and that i will do tomorrow i have been reminded of it today it is about something i once did and dont think i ought to have done  this it must be said was rather a mild way of referring to a frantic passion and flight which much or little in itself only accident had saved from being a scandal in the public eye  knight thought the matter some trifle and said pleasantly  then i am not to hear the dreadful confession now  no not now i did not mean tonight elfride responded with a slight decline in the firmness of her voice it is not light as you think itit troubles me a great deal fearing now the effect of her own earnestness she added forcedly though perhaps you may think it light after all  but you have not said when it is to be  tomorrow morning name a time will you and bind me to it i want you to fix an hour because i am weak and may otherwise try to get out of it she added a little artificial laugh which showed how timorous her resolution was still  well say after breakfastat eleven oclock  yes eleven oclock i promise you bind me strictly to my word    chapter xxviii  i lull a fancy troubletost   miss swancourt it is eleven oclock  she was looking out of her dressingroom window on the first floor and knight was regarding her from the terrace balustrade upon which he had been idly sitting for some timedividing the glances of his eye between the pages of a book in his hand the brilliant hues of the geraniums and calceolarias and the open window abovementioned  yes it is i know i am coming  he drew closer and under the window  how are you this morning elfride you look no better for your long nights rest  she appeared at the door shortly after took his offered arm and together they walked slowly down the gravel path leading to the river and away under the trees  her resolution sustained during the last fifteen hours had been to tell the whole truth and now the moment had come  step by step they advanced and still she did not speak they were nearly at the end of the walk when knight broke the silence  well what is the confession elfride  she paused a moment drew a long breath and this is what she said  i told you one dayor rather i gave you to understandwhat was not true i fancy you thought me to mean i was nineteen my next birthday but it was my last i was nineteen  the moment had been too much for her now that the crisis had come no qualms of conscience no love of honesty no yearning to make a confidence and obtain forgiveness with a kiss could string elfride up to the venture her dread lest he should be unforgiving was heightened by the thought of yesterdays artifice which might possibly add disgust to his disappointment the certainty of one more days affection which she gained by silence outvalued the hope of a perpetuity combined with the risk of all  the trepidation caused by these thoughts on what she had intended to say shook so naturally the words she did say that knight never for a moment suspected them to be a last moments substitution he smiled and pressed her hand warmly  my dear elfieyes you are nowno protestationwhat a winning little woman you are to be so absurdly scrupulous about a mere iota really i never once have thought whether your nineteenth year was the last or the present and by george well i may not for it would never do for a staid fogey a dozen years older to stand upon such a trifle as that  dont praise medont praise me though i prize it from your lips i dont deserve it now  but knight being in an exceptionally genial mood merely saw this distressful exclamation as modesty well he added after a minute i like you all the better you know for such moral precision although i called it absurd he went on with tender earnestness for elfride there is one thing i do love to see in a womanthat is a soul truthful and clear as heavens light i could put up with anything if i had thatforgive nothing if i had it not elfride you have such a soul if ever woman had and having it retain it and dont ever listen to the fashionable theories of the day about a womans privileges and natural right to practise wiles depend upon it my dear girl that a noble woman must be as honest as a noble man i specially mean by honesty fairness not only in matters of business and social detail but in all the delicate dealings of love to which the licence given to your sex particularly refers  elfride looked troublously at the trees  now let us go on to the river elfie  i would if i had a hat on she said with a sort of suppressed woe  i will get it for you said knight very willing to purchase her companionship at so cheap a price you sit down there a minute and he turned and walked rapidly back to the house for the article in question  elfride sat down upon one of the rustic benches which adorned this portion of the grounds and remained with her eyes upon the grass she was induced to lift them by hearing the brush of light and irregular footsteps hard by passing along the path which intersected the one she was in and traversed the outer shrubberies elfride beheld the farmers widow mrs jethway before she noticed elfride she paused to look at the house portions of which were visible through the bushes elfride shrinking back hoped the unpleasant woman might go on without seeing her but mrs jethway silently apostrophizing the house with actions which seemed dictated by a halfoverturned reason had discerned the girl and immediately came up and stood in front of her  ah miss swancourt why did you disturb me mustnt i trespass here  you may walk here if you like mrs jethway i do not disturb you  you disturb my mind and my mind is my whole life for my boy is there still and he is gone from my body  yes poor young man i was sorry when he died  do you know what he died of  consumption  oh no no said the widow that word consumption covers a good deal he died because you were his own wellagreed sweetheart and then proved falseand it killed him yes miss swancourt she said in an excited whisper you killed my son  how can you be so wicked and foolish replied elfride rising indignantly but indignation was not natural to her and having been so worn and harrowed by late events she lost any powers of defence that mood might have lent her i could not help his loving me mrs jethway  thats just what you could have helped you know how it began miss elfride yes you said you liked the name of felix better than any other name in the parish and you knew it was his name and that those you said it to would report it to him  i knew it was his nameof course i did but i am sure mrs jethway i did not intend anybody to tell him  but you knew they would  no i didnt  and then after that when you were riding on revelsday by our house and the lads were gathered there and you wanted to dismount when jim drake and george upway and three or four more ran forward to hold your pony and felix stood back timid why did you beckon to him and say you would rather he held it  o mrs jethway you do think so mistakenly i liked him bestthats why i wanted him to do it he was gentle and nicei always thought him soand i liked him  then why did you let him kiss you  it is a falsehood oh it is it is said elfride weeping with desperation he came behind me and attempted to kiss me and that was why i told him never to let me see him again  but you did not tell your father or anybody as you would have if you had looked upon it then as the insult you now pretend it was  he begged me not to tell and foolishly enough i did not and i wish i had now i little expected to be scourged with my own kindness pray leave me mrs jethway the girl only expostulated now  well you harshly dismissed him and he died and before his body was cold you took another to your heart then as carelessly sent him about his business and took a third and if you consider that nothing miss swancourt she continued drawing closer it led on to what was very serious indeed have you forgotten the wouldbe runaway marriage the journey to london and the return the next day without being married and that theres enough disgrace in that to ruin a womans good name far less light than yours you may have i have not fickleness towards a lover is bad but fickleness after playing the wife is wantonness  oh its a wicked cruel lie do not say it oh do not  does your new man know of it i think not or he would be no man of yours as much of the story as was known is creeping about the neighbourhood even now but i know more than any of them and why should i respect your love  i defy you cried elfride tempestuously do and say all you can to ruin me try put your tongue at work i invite it i defy you as a slanderous woman look there he comes and her voice trembled greatly as she saw through the leaves the beloved form of knight coming from the door with her hat in his hand tell him at once i can bear it  not now said the woman and disappeared down the path  the excitement of her latter words had restored colour to elfrides cheeks and hastily wiping her eyes she walked farther on so that by the time her lover had overtaken her the traces of emotion had nearly disappeared from her face knight put the hat upon her head took her hand and drew it within his arm  it was the last day but one previous to their departure for st leonards and knight seemed to have a purpose in being much in her company that day they rambled along the valley the season was that period in the autumn when the foliage alone of an ordinary plantation is rich enough in hues to exhaust the chromatic combinations of an artists palette most lustrous of all are the beeches graduating from bright rusty red at the extremity of the boughs to a bright yellow at their inner parts young oaks are still of a neutral green scotch firs and hollies are nearly blue whilst occasional dottings of other varieties give maroons and purples of every tinge  the riversuch as it washere pursued its course amid flagstones as level as a pavement but divided by crevices of irregular width with the summer drought the torrent had narrowed till it was now but a thread of crystal clearness meandering along a central channel in the rocky bed of the winter current knight scrambled through the bushes which at this point nearly covered the brook from sight and leapt down upon the dry portion of the river bottom  elfride i never saw such a sight he exclaimed the hazels overhang the rivers course in a perfect arch and the floor is beautifully paved the place reminds one of the passages of a cloister let me help you down  he assisted her through the marginal underwood and down to the stones they walked on together to a tiny cascade about a foot wide and high and sat down beside it on the flags that for nine months in the year were submerged beneath a gushing bourne from their feet trickled the attenuated thread of water which alone remained to tell the intent and reason of this leafcovered aisle and journeyed on in a zigzag line till lost in the shade  knight leaning on his elbow after contemplating all this looked critically at elfride  does not such a luxuriant head of hair exhaust itself and get thin as the years go on from eighteen to eightandtwenty he asked at length  oh no she said quickly with a visible disinclination to harbour such a thought which came upon her with an unpleasantness whose force it would be difficult for men to understand she added afterwards with smouldering uneasiness do you really think that a great abundance of hair is more likely to get thin than a moderate quantity  yes i really do i believeam almost sure in factthat if statistics could be obtained on the subject you would find the persons with thin hair were those who had a superabundance originally and that those who start with a moderate quantity retain it without much loss  elfrides troubles sat upon her face as well as in her heart perhaps to a woman it is almost as dreadful to think of losing her beauty as of losing her reputation at any rate she looked quite as gloomy as she had looked at any minute that day  you shouldnt be so troubled about a mere personal adornment said knight with some of the severity of tone that had been customary before she had beguiled him into softness  i think it is a womans duty to be as beautiful as she can if i were a scholar i would give you chapter and verse for it from one of your own latin authors i know there is such a passage for papa has alluded to it  munditiae et ornatus et cultus cis that it a passage in livy which is no defence at all  no it is not that  never mind then for i have a reason for not taking up my old cudgels against you elfie can you guess what the reason is  no but i am glad to hear it she said thankfully for it is dreadful when you talk so for whatever dreadful name the weakness may deserve i must candidly own that i am terrified to think my hair may ever get thin  of course a sensible woman would rather lose her wits than her beauty  i dont care if you do say satire and judge me cruelly i know my hair is beautiful everybody says so  why my dear miss swancourt he tenderly replied i have not said anything against it but you know what is said about handsome being and handsome doing  poor miss handsomedoes cuts but a sorry figure beside miss handsomeis in every mans eyes your own not excepted mr knight though it pleases you to throw off so said elfride saucily and lowering her voice you ought not to have taken so much trouble to save me from falling over the cliff for you dont think mine a life worth much trouble evidently  perhaps you think mine was not worth yours  it was worth anybodys  her hand was plashing in the little waterfall and her eyes were bent the same way  you talk about my severity with you elfride you are unkind to me you know  how she asked looking up from her idle occupation  after my taking trouble to get jewellery to please you you wouldnt accept it  perhaps i would now perhaps i want to  do said knight  and the packet was withdrawn from his pocket and presented the third time elfride took it with delight the obstacle was rent in twain and the significant gift was hers  ill take out these ugly ones at once she exclaimed and ill wear yoursshall i  i should be gratified  now though it may seem unlikely considering how far the two had gone in converse knight had never yet ventured to kiss elfride far slower was he than stephen smith in matters like that the utmost advance he had made in such demonstrations had been to the degree witnessed by stephen in the summerhouse so elfrides cheek being still forbidden fruit to him he said impulsively  elfie i should like to touch that seductive ear of yours those are my gifts so let me dress you in them  she hesitated with a stimulating hesitation  let me put just one in its place then  her face grew much warmer  i dont think it would be quite the usual or proper course she said suddenly turning and resuming her operation of plashing in the miniature cataract  the stillness of things was disturbed by a bird coming to the streamlet to drink after watching him dip his bill sprinkle himself and fly into a tree knight replied with the courteous brusqueness she so much liked to hear  elfride now you may as well be fair you would mind my doing it but little i think so give me leave do  i will be fair then she said confidingly and looking him full in the face it was a particular pleasure to her to be able to do a little honesty without fear i should not mind your doing soi should like such an attention my thought was would it be right to let you  then i will he rejoined with that singular earnestness about a small matterin the eyes of a ladies man but a momentary peg for flirtation or jestwhich is only found in deep natures who have been wholly unused to toying with womankind and which from its unwontedness is in itself a tribute the most precious that can be rendered and homage the most exquisite to be received  and you shall she whispered without reserve and no longer mistress of the ceremonies and then elfride inclined herself towards him thrust back her hair and poised her head sideways in doing this her arm and shoulder necessarily rested against his breast  at the touch the sensation of both seemed to be concentrated at the point of contact all the time he was performing the delicate manoeuvre knight trembled like a young surgeon in his first operation  now the other said knight in a whisper  no no  why not  i dont know exactly  you must know  your touch agitates me so let us go home  dont say that elfride what is it after all a mere nothing now turn round dearest  she was powerless to disobey and turned forthwith and then without any defined intention in eithers mind his face and hers drew closer together and he supported her there and kissed her  knight was at once the most ardent and the coolest man alive when his emotions slumbered he appeared almost phlegmatic when they were moved he was no less than passionate and now without having quite intended an early marriage he put the question plainly it came with all the ardour which was the accumulation of long years behind a natural reserve  elfride when shall we be married  the words were sweet to her but there was a bitter in the sweet these newlyovert acts of his which had culminated in this plain question coming on the very day of mrs jethways blasting reproaches painted distinctly her fickleness as an enormity loving him in secret had not seemed such thoroughgoing inconstancy as the same love recognized and acted upon in the face of threats her distraction was interpreted by him at her side as the outward signs of an unwonted experience  i dont press you for an answer now darling he said seeing she was not likely to give a lucid reply take your time  knight was as honourable a man as was ever loved and deluded by woman it may be said that his blindness in love proved the point for shrewdness in love usually goes with meanness in general once the passion had mastered him the intellect had gone for naught knight as a lover was more singleminded and far simpler than his friend stephen who in other capacities was shallow beside him  without saying more on the subject of their marriage knight held her at arms length as if she had been a large bouquet and looked at her with critical affection  does your pretty gift become me she inquired with tears of excitement on the fringes of her eyes  undoubtedly perfectly said her lover adopting a lighter tone to put her at her ease ah you should see them you look shinier than ever fancy that i have been able to improve you  am i really so nice i am glad for your sake i wish i could see myself  you cant you must wait till we get home  i shall never be able she said laughing look heres a way  so there is well done womans wit  hold me steady  oh yes  and dont let me fall will you  by no means  below their seat the thread of water paused to spread out into a smooth small pool knight supported her whilst she knelt down and leant over it  i can see myself really try as religiously as i will i cannot help admiring my appearance in them  doubtless how can you be so fond of finery i believe you are corrupting me into a taste for it i used to hate every such thing before i knew you  i like ornaments because i want people to admire what you possess and envy you and say i wish i was he  i suppose i ought not to object after that and how much longer are you going to look in there at yourself  until you are tired of holding me oh i want to ask you something and she turned round now tell truly wont you what colour of hair do you like best now  knight did not answer at the moment  say light do she whispered coaxingly dont say dark as you did that time  lightbrown then exactly the colour of my sweethearts  really said elfride enjoying as truth what she knew to be flattery  yes  and blue eyes too not hazel say yes say yes  one recantation is enough for today  no no  very well blue eyes and knight laughed and drew her close and kissed her the second time which operations he performed with the carefulness of a fruiterer touching a bunch of grapes so as not to disturb their bloom  elfride objected to a second and flung away her face the movement causing a slight disarrangement of hat and hair hardly thinking what she said in the trepidation of the moment she exclaimed clapping her hand to her ear  ah we must be careful i lost the other earring doing like this  no sooner did she realise the significant words than a troubled look passed across her face and she shut her lips as if to keep them back  doing like what said knight perplexed  oh sitting down out of doors she replied hastily     chapter xxix       care thou canker   it is an evening at the beginning of october and the mellowest of autumn sunsets irradiates london even to its uttermost eastern end between the eye and the flaming west columns of smoke stand up in the still air like tall trees everything in the shade is rich and misty blue  mr and mrs swancourt and elfride are looking at these lustrous and lurid contrasts from the window of a large hotel near london bridge the visit to their friends at st leonards is over and they are staying a day or two in the metropolis on their way home  knight spent the same interval of time in crossing over to brittany by way of jersey and st malo he then passed through normandy and returned to london also his arrival there having been two days later than that of elfride and her parents  so the evening of this october day saw them all meeting at the abovementioned hotel where they had previously engaged apartments during the afternoon knight had been to his lodgings at richmond to make a little change in the nature of his baggage and on coming up again there was never ushered by a bland waiter into a comfortable room a happier man than knight when shown to where elfride and her stepmother were sitting after a fatiguing day of shopping  elfride looked none the better for her change knight was as brown as a nut they were soon engaged by themselves in a corner of the room now that the precious words of promise had been spoken the young girl had no idea of keeping up her price by the system of reserve which other more accomplished maidens use her lover was with her again and it was enough she made her heart over to him entirely  dinner was soon despatched and when a preliminary round of conversation concerning their doings since the last parting had been concluded they reverted to the subject of tomorrows journey home  that enervating ride through the myrtle climate of south devonhow i dread it tomorrow mrs swancourt was saying i had hoped the weather would have been cooler by this time  did you ever go by water said knight  neverby never i mean not since the time of railways  then if you can afford an additional day i propose that we do it said knight the channel is like a lake just now we should reach plymouth in about forty hours i think and the boats start from just below the bridge here pointing over his shoulder eastward  hear hear said the vicar  its an idea certainly said his wife  of course these coasters are rather tubby said knight but you wouldnt mind that  no we wouldnt mind  and the saloon is a place like the fishmarket of a ninthrate country town but that wouldnt matter  oh dear no if we had only thought of it soon enough we might have had the use of lord luxellians yacht but never mind well go we shall escape the worrying rattle through the whole length of london tomorrow morningnot to mention the risk of being killed by excursion trains which is not a little one at this time of the year if the papers are true  elfride too thought the arrangement delightful and accordingly ten oclock the following morning saw two cabs crawling round by the mint and between the preternaturally high walls of nightingale lane towards the river side  the first vehicle was occupied by the travellers in person and the second brought up the luggage under the supervision of mrs snewson mrs swancourts maidand for the last fortnight elfrides also for although the younger lady had never been accustomed to any such attendant at robing times her stepmother forced her into a semblance of familiarity with one when they were away from home  presently waggons bales and smells of all descriptions increased to such an extent that the advance of the cabs was at the slowest possible rate at intervals it was necessary to halt entirely that the heavy vehicles unloading in front might be moved aside a feat which was not accomplished without a deal of swearing and noise the vicar put his head out of the window  surely there must be some mistake in the way he said with great concern drawing in his head again theres not a respectable conveyance to be seen here except ours ive heard that there are strange dens in this part of london into which people have been entrapped and murderedsurely there is no conspiracy on the part of the cabman  oh no no it is all right said mr knight who was as placid as dewy eve by the side of elfride  but what i argue from said the vicar with a greater emphasis of uneasiness are plain appearances this cant be the highway from london to plymouth by water because it is no way at all to any place we shall miss our steamer and our train toothats what i think  depend upon it we are right in fact here we are  trimmers wharf said the cabman opening the door  no sooner had they alighted than they perceived a tussle going on between the hindmost cabman and a crowd of light porters who had charged him in column to obtain possession of the bags and boxes mrs snewsons hands being seen stretched towards heaven in the midst of the melee knight advanced gallantly and after a hard struggle reduced the crowd to two upon whose shoulders and trucks the goods vanished away in the direction of the waters edge with startling rapidity  then more of the same tribe who had run on ahead were heard shouting to boatmen three of whom pulled alongside and two being vanquished the luggage went tumbling into the remaining one  never saw such a dreadful scene in my lifenever said mr swancourt floundering into the boat worse than famine and sword upon one i thought such customs were confined to continental ports arent you astonished elfride  oh no said elfride appearing amid the dingy scene like a rainbow in a murky sky it is a pleasant novelty i think  where in the wide ocean is our steamer the vicar inquired i can see nothing but old hulks for the life of me  just behind that one said knight we shall soon be round under her  the object of their search was soon after disclosed to viewa great lumbering form of inky blackness which looked as if it had never known the touch of a paintbrush for fifty years it was lying beside just such another and the way on board was down a narrow lane of water between the two about a yard and a half wide at one end and gradually converging to a point at the moment of their entry into this narrow passage a brilliantly painted rival paddled down the river like a trotting steed creating such a series of waves and splashes that their frail wherry was tossed like a teacup and the vicar and his wife slanted this way and that inclining their heads into contact with a punchandjudy air and countenance the wavelets striking the sides of the two hulls and flapping back into their laps  dreadful horrible mr swancourt murmured privately and said aloud i thought we walked on board i dont think really i should have come if i had known this trouble was attached to it  if they must splash i wish they would splash us with clean water said the old lady wiping her dress with her handkerchief  i hope it is perfectly safe continued the vicar  o papa you are not very brave cried elfride merrily  bravery is only obtuseness to the perception of contingencies mr swancourt severely answered  mrs swancourt laughed and elfride laughed and knight laughed in the midst of which pleasantness a man shouted to them from some position between their heads and the sky and they found they were close to the juliet into which they quiveringly ascended  it having been found that the lowness of the tide would prevent their getting off for an hour the swancourts having nothing else to do allowed their eyes to idle upon men in blue jerseys performing mysterious mending operations with tartwine they turned to look at the dashes of lurid sunlight like burnished copper stars afloat on the ripples which danced into and tantalized their vision or listened to the loud music of a steamcrane at work close by or to sighing sounds from the funnels of passing steamers getting dead as they grew more distant or to shouts from the decks of different craft in their vicinity all of them assuming the form of ahhehay  halfpast ten not yet off mr swancourt breathed a breath of weariness and looked at his fellowtravellers in general their faces were certainly not worth looking at the expression waiting was written upon them so absolutely that nothing more could be discerned there all animation was suspended till providence should raise the water and let them go  i have been thinking said knight that we have come amongst the rarest class of people in the kingdom of all human characteristics a low opinion of the value of his own time by an individual must be among the strangest to find here we see numbers of that patient and happy species rovers as distinct from travellers  but they are pleasureseekers to whom time is of no importance  oh no the pleasureseekers we meet on the grand routes are more anxious than commercial travellers to rush on and added to the loss of time in getting to their journeys end these exceptional people take their chance of seasickness by coming this way  can it be inquired the vicar with apprehension surely not mr knight just here in our english channelclose at our doors as i may say  entrance passages are very draughty places and the channel is like the rest it ruins the temper of sailors it has been calculated by philosophers that more damns go up to heaven from the channel in the course of a year than from all the five oceans put together  they really start now and the dead looks of all the throng come to life immediately the man who has been frantically hauling in a rope that bade fair to have no end ceases his labours and they glide down the serpentine bends of the thames  anything anywhere was a mine of interest to elfride and so was this  it is well enough now said mrs swancourt after they had passed the nore but i cant say i have cared for my voyage hitherto for being now in the open sea a slight breeze had sprung up which cheered her as well as her two younger companions but unfortunately it had a reverse effect upon the vicar who after turning a sort of apricot jam colour interspersed with dashes of raspberry pleaded indisposition and vanished from their sight  the afternoon wore on mrs swancourt kindly sat apart by herself reading and the betrothed pair were left to themselves elfride clung trustingly to knights arm and proud was she to walk with him up and down the deck or to go forward and leaning with him against the forecastle rails watch the setting sun gradually withdrawing itself over their stern into a huge bank of livid cloud with golden edges that rose to meet it  she was childishly full of life and spirits though in walking up and down with him before the other passengers and getting noticed by them she was at starting rather confused it being the first time she had shown herself so openly under that kind of protection i expect they are envious and saying things about us dont you she would whisper to knight with a stealthy smile  oh no he would answer unconcernedly why should they envy us and what can they say  not any harm of course elfride replied except such as this how happy those two are she is proud enough now what makes it worse she continued in the extremity of confidence i heard those two cricketing men say just now shes the nobbiest girl on the boat but i dont mind it you know harry  i should hardly have supposed you did even if you had not told me said knight with great blandness  she was never tired of asking her lover questions and admiring his answers good bad or indifferent as they might be the evening grew dark and night came on and lights shone upon them from the horizon and from the sky  now look there ahead of us at that halo in the air of silvery brightness watch it and you will see what it comes to  she watched for a few minutes when two white lights emerged from the side of a hill and showed themselves to be the origin of the halo  what a dazzling brilliance what do they mark  the south foreland they were previously covered by the cliff  what is that level line of little sparklesa town i suppose  thats dover  all this time and later soft sheet lightning expanded from a cloud in their path enkindling their faces as they paced up and down shining over the water and for a moment showing the horizon as a keen line  elfride slept soundly that night her first thought the next morning was the thrilling one that knight was as close at hand as when they were at home at endelstow and her first sight on looking out of the cabin window was the perpendicular face of beachy head gleaming white in a brilliant sixoclockinthemorning sun this fair daybreak however soon changed its aspect a cold wind and a pale mist descended upon the sea and seemed to threaten a dreary day  when they were nearing southampton mrs swancourt came to say that her husband was so ill that he wished to be put on shore here and left to do the remainder of the journey by land he will be perfectly well directly he treads firm ground again which shall we dogo with him or finish our voyage as we intended  elfride was comfortably housed under an umbrella which knight was holding over her to keep off the wind oh dont let us go on shore she said with dismay it would be such a pity  thats very fine said mrs swancourt archly as to a child see the wind has increased her colour the sea her appetite and spirits and somebody her happiness yes it would be a pity certainly  tis my misfortune to be always spoken to from a pedestal sighed elfride  well we will do as you like mrs swancourt said knight but  i myself would rather remain on board interrupted the elder lady and mr swancourt particularly wishes to go by himself so that shall settle the matter  the vicar now a drab colour was put ashore and became as well as ever forthwith  elfride sitting alone in a retired part of the vessel saw a veiled woman walk aboard among the very latest arrivals at this port she was clothed in black silk and carried a dark shawl upon her arm the woman without looking around her turned to the quarter allotted to the secondcabin passengers all the carnation mrs swancourt had complimented her stepdaughter upon possessing left elfrides cheeks and she trembled visibly  she ran to the other side of the boat where mrs swancourt was standing  let us go home by railway with papa after all she pleaded earnestly i would rather go with himshall we  mrs swancourt looked around for a moment as if unable to decide ah she exclaimed it is too late now why did not you say so before when we had plenty of time  the juliet had at that minute let go the engines had started and they were gliding slowly away from the quay there was no help for it but to remain unless the juliet could be made to put back and that would create a great disturbance elfride gave up the idea and submitted quietly her happiness was sadly mutilated now  the woman whose presence had so disturbed her was exactly like mrs jethway she seemed to haunt elfride like a shadow after several minutes vain endeavour to account for any design mrs jethway could have in watching her elfride decided to think that if it were the widow the encounter was accidental she remembered that the widow in her restlessness was often visiting the village near southampton which was her original home and it was possible that she chose watertransit with the idea of saving expense  what is the matter elfride knight inquired standing before her  nothing more than that i am rather depressed  i dont much wonder at it that wharf was depressing we seemed underneath and inferior to everything around us but we shall be in the sea breeze again soon and that will freshen you dear  the evening closed in and dusk increased as they made way down southampton water and through the solent elfrides disturbance of mind was such that her light spirits of the foregoing four and twenty hours had entirely deserted her the weather too had grown more gloomy for though the showers of the morning had ceased the sky was covered more closely than ever with dense leaden clouds how beautiful was the sunset when they rounded the north foreland the previous evening now it was impossible to tell within half an hour the time of the luminarys going down knight led her about and being by this time accustomed to her sudden changes of mood overlooked the necessity of a cause in regarding the conditionsimpressionableness and elasticity  elfride looked stealthily to the other end of the vessel mrs jethway or her double was sitting at the sternher eye steadily regarding elfride  let us go to the forepart she said quickly to knight see therethe man is fixing the lights for the night  knight assented and after watching the operation of fixing the red and the green lights on the port and starboard bows and the hoisting of the white light to the masthead he walked up and down with her till the increase of wind rendered promenading difficult elfrides eyes were occasionally to be found furtively gazing abaft to learn if her enemy were really there nobody was visible now  shall we go below said knight seeing that the deck was nearly deserted  no she said if you will kindly get me a rug from mrs swancourt i should like if you dont mind to stay here she had recently fancied the assumed mrs jethway might be a firstclass passenger and dreaded meeting her by accident  knight appeared with the rug and they sat down behind a weathercloth on the windward side just as the two red eyes of the needles glared upon them from the gloom their pointed summits rising like shadowy phantom figures against the sky it became necessary to go below to an eightoclock meal of nondescript kind and elfride was immensely relieved at finding no sign of mrs jethway there they again ascended and remained above till mrs snewson staggered up to them with the message that mrs swancourt thought it was time for elfride to come below knight accompanied her down and returned again to pass a little more time on deck  elfride partly undressed herself and lay down and soon became unconscious though her sleep was light how long she had lain she knew not when by slow degrees she became cognizant of a whispering in her ear  you are well on with him i can see well provoke me now but my day will come you will find that seemed to be the utterance or words to that effect  elfride became broad awake and terrified she knew the words if real could be only those of one person and that person the widow jethway  the lamp had gone out and the place was in darkness in the next berth she could hear her stepmother breathing heavily further on snewson breathing more heavily still these were the only other legitimate occupants of the cabin and mrs jethway must have stealthily come in by some means and retreated again or else she had entered an empty berth next snewsons the fear that this was the case increased elfrides perturbation till it assumed the dimensions of a certainty for how could a stranger from the other end of the ship possibly contrive to get in could it have been a dream  elfride raised herself higher and looked out of the window there was the sea floundering and rushing against the ships side just by her head and thence stretching away dim and moaning into an expanse of indistinctness and far beyond all this two placid lights like rayless stars now almost fearing to turn her face inwards again lest mrs jethway should appear at her elbow elfride meditated upon whether to call snewson to keep her company four bells sounded and she heard voices which gave her a little courage it was not worth while to call snewson  at any rate elfride could not stay there panting longer at the risk of being again disturbed by that dreadful whispering so wrapping herself up hurriedly she emerged into the passage and by the aid of a faint light burning at the entrance to the saloon found the foot of the stairs and ascended to the deck dreary the place was in the extreme it seemed a new spot altogether in contrast with its daytime self she could see the glowworm light from the binnacle and the dim outline of the man at the wheel also a form at the bows not another soul was apparent from stem to stern  yes there were two moreby the bulwarks one proved to be her harry the other the mate she was glad indeed and on drawing closer found they were holding a low slow chat about nautical affairs she ran up and slipped her hand through knights arm partly for love partly for stability  elfie not asleep said knight after moving a few steps aside with her  no i cannot sleep may i stay here it is so dismal down there andand i was afraid where are we now  due south of portland bill those are the lights abeam of us look a terrible spot that on a stormy night and do you see a very small light that dips and rises to the right thats a lightship on the dangerous shoal called the shambles where many a good vessel has gone to pieces between it and ourselves is the racea place where antagonistic currents meet and form whirlpoolsa spot which is rough in the smoothest weather and terrific in a wind that dark dreary horizon we just discern to the left is the west bay terminated landwards by the chesil beach  what time is it harry  just past two  are you going below  oh no not tonight i prefer pure air  she fancied he might be displeased with her for coming to him at this unearthly hour i should like to stay here too if you will allow me she said timidly  i want to ask you things  allow you elfie said knight putting his arm round her and drawing her closer i am twice as happy with you by my side yes we will stay and watch the approach of day  so they again sought out the sheltered nook and sitting down wrapped themselves in the rug as before  what were you going to ask me he inquired as they undulated up and down  oh it was not muchperhaps a thing i ought not to ask she said hesitatingly her sudden wish had really been to discover at once whether he had ever before been engaged to be married if he had she would make that a ground for telling him a little of her conduct with stephen mrs jethways seeming words had so depressed the girl that she herself now painted her flight in the darkest colours and longed to ease her burdened mind by an instant confession if knight had ever been imprudent himself he might she hoped forgive all  i wanted to ask you she went on ifyou had ever been engaged before she added tremulously i hope you havei mean i dont mind at all if you have  no i never was knight instantly and heartily replied elfrideand there was a certain happy pride in his tonei am twelve years older than you and i have been about the world and in a way into society and you have not and yet i am not so unfit for you as strictthinking people might imagine who would assume the difference in age to signify most surely an equal addition to my practice in lovemaking  elfride shivered  you are coldis the wind too much for you  no she said gloomily the belief which had been her sheetanchor in hoping for forgiveness had proved false this account of the exceptional nature of his experience a matter which would have set her rejoicing two years ago chilled her now like a frost  you dont mind my asking you she continued  oh nonot at all  and have you never kissed many ladies she whispered hoping he would say a hundred at the least  the time the circumstances and the scene were such as to draw confidences from the most reserved elfride whispered knight in reply it is strange you should have asked that question but ill answer it though i have never told such a thing before i have been rather absurd in my avoidance of women i have never given a woman a kiss in my life except yourself and my mother the man of two and thirty with the experienced mind warmed all over with a boys ingenuous shame as he made the confession  what not one she faltered  no not one  how very strange  yes the reverse experience may be commoner and yet to those who have observed their own sex as i have my case is not remarkable men about town are womens favouritesthats the postulateand superficial people dont think far enough to see that there may be reserved lonely exceptions  are you proud of it harry  no indeed of late years i have wished i had gone my ways and trod out my measure like lighterhearted men i have thought of how many happy experiences i may have lost through never going to woo  then why did you hold aloof  i cannot say i dont think it was my nature to circumstance hindered me perhaps i have regretted it for another reason this great remissness of mine has had its effect upon me the older i have grown the more distinctly have i perceived that it was absolutely preventing me from liking any woman who was not as unpractised as i and i gave up the expectation of finding a nineteenthcentury young lady in my own raw state then i found you elfride and i felt for the first time that my fastidiousness was a blessing and it helped to make me worthy of you i felt at once that differing as we did in other experiences in this matter i resembled you well arent you glad to hear it elfride  yes i am she answered in a forced voice but i always had thought that men made lots of engagements before they marriedespecially if they dont marry very young  so all women think i supposeand rightly indeed of the majority of bachelors as i said before but an appreciable minority of slowcoach men do notand it makes them very awkward when they do come to the point however it didnt matter in my case  why she asked uneasily  because you know even less of lovemaking and matrimonial prearrangement than i and so you cant draw invidious comparisons if i do my engaging improperly  i think you do it beautifully  thank you dear but continued knight laughingly your opinion is not that of an expert which alone is of value  had she answered yes it is half as strongly as she felt it knight might have been a little astonished  if you had ever been engaged to be married before he went on i expect your opinion of my addresses would be different but then i should not  should not what harry  oh i was merely going to say that in that case i should never have given myself the pleasure of proposing to you since your freedom from that experience was your attraction darling  you are severe on women are you not  no i think not i had a right to please my taste and that was for untried lips other men than those of my sort acquire the taste as they get olderbut dont find an elfride  what horrid sound is that we hear when we pitch forward  only the screwdont find an elfride as i did to think that i should have discovered such an unseen flower down there in the westto whom a man is as much as a multitude to some women and a trip down the english channel like a voyage round the world  and would you she said and her voice was tremulous have given up a ladyif you had become engaged to herand then found she had had one kiss before yoursand would you havegone away and left her  one kissno hardly for that  two  welli could hardly say inventorially like that too much of that sort of thing certainly would make me dislike a woman but let us confine our attention to ourselves not go thinking of might have beens  so elfride had allowed her thoughts to dally with false surmise and every one of knights words fell upon her like a weight after this they were silent for a long time gazing upon the black mysterious sea and hearing the strange voice of the restless wind a rocking to and fro on the waves when the breeze is not too violent and cold produces a soothing effect even upon the most highlywrought mind elfride slowly sank against knight and looking down he found by her soft regular breathing that she had fallen asleep not wishing to disturb her he continued still and took an intense pleasure in supporting her warm young form as it rose and fell with her every breath  knight fell to dreaming too though he continued wide awake it was pleasant to realize the implicit trust she placed in him and to think of the charming innocence of one who could sink to sleep in so simple and unceremonious a manner more than all the musing unpractical student felt the immense responsibility he was taking upon himself by becoming the protector and guide of such a trusting creature the quiet slumber of her soul lent a quietness to his own then she moaned and turned herself restlessly presently her mutterings became distinct  dont tell himhe will not love mei did not mean any disgraceindeed i did not so dont tell harry we were going to be marriedthat was why i ran awayand he says he will not have a kissed womanand if you tell him he will go away and i shall die i pray have mercyoh  elfride started up wildly  the previous moment a musical dingdong had spread into the air from their right hand and awakened her  what is it she exclaimed in terror  only eight bells said knight soothingly dont be frightened little bird you are safe what have you been dreaming about  i cant tell i cant tell she said with a shudder oh i dont know what to do  stay quietly with me we shall soon see the dawn now look the morning star is lovely over there the clouds have completely cleared off whilst you have been sleeping what have you been dreaming of  a woman in our parish  dont you like her  i dont she doesnt like me where are we  about south of the exe  knight said no more on the words of her dream they watched the sky till elfride grew calm and the dawn appeared it was mere wan lightness first then the wind blew in a changed spirit and died away to a zephyr the star dissolved into the day  thats how i should like to die said elfride rising from her seat and leaning over the bulwark to watch the stars last expiring gleam  as the lines say knight replied       to set as sets the morning star which goes       not down behind the darkend west nor hides       obscured among the tempests of the sky       but melts away into the light of heaven   oh other people have thought the same thing have they thats always the case with my originalitiesthey are original to nobody but myself  not only the case with yours when i was a young hand at reviewing i used to find that a frightful pitfalldilating upon subjects i met with which were novelties to me and finding afterwards they had been exhausted by the thinking world when i was in pinafores  that is delightful whenever i find you have done a foolish thing i am glad because it seems to bring you a little nearer to me who have done many and elfride thought again of her enemy asleep under the deck they trod  all up the coast prominences singled themselves out from recesses then a rosy sky spread over the eastern sea and behind the low line of land flinging its livery in dashes upon the thin airy clouds in that direction every projection on the land seemed now so many fingers anxious to catch a little of the liquid light thrown so prodigally over the sky and after a fantastic time of lustrous yellows in the east the higher elevations along the shore were flooded with the same hues the bluff and bare contours of start point caught the brightest earliest glow of all and so also did the sides of its white lighthouse perched upon a shelf in its precipitous front like a mediaeval saint in a niche their lofty neighbour bolt head on the left remained as yet ungilded and retained its gray  then up came the sun as it were in jerks just to seaward of the easternmost point of land flinging out a jacobsladder path of light from itself to elfride and knight and coating them with rays in a few minutes the inferior dignitaries of the shorefroward point berry head and prawleall had acquired their share of the illumination ere this and at length the very smallest protuberance of wave cliff or inlet even to the innermost recesses of the lovely valley of the dart had its portion and sunlight now the common possession of all ceased to be the wonderful and coveted thing it had been a short half hour before  after breakfast plymouth arose into view and grew distincter to their nearing vision the breakwater appearing like a streak of phosphoric light upon the surface of the sea elfride looked furtively around for mrs jethway but could discern no shape like hers afterwards in the bustle of landing she looked again with the same result by which time the woman had probably glided upon the quay unobserved expanding with a sense of relief elfride waited whilst knight looked to their luggage and then saw her father approaching through the crowd twirling his walkingstick to catch their attention elbowing their way to him they all entered the town which smiled as sunny a smile upon elfride as it had done between one and two years earlier when she had entered it at precisely the same hour as the brideelect of stephen smith     chapter xxx      vassal unto love   elfride clung closer to knight as day succeeded day whatever else might admit of question there could be no dispute that the allegiance she bore him absorbed her whole soul and existence a greater than stephen had arisen and she had left all to follow him  the unreserved girl was never chary of letting her lover discover how much she admired him she never once held an idea in opposition to any one of his or insisted on any point with him or showed any independence or held her own on any subject his lightest whim she respected and obeyed as law and if expressing her opinion on a matter he took up the subject and differed from her she instantly threw down her own opinion as wrong and untenable even her ambiguities and espieglerie were but media of the same manifestation acted charades embodying the words of her prototype the tender and susceptible daughterinlaw of naomi let me find favour in thy sight my lord for that thou hast comforted me and for that thou hast spoken friendly unto thine handmaid  she was syringing the plants one wet day in the greenhouse knight was sitting under a great passionflower observing the scene sometimes he looked out at the rain from the sky and then at elfrides inner rain of larger drops which fell from trees and shrubs after having previously hung from the twigs like small silver fruit  i must give you something to make you think of me during this autumn at your chambers she was saying what shall it be portraits do more harm than good by selecting the worst expression of which your face is capable hair is unlucky and you dont like jewellery  something which shall bring back to my mind the many scenes we have enacted in this conservatory i see what i should prize very much that dwarf myrtle tree in the pot which you have been so carefully tending  elfride looked thoughtfully at the myrtle  i can carry it comfortably in my hat box said knight and i will put it in my window and so it being always before my eyes i shall think of you continually  it so happened that the myrtle which knight had singled out had a peculiar beginning and history it had originally been a twig worn in stephen smiths buttonhole and he had taken it thence stuck it into the pot and told her that if it grew she was to take care of it and keep it in remembrance of him when he was far away  she looked wistfully at the plant and a sense of fairness to smiths memory caused her a pang of regret that knight should have asked for that very one it seemed exceeding a common heartlessness to let it go  is there not anything you like better she said sadly that is only an ordinary myrtle  no i am fond of myrtle seeing that she did not take kindly to the idea he said again why do you object to my having that  oh noi dont object preciselyit was a feelingah heres another cutting lately struck and just as smallof a better kind and with prettier leavesmyrtus microphylla  that will do nicely let it be put in my room that i may not forget it what romance attaches to the other  it was a gift to me  the subject then dropped knight thought no more of the matter till on entering his bedroom in the evening he found the second myrtle placed upon his dressingtable as he had directed he stood for a moment admiring the fresh appearance of the leaves by candlelight and then he thought of the transaction of the day  male lovers as well as female can be spoilt by too much kindness and elfrides uniform submissiveness had given knight a rather exacting manner at crises attached to her as he was why should she have refused the one i first chose he now asked himself even such slight opposition as she had shown then was exceptional enough to make itself noticeable he was not vexed with her in the least the mere variation of her way today from her usual ways kept him musing on the subject because it perplexed him it was a giftthose were her words admitting it to be a gift he thought she could hardly value a mere friend more than she valued him as a lover and giving the plant into his charge would have made no difference except indeed it was the gift of a lover he murmured  i wonder if elfride has ever had a lover before he said aloud as a new idea quite this and companion thoughts were enough to occupy him completely till he fell asleeprather later than usual  the next day when they were again alone he said to her rather suddenly  do you love me more or less elfie for what i told you on board the steamer  you told me so many things she returned lifting her eyes to his and smiling  i mean the confession you coaxed out of methat i had never been in the position of lover before  it is a satisfaction i suppose to be the first in your heart she said to him with an attempt to continue her smiling  i am going to ask you a question now said knight somewhat awkwardly i only ask it in a whimsical way you know not with great seriousness elfride you may think it odd perhaps  elfride tried desperately to keep the colour in her face she could not though distressed to think that getting pale showed consciousness of deeper guilt than merely getting red  oh noi shall not think that she said because obliged to say something to fill the pause which followed her questioners remark  it is this have you ever had a lover i am almost sure you have not but have you  not as it were a lover i mean not worth mentioning harry she faltered  knight overstrained in sentiment as he knew the feeling to be felt some sickness of heart  still he was a lover  well a sort of lover i suppose she responded tardily  a man i mean you know  yes but only a mere person and  but truly your lover  yes a lover certainlyhe was that yes he might have been called my lover  knight said nothing to this for a minute or more and kept silent time with his finger to the tick of the old library clock in which room the colloquy was going on  you dont mind harry do you she said anxiously nestling close to him and watching his face  of course i dont seriously mind in reason a man cannot object to such a trifle i only thought you hadntthat was all  however one ray was abstracted from the glory about her head but afterwards when knight was wandering by himself over the bare and breezy hills and meditating on the subject that ray suddenly returned for she might have had a lover and never have cared in the least for him she might have used the word improperly and meant admirer all the time of course she had been admired and one man might have made his admiration more prominent than that of the resta very natural case  they were sitting on one of the garden seats when he found occasion to put the supposition to the test did you love that lover or admirer of yours ever so little elfie  she murmured reluctantly yes i think i did  knight felt the same faint touch of misery only a very little he said  i am not sure how much  but you are sure darling you loved him a little  i think i am sure i loved him a little  and not a great deal elfie  my love was not supported by reverence for his powers  but elfride did you love him deeply said knight restlessly  i dont exactly know how deep you mean by deeply  thats nonsense  you misapprehend and you have let go my hand she cried her eyes filling with tears harry dont be severe with me and dont question me i did not love him as i do you and could it be deeply if i did not think him cleverer than myself for i did not you grieve me so muchyou cant think  i will not say another word about it  and you will not think about it either will you i know you think of weaknesses in me after i am out of your sight and not knowing what they are i cannot combat them i almost wish you were of a grosser nature harry in truth i do or rather i wish i could have the advantages such a nature in you would afford me and yet have you as you are  what advantages would they be  less anxiety and more security ordinary men are not so delicate in their tastes as you and where the lover or husband is not fastidious and refined and of a deep nature things seem to go on better i fancyas far as i have been able to observe the world  yes i suppose it is right shallowness has this advantage that you cant be drowned there  but i think ill have you as you are yes i will she said winsomely the practical husbands and wives who take things philosophically are very humdrum are they not yes it would kill me quite you please me best as you are  even though i wish you had never cared for one before me  yes and you must not wish it dont  ill try not to elfride  so she hoped but her heart was troubled if he felt so deeply on this point what would he say did he know all and see it as mrs jethway saw it he would never make her the happiest girl in the world by taking her to be his own for aye the thought enclosed her as a tomb whenever it presented itself to her perturbed brain she tried to believe that mrs jethway would never do her such a cruel wrong as to increase the bad appearance of her folly by innuendoes and concluded that concealment having been begun must be persisted in if possible for what he might consider as bad as the fact was her previous concealment of it by strategy  but elfride knew mrs jethway to be her enemy and to hate her it was possible she would do her worst and should she do it all might be over  would the woman listen to reason and be persuaded not to ruin one who had never intentionally harmed her    it was night in the valley between endelstow crags and the shore the brook which trickled that way to the sea was distinct in its murmurs now and over the line of its course there began to hang a white riband of fog against the sky on the left hand of the vale the black form of the church could be seen on the other rose hazelbushes a few trees and where these were absent furze tuftsas tall as menon stems nearly as stout as timber the shriek of some bird was occasionally heard as it flew terrorstricken from its first roost to seek a new sleepingplace where it might pass the night unmolested  in the evening shade some way down the valley and under a row of scrubby oaks a cottage could still be discerned it stood absolutely alone the house was rather large and the windows of some of the rooms were nailed up with boards on the outside which gave a particularly deserted appearance to the whole erection from the front door an irregular series of rough and misshapen steps cut in the solid rock led down to the edge of the streamlet which at their extremity was hollowed into a basin through which the water trickled this was evidently the means of water supply to the dweller or dwellers in the cottage  a light footstep was heard descending from the higher slopes of the hillside indistinct in the pathway appeared a moving female shape who advanced and knocked timidly at the door no answer being returned the knock was repeated with the same result and it was then repeated a third time this also was unsuccessful  from one of the only two windows on the ground floor which were not boarded up came rays of light no shutter or curtain obscuring the room from the eyes of a passer on the outside so few walked that way after nightfall that any such means to secure secrecy were probably deemed unnecessary  the inequality of the rays falling upon the trees outside told that the light had its origin in a flickering fire only the visitor after the third knocking stepped a little to the left in order to gain a view of the interior and threw back the hood from her face the dancing yellow sheen revealed the fair and anxious countenance of elfride  inside the house this firelight was enough to illumine the room distinctly and to show that the furniture of the cottage was superior to what might have been expected from so unpromising an exterior it also showed to elfride that the room was empty beyond the light quiver and flap of the flames nothing moved or was audible therein  she turned the handle and entered throwing off the cloak which enveloped her under which she appeared without hat or bonnet and in the sort of halftoilette country people ordinarily dine in then advancing to the foot of the staircase she called distinctly but somewhat fearfully mrs jethway  no answer  with a look of relief and regret combined denoting that ease came to the heart and disappointment to the brain elfride paused for several minutes as if undecided how to act determining to wait she sat down on a chair the minutes drew on and after sitting on the thorns of impatience for half an hour she searched her pocket took therefrom a letter and tore off the blank leaf then taking out a pencil she wrote upon the paper   dear mrs jethwayi have been to visit you i wanted much to see you but i cannot wait any longer i came to beg you not to execute the threats you have repeated to me do not i beseech you mrs jethway let any one know i ran away from home it would ruin me with him and break my heart i will do anything for you if you will be kind to me in the name of our common womanhood do not i implore you make a scandal of meyours e swancourt   she folded the note cornerwise directed it and placed it on the table then again drawing the hood over her curly head she emerged silently as she had come  whilst this episode had been in action at mrs jethways cottage knight had gone from the diningroom into the drawingroom and found mrs swancourt there alone  elfride has vanished upstairs or somewhere she said  and i have been reading an article in an old number of the present that i lighted on by chance a short time ago it is an article you once told us was yours well harry with due deference to your literary powers allow me to say that this effusion is all nonsense in my opinion  what is it about said knight taking up the paper and reading  there dont get red about it own that experience has taught you to be more charitable i have never read such unchivalrous sentiments in my lifefrom a man i mean there i forgive you it was before you knew elfride  oh yes said knight looking up i remember now the text of that sermon was not my own at all but was suggested to me by a young man named smiththe same whom i have mentioned to you as coming from this parish i thought the idea rather ingenious at the time and enlarged it to the weight of a few guineas because i had nothing else in my head  which idea do you call the text i am curious to know that  well this said knight somewhat unwillingly that experience teaches and your sweetheart no less than your tailor is necessarily very imperfect in her duties if you are her first patron and conversely the sweetheart who is graceful under the initial kiss must be supposed to have had some practice in the trade  and do you mean to say that you wrote that upon the strength of another mans remark without having tested it by practice  yesindeed i do  then i think it was uncalled for and unfair and how do you know it is true i expect you regret it now  since you bring me into a serious mood i will speak candidly i do believe that remark to be perfectly true and having written it i would defend it anywhere but i do often regret having ever written it as well as others of the sort i have grown older since and i find such a tone of writing is calculated to do harm in the world every literary jack becomes a gentleman if he can only pen a few indifferent satires upon womankind women themselves too have taken to the trick and so upon the whole i begin to be rather ashamed of my companions  ah henry you have fallen in love since and it makes a difference said mrs swancourt with a faint tone of banter  thats true but that is not my reason  having found that in a case of your own experience a socalled goose was a swan it seems absurd to deny such a possibility in other mens experiences  you can hit palpably cousin charlotte said knight you are like the boy who puts a stone inside his snowball and i shall play with you no longer excuse mei am going for my evening stroll  though knight had spoken jestingly this incident and conversation had caused him a sudden depression coming rather singularly just after his discovery that elfride had known what it was to love warmly before she had known him his mind dwelt upon the subject and the familiar pipe he smoked whilst pacing up and down the shrubberypath failed to be a solace he thought again of those idle wordshitherto quite forgottenabout the first kiss of a girl and the theory seemed more than reasonable of course their sting now lay in their bearing on elfride  elfride under knights kiss had certainly been a very different woman from herself under stephens whether for good or for ill she had marvellously well learnt a betrothed ladys part and the fascinating finish of her deportment in this second campaign did probably arise from her unreserved encouragement of stephen knight with all the rapidity of jealous sensitiveness pounced upon some words she had inadvertently let fall about an earring which he had only partially understood at the time it was during that initial kiss by the little waterfall  we must be careful i lost the other by doing this  a flush which had in it as much of wounded pride as of sorrow passed over knight as he thought of what he had so frequently said to her in his simplicity i always meant to be the first comer in a womans heart fresh lips or none for me how childishly blind he must have seemed to this mere girl how she must have laughed at him inwardly he absolutely writhed as he thought of the confession she had wrung from him on the boat in the darkness of night the one conception which had sustained his dignity when drawn out of his shell on that occasionthat of her charming ignorance of all such mattershow absurd it was  this man whose imagination had been fed up to preternatural size by lonely study and silent observations of his kindwhose emotions had been drawn out long and delicate by his seclusion like plants in a cellarwas now absolutely in pain moreover several years of poetic study and if the truth must be told poetic efforts had tended to develop the affective side of his constitution still further in proportion to his active faculties it was his belief in the absolute newness of blandishment to elfride which had constituted her primary charm he began to think it was as hard to be earliest in a womans heart as it was to be first in the pool of bethesda  that knight should have been thus constituted that elfrides second lover should not have been one of the great mass of bustling mankind little given to introspection whose goodnature might have compensated for any lack of appreciativeness was the chance of things that her throbbing selfconfounding indiscreet heart should have to defend itself unaided against the keen scrutiny and logical power which knight now that his suspicions were awakened would sooner or later be sure to exercise against her was her misfortune a miserable incongruity was apparent in the circumstance of a strong mind practising its unerring archery upon a heart which the owner of that mind loved better than his own  elfrides docile devotion to knight was now its own enemy clinging to him so dependently she taught him in time to presume upon that devotiona lesson men are not slow to learn a slight rebelliousness occasionally would have done him no harm and would have been a world of advantage to her but she idolized him and was proud to be his bondservant     chapter xxxi       a worm i the bud   one day the reviewer said let us go to the cliffs again elfride and without consulting her wishes he moved as if to start at once  the cliff of our dreadful adventure she inquired with a shudder death stares me in the face in the person of that cliff  nevertheless so entirely had she sunk her individuality in his that the remark was not uttered as an expostulation and she immediately prepared to accompany him  no not that place said knight it is ghastly to me too that other i mean what is its namewindy beak  windy beak was the second cliff in height along that coast and as is frequently the case with the natural features of the globe no less than with the intellectual features of men it enjoyed the reputation of being the first moreover it was the cliff to which elfride had ridden with stephen smith on a wellremembered morning of his summer visit  so though thought of the former cliff had caused her to shudder at the perils to which her lover and herself had there been exposed by being associated with knight only it was not so objectionable as windy beak that place was worse than gloomy it was a perpetual reproach to her  but not liking to refuse she said it is further than the other cliff  yes but you can ride  and will you too  no ill walk  a duplicate of her original arrangement with stephen some fatality must be hanging over her head but she ceased objecting  very well harry ill ride she said meekly  a quarter of an hour later she was in the saddle but how different the mood from that of the former time she had indeed given up her position as queen of the less to be vassal of the greater here was no showing off now no scampering out of sight with pansy to perplex and tire her companion no saucy remarks on la belle dame sans merci elfride was burdened with the very intensity of her love  knight did most of the talking along the journey elfride silently listened and entirely resigned herself to the motions of the ambling horse upon which she sat alternately rising and sinking gently like a sea bird upon a sea wave  when they had reached the limit of a quadrupeds possibilities in walking knight tenderly lifted her from the saddle tied the horse and rambled on with her to the seat in the rock knight sat down and drew elfride deftly beside him and they looked over the sea  two or three degrees above that melancholy and eternally level line the ocean horizon hung a sun of brass with no visible rays in a sky of ashen hue it was a sky the sun did not illuminate or enkindle as is usual at sunsets this sheet of sky was met by the salt mass of gray water flecked here and there with white a waft of dampness occasionally rose to their faces which was probably rarefied spray from the blows of the sea upon the foot of the cliff  elfride wished it could be a longer time ago that she had sat there with stephen as her lover and agreed to be his wife the significant closeness of that time to the present was another item to add to the list of passionate fears which were chronic with her now  yet knight was very tender this evening and sustained her close to him as they sat  not a word had been uttered by either since sitting down when knight said musingly looking still afar  i wonder if any lovers in past years ever sat here with arms locked as we do now probably they have for the place seems formed for a seat  her recollection of a wellknown pair who had and the muchtalkedof loss which had ensued therefrom and how the young man had been sent back to look for the missing article led elfride to glance down to her side and behind her back many people who lose a trinket involuntarily give a momentary look for it in passing the spot ever so long afterwards they do not often find it elfride in turning her head saw something shine weakly from a crevice in the rocky sedile only for a few minutes during the day did the sun light the alcove to its innermost rifts and slits but these were the minutes now and its level rays did elfride the good or evil turn of revealing the lost ornament  elfrides thoughts instantly reverted to the words she had unintentionally uttered upon what had been going on when the earring was lost and she was immediately seized with a misgiving that knight on seeing the object would be reminded of her words her instinctive act therefore was to secure it privately  it was so deep in the crack that elfride could not pull it out with her hand though she made several surreptitious trials  what are you doing elfie said knight noticing her attempts and looking behind him likewise  she had relinquished the endeavour but too late  knight peered into the joint from which her hand had been withdrawn and saw what she had seen he instantly took a penknife from his pocket and by dint of probing and scraping brought the earring out upon open ground  it is not yours surely he inquired  yes it is she said quietly  well that is a most extraordinary thing that we should find it like this knight then remembered more circumstances what is it the one you have told me of  yes  the unfortunate remark of hers at the kiss came into his mind if eyes were ever an index to be trusted trying to repress the words he yet spoke on the subject more to obtain assurance that what it had seemed to imply was not true than from a wish to pry into bygones  were you really engaged to be married to that lover he said looking straight forward at the sea again  yesbut not exactly yet i think i was  o elfride engaged to be married he murmured  it would have been called asecret engagement i suppose but dont look so disappointed dont blame me  no no  why do you say no no in such a way sweetly enough but so barely  knight made no direct reply to this elfride i told you once he said following out his thoughts that i never kissed a woman as a sweetheart until i kissed you a kiss is not much i suppose and it happens to few young people to be able to avoid all blandishments and attentions except from the one they afterwards marry but i have peculiar weaknesses elfride and because i have led a peculiar life i must suffer for it i suppose i had hopedwell what i had no right to hope in connection with you you naturally granted your former lover the privileges you grant me  a yes came from her like the last sad whisper of a breeze  and he used to kiss youof course he did  yes  and perhaps you allowed him a more free manner in his lovemaking than i have shown in mine  no i did not this was rather more alertly spoken  but he adopted it without being allowed  yes  how much i have made of you elfride and how i have kept aloof said knight in deep and shaken tones so many days and hours as i have hoped in youi have feared to kiss you more than those two times and he made no scruples to  she crept closer to him and trembled as if with cold her dread that the whole story with random additions would become known to him caused her manner to be so agitated that knight was alarmed and perplexed into stillness the actual innocence which made her think so fearfully of what as the world goes was not a great matter magnified her apparent guilt it may have said to knight that a woman who was so flurried in the preliminaries must have a dreadful sequel to her tale  i know continued knight with an indescribable drag of manner and intonationi know i am absurdly scrupulous about youthat i want you too exclusively mine in your past before you knew mefrom your very cradlei wanted to think you had been mine i would make you mine by main force elfride he went on vehemently i cant help this jealousy over you it is my nature and must be so and i hate the fact that you have been caressed before yes hate it  she drew a long deep breath which was half a sob knights face was hard and he never looked at her at all still fixing his gaze far out to sea which the sun had now resigned to the shade in high places it is not long from sunset to night dusk being in a measure banished and though only evening where they sat it had been twilight in the valleys for half an hour upon the dull expanse of sea there gradually intensified itself into existence the gleam of a distant lightship  when that lover first kissed you elfride was it in such a place as this  yes it was  you dont tell me anything but what i wring out of you why is that why have you suppressed all mention of this when casual confidences of mine should have suggested confidence in return on board the juliet why were you so secret it seems like being made a fool of elfride to think that when i was teaching you how desirable it was that we should have no secrets from each other you were assenting in words but in act contradicting me confidence would have been so much more promising for our happiness if you had had confidence in me and told me willingly i shouldbe different but you suppress everything and i shall question you did you live at endelstow at that time  yes she said faintly  where were you when he first kissed you  sitting in this seat  ah i thought so said knight rising and facing her  and that accounts for everythingthe exclamation which you explained deceitfully and all forgive the harsh word elfrideforgive it he smiled a surface smile as he continued what a poor mortal i am to play second fiddle in everything and to be deluded by fibs  oh dont say it dont harry  where did he kiss you besides here  sitting ona tomb in thechurchyardand other places she answered with slow recklessness  never mind never mind he exclaimed on seeing her tears and perturbation i dont want to grieve you i dont care  but knight did care  it makes no difference you know he continued seeing she did not reply  i feel cold said elfride shall we go home  yes it is late in the year to sit long out of doors we ought to be off this ledge before it gets too dark to let us see our footing i daresay the horse is impatient  knight spoke the merest commonplace to her now he had hoped to the last moment that she would have volunteered the whole story of her first attachment it grew more and more distasteful to him that she should have a secret of this nature such entire confidence as he had pictured as about to exist between himself and the innocent young wife who had known no lovers tones save hiswas this its beginning he lifted her upon the horse and they went along constrainedly the poison of suspicion was doing its work well  an incident occurred on this homeward journey which was long remembered by both as adding shade to shadow knight could not keep from his mind the words of adams reproach to eve in paradise lost and at last whispered them to himself       foold and beguiled by him thou i by thee   what did you say elfride inquired timorously  it was only a quotation  they had now dropped into a hollow and the church tower made its appearance against the pale evening sky its lower part being hidden by some intervening trees elfride being denied an answer was looking at the tower and trying to think of some contrasting quotation she might use to regain his tenderness after a little thought she said in winning tones  thou hast been my hope and a strong tower for me against the enemy  they passed on a few minutes later three or four birds were seen to fly out of the tower  the strong tower moves said knight with surprise  a corner of the square mass swayed forward sank and vanished a loud rumble followed and a cloud of dust arose where all had previously been so clear  the church restorers have done it said elfride  at this minute mr swancourt was seen approaching them he came up with a bustling demeanour apparently much engrossed by some business in hand  we have got the tower down he exclaimed it came rather quicker than we intended it should the first idea was to take it down stone by stone you know in doing this the crack widened considerably and it was not believed safe for the men to stand upon the walls any longer then we decided to undermine it and three men set to work at the weakest corner this afternoon they had left off for the evening intending to give the final blow tomorrow morning and had been home about half an hour when down it came a very successful joba very fine job indeed but he was a tough old fellow in spite of the crack here mr swancourt wiped from his face the perspiration his excitement had caused him  poor old tower said elfride  yes i am sorry for it said knight it was an interesting piece of antiquitya local record of local art  ah but my dear sir we shall have a new one expostulated mr swancourt a splendid towerdesigned by a firstrate london manin the newest style of gothic art and full of christian feeling  indeed said knight  oh yes not in the barbarous clumsy architecture of this neighbourhood you see nothing so rough and pagan anywhere else in england when the men are gone i would advise you to go and see the church before anything further is done to it you can now sit in the chancel and look down the nave through the west arch and through that far out to sea in fact said mr swancourt significantly if a wedding were performed at the altar tomorrow morning it might be witnessed from the deck of a ship on a voyage to the south seas with a good glass however after dinner when the moon has risen go up and see for yourselves  knight assented with feverish readiness he had decided within the last few minutes that he could not rest another night without further talk with elfride upon the subject which now divided them he was determined to know all and relieve his disquiet in some way elfride would gladly have escaped further converse alone with him that night but it seemed inevitable  just after moonrise they left the house how little any expectation of the moonlight prospectwhich was the ostensible reason of their pilgrimagehad to do with knights real motive in getting the gentle girl again upon his arm elfride no less than himself well knew     chapter xxxii      had i wist before i kist   it was now october and the night air was chill after looking to see that she was well wrapped up knight took her along the hillside path they had ascended so many times in each others company when doubt was a thing unknown on reaching the church they found that one side of the tower was as the vicar had stated entirely removed and lying in the shape of rubbish at their feet the tower on its eastern side still was firm and might have withstood the shock of storms and the siege of battering years for many a generation even now they entered by the sidedoor went eastward and sat down by the altarsteps  the heavy arch spanning the junction of tower and nave formed tonight a black frame to a distant misty view stretching far westward just outside the arch came the heap of fallen stones then a portion of moonlit churchyard then the wide and convex sea behind it was a coupdoeil which had never been possible since the mediaeval masons first attached the old tower to the older church it dignified and hence must be supposed to have had an interest apart from that of simple moonlight on ancient wall and sea and shoreany mention of which has by this time it is to be feared become one of the cuckoocries which are heard but not regarded rays of crimson blue and purple shone upon the twain from the east window behind them wherein saints and angels vied with each other in primitive surroundings of landscape and sky and threw upon the pavement at the sitters feet a softer reproduction of the same translucent hues amid which the shadows of the two living heads of knight and elfride were opaque and prominent blots presently the moon became covered by a cloud and the iridescence died away  there it is gone said knight ive been thinking elfride that this place we sit on is where we may hope to kneel together soon but i am restless and uneasy and you know why  before she replied the moonlight returned again irradiating that portion of churchyard within their view it brightened the near part first and against the background which the cloudshadow had not yet uncovered stood brightest of all a white tombthe tomb of young jethway  knight still alive on the subject of elfrides secret thought of her words concerning the kiss that it once had occurred on a tomb in this churchyard  elfride he said with a superficial archness which did not half cover an undercurrent of reproach do you know i think you might have told me voluntarily about that pastof kisses and betrothingwithout giving me so much uneasiness and trouble was that the tomb you alluded to as having sat on with him  she waited an instant yes she said  the correctness of his random shot startled knight though considering that almost all the other memorials in the churchyard were upright headstones upon which nobody could possibly sit it was not so wonderful  elfride did not even now go on with the explanation her exacting lover wished to have and her reticence began to irritate him as before he was inclined to read her a lecture  why dont you tell me all he said somewhat indignantly elfride there is not a single subject upon which i feel more strongly than upon thisthat everything ought to be cleared up between two persons before they become husband and wife see how desirable and wise such a course is in order to avoid disagreeable contingencies in the form of discoveries afterwards for elfride a secret of no importance at all may be made the basis of some fatal misunderstanding only because it is discovered and not confessed they say there never was a couple of whom one had not some secret the other never knew or was intended to know this may or may not be true but if it be true some have been happy in spite rather than in consequence of it if a man were to see another man looking significantly at his wife and she were blushing crimson and appearing startled do you think he would be so well satisfied with for instance her truthful explanation that once to her great annoyance she accidentally fainted into his arms as if she had said it voluntarily long ago before the circumstance occurred which forced it from her suppose that admirer you spoke of in connection with the tomb yonder should turn up and bother me it would embitter our lives if i were then half in the dark as i am now  knight spoke the latter sentences with growing force  it cannot be she said  why not he asked sharply  elfride was distressed to find him in so stern a mood and she trembled in a confusion of ideas probably not intending a wilful prevarication she answered hurriedly  if hes dead how can you meet him  is he dead oh thats different altogether said knight immensely relieved but let me seewhat did you say about that tomb and him  thats his tomb she continued faintly  what was he who lies buried there the man who was your lover knight asked in a distinct voice  yes and i didnt love him or encourage him  but you let him kiss youyou said so you know elfride  she made no reply  why said knight recollecting circumstances by degrees you surely said you were in some degree engaged to himand of course you were if he kissed you and now you say you never encouraged him and i have been fancying you saidi am almost sure you didthat you were sitting with him on that tomb good god he cried suddenly starting up in anger are you telling me untruths why should you play with me like this ill have the right of it elfride we shall never be happy theres a blight upon us or me or you and it must be cleared off before we marry knight moved away impetuously as if to leave her  she jumped up and clutched his arm  dont go harrydont  tell me then said knight sternly and remember this no more fibs or upon my soul i shall hate you heavens that i should come to this to be made a fool of by a girls untruths  dont dont treat me so cruelly o harry harry have pity and withdraw those dreadful words i am truthful by naturei amand i dont know how i came to make you misunderstand but i was frightened she quivered so in her perturbation that she shook him with her note sentence incomplete in text  did you say you were sitting on that tomb he asked moodily  yes and it was true  then how in the name of heaven can a man sit upon his own tomb  that was another man forgive me harry wont you  what a lover in the tomb and a lover on it  ohohyes  then there were two before me  isuppose so  now dont be a silly woman with your supposingi hate all that said knight contemptuously almost well we learn strange things i dont know what i might have doneno man can say into what shape circumstances may warp himbut i hardly think i should have had the conscience to accept the favours of a new lover whilst sitting over the poor remains of the old one upon my soul i dont knight in moody meditation continued looking towards the tomb which stood staring them in the face like an avenging ghost  but you wrong meoh so grievously she cried i did not meditate any such thing believe me harry i did not it only happened soquite of itself  well i suppose you didnt intend such a thing he said nobody ever does he sadly continued  and him in the grave i never once loved  i suppose the second lover and you as you sat there vowed to be faithful to each other for ever  elfride only replied by quick heavy breaths showing she was on the brink of a sob  you dont choose to be anything but reserved then he said imperatively  of course we did she responded  of course you seem to treat the subject very lightly  it is past and is nothing to us now  elfride it is a nothing which though it may make a careless man laugh cannot but make a genuine one grieve it is a very gnawing pain tell me straight throughall of it  never o harry how can you expect it when so little of it makes you so harsh with me  now elfride listen to this you know that what you have told only jars the subtler fancies in one after all the feeling i have about it would be called and is mere sentimentality and i dont want you to suppose that an ordinary previous engagement of a straightforward kind would make any practical difference in my love or my wish to make you my wife but you seem to have more to tell and thats where the wrong is is there more  not much more she wearily answered  knight preserved a grave silence for a minute not much more he said at last i should think not indeed his voice assumed a low and steady pitch elfride you must not mind my saying a strangesounding thing for say it i shall it is this that if there were much more to add to an account which already includes all the particulars that a broken marriage engagement could possibly include with propriety it must be some exceptional thing which might make it impossible for me or any one else to love you and marry you  knights disturbed mood led him much further than he would have gone in a quieter moment and even as it was had she been assertive to any degree he would not have been so peremptory and had she been a stronger charactermore practical and less imaginativeshe would have made more use of her position in his heart to influence him but the confiding tenderness which had won him is ever accompanied by a sort of selfcommittal to the stream of events leading every such woman to trust more to the kindness of fate for good results than to any argument of her own  well well he murmured cynically i wont say it is your fault it is my illluck i suppose i had no real right to question youeverybody would say it was presuming but when we have misunderstood we feel injured by the subject of our misunderstanding you never said you had had nobody else here making love to you so why should i blame you elfride i beg your pardon  no no i would rather have your anger than that cool aggrieved politeness do drop that harry why should you inflict that upon me it reduces me to the level of a mere acquaintance  you do that with me why not confidence for confidence  yes but i didnt ask you a single question with regard to your past i didnt wish to know about it all i cared for was that wherever you came from whatever you had done whoever you had loved you were mine at last harry if originally you had known i had loved would you never have cared for me  i wont quite say that though i own that the idea of your inexperienced state had a great charm for me but i think this that if i had known there was any phase of your past love you would refuse to reveal if i asked to know it i should never have loved you  elfride sobbed bitterly am i such amere characterless toyas to have no attraction in me apart fromfreshness havent i brains you saidi was clever and ingenious in my thoughts andisnt that anything have i not some beauty i think i have a littleand i know i haveyes i do you have praised my voice and my manner and my accomplishments yet all these together are so much rubbish because iaccidentally saw a man before you  oh come elfride accidentally saw a man is very cool you loved him remember  and loved him a little  and refuse now to answer the simple question how it ended do you refuse still elfride  you have no right to question me soyou said so it is unfair trust me as i trust you  thats not at all  i shall not love you if you are so cruel it is cruel to me to argue like this  perhaps it is yes it is i was carried away by my feeling for you heaven knows that i didnt mean to but i have loved you so that i have used you badly  i dont mind it harry she instantly answered creeping up and nestling against him and i will not think at all that you used me harshly if you will forgive me and not be vexed with me any more i do wish i had been exactly as you thought i was but i could not help it you know if i had only known you had been coming what a nunnery i would have lived in to have been good enough for you  well never mind said knight and he turned to go he endeavoured to speak sportively as they went on diogenes laertius says that philosophers used voluntarily to deprive themselves of sight to be uninterrupted in their meditations men becoming lovers ought to do the same thing  whybut never mindi dont want to know dont speak laconically to me she said with deprecation  why because they would never then be distracted by discovering their idol was secondhand  she looked down and sighed and they passed out of the crumbling old place and slowly crossed to the churchyard entrance knight was not himself and he could not pretend to be she had not told all  he supported her lightly over the stile and was practically as attentive as a lover could be but there had passed away a glory and the dream was not as it had been of yore perhaps knight was not shaped by nature for a marrying man perhaps his lifelong constraint towards women which he had attributed to accident was not chance after all but the natural result of instinctive acts so minute as to be undiscernible even by himself or whether the rough dispelling of any bright illusion however imaginative depreciates the real and unexaggerated brightness which appertains to its basis one cannot say certain it was that knights disappointment at finding himself second or third in the field at elfrides momentary equivoque and at her reluctance to be candid brought him to the verge of cynicism     chapter xxxiii       o daughter of babylon wasted with misery   a habit of knights when not immediately occupied with elfrideto walk by himself for half an hour or so between dinner and bedtimehad become familiar to his friends at endelstow elfride herself among them when he had helped her over the stile she said gently if you wish to take your usual turn on the hill harry i can run down to the house alone  thank you elfie then i think i will  her form diminished to blackness in the moonlight and knight after remaining upon the churchyard stile a few minutes longer turned back again towards the building his usual course was now to light a cigar or pipe and indulge in a quiet meditation but tonight his mind was too tense to bethink itself of such a solace he merely walked round to the site of the fallen tower and sat himself down upon some of the large stones which had composed it until this day when the chain of circumstance originated by stephen smith while in the employ of mr hewby the london man of art had brought about its overthrow  pondering on the possible episodes of elfrides past life and on how he had supposed her to have had no past justifying the name he sat and regarded the white tomb of young jethway now close in front of him the sea though comparatively placid could as usual be heard from this point along the whole distance between promontories to the right and left floundering and entangling itself among the insulated stacks of rock which dotted the waters edgethe miserable skeletons of tortured old cliffs that would not even yet succumb to the wear and tear of the tides  as a change from thoughts not of a very cheerful kind knight attempted exertion he stood up and prepared to ascend to the summit of the ruinous heap of stones from which a more extended outlook was obtainable than from the ground he stretched out his arm to seize the projecting arris of a larger block than ordinary and so help himself up when his hand lighted plump upon a substance differing in the greatest possible degree from what he had expected to seizehard stone it was stringy and entangled and trailed upon the stone the deep shadow from the aisle wall prevented his seeing anything here distinctly and he began guessing as a necessity it is a tressy species of moss or lichen he said to himself  but it lay loosely over the stone  it is a tuft of grass he said  but it lacked the roughness and humidity of the finest grass  it is a masons whitewashbrush  such brushes he remembered were more bristly and however much used in repairing a structure would not be required in pulling one down  he said it must be a thready silk fringe  he felt further in it was somewhat warm knight instantly felt somewhat cold  to find the coldness of inanimate matter where you expect warmth is startling enough but a colder temperature than that of the body being rather the rule than the exception in common substances it hardly conveys such a shock to the system as finding warmth where utter frigidity is anticipated  god only knows what it is he said  he felt further and in the course of a minute put his hand upon a human head the head was warm but motionless the thready mass was the hair of the headlong and straggling showing that the head was a womans  knight in his perplexity stood still for a moment and collected his thoughts the vicars account of the fall of the tower was that the workmen had been undermining it all the day and had left in the evening intending to give the finishing stroke the next morning half an hour after they had gone the undermined angle came down the woman who was half buried as it seemed must have been beneath it at the moment of the fall  knight leapt up and began endeavouring to remove the rubbish with his hands the heap overlying the body was for the most part fine and dusty but in immense quantity it would be a saving of time to run for assistance he crossed to the churchyard wall and hastened down the hill  a little way down an intersecting road passed over a small ridge which now showed up darkly against the moon and this road here formed a kind of notch in the skyline at the moment that knight arrived at the crossing he beheld a man on this eminence coming towards him knight turned aside and met the stranger  there has been an accident at the church said knight without preface the tower has fallen on somebody who has been lying there ever since will you come and help  that i will said the man  it is a woman said knight as they hurried back and i think we two are enough to extricate her do you know of a shovel  the gravedigging shovels are about somewhere they used to stay in the tower  and there must be some belonging to the workmen  they searched about and in an angle of the porch found three carefully stowed away going round to the west end knight signified the spot of the tragedy  we ought to have brought a lantern he exclaimed but we may be able to do without he set to work removing the superincumbent mass  the other man who looked on somewhat helplessly at first now followed the example of knights activity and removed the larger stones which were mingled with the rubbish but with all their efforts it was quite ten minutes before the body of the unfortunate creature could be extricated they lifted her as carefully as they could breathlessly carried her to felix jethways tomb which was only a few steps westward and laid her thereon  is she dead indeed said the stranger  she appears to be said knight which is the nearest house the vicarage i suppose  yes but since we shall have to call a surgeon from castle boterel i think it would be better to carry her in that direction instead of away from the town  and is it not much further to the first house we come to going that way than to the vicarage or to the crags  not much the stranger replied  suppose we take her there then and i think the best way to do it would be thus if you dont mind joining hands with me  not in the least i am glad to assist  making a kind of cradle by clasping their hands crosswise under the inanimate woman they lifted her and walked on side by side down a path indicated by the stranger who appeared to know the locality well  i had been sitting in the church for nearly an hour knight resumed when they were out of the churchyard afterwards i walked round to the site of the fallen tower and so found her it is painful to think i unconsciously wasted so much time in the very presence of a perishing flying soul  the tower fell at dusk did it not quite two hours ago i think  yes she must have been there alone what could have been her object in visiting the churchyard then  it is difficult to say the stranger looked inquiringly into the reclining face of the motionless form they bore would you turn her round for a moment so that the light shines on her face he said  they turned her face to the moon and the man looked closer into her features why i know her he exclaimed  who is she  mrs jethway and the cottage we are taking her to is her own she is a widow and i was speaking to her only this afternoon i was at castle boterel postoffice and she came there to post a letter poor soul let us hurry on  hold my wrist a little tighter was not that tomb we laid her on the tomb of her only son  yes it was yes i see it now she was there to visit the tomb since the death of that son she has been a desolate desponding woman always bewailing him she was a farmers wife very well educateda governess originally i believe  knights heart was moved to sympathy his own fortunes seemed in some strange way to be interwoven with those of this jethway family through the influence of elfride over himself and the unfortunate son of that house he made no reply and they still walked on  she begins to feel heavy said the stranger breaking the silence  yes she does said knight and after another pause added i think i have met you before though where i cannot recollect may i ask who you are  oh yes i am lord luxellian who are you  i am a visitor at the cragsmr knight  i have heard of you mr knight  and i of you lord luxellian i am glad to meet you  i may say the same i am familiar with your name in print  and i with yours is this the house  yes  the door was locked knight reflecting a moment searched the pocket of the lifeless woman and found therein a large key which on being applied to the door opened it easily the fire was out but the moonlight entered the quarried window and made patterns upon the floor the rays enabled them to see that the room into which they had entered was pretty well furnished it being the same room that elfride had visited alone two or three evenings earlier they deposited their still burden on an oldfashioned couch which stood against the wall and knight searched about for a lamp or candle he found a candle on a shelf lighted it and placed it on the table  both knight and lord luxellian examined the pale countenance attentively and both were nearly convinced that there was no hope no marks of violence were visible in the casual examination they made  i think that as i know where doctor granson lives said lord luxellian i had better run for him whilst you stay here  knight agreed to this lord luxellian then went off and his hurrying footsteps died away knight continued bending over the body and a few minutes longer of careful scrutiny perfectly satisfied him that the woman was far beyond the reach of the lancet and the drug her extremities were already beginning to get stiff and cold knight covered her face and sat down  the minutes went by the essayist remained musing on all the occurrences of the night his eyes were directed upon the table and he had seen for some time that writingmaterials were spread upon it he now noticed these more particularly there were an inkstand pen blottingbook and notepaper several sheets of paper were thrust aside from the rest upon which letters had been begun and relinquished as if their form had not been satisfactory to the writer a stick of black sealingwax and seal were there too as if the ordinary fastening had not been considered sufficiently secure the abandoned sheets of paper lying as they did open upon the table made it possible as he sat to read the few words written on each one ran thus   siras a woman who was once blest with a dear son of her own i implore you to accept a warning   another   sirif you will deign to receive warning from a stranger before it is too late to alter your course listen to   the third   sirwith this letter i enclose to you another which unaided by any explanation from me tells a startling tale i wish however to add a few words to make your delusion yet more clear to you    it was plain that after these renounced beginnings a fourth letter had been written and despatched which had been deemed a proper one upon the table were two drops of sealingwax the stick from which they were taken having been laid down overhanging the edge of the table the end of it drooped showing that the wax was placed there whilst warm there was the chair in which the writer had sat the impression of the letters address upon the blottingpaper and the poor widow who had caused these results lying dead hard by knight had seen enough to lead him to the conclusion that mrs jethway having matter of great importance to communicate to some friend or acquaintance had written him a very careful letter and gone herself to post it that she had not returned to the house from that time of leaving it till lord luxellian and himself had brought her back dead  the unutterable melancholy of the whole scene as he waited on silent and alone did not altogether clash with the mood of knight even though he was the affianced of a fair and winning girl and though so lately he had been in her company whilst sitting on the remains of the demolished tower he had defined a new sensation that the lengthened course of inaction he had lately been indulging in on elfrides account might probably not be good for him as a man who had work to do it could quickly be put an end to by hastening on his marriage with her  knight in his own opinion was one who had missed his mark by excessive aiming having now to a great extent given up ideal ambitions he wished earnestly to direct his powers into a more practical channel and thus correct the introspective tendencies which had never brought himself much happiness or done his fellowcreatures any great good to make a start in this new direction by marriage which since knowing elfride had been so entrancing an idea was less exquisite tonight that the curtailment of his illusion regarding her had something to do with the reaction and with the return of his old sentiments on wasting time is more than probable though knights heart had so greatly mastered him the mastery was not so complete as to be easily maintained in the face of a moderate intellectual revival  his reverie was broken by the sound of wheels and a horses tramp the door opened to admit the surgeon lord luxellian and a mr coole coroner for the division who had been attending at castle boterel that very day and was having an afterdinner chat with the doctor when lord luxellian arrived next came two female nurses and some idlers  mr granson after a cursory examination pronounced the woman dead from suffocation induced by intense pressure on the respiratory organs and arrangements were made that the inquiry should take place on the following morning before the return of the coroner to st launces  shortly afterwards the house of the widow was deserted by all its living occupants and she abode in death as she had in her life during the past two years entirely alone     chapter xxxiv     yea happy shall he be that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us   sixteen hours had passed knight was entering the ladies boudoir at the crags upon his return from attending the inquest touching the death of mrs jethway elfride was not in the apartment  mrs swancourt made a few inquiries concerning the verdict and collateral circumstances then she said  the postman came this morning the minute after you left the house there was only one letter for you and i have it here  she took a letter from the lid of her workbox and handed it to him knight took the missive abstractedly but struck by its appearance murmured a few words and left the room  the letter was fastened with a black seal and the handwriting in which it was addressed had lain under his eyes long and prominently only the evening before  knight was greatly agitated and looked about for a spot where he might be secure from interruption it was the season of heavy dews which lay on the herbage in shady places all the day long nevertheless he entered a small patch of neglected grassplat enclosed by the shrubbery and there perused the letter which he had opened on his way thither  the handwriting the seal the paper the introductory words all had told on the instant that the letter had come to him from the hands of the widow jethway now dead and cold he had instantly understood that the unfinished notes which caught his eye yesternight were intended for nobody but himself he had remembered some of the words of elfride in her sleep on the steamer that somebody was not to tell him of something or it would be her ruina circumstance hitherto deemed so trivial and meaningless that he had wellnigh forgotten it all these things infused into him an emotion intense in power and supremely distressing in quality the paper in his hand quivered as he read   the valley endelstow  sira woman who has not much in the world to lose by any censure this act may bring upon her wishes to give you some hints concerning a lady you love if you will deign to accept a warning before it is too late you will notice what your correspondent has to say  you are deceived can such a woman as this be worthy  one who encouraged an honest youth to love her then slighted him so that he died  one who next took a man of no birth as a lover who was forbidden the house by her father  one who secretly left her home to be married to that man met him and went with him to london  one who for some reason or other returned again unmarried  one who in her aftercorrespondence with him went so far as to address him as her husband  one who wrote the enclosed letter to ask me who better than anybody else knows the story to keep the scandal a secret  i hope soon to be beyond the reach of either blame or praise but before removing me god has put it in my power to avenge the death of my son  gertrude jethway   the letter enclosed was the note in pencil that elfride had written in mrs jethways cottage   dear mrs jethwayi have been to visit you i wanted much to see you but i cannot wait any longer i came to beg you not to execute the threats you have repeated to me do not i beseech you mrs jethway let any one know i ran away from home it would ruin me with him and break my heart i will do anything for you if you will be kind to me in the name of our common womanhood do not i implore you make a scandal of meyours  e swancourt   knight turned his head wearily towards the house the ground rose rapidly on nearing the shrubbery in which he stood raising it almost to a level with the first floor of the crags elfrides dressingroom lay in the salient angle in this direction and it was lighted by two windows in such a position that from knights standingplace his sight passed through both windows and raked the room elfride was there she was pausing between the two windows looking at her figure in the chevalglass she regarded herself long and attentively in front turned flung back her head and observed the reflection over her shoulder  nobody can predicate as to her object or fancy she may have done the deed in the very abstraction of deep sadness she may have been moaning from the bottom of her heart how unhappy am i but the impression produced on knight was not a good one he dropped his eyes moodily the dead womans letter had a virtue in the accident of its juncture far beyond any it intrinsically exhibited circumstance lent to evil words a ring of pitiless justice echoing from the grave knight could not endure their possession he tore the letter into fragments  he heard a brushing among the bushes behind and turning his head he saw elfride following him the fair girl looked in his face with a wistful smile of hope too forcedly hopeful to displace the firmly established dread beneath it his severe words of the previous night still sat heavy upon her  i saw you from my window harry she said timidly  the dew will make your feet wet he observed as one deaf  i dont mind it  there is danger in getting wet feet  yesharry what is the matter  oh nothing shall i resume the serious conversation i had with you last night no perhaps not perhaps i had better not  oh i cannot tell how wretched it all is ah i wish you were your own dear self again and had kissed me when i came up why didnt you ask me for one why dont you now  too free in manner by half he heard murmur the voice within him  it was that hateful conversation last night she went on oh those words last night was a black night for me  kissi hate that word dont talk of kissing for gods sake i should think you might with advantage have shown tact enough to keep back that word kiss considering those you have accepted  she became very pale and a rigid and desolate charactery took possession of her face that face was so delicate and tender in appearance now that one could fancy the pressure of a finger upon it would cause a livid spot  knight walked on and elfride with him silent and unopposing he opened a gate and they entered a path across a stubblefield  perhaps i intrude upon you she said as he closed the gate shall i go away  no listen to me elfride knights voice was low and unequal i have been honest with you will you be so with me if anystrangeconnection has existed between yourself and a predecessor of mine tell it now it is better that i know it now even though the knowledge should part us than that i should discover it in time to come and suspicions have been awakened in me i think i will not say how because i despise the means a discovery of any mystery of your past would embitter our lives  knight waited with a slow manner of calmness his eyes were sad and imperative they went farther along the path  will you forgive me if i tell you all she exclaimed entreatingly  i cant promise so much depends upon what you have to tell  elfride could not endure the silence which followed  are you not going to love me she burst out harry harry love me and speak as usual do i beseech you harry  are you going to act fairly by me said knight with rising anger or are you not what have i done to you that i should be put off like this be caught like a bird in a springe everything intended to be hidden from me why is it elfride thats what i ask you  in their agitation they had left the path and were wandering among the wet and obstructive stubble without knowing or heeding it  what have i done she faltered  what how can you ask what when you know so well you know that i have designedly been kept in ignorance of something attaching to you which had i known of it might have altered all my conduct and yet you say what  she drooped visibly and made no answer  not that i believe in malicious letterwriters and whisperers not i i dont know whether i do or dont upon my soul i cant tell i know this a religion was building itself upon you in my heart i looked into your eyes and thought i saw there truth and innocence as pure and perfect as ever embodied by god in the flesh of woman perfect truth is too much to expect but ordinary truth i will have or nothing at all just say then is the matter you keep back of the gravest importance or is it not  i dont understand all your meaning if i have hidden anything from you it has been because i loved you so and i fearedfearedto lose you  since you are not given to confidence i want to ask you some plain questions have i your permission  yes she said and there came over her face a weary resignation say the harshest words you can i will bear them  there is a scandal in the air concerning you elfride and i cannot even combat it without knowing definitely what it is it may not refer to you entirely or even at all knight trifled in the very bitterness of his feeling in the time of the french revolution pariseau a balletmaster was beheaded by mistake for parisot a captain of the kings guard i wish there was another e swancourt in the neighbourhood look at this  he handed her the letter she had written and left on the table at mrs jethways she looked over it vacantly  it is not so much as it seems she pleaded it seems wickedly deceptive to look at now but it had a much more natural origin than you think my sole wish was not to endanger our love o harry that was all my idea it was not much harm  yes yes but independently of the poor miserable creatures remarks it seems to implysomething wrong  what remarks  those she wrote menow torn to pieces elfride did you run away with a man you lovedthat was the damnable statement has such an accusation life in itreally truly elfride  yes she whispered  knights countenance sank to be married to him came huskily from his lips  yes oh forgive me i had never seen you harry  to london  yes but i  answer my questions say nothing else elfride did you ever deliberately try to marry him in secret  no not deliberately  but did you do it  a feeble red passed over her face  yes she said  and after thatdid youwrite to him as your husband and did he address you as his wife  listen listen it was  do answer me only answer me  then yes we did her lips shook but it was with some little dignity that she continued i would gladly have told you for i knew and know i had done wrong but i dared not i loved you too well oh so well you have been everything in the world to meand you are now will you not forgive me  it is a melancholy thought that men who at first will not allow the verdict of perfection they pronounce upon their sweethearts or wives to be disturbed by gods own testimony to the contrary will once suspecting their purity morally hang them upon evidence they would be ashamed to admit in judging a dog  the reluctance to tell which arose from elfrides simplicity in thinking herself so much more culpable than she really was had been doing fatal work in knights mind the man of many ideas now that his first dream of impossible things was over vibrated too far in the contrary direction and her every movement of featureevery tremorevery confused wordwas taken as so much proof of her unworthiness  elfride we must bid goodbye to compliment said knight we must do without politeness now look in my face and as you believe in god above tell me truly one thing more were you away alone with him  yes  did you return home the same day on which you left it  no  the word fell like a bolt and the very land and sky seemed to suffer knight turned aside meantime elfrides countenance wore a look indicating utter despair of being able to explain matters so that they would seem no more than they really werea despair which not only relinquishes the hope of direct explanation but wearily gives up all collateral chances of extenuation  the scene was engraved for years on the retina of knights eye the dead and brown stubble the weeds among it the distant belt of beeches shutting out the view of the house the leaves of which were now red and sick to death  you must forget me he said we shall not marry elfride  how much anguish passed into her soul at those words from him was told by the look of supreme torture she wore  what meaning have you harry you only say so do you  she looked doubtingly up at him and tried to laugh as if the unreality of his words must be unquestionable  you are not in earnest i knowi hope you are not surely i belong to you and you are going to keep me for yours  elfride i have been speaking too roughly to you i have said what i ought only to have thought i like you and let me give you a word of advice marry your man as soon as you can however weary of each other you may feel you belong to each other and i am not going to step between you do you think i woulddo you think i could for a moment if you cannot marry him now and another makes you his wife do not reveal this secret to him after marriage if you do not before honesty would be damnation then  bewildered by his expressions she exclaimed  no no i will not be a wife unless i am yours and i must be yours  if we had married  but you dont meanthatthatyou will go away and leave me and not be anything more to meoh you dont  convulsive sobs took all nerve out of her utterance she checked them and continued to look in his face for the ray of hope that was not to be found there  i am going indoors said knight you will not follow me elfride i wish you not to  oh no indeed i will not  and then i am going to castle boterel goodbye  he spoke the farewell as if it were but for the daylightly as he had spoken such temporary farewells many times beforeand she seemed to understand it as such knight had not the power to tell her plainly that he was going for ever he hardly knew for certain that he was whether he should rush back again upon the current of an irresistible emotion or whether he could sufficiently conquer himself and her in him to establish that parting as a supreme farewell and present himself to the world again as no womans  ten minutes later he had left the house leaving directions that if he did not return in the evening his luggage was to be sent to his chambers in london whence he intended to write to mr swancourt as to the reasons of his sudden departure he descended the valley and could not forbear turning his head he saw the stubblefield and a slight girlish figure in the midst of itup against the sky elfride docile as ever had hardly moved a step for he had said remain he looked and saw her againhe saw her for weeks and months he withdrew his eyes from the scene swept his hand across them as if to brush away the sight breathed a low groan and went on     chapter xxxv       and wilt thou leave me thussay naysay nay   the scene shifts to knights chambers in bedes inn it was late in the evening of the day following his departure from endelstow a drizzling rain descended upon london forming a humid and dreary halo over every welllighted street the rain had not yet been prevalent long enough to give to rapid vehicles that clear and distinct rattle which follows the thorough washing of the stones by a drenching rain but was just sufficient to make footway and roadway slippery adhesive and clogging to both feet and wheels  knight was standing by the fire looking into its expiring embers previously to emerging from his door for a dreary journey home to richmond his hat was on and the gas turned off the blind of the window overlooking the alley was not drawn down and with the light from beneath which shone over the ceiling of the room came in place of the usual babble only the reduced clatter and quick speech which were the result of necessity rather than choice  whilst he thus stood waiting for the expiration of the few minutes that were wanting to the time for his catching the train a light tapping upon the door mingled with the other sounds that reached his ears it was so faint at first that the outer noises were almost sufficient to drown it finding it repeated knight crossed the lobby crowded with books and rubbish and opened the door  a woman closely muffled up but visibly of fragile build was standing on the landing under the gaslight she sprang forward flung her arms round knights neck and uttered a low cry  o harry harry you are killing me i could not help coming dont send me awaydont forgive your elfride for comingi love you so  knights agitation and astonishment mastered him for a few moments  elfride he cried what does this mean what have you done  do not hurt me and punish meoh do not i couldnt help coming it was killing me last night when you did not come back i could not bear iti could not only let me be with you and see your face harry i dont ask for more  her eyelids were hot heavy and thick with excessive weeping and the delicate rosered of her cheeks was disfigured and inflamed by the constant chafing of the handkerchief in wiping her many tears  who is with you have you come alone he hurriedly inquired  yes when you did not come last night i sat up hoping you would comeand the night was all agonyand i waited on and on and you did not come then when it was morning and your letter said you were gone i could not endure it and i ran away from them to st launces and came by the train and i have been all day travelling to you and you wont make me go away again will you harry because i shall always love you till i die  yet it is wrong for you to stay o elfride what have you committed yourself to it is ruin to your good name to run to me like this has not your first experience been sufficient to keep you from these things  my name harry i shall soon die and what good will my name be to me then oh could i but be the man and you the woman i would not leave you for such a little fault as mine do not think it was so vile a thing in me to run away with him ah how i wish you could have run away with twenty women before you knew me that i might show you i would think it no fault but be glad to get you after them all so that i had you if you only knew me through and through how true i am harry cannot i be yours say you love me just the same and dont let me be separated from you again will you i cannot bear itall the long hours and days and nights going on and you not there but away because you hate me  not hate you elfride he said gently and supported her with his arm but you cannot stay here nowjust at present i mean  i suppose i must noti wish i might i am afraid that ifyou lose sight of mesomething dark will happen and we shall not meet again harry if i am not good enough to be your wife i wish i could be your servant and live with you and not be sent away never to see you again i dont mind what it is except that  no i cannot send you away i cannot god knows what dark future may arise out of this evenings work but i cannot send you away you must sit down and i will endeavour to collect my thoughts and see what had better be done  at that moment a loud knocking at the house door was heard by both accompanied by a hurried ringing of the bell that echoed from attic to basement the door was quickly opened and after a few hasty words of converse in the hall heavy footsteps ascended the stairs  the face of mr swancourt flushed grieved and stern appeared round the landing of the staircase he came higher up and stood beside them glancing over and past knight with silent indignation he turned to the trembling girl  o elfride and have i found you at last are these your tricks madam when will you get rid of your idiocies and conduct yourself like a decent woman is my family name and house to be disgraced by acts that would be a scandal to a washerwomans daughter come along madam come  she is so weary said knight in a voice of intensest anguish mr swancourt dont be harsh with herlet me beg of you to be tender with her and love her  to you sir said mr swancourt turning to him as if by the sheer pressure of circumstances i have little to say i can only remark that the sooner i can retire from your presence the better i shall be pleased why you could not conduct your courtship of my daughter like an honest man i do not know why shea foolish inexperienced girlshould have been tempted to this piece of folly i do not know even if she had not known better than to leave her home you might have i should think  it is not his fault he did not tempt me papa i came  if you wished the marriage broken off why didnt you say so plainly if you never intended to marry why could you not leave her alone upon my soul it grates me to the heart to be obliged to think so ill of a man i thought my friend  knight soulsick and weary of his life did not arouse himself to utter a word in reply how should he defend himself when his defence was the accusation of elfride on that account he felt a miserable satisfaction in letting her father go on thinking and speaking wrongfully it was a faint ray of pleasure straying into the great gloominess of his brain to think that the vicar might never know but that he as her lover tempted her away which seemed to be the form mr swancourts misapprehension had taken  now are you coming said mr swancourt to her again he took her unresisting hand drew it within his arm and led her down the stairs knights eyes followed her the last moment begetting in him a frantic hope that she would turn her head she passed on and never looked back  he heard the door openclose again the wheels of a cab grazed the kerbstone a murmured direction followed the door was slammed together the wheels moved and they rolled away   from that hour of her reappearance a dreadful conflict raged within the breast of henry knight his instinct emotion affectivenessor whatever it may be calledurged him to stand forward seize upon elfride and be her cherisher and protector through life then came the devastating thought that elfrides childlike unreasoning and indiscreet act in flying to him only proved that the proprieties must be a dead letter with her that the unreserve which was really artlessness without ballast meant indifference to decorum and what so likely as that such a woman had been deceived in the past he said to himself in a mood of the bitterest cynicism the suspicious discreet woman who imagines dark and evil things of all her fellowcreatures is far too shrewd to be deluded by man trusting beings like elfride are the women who fall  hours and days went by and knight remained inactive lengthening time which made fainter the heartawakening power of her presence strengthened the mental ability to reason her down elfride loved him he knew and he could not leave off loving her but marry her he would not if she could but be again his own elfridethe woman she had seemed to bebut that woman was dead and buried and he knew her no more and how could he marry this elfride one who if he had originally seen her as she was would have been barely an interesting pitiable acquaintance in his eyesno more  it cankered his heart to think he was confronted by the closest instance of a worse state of things than any he had assumed in the pleasant social philosophy and satire of his essays  the moral rightness of this mans life was worthy of all praise but in spite of some intellectual acumen knight had in him a modicum of that wrongheadedness which is mostly found in scrupulously honest people with him truth seemed too clean and pure an abstraction to be so hopelessly churned in with error as practical persons find it having now seen himself mistaken in supposing elfride to be peerless nothing on earth could make him believe she was not so very bad after all  he lingered in town a fortnight doing little else than vibrate between passion and opinions one idea remained intactthat it was better elfride and himself should not meet  when he surveyed the volumes on his shelvesfew of which had been opened since elfride first took possession of his hearttheir untouched and orderly arrangement reproached him as an apostate from the old faith of his youth and early manhood he had deserted those neverfailing friends so they seemed to say for an unstable delight in a ductile woman which had ended all in bitterness the spirit of selfdenial verging on asceticism which had ever animated knight in old times announced itself as having departed with the birth of love with it having gone the selfrespect which had compensated for the lack of selfgratification poor little elfride instead of holding as formerly a place in his religion began to assume the hue of a temptation perhaps it was human and correctly natural that knight never once thought whether he did not owe her a little sacrifice for her unchary devotion in saving his life  with a consciousness of having thus like antony kissed away kingdoms and provinces he next considered how he had revealed his higher secrets and intentions to her an unreserve he would never have allowed himself with any man living how was it that he had not been able to refrain from telling her of adumbrations heretofore locked in the closest strongholds of his mind  knights was a robust intellect which could escape outside the atmosphere of heart and perceive that his own love as well as other peoples could be reduced by change of scene and circumstances at the same time the perception was a superimposed sorrow         o last regret regret can die   but being convinced that the death of this regret was the best thing for him he did not long shrink from attempting it he closed his chambers suspended his connection with editors and left london for the continent here we will leave him to wander without purpose beyond the nominal one of encouraging obliviousness of elfride     chapter xxxvi       the pennies the jewel that beautifies a   i cant think whats coming to these st launces people at all at all  with their howdyedos do you mean  ay with their howdyedos and shaking of hands asking me in and tender inquiries for you john  these words formed part of a conversation between john smith and his wife on a saturday evening in the spring which followed knights departure from england stephen had long since returned to india and the persevering couple themselves had migrated from lord luxellians park at endelstow to a comfortable roadside dwelling about a mile out of st launces where john had opened a small stone and slate yard in his own name  when we came here six months ago continued mrs smith though i had paid ready money so many years in the town my friskier shopkeepers would only speak over the counter meet em in the street halfanhour after and theyd treat me with staring ignorance of my face  look through ye as through a glass winder  yes the brazen ones would the quiet and cool ones would glance over the top of my head past my side over my shoulder but never meet my eye the gentlemodest would turn their faces south if i were coming east flit down a passage if i were about to halve the pavement with them there was the spruce young bookseller would play the same tricks the butchers daughters the upholsterers young men hand in glove when doing business out of sight with you but caring nothing for a old woman when playing the genteel away from all signs of their trade  true enough maria  well today tis all different id no sooner got to market than mrs joakes rushed up to me in the eyes of the town and said my dear mrs smith now you must be tired with your walk come in and have some lunch i insist upon it knowing you so many years as i have dont you remember when we used to go looking for owls feathers together in the castle ruins theres no knowing what you may need so i answered the woman civilly i hadnt got to the corner before that thriving young lawyer sweet whos quite the dandy ran after me out of breath mrs smith he says excuse my rudeness but theres a bramble on the tail of your dress which youve dragged in from the country allow me to pull it off for you if youll believe me this was in the very front of the town hall whats the meaning of such sudden love for a old woman  cant say unless tis repentance  repentance was there ever such a fool as you john did anybody ever repent with money ins pocket and fifty years to live  now ive been thinking too said john passing over the query as hardly pertinent that ive had more lovingkindness from folks today than i ever have before since we moved here why old alderman tope walked out to the middle of the street where i was to shake hands with meso a did having on my working clothes i thought twas odd ay and there was young werrington  whos he  why the man in hill street who plays and sells flutes trumpets and fiddles and grand pehanners he was talking to egloskerry that very small bachelorman with money in the funds i was going by im sure without thinking or expecting a nod from men of that glib kidney when in my working clothes  you always will go poking into town in your working clothes beg you to change how i will tis no use  well however i was in my working clothes werrington saw me ah mr smith a fine morning excellent weather for building says he out as loud and friendly as if id met him in some deep hollow where he could get nobody else to speak to at all twas odd for werrington is one of the very ringleaders of the fast class  at that moment a tap came to the door the door was immediately opened by mrs smith in person  youll excuse us im sure mrs smith but this beautiful spring weather was too much for us yes and we could stay in no longer and i took mrs trewen upon my arm directly wed had a cup of tea and out we came and seeing your beautiful crocuses in such a bloom weve taken the liberty to enter well step round the garden if you dont mind  not at all said mrs smith and they walked round the garden she lifted her hands in amazement directly their backs were turned goodness send us grace  who be they said her husband  actually mr trewen the bankmanager and his wife  john smith staggered in mind went out of doors and looked over the garden gate to collect his ideas he had not been there two minutes when wheels were heard and a carriage and pair rolled along the road a distinguishedlooking lady with the demeanour of a duchess reclined within when opposite smiths gate she turned her head and instantly commanded the coachman to stop  ah mr smith i am glad to see you looking so well i could not help stopping a moment to congratulate you and mrs smith upon the happiness you must enjoy joseph you may drive on  and the carriage rolled away towards st launces  out rushed mrs smith from behind a laurelbush where she had stood pondering  just going to touch my hat to her said john just for all the world as i would have to poor lady luxellian years ago  lord who is she  the publichouse womanwhats her name mrsmrsat the falcon  publichouse woman the clumsiness of the smith family you might say the landlady of the falcon hotel since we are in for politeness the people are ridiculous enough but give them their due  the possibility is that mrs smith was getting mollified in spite of herself by these remarkably friendly phenomena among the people of st launces and in justice to them it was quite desirable that she should do so the interest which the unpractised ones of this town expressed so grotesquely was genuine of its kind and equal in intrinsic worth to the more polished smiles of larger communities  by this time mr and mrs trewen were returning from the garden  ill ask em flat whispered john to his wife ill say we be in a fogyoull excuse my asking a question mr and mrs trewen how is it you all be so friendly today hey twould sound right and sensible wouldnt it  not a word good mercy when will the man have manners  it must be a proud moment for you i am sure mr and mrs smith to have a son so celebrated said the bankmanager advancing  ah tis stepheni knew it said mrs smith triumphantly to herself  we dont know particulars said john  not know  no  why tis all over town our worthy mayor alluded to it in a speech at the dinner last night of the everymanhisownmaker club  and what about stephen urged mrs smith  why your son has been feted by deputygovernors and parsee princes and nobodyknowswho in india is hand in glove with nabobs and is to design a large palace and cathedral and hospitals colleges halls and fortifications by the general consent of the ruling powers christian and pagan alike  twas sure to come to the boy said mr smith unassumingly  tis in yesterdays st launces chronicle and our worthy mayor in the chair introduced the subject into his speech last night in a masterly manner  twas very good of the worthy mayor in the chair im sure said stephens mother i hope the boy will have the sense to keep what hes got but as for men they are a simple sex some woman will hook him  well mr and mrs smith the evening closes in and we must be going and remember this that every saturday when you come in to market you are to make our house as your own there will be always a teacup and saucer for you as you know there has been for months though you may have forgotten it im a plainspeaking woman and what i say i mean  when the visitors were gone and the sun had set and the moons rays were just beginning to assert themselves upon the walls of the dwelling john smith and his wife sat dawn to the newspaper they had hastily procured from the town and when the reading was done they considered how best to meet the new social requirements settling upon them which mrs smith considered could be done by new furniture and house enlargement alone  and john mind one thing she said in conclusion in writing to stephen never by any means mention the name of elfride swancourt again weve left the place and know no more about her except by hearsay he seems to be getting free of her and glad am i for it it was a cloudy hour for him when he first set eyes upon the girl that familys been no good to him first or last so let them keep their blood to themselves if they want to he thinks of her i know but not so hopelessly so dont try to know anything about her and we cant answer his questions she may die out of his mind then  that shall be it said john     chapter xxxvii       after many days   knight roamed south under colour of studying continental antiquities  he paced the lofty aisles of amiens loitered by ardennes abbey climbed into the strange towers of laon analyzed noyon and rheims then he went to chartres and examined its scaly spires and quaint carving then he idled about coutances he rowed beneath the base of mont st michel and caught the varied skyline of the crumbling edifices encrusting it st ouens rouen knew him for days so did vezelay sens and many a hallowed monument besides abandoning the inspection of early french art with the same purposeless haste as he had shown in undertaking it he went further and lingered about ferrara padua and pisa satiated with mediaevalism he tried the roman forum next he observed moonlight and starlight effects by the bay of naples he turned to austria became enervated and depressed on hungarian and bohemian plains and was refreshed again by breezes on the declivities of the carpathians  then he found himself in greece he visited the plain of marathon and strove to imagine the persian defeat to mars hill to picture st paul addressing the ancient athenians to thermopylae and salamis to run through the facts and traditions of the second invasionthe result of his endeavours being more or less chaotic knight grew as weary of these places as of all others then he felt the shock of an earthquake in the ionian islands and went to venice here he shot in gondolas up and down the winding thoroughfare of the grand canal and loitered on calle and piazza at night when the lagunes were undisturbed by a ripple and no sound was to be heard but the stroke of the midnight clock afterwards he remained for weeks in the museums galleries and libraries of vienna berlin and paris and thence came home  time thus rolls us on to a february afternoon divided by fifteen months from the parting of elfride and her lover in the brown stubble field towards the sea  two men obviously not londoners and with a touch of foreignness in their look met by accident on one of the gravel walks leading across hyde park the younger more given to looking about him than his fellow saw and noticed the approach of his senior some time before the latter had raised his eyes from the ground upon which they were bent in an abstracted gaze that seemed habitual with him  mr knightindeed it is exclaimed the younger man  ah stephen smith said knight  simultaneous operations might now have been observed progressing in both the result being that an expression less frank and impulsive than the first took possession of their features it was manifest that the next words uttered were a superficial covering to constraint on both sides  have you been in england long said knight  only two days said smith  india ever since  nearly ever since  they were making a fuss about you at st launces last year i fancy i saw something of the sort in the papers  yes i believe something was said about me  i must congratulate you on your achievements  thanks but they are nothing very extraordinary a natural professional progress where there was no opposition  there followed that want of words which will always assert itself between nominal friends who find they have ceased to be real ones and have not yet sunk to the level of mere acquaintance each looked up and down the park knight may possibly have borne in mind during the intervening months stephens manner towards him the last time they had met and may have encouraged his former interest in stephens welfare to die out of him as misplaced stephen certainly was full of the feelings begotten by the belief that knight had taken away the woman he loved so well  stephen smith then asked a question adopting a certain recklessness of manner and tone to hide if possible the fact that the subject was a much greater one to him than his friend had ever supposed  are you married  i am not  knight spoke in an indescribable tone of bitterness that was almost moroseness  and i never shall be he added decisively are you  no said stephen sadly and quietly like a man in a sickroom totally ignorant whether or not knight knew of his own previous claims upon elfride he yet resolved to hazard a few more words upon the topic which had an aching fascination for him even now  then your engagement to miss swancourt came to nothing he said you remember i met you with her once  stephens voice gave way a little here in defiance of his firmest will to the contrary indian affairs had not yet lowered those emotions down to the point of control  it was broken off came quickly from knight engagements to marry often end like thatfor better or for worse  yes so they do and what have you been doing lately  doing nothing  where have you been  i can hardly tell you in the main going about europe and it may perhaps interest you to know that i have been attempting the serious study of continental art of the middle ages my notes on each example i visited are at your service they are of no use to me  i shall be glad with themoh travelling far and near  not far said knight with moody carelessness you know i daresay that sheep occasionally become giddyhydatids in the head tis called in which their brains become eaten up and the animal exhibits the strange peculiarity of walking round and round in a circle continually i have travelled just in the same wayround and round like a giddy ram  the reckless bitter and rambling style in which knight talked as if rather to vent his images than to convey any ideas to stephen struck the young man painfully his former friends days had become cankered in some way knight was a changed man he himself had changed much but not as knight had changed  yesterday i came home continued knight without having to the best of my belief imbibed halfadozen ideas worth retaining  you outhamlet hamlet in morbidness of mood said stephen with regretful frankness  knight made no reply  do you know stephen continued i could almost have sworn that you would be married before this time from what i saw  knights face grew harder could you he said  stephen was powerless to forsake the depressing luring subject  yes and i simply wonder at it  whom did you expect me to marry  her i saw you with  thank you for that wonder  did she jilt you  smith now one word to you knight returned steadily dont you ever question me on that subject i have a reason for making this request mind and if you do question me you will not get an answer  oh i dont for a moment wish to ask what is unpleasant to younot i i had a momentary feeling that i should like to explain something on my side and hear a similar explanation on yours but let it go let it go by all means  what would you explain  i lost the woman i was going to marry you have not married as you intended we might have compared notes  i have never asked you a word about your case  i know that  and the inference is obvious  quite so  the truth is stephen i have doggedly resolved never to allude to the matterfor which i have a very good reason  doubtless as good a reason as you had for not marrying her  you talk insidiously i had a good onea miserably good one  smiths anxiety urged him to venture one more question  did she not love you enough he drew his breath in a slow and attenuated stream as he waited in timorous hope for the answer  stephen you rather strain ordinary courtesy in pressing questions of that kind after what i have said i cannot understand you at all i must go on now  why good god exclaimed stephen passionately you talk as if you hadnt at all taken her away from anybody who had better claims to her than you  what do you mean by that said knight with a puzzled air what have you heard  nothing i too must go on goodday  if you will go said knight reluctantly now you must i suppose i am sure i cannot understand why you behave so  nor i why you do i have always been grateful to you and as far as i am concerned we need never have become so estranged as we have  and have i ever been anything but welldisposed towards you stephen surely you know that i have not the system of reserve began with you you know that  no no you altogether mistake our position you were always from the first reserved to me though i was confidential to you that was i suppose the natural issue of our differing positions in life and when i the pupil became reserved like you the master you did not like it however i was going to ask you to come round and see me  where are you staying  at the grosvenor hotel pimlico  so am i  thats convenient not to say odd well i am detained in london for a day or two then i am going down to see my father and mother who live at st launces now will you see me this evening  i may but i will not promise i was wishing to be alone for an hour or two but i shall know where to find you at any rate goodbye     chapter xxxviii       jealousy is cruel as the grave   stephen pondered not a little on this meeting with his old friend and oncebeloved exemplar he was grieved for amid all the distractions of his latter years a still small voice of fidelity to knight had lingered on in him perhaps this staunchness was because knight ever treated him as a mere discipleeven to snubbing him sometimes and had at last though unwittingly inflicted upon him the greatest snub of all that of taking away his sweetheart the emotional side of his constitution was built rather after a feminine than a male model and that tremendous wound from knights hand may have tended to keep alive a warmth which solicitousness would have extinguished altogether  knight on his part was vexed after they had parted that he had not taken stephen in hand a little after the old manner those words which smith had let fall concerning somebody having a prior claim to elfride would if uttered when the man was younger have provoked such a query as come tell me all about it my lad from knight and stephen would straightway have delivered himself of all he knew on the subject  stephen the ingenuous boy though now obliterated externally by stephen the contriving man returned to knights memory vividly that afternoon he was at present but a sojourner in london and after attending to the two or three matters of business which remained to be done that day he walked abstractedly into the gloomy corridors of the british museum for the halfhour previous to their closing that meeting with smith had reunited the present with the past closing up the chasm of his absence from england as if it had never existed until the final circumstances of his previous time of residence in london formed but a yesterday to the circumstances now the conflict that then had raged in him concerning elfride swancourt revived strengthened by its sleep indeed in those many months of absence though quelling the intention to make her his wife he had never forgotten that she was the type of woman adapted to his nature and instead of trying to obliterate thoughts of her altogether he had grown to regard them as an infirmity it was necessary to tolerate  knight returned to his hotel much earlier in the evening than he would have done in the ordinary course of things he did not care to think whether this arose from a friendly wish to close the gap that had slowly been widening between himself and his earliest acquaintance or from a hankering desire to hear the meaning of the dark oracles stephen had hastily pronounced betokening that he knew something more of elfride than knight had supposed  he made a hasty dinner inquired for smith and soon was ushered into the young mans presence whom he found sitting in front of a comfortable fire beside a table spread with a few scientific periodicals and art reviews  i have come to you after all said knight my manner was odd this morning and it seemed desirable to call but that you had too much sense to notice stephen i know put it down to my wanderings in france and italy  dont say another word but sit down i am only too glad to see you again  stephen would hardly have cared to tell knight just then that the minute before knight was announced he had been reading over some old letters of elfrides they were not many and until tonight had been sealed up and stowed away in a corner of his leather trunk with a few other mementoes and relics which had accompanied him in his travels the familiar sights and sounds of london the meeting with his friend had with him also revived that sense of abiding continuity with regard to elfride and love which his absence at the other side of the world had to some extent suspended though never ruptured he at first intended only to look over these letters on the outside then he read one then another until the whole was thus reused as a stimulus to sad memories he folded them away again placed them in his pocket and instead of going on with an examination into the state of the artistic world had remained musing on the strange circumstance that he had returned to find knight not the husband of elfride after all  the possibility of any given gratification begets a cumulative sense of its necessity stephen gave the rein to his imagination and felt more intensely than he had felt for many months that without elfride his life would never be any great pleasure to himself or honour to his maker  they sat by the fire chatting on external and random subjects neither caring to be the first to approach the matter each most longed to discuss on the table with the periodicals lay two or three pocketbooks one of them being open knight seeing from the exposed page that the contents were sketches only began turning the leaves over carelessly with his finger when some time later stephen was out of the room knight proceeded to pass the interval by looking at the sketches more carefully  the first crude ideas pertaining to dwellings of all kinds were roughly outlined on the different pages antiquities had been copied fragments of indian columns colossal statues and outlandish ornament from the temples of elephanta and kenneri were carelessly intruded upon by outlines of modern doors windows roofs cookingstoves and household furniture everything in short which comes within the range of a practising architects experience who travels with his eyes open among these occasionally appeared rough delineations of mediaeval subjects for carving or illuminationheads of virgins saints and prophets  stephen was not professedly a freehand draughtsman but he drew the human figure with correctness and skill in its numerous repetitions on the sides and edges of the leaves knight began to notice a peculiarity all the feminine saints had one type of feature there were large nimbi and small nimbi about their drooping heads but the face was always the same that profilehow well knight knew that profile  had there been but one specimen of the familiar countenance he might have passed over the resemblance as accidental but a repetition meant more knight thought anew of smiths hasty words earlier in the day and looked at the sketches again and again  on the young mans entry knight said with palpable agitation  stephen who are those intended for  stephen looked over the book with utter unconcern saints and angels done in my leisure moments they were intended as designs for the stained glass of an english church  but whom do you idealize by that type of woman you always adopt for the virgin  nobody  and then a thought raced along stephens mind and he looked up at his friend  the truth is stephens introduction of elfrides lineaments had been so unconscious that he had not at first understood his companions drift the hand like the tongue easily acquires the trick of repetition by rote without calling in the mind to assist at all and this had been the case here young men who cannot write verses about their loves generally take to portraying them and in the early days of his attachment smith had never been weary of outlining elfride the layfigure of stephens sketches now initiated an adjustment of many things knight had recognized her the opportunity of comparing notes had come unsought  elfride swancourt to whom i was engaged he said quietly  stephen  i know what you mean by speaking like that  was it elfride you the man stephen  yes and you are thinking why did i conceal the fact from you that time at endelstow are you not  yes and moremore  i did it for the best blame me if you will i did it for the best and now say how could i be with you afterwards as i had been before  i dont know at all i cant say  knight remained fixed in thought and once he murmured  i had a suspicion this afternoon that there might be some such meaning in your words about my taking her away but i dismissed it how came you to know her he presently asked in almost a peremptory tone  i went down about the church years ago now  when you were with hewby of course of course well i cant understand it his tones rose i dont know what to say your hoodwinking me like this for so long  i dont see that i have hoodwinked you at all  yes yes but  knight arose from his seat and began pacing up and down the room his face was markedly pale and his voice perturbed as he said  you did not act as i should have acted towards you under those circumstances i feel it deeply and i tell you plainly i shall never forget it  what  your behaviour at that meeting in the family vault when i told you we were going to be married deception dishonesty everywhere all the worlds of a piece  stephen did not much like this misconstruction of his motives even though it was but the hasty conclusion of a friend disturbed by emotion  i could do no otherwise than i did with due regard to her he said stiffly  indeed said knight in the bitterest tone of reproach nor could you with due regard to her have married her i suppose i have hopedlongedthat he who turns out to be you would ultimately have done that  i am much obliged to you for that hope but you talk very mysteriously i think i had about the best reason anybody could have had for not doing that  oh what reason was it  that i could not  you ought to have made an opportunity you ought to do so now in bare justice to her stephen cried knight carried beyond himself that you know very well and it hurts and wounds me more than you dream to find you never have tried to make any reparation to a woman of that kindso trusting so apt to be run away with by her feelingspoor little fool so much the worse for her  why you talk like a madman you took her away from me did you not  picking up what another throws down can scarcely be called taking away however we shall not agree too well upon that subject so we had better part  but i am quite certain you misapprehend something most grievously said stephen shaken to the bottom of his heart what have i done tell me i have lost elfride but is that such a sin  was it her doing or yours  was what  that you parted  i will tell you honestly it was hers entirely entirely  what was her reason  i can hardly say but ill tell the story without reserve  stephen until today had unhesitatingly held that she grew tired of him and turned to knight but he did not like to advance the statement now or even to think the thought to fancy otherwise accorded better with the hope to which knights estrangement had given birth that love for his friend was not the direct cause but a result of her suspension of love for himself  such a matter must not be allowed to breed discord between us knight returned relapsing into a manner which concealed all his true feeling as if confidence now was intolerable i do see that your reticence towards me in the vault may have been dictated by prudential considerations he concluded artificially it was a strange thing altogether but not of much importance i suppose at this distance of time and it does not concern me now though i dont mind hearing your story  these words from knight uttered with such an air of renunciation and apparent indifference prompted smith to speak onperhaps with a little complacencyof his old secret engagement to elfride he told the details of its origin and the peremptory words and actions of her father to extinguish their love  knight persevered in the tone and manner of a disinterested outsider it had become more than ever imperative to screen his emotions from stephens eye the young man would otherwise be less frank and their meeting would be again embittered what was the use of untoward candour  stephen had now arrived at the point in his ingenuous narrative where he left the vicarage because of her fathers manner knights interest increased their love seemed so innocent and childlike thus far  it is a nice point in casuistry he observed to decide whether you were culpable or not in not telling swancourt that your friends were parishioners of his it was only human nature to hold your tongue under the circumstances well what was the result of your dismissal by him  that we agreed to be secretly faithful and to insure this we thought we would marry  knights suspense and agitation rose higher when stephen entered upon this phase of the subject  do you mind telling on he said steadying his manner of speech  oh not at all  then stephen gave in full the particulars of the meeting with elfride at the railway station the necessity they were under of going to london unless the ceremony were to be postponed the long journey of the afternoon and evening her timidity and revulsion of feeling its culmination on reaching london the crossing over to the downplatform and their immediate departure again solely in obedience to her wish the journey all night their anxious watching for the dawn their arrival at st launces at lastwere detailed and he told how a village woman named jethway was the only person who recognized them either going or coming and how dreadfully this terrified elfride he told how he waited in the fields whilst this then reproachful sweetheart went for her pony and how the last kiss he ever gave her was given a mile out of the town on the way to endelstow  these things stephen related with a will he believed that in doing so he established word by word the reasonableness of his claim to elfride  curse her curse that womanthat miserable letter that parted us o god  knight began pacing the room again and uttered this at further end  what did you say said stephen turning round  say did i say anything oh i was merely thinking about your story and the oddness of my having a fancy for the same woman afterwards and that now ii have forgotten her almost and neither of us care about her except just as a friend you know eh  knight still continued at the further end of the room somewhat in shadow  exactly said stephen inwardly exultant for he was really deceived by knights offhand manner  yet he was deceived less by the completeness of knights disguise than by the persuasive power which lay in the fact that knight had never before deceived him in anything so this supposition that his companion had ceased to love elfride was an enormous lightening of the weight which had turned the scale against him  admitting that elfride could love another man after you said the elder under the same varnish of careless criticism she was none the worse for that experience  the worse of course she was none the worse  did you ever think it a wild and thoughtless thing for her to do  indeed i never did said stephen i persuaded her she saw no harm in it until she decided to return nor did i nor was there except to the extent of indiscretion  directly she thought it was wrong she would go no further  that was it i had just begun to think it wrong too  such a childish escapade might have been misrepresented by any evildisposed person might it not  it might but i never heard that it was nobody who really knew all the circumstances would have done otherwise than smile if all the world had known it elfride would still have remained the only one who thought her action a sin poor child she always persisted in thinking so and was frightened more than enough  stephen do you love her now  well i like her i always shall you know he said evasively and with all the strategy love suggested but i have not seen her for so long that i can hardly be expected to love her do you love her still  how shall i answer without being ashamed what fickle beings we men are stephen men may love strongest for a while but women love longest i used to love herin my way you know  yes i understand ah and i used to love her in my way in fact i loved her a good deal at one time but travel has a tendency to obliterate early fancies  it hasit has truly  perhaps the most extraordinary feature in this conversation was the circumstance that though each interlocutor had at first his suspicions of the others abiding passion awakened by several little acts neither would allow himself to see that his friend might now be speaking deceitfully as well as he  stephen resumed knight now that matters are smooth between us i think i must leave you you wont mind my hurrying off to my quarters  youll stay to some sort of supper surely didnt you come to dinner  you must really excuse me this once  then youll drop in to breakfast tomorrow  i shall be rather pressed for time  an early breakfast which shall interfere with nothing  ill come said knight with as much readiness as it was possible to graft upon a huge stock of reluctance yes early eight oclock say as we are under the same roof  any time you like eight it shall be  and knight left him to wear a mask to dissemble his feelings as he had in their late miserable conversation was such torture that he could support it no longer it was the first time in knights life that he had ever been so entirely the player of a part and the man he had thus deceived was stephen who had docilely looked up to him from youth as a superior of unblemished integrity  he went to bed and allowed the fever of his excitement to rage uncontrolled stephenit was only he who was the rivalonly stephen there was an anticlimax of absurdity which knight wretched and consciencestricken as he was could not help recognizing stephen was but a boy to him where the great grief lay was in perceiving that the very innocence of elfride in reading her little fault as one so grave was what had fatally misled him had elfride with any degree of coolness asserted that she had done no harm the poisonous breath of the dead mrs jethway would have been inoperative why did he not make his little docile girl tell more if on that subject he had only exercised the imperativeness customary with him on others all might have been revealed it smote his heart like a switch when he remembered how gently she had borne his scourging speeches never answering him with a single reproach only assuring him of her unbounded love  knight blessed elfride for her sweetness and forgot her fault he pictured with a vivid fancy those fair summer scenes with her he again saw her as at their first meeting timid at speaking yet in her eagerness to be explanatory borne forward almost against her will how she would wait for him in green places without showing any of the ordinary womanly affectations of indifference how proud she was to be seen walking with him bearing legibly in her eyes the thought that he was the greatest genius in the world  he formed a resolution and after that could make pretence of slumber no longer rising and dressing himself he sat down and waited for day  that night stephen was restless too not because of the unwontedness of a return to english scenery not because he was about to meet his parents and settle down for awhile to english cottage life he was indulging in dreams and for the nonce the warehouses of bombay and the plains and forts of poonah were but a shadows shadow his dream was based on this one atom of fact elfride and knight had become separated and their engagement was as if it had never been their rupture must have occurred soon after stephens discovery of the fact of their union and stephen went on to think what so probable as that a return of her errant affection to himself was the cause  stephens opinions in this matter were those of a lover and not the balanced judgment of an unbiassed spectator his naturally sanguine spirit built hope upon hope till scarcely a doubt remained in his mind that her lingering tenderness for him had in some way been perceived by knight and had provoked their parting  to go and see elfride was the suggestion of impulses it was impossible to withstand at any rate to run down from st launces to castle poterel a distance of less than twenty miles and glide like a ghost about their old haunts making stealthy inquiries about her would be a fascinating way of passing the first spare hours after reaching home on the day after the morrow  he was now a richer man than heretofore standing on his own bottom and the definite position in which he had rooted himself nullified old local distinctions he had become illustrious even sanguine clarus judging from the tone of the worthy mayor of st launces     chapter xxxix       each to the loved ones side   the friends and rivals breakfasted together the next morning not a word was said on either side upon the matter discussed the previous evening so glibly and so hollowly stephen was absorbed the greater part of the time in wishing he were not forced to stay in town yet another day  i dont intend to leave for st launces till tomorrow as you know he said to knight at the end of the meal what are you going to do with yourself today  i have an engagement just before ten said knight deliberately and after that time i must call upon two or three people  ill look for you this evening said stephen  yes do you may as well come and dine with me that is if we can meet i may not sleep in london tonight in fact i am absolutely unsettled as to my movements yet however the first thing i am going to do is to get my baggage shifted from this place to bedes inn goodbye for the present ill write you know if i cant meet you  it now wanted a quarter to nine oclock when knight was gone stephen felt yet more impatient of the circumstance that another day would have to drag itself away wearily before he could set out for that spot of earth whereon a soft thought of him might perhaps be nourished still on a sudden he admitted to his mind the possibility that the engagement he was waiting in town to keep might be postponed without much harm  it was no sooner perceived than attempted looking at his watch he found it wanted forty minutes to the departure of the ten oclock train from paddington which left him a surplus quarter of an hour before it would be necessary to start for the station  scribbling a hasty note or twoone putting off the business meeting another to knight apologizing for not being able to see him in the eveningpaying his bill and leaving his heavier luggage to follow him by goodstrain he jumped into a cab and rattled off to the great western station  shortly afterwards he took his seat in the railway carriage  the guard paused on his whistle to let into the next compartment to smiths a man of whom stephen had caught but a hasty glimpse as he ran across the platform at the last moment  smith sank back into the carriage stilled by perplexity the man was like knightastonishingly like him was it possible it could be he to have got there he must have driven like the wind to bedes inn and hardly have alighted before starting again no it could not be he that was not his way of doing things  during the early part of the journey stephen smiths thoughts busied themselves till his brain seemed swollen one subject was concerning his own approaching actions he was a day earlier than his letter to his parents had stated and his arrangement with them had been that they should meet him at plymouth a plan which pleased the worthy couple beyond expression once before the same engagement had been made which he had then quashed by antedating his arrival this time he would go right on to castle boterel ramble in that wellknown neighbourhood during the evening and next morning making inquiries and return to plymouth to meet them as arrangeda contrivance which would leave their cherished project undisturbed relieving his own impatience also  at chippenham there was a little waiting and some loosening and attaching of carriages  stephen looked out at the same moment another mans head emerged from the adjoining window each looked in the others face  knight and stephen confronted one another  you here said the younger man  yes it seems that you are too said knight strangely  yes  the selfishness of love and the cruelty of jealousy were fairly exemplified at this moment each of the two men looked at his friend as he had never looked at him before each was troubled at the others presence  i thought you said you were not coming till tomorrow remarked knight  i did it was an afterthought to come today this journey was your engagement then  no it was not this is an afterthought of mine too i left a note to explain it and account for my not being able to meet you this evening as we arranged  so did i for you  you dont look well you did not this morning  i have a headache you are paler today than you were  i too have been suffering from headache we have to wait here a few minutes i think  they walked up and down the platform each one more and more embarrassingly concerned with the awkwardness of his friends presence they reached the end of the footway and paused in sheer absentmindedness stephens vacant eyes rested upon the operations of some porters who were shifting a dark and curiouslooking van from the rear of the train to shunt another which was between it and the fore part of the train this operation having been concluded the two friends returned to the side of their carriage  will you come in here said knight not very warmly  i have my rug and portmanteau and umbrella with me it is rather bothering to move now said stephen reluctantly why not you come here  i have my traps too it is hardly worth while to shift them for i shall see you again you know  oh yes  and each got into his own place just at starting a man on the platform held up his hands and stopped the train  stephen looked out to see what was the matter  one of the officials was exclaiming to another that carriage should have been attached again cant you see it is for the main line quick what fools there are in the world  what a confounded nuisance these stoppages are exclaimed knight impatiently looking out from his compartment what is it  that singular carriage we saw has been unfastened from our train by mistake it seems said stephen  he was watching the process of attaching it the van or carriage which he now recognized as having seen at paddington before they started was rich and solemn rather than gloomy in aspect it seemed to be quite new and of modern design and its impressive personality attracted the notice of others beside himself he beheld it gradually wheeled forward by two men on each side slower and more sadly it seemed to approach then a slight concussion and they were connected with it and off again  stephen sat all the afternoon pondering upon the reason of knights unexpected reappearance was he going as far as castle boterel if so he could only have one object in viewa visit to elfride and what an idea it seemed  at plymouth smith partook of a little refreshment and then went round to the side from which the train started for camelton the new station near castle boterel and endelstow  knight was already there  stephen walked up and stood beside him without speaking two men at this moment crept out from among the wheels of the waiting train  the carriage is light enough said one in a grim tone light as vanity full of nothing  nothing in size but a good deal in signification said the other a man of brighter mind and manners  smith then perceived that to their train was attached that same carriage of grand and dark aspect which had haunted them all the way from london  you are going on i suppose said knight turning to stephen after idly looking at the same object  yes  we may as well travel together for the remaining distance may we not  certainly we will and they both entered the same door  evening drew on apace it chanced to be the eve of st valentinesthat bishop of blessed memory to youthful loversand the sun shone low under the rim of a thick hard cloud decorating the eminences of the landscape with crowns of orange fire as the train changed its direction on a curve the same rays stretched in through the window and coaxed open knights halfclosed eyes  you will get out at st launces i suppose he murmured  no said stephen i am not expected till tomorrow knight was silent  and youare you going to endelstow said the younger man pointedly  since you ask i can do no less than say i am stephen continued knight slowly and with more resolution of manner than he had shown all the day i am going to endelstow to see if elfride swancourt is still free and if so to ask her to be my wife  so am i said stephen smith  i think youll lose your labour knight returned with decision  naturally you do there was a strong accent of bitterness in stephens voice you might have said hope instead of think he added  i might have done no such thing i gave you my opinion elfride swancourt may have loved you once no doubt but it was when she was so young that she hardly knew her own mind  thank you said stephen laconically she knew her mind as well as i did we are the same age if you hadnt interfered  dont say thatdont say it stephen how can you make out that i interfered be just please  well said his friend she was mine before she was yoursyou know that and it seemed a hard thing to find you had got her and that if it had not been for you all might have turned out well for me stephen spoke with a swelling heart and looked out of the window to hide the emotion that would make itself visible upon his face  it is absurd said knight in a kinder tone for you to look at the matter in that light what i tell you is for your good you naturally do not like to realize the truththat her liking for you was only a girls first fancy which has no root ever  it is not true said stephen passionately it was you put me out and now youll be pushing in again between us and depriving me of my chance again my right thats what it is how ungenerous of you to come anew and try to take her away from me when you had won her i did not interfere and you might i think mr knight do by me as i did by you  dont mr me you are as well in the world as i am now  first love is deepest and that was mine  who told you that said knight superciliously  i had her first love and it was through me that you and she parted i can guess that well enough  it was and if i were to explain to you in what way that operated in parting us i should convince you that you do quite wrong in intruding upon herthat as i said at first your labour will be lost i dont choose to explain because the particulars are painful but if you wont listen to me go on for heavens sake i dont care what you do my boy  you have no right to domineer over me as you do just because when i was a lad i was accustomed to look up to you as a master and you helped me a little for which i was grateful to you and have loved you you assume too much now and step in before me it is cruelit is unjustof you to injure me so  knight showed himself keenly hurt at this stephen those words are untrue and unworthy of any man and they are unworthy of you you know you wrong me if you have ever profited by any instruction of mine i am only too glad to know it you know it was given ungrudgingly and that i have never once looked upon it as making you in any way a debtor to me  stephens naturally gentle nature was touched and it was in a troubled voice that he said yes yes i am unjust in thati own it  this is st launces station i think are you going to get out  knights manner of returning to the matter in hand drew stephen again into himself no i told you i was going to endelstow he resolutely replied  knights features became impassive and he said no more the train continued rattling on and stephen leant back in his corner and closed his eyes the yellows of evening had turned to browns the dusky shades thickened and a flying cloud of dust occasionally stroked the windowborne upon a chilling breeze which blew from the northeast the previously gilded but now dreary hills began to lose their daylight aspects of rotundity and to become black discs vandyked against the sky all nature wearing the cloak that six oclock casts over the landscape at this time of the year  stephen started up in bewilderment after a long stillness and it was some time before he recollected himself  well how real how real he exclaimed brushing his hand across his eyes  what is said knight  that dream i fell asleep for a few minutes and have had a dreamthe most vivid i ever remember  he wearily looked out into the gloom they were now drawing near to camelton the lighting of the lamps was perceptible through the veil of eveningeach flame starting into existence at intervals and blinking weakly against the gusts of wind  what did you dream said knight moodily  oh nothing to be told twas a sort of incubus there is never anything in dreams  i hardly supposed there was  i know that however what i so vividly dreamt was this since you would like to hear it was the brightest of bright mornings at east endelstow church and you and i stood by the font far away in the chancel lord luxellian was standing alone cold and impassive and utterly unlike his usual self but i knew it was he inside the altar rail stood a strange clergyman with his book open he looked up and said to lord luxellian wheres the bride lord luxellian said theres no bride at that moment somebody came in at the door and i knew her to be lady luxellian who died he turned and said to her i thought you were in the vault below us but that could have only been a dream of mine come on then she came on and in brushing between us she chilled me so with cold that i exclaimed the life is gone out of me and in the way of dreams i awoke but here we are at camelton  they were slowly entering the station  what are you going to do said knight do you really intend to call on the swancourts  by no means i am going to make inquiries first i shall stay at the luxellian arms tonight you will go right on to endelstow i suppose at once  i can hardly do that at this time of the day perhaps you are not aware that the familyher father at any rateis at variance with me as much as with you  i didnt know it  and that i cannot rush into the house as an old friend any more than you can certainly i have the privileges of a distant relationship whatever they may be  knight let down the window and looked ahead there are a great many people at the station he said they seem all to be on the lookout for us  when the train stopped the halfestranged friends could perceive by the lamplight that the assemblage of idlers enclosed as a kernel a group of men in black cloaks a side gate in the platform railing was open and outside this stood a dark vehicle which they could not at first characterize then knight saw on its upper part forms against the sky like cedars by night and knew the vehicle to be a hearse few people were at the carriage doors to meet the passengersthe majority had congregated at this upper end knight and stephen alighted and turned for a moment in the same direction  the sombre van which had accompanied them all day from london now began to reveal that their destination was also its own it had been drawn up exactly opposite the open gate the bystanders all fell back forming a clear lane from the gateway to the van and the men in cloaks entered the latter conveyance  they are labourers i fancy said stephen ah it is strange but i recognize three of them as endelstow men rather remarkable this  presently they began to come out two and two and under the rays of the lamp they were seen to bear between them a lightcoloured coffin of satinwood brightly polished and without a nail the eight men took the burden upon their shoulders and slowly crossed with it over to the gate  knight and stephen went outside and came close to the procession as it moved off a carriage belonging to the cortege turned round close to a lamp the rays shone in upon the face of the vicar of endelstow mr swancourtlooking many years older than when they had last seen him knight and stephen involuntarily drew back  knight spoke to a bystander what has mr swancourt to do with that funeral  he is the ladys father said the bystander  what ladys father said knight in a voice so hollow that the man stared at him  the father of the lady in the coffin she died in london you know and has been brought here by this train she is to be taken home tonight and buried tomorrow  knight stood staring blindly at where the hearse had been as if he saw it or some one there then he turned and beheld the lithe form of stephen bowed down like that of an old man he took his young friends arm and led him away from the light     chapter xl       welcome proud lady   half an hour has passed two miserable men are wandering in the darkness up the miles of road from camelton to endelstow  has she broken her heart said henry knight can it be that i have killed her i was bitter with her stephen and she has died and may god have no mercy upon me  how can you have killed her more than i  why i went away from herstole away almostand didnt tell her i should not come again and at that last meeting i did not kiss her once but let her miserably go i have been a foola fool i wish the most abject confession of it before crowds of my countrymen could in any way make amends to my darling for the intense cruelty i have shown her  your darling said stephen with a sort of laugh any man can say that i suppose any man can i know this she was my darling before she was yours and after too if anybody has a right to call her his own it is i  you talk like a man in the dark which is what you are did she ever do anything for you risk her name for instance for you  yes she did said stephen emphatically  not entirely did she ever live for youprove she could not live without youlaugh and weep for you  yes  never did she ever risk her life for youno my darling did for me  then it was in kindness only when did she risk her life for you  to save mine on the cliff yonder the poor child was with me looking at the approach of the puffin steamboat and i slipped down we both had a narrow escape i wish we had died there  ah but wait stephen pleaded with wet eyes she went on that cliff to see me arrive home she had promised it she told me she would months before and would she have gone there if she had not cared for me at all  you have an idea that elfride died for you no doubt said knight with a mournful sarcasm too nerveless to support itself  never mind if we find thatthat she died yours ill say no more ever  and if we find she died yours ill say no more  very wellso it shall be  the dark clouds into which the sun had sunk had begun to drop rain in an increasing volume  can we wait somewhere here till this shower is over said stephen desultorily  as you will but it is not worth while well hear the particulars and return dont let people know who we are i am not much now  they had reached a point at which the road branched into twojust outside the west village one fork of the diverging routes passing into the latter place the other stretching on to east endelstow having come some of the distance by the footpath they now found that the hearse was only a little in advance of them  i fancy it has turned off to east endelstow can you see  i cannot you must be mistaken  knight and stephen entered the village a bar of fiery light lay across the road proceeding from the halfopen door of a smithy in which bellows were heard blowing and a hammer ringing the rain had increased and they mechanically turned for shelter towards the warm and cosy scene  close at their heels came another man without overcoat or umbrella and with a parcel under his arm  a wet evening he said to the two friends and passed by them they stood in the outer penthouse but the man went in to the fire  the smith ceased his blowing and began talking to the man who had entered  i have walked all the way from camelton said the latter was obliged to come tonight you know  he held the parcel which was a flat one towards the firelight to learn if the rain had penetrated it resting it edgewise on the forge he supported it perpendicularly with one hand wiping his face with the handkerchief he held in the other  i suppose you know what ive got here he observed to the smith  no i dont said the smith pausing again on his bellows  as the rains not over ill show you said the bearer  he laid the thin and broad package which had acute angles in different directions flat upon the anvil and the smith blew up the fire to give him more light first after untying the package a sheet of brown paper was removed this was laid flat then he unfolded a piece of baize this also he spread flat on the paper the third covering was a wrapper of tissue paper which was spread out in its turn the enclosure was revealed and he held it up for the smiths inspection  ohi see said the smith kindling with a chastened interest and drawing close poor young ladyah terrible melancholy thingso soon too  knight and stephen turned their heads and looked  and whats that continued the smith  thats the coronetbeautifully finished isnt it ah that cost some money  tis as fine a bit of metal work as ever i seethat tis  it came from the same people as the coffin you know but was not ready soon enough to be sent round to the house in london yesterday ive got to fix it on this very night  the carefullypacked articles were a coffinplate and coronet  knight and stephen came forward the undertakers man on seeing them look for the inscription civilly turned it round towards them and each read almost at one moment by the ruddy light of the coals              e l f r i d e            wife of spenser hugo luxellian            fifteenth baron luxellian            died february 10 18   they read it and read it and read it againstephen and knightas if animated by one soul then stephen put his hand upon knights arm and they retired from the yellow glow further further till the chill darkness enclosed them round and the quiet sky asserted its presence overhead as a dim grey sheet of blank monotony  where shall we go said stephen  i dont know  a long silence ensuedelfride married said stephen then in a thin whisper as if he feared to let the assertion loose on the world  false whispered knight  and dead denied us both i hate falsei hate it  knight made no answer  nothing was heard by them now save the slow measurement of time by their beating pulses the soft touch of the dribbling rain upon their clothes and the low purr of the blacksmiths bellows hard by  shall we follow elfie any further stephen said  no let us leave her alone she is beyond our love and let her be beyond our reproach since we dont know half the reasons that made her do as she did stephen how can we say even now that she was not pure and true in heart knights voice had now become mild and gentle as a childs he went on can we call her ambitious no circumstance has as usual overpowered her purposesfragile and delicate as sheliable to be overthrown in a moment by the coarse elements of accident i know thats itdont you  it may beit must be let us go on  they began to bend their steps towards castle boterel whither they had sent their bags from camelton they wandered on in silence for many minutes stephen then paused and lightly put his hand within knights arm  i wonder how she came to die he said in a broken whisper shall we return and learn a little more  they turned back again and entering endelstow a second time came to a door which was standing open it was that of an inn called the welcome home and the house appeared to have been recently repaired and entirely modernized the name too was not that of the same landlord as formerly but martin cannisters  knight and smith entered the inn was quite silent and they followed the passage till they reached the kitchen where a huge fire was burning which roared up the chimney and sent over the floor ceiling and newlywhitened walls a glare so intense as to make the candle quite a secondary light a woman in a white apron and black gown was standing there alone behind a cleanlyscrubbed deal table stephen first and knight afterwards recognized her as unity who had been parlourmaid at the vicarage and young ladysmaid at the crags  unity said stephen softly dont you know me  she looked inquiringly a moment and her face cleared up  mr smithay that it is she said and thats mr knight i beg you to sit down perhaps you know that since i saw you last i have married martin cannister  how long have you been married  about five months we were married the same day that my dear miss elfie became lady luxellian tears appeared in unitys eyes and filled them and fell down her cheek in spite of efforts to the contrary  the pain of the two men in resolutely controlling themselves when thus exampled to admit relief of the same kind was distressing they both turned their backs and walked a few steps away  then unity said will you go into the parlour gentlemen  let us stay here with her knight whispered and turning said no we will sit here we want to rest and dry ourselves here for a time if you please  that evening the sorrowing friends sat with their hostess beside the large fire knight in the recess formed by the chimney breast where he was in shade and by showing a little confidence they won hers and she told them what they had stayed to hearthe latter history of poor elfride  one dayafter you mr knight left us for the last timeshe was missed from the crags and her father went after her and brought her home ill where she went to i never knewbut she was very unwell for weeks afterwards and she said to me that she didnt care what became of her and she wished she could die when she was better i said she would live to be married yet and she said then yes ill do anything for the benefit of my family so as to turn my useless life to some practical account well it began like this about lord luxellian courting her the first lady luxellian had died and he was in great trouble because the little girls were left motherless after a while they used to come and see her in their little black frocks for they liked her as well or better than their own motherthats true they used to call her little mamma these children made her a shade livelier but she was not the girl she had beeni could see thatand she grew thinner a good deal well my lord got to ask the swancourts oftener and oftener to dinnernobody else of his acquaintanceand at last the vicars family were backwards and forwards at all hours of the day well people say that the little girls asked their father to let miss elfride come and live with them and that he said perhaps he would if they were good children however the time went on and one day i said miss elfride you dont look so well as you used to and though nobody else seems to notice it i do she laughed a little and said i shall live to be married yet as you told me  shall you miss i am glad to hear that i said  whom do you think i am going to be married to she said again  mr knight i suppose said i  oh she cried and turned off so white and afore i could get to her she had sunk down like a heap of clothes and fainted away well then she came to herself after a time and said unity now well go on with our conversation  better not today miss i said  yes we will she said whom do you think i am going to be married to  i dont know i said this time  guess she said  tisnt my lord is it says i  yes tis says she in a sick wild way  but he dont come courting much i said  ah you dont know she said and told me twas going to be in october after that she freshened up a bitwhether twas with the thought of getting away from home or not i dont know for perhaps i may as well speak plainly and tell you that her home was no home to her now her father was bitter to her and harsh upon her and though mrs swancourt was well enough in her way twas a sort of cold politeness that was not worth much and the little thing had a worrying time of it altogether about a month before the wedding she and my lord and the two children used to ride about together upon horseback and a very pretty sight they were and if youll believe me i never saw him once with her unless the children were with her toowhich made the courting so strangelooking ay and my lord is so handsome you know so that at last i think she rather liked him and i have seen her smile and blush a bit at things he said he wanted her the more because the children did for everybody could see that she would be a most tender mother to them and friend and playmate too and my lord is not only handsome but a splendid courter and up to all the ways ot so he made her the beautifullest presents ah one i can minda lovely bracelet with diamonds and emeralds oh how red her face came when she saw it the old roses came back to her cheeks for a minute or two then i helped dress her the day we both were marriedit was the last service i did her poor child when she was ready i ran upstairs and slipped on my own wedding gown and away they went and away went martin and i and no sooner had my lord and my lady been married than the parson married us it was a very quiet pair of weddingshardly anybody knew it well hope will hold its own in a young heart if so be it can and my lady freshened up a bit for my lord was so handsome and kind  how came she to dieand away from home murmured knight  dont you see sir she fell off again afore theyd been married long and my lord took her abroad for change of scene they were coming home and had got as far as london when she was taken very ill and couldnt be moved and there she died  was he very fond of her  what my lord oh he was  very fond of her  very beyond everything not suddenly but by slow degrees twas her nature to win people more when they knew her well hed have died for her i believe poor my lord hes heartbroken now  the funeral is tomorrow  yes my husband is now at the vault with the masons opening the steps and cleaning down the walls   the next day two men walked up the familiar valley from castle boterel to east endelstow church and when the funeral was over and every one had left the lawnlike churchyard the pair went softly down the steps of the luxellian vault and under the lowgroined arches they had beheld once before lit up then as now in the new niche of the crypt lay a rather new coffin which had lost some of its lustre and a newer coffin still bright and untarnished in the slightest degree  beside the latter was the dark form of a man kneeling on the damp floor his body flung across the coffin his hands clasped and his whole frame seemingly given up in utter abandonment to grief he was still youngyounger perhaps than knightand even now showed how graceful was his figure and symmetrical his build he murmured a prayer half aloud and was quite unconscious that two others were standing within a few yards of him  knight and stephen had advanced to where they once stood beside elfride on the day all three had met there before she had herself gone down into silence like her ancestors and shut her bright blue eyes for ever not until then did they see the kneeling figure in the dim light knight instantly recognized the mourner as lord luxellian the bereaved husband of elfride  they felt themselves to be intruders knight pressed stephen back and they silently withdrew as they had entered  come away he said in a broken voice we have no right to be there another stands before usnearer to her than we  and side by side they both retraced their steps down the grey still valley to castle boterel
