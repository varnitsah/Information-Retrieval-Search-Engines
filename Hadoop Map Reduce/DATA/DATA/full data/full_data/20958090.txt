20958090	odd craft  by ww jacobs    the castaway  mrs john boxer stood at the door of the shop with her hands clasped on her apron  the short day had drawn to a close and the lamps in the narrow little thoroughfares of shinglesea were already lit  for a time she stood listening to the regular beat of the sea on the beach some halfmile distant and then with a slight shiver stepped back into the shop and closed the door  illustration mrs john boxer stood at the door of the shop with her hands clasped on her apron  the little shop with its widemouthed bottles of sweets was one of her earliest memories  until her marriage she had known no other home and when her husband was lost with the north star some three years before she gave up her home in poplar and returned to assist her mother in the little shop  in a restless mood she took up a piece of needlework and a minute or two later put it down again  a glance through the glass of the door leading into the small parlour revealed mrs gimpson with a red shawl round her shoulders asleep in her easychair  mrs boxer turned at the clang of the shop bell and then with a wild cry stood gazing at the figure of a man standing in the doorway  he was short and bearded with oddly shaped shoulders and a left leg which was not a match but the next moment mrs boxer was in his arms sobbing and laughing together  mrs gimpson whose nerves were still quivering owing to the suddenness with which she had been awakened came into the shop mr boxer freed an arm and placing it round her waist kissed her with some affection on the chin  hes come back  cried mrs boxer hysterically  thank goodness said mrs gimpson after a moments deliberation  hes alive  cried mrs boxer  hes alive   she halfdragged and halfled him into the small parlour and thrusting him into the easychair lately vacated by mrs gimpson seated herself upon his knee regardless in her excitement that the rightful owner was with elaborate care selecting the most uncomfortable chair in the room  fancy his coming back said mrs boxer wiping her eyes  how did you escape john  where have you been  tell us all about it  mr boxer sighed  it ud be a long story if i had the gift of telling of it he said slowly but ill cut it short for the present  when the north star went down in the south pacific most o the hands got away in the boats but i was too late  i got this crack on the head with something falling on it from aloft  look here  he bent his head and mrs boxer separating the stubble with her fingers uttered an exclamation of pity and alarm at the extent of the scar mrs gimpson craning forward uttered a sound which might mean anythingeven pity  when i come to my senses continued mr boxer the ship was sinking and i just got to my feet when she went down and took me with her  how i escaped i dont know  i seemed to be choking and fighting for my breath for years and then i found myself floating on the sea and clinging to a grating  i clung to it all night and next day i was picked up by a native who was paddling about in a canoe and taken ashore to an island where i lived for over two years  it was right out o the way o craft but at last i was picked up by a trading schooner named the pearl belonging to sydney and taken there  at sydney i shipped aboard the marston towers a steamer and landed at the albert docks this morning  poor john said his wife holding on to his arm  how you must have suffered  i did said mr boxer  mother got a cold  he inquired eying that lady  no i aint said mrs gimpson answering for herself  why didnt you write when you got to sydney  didnt know where to write to replied mr boxer staring  i didnt know where mary had gone to  you might ha wrote here said mrs gimpson  didnt think of it at the time said mr boxer  one thing is i was very busy at sydney looking for a ship  however im ere now  i always felt youd turn up some day said mrs gimpson  i felt certain of it in my own mind  mary made sure you was dead but i said no i knew better  there was something in mrs gimpsons manner of saying this that impressed her listeners unfavourably  the impression was deepened when after a short dry laugh a propos of nothing she sniffed againthree times  well you turned out to be right said mr boxer shortly  i ginrally am was the reply theres very few people can take me in  she sniffed again  were the natives kind to you inquired mrs boxer hastily as she turned to her husband  very kind said the latter  ah you ought to have seen that island beautiful yellow sands and palmtrees cocoanuts to be ad for the picking and nothing to do all day but lay about in the sun and swim in the sea  any publicouses there inquired mrs gimpson  certnly not said her soninlaw  this was an islandone o the little islands in the south pacific ocean  what did you say the name o the schooner was  inquired mrs gimpson  pearl replied mr boxer with the air of a resentful witness under crossexamination  and what was the name o the captin  said mrs gimpson  thomashenerywaltersmith said mr boxer with somewhat unpleasant emphasis  an the mates name  john brown was the reply  common names commented mrs gimpson very common  but i knew youd come back all righti never ad no alarm  hes safe and happy my dear i says  hell come back all in his own good time  what dyou mean by that demanded the sensitive mr boxer  i come back as soon as i could  you know you were anxious mother interposed her daughter  why you insisted upon our going to see old mr silver about it  ah  but i wasnt uneasy or anxious afterwards said mrs gimpson compressing her lips  whos old mr silver and what should he know about it inquired mr boxer  hes a fortuneteller replied his wife  reads the stars said his motherinlaw  mr boxer laugheda good ringing laugh  what did he tell you he inquired  nothing said his wife hastily  ah said mr boxer waggishly that was wise of im  most of us could tell fortunes that way  thats wrong said mrs gimpson to her daughter sharply  rights right any day and truths truth  he said that he knew all about john and what hed been doing but he wouldnt tell us for fear of urting our feelings and making mischief  here look ere said mr boxer starting up ive ad about enough o this  why dont you speak out what you mean  ill mischief im the old humbug  old rascal  never mind john said his wife laying her hand upon his arm  here you are safe and sound and as for old mr silver theres a lot o people dont believe in him  ah they dont want to said mrs gimpson obstinately  but dont forget that he foretold my cough last winter  well look ere said mr boxer twisting his short blunt nose into as near an imitation of a sneer as he could manage ive told you my story and ive got witnesses to prove it  you can write to the master of the marston towers if you like and other people besides  very well then lets go and see your precious old fortuneteller  you neednt say who i am say im a friend and tell im never to mind about making mischief but to say right out where i am and what ive been doing all this time i have my opes itll cure you of your superstitiousness  illustration well look ere said mr boxer ive told you my story and ive got witnesses to prove it  well go round after weve shut up mother said mrs boxer  well have a bit o supper first and then start early  mrs gimpson hesitated  it is never pleasant to submit ones superstitions to the tests of the unbelieving but after the attitude she had taken up she was extremely loath to allow her soninlaw a triumph  never mind well say no more about it she said primly but i ave my own ideas  i dessay said mr boxer but youre afraid for us to go to your old fortuneteller  it would be too much of a showup for im  its no good your trying to aggravate me john boxer because you cant do it said mrs gimpson in a voice trembling with passion  o course if people like being deceived they must be said mr boxer weve all got to live and if wed all got our common sense fortune tellers couldnt  does he tell fortunes by tealeaves or by the colour of your eyes  laugh away john boxer said mrs gimpson icily but i shouldnt have been alive now if it hadnt ha been for mr silvers warnings  mother stayed in bed for the first ten days in july explained mrs boxer to avoid being bit by a mad dog  tcheetcheetchee said the hapless mr boxer putting his hand over his mouth and making noble efforts to restrain himself tcheetch  i spose youd ha laughed more if i ad been bit  said the glaring mrs gimpson  well who did the dog bite after all  inquired mr boxer recovering  you dont understand replied mrs gimpson pityingly me being safe up in bed and the door locked there was no mad dog  there was no use for it  well said mr boxer me and marys going round to see that old deceiver after supper whether you come or not  mary shall tell im im a friend and ask him to tell her everything about er husband  nobody knows me here and mary and mell be affectionate like and give im to understand we want to marry  then he wont mind making mischief  youd better leave well alone said mrs gimpson  mr boxer shook his head  i was always one for a bit o fun he said slowly  i want to see his face when he finds out who i am  mrs gimpson made no reply she was looking round for the marketbasket and having found it she left the reunited couple to keep house while she went out to obtain a supper which should in her daughters eyes be worthy of the occasion  she went to the high street first and made her purchases and was on the way back again when in response to a sudden impulse as she passed the end of crowners alley she turned into that small byway and knocked at the astrologers door  a slow dragging footstep was heard approaching in reply to the summons and the astrologer recognising his visitor as one of his most faithful and credulous clients invited her to step inside  mrs gimpson complied and taking a chair gazed at the venerable white beard and small redrimmed eyes of her host in some perplexity as to how to begin  my daughters coming round to see you presently she said at last  the astrologer nodded  sheshe wants to ask you about er husband faltered mrs gimpson shes going to bring a friend with hera man who doesnt believe in your knowledge  hehe knows all about my daughters husband and he wants to see what you say you know about him  the old man put on a pair of huge horn spectacles and eyed her carefully  youve got something on your mind he said at last youd better tell me everything  mrs gimpson shook her head  theres some danger hanging over you continued mr silver in a low thrilling voice some danger in connection with your soninlaw  there he waved a lean shrivelled hand backward and forward as though dispelling a fog and peered into distancethere is something forming over you  youor somebodyare hiding something from me  illustration there is something forming over you  mrs gimpson aghast at such omniscience sank backward in her chair  speak said the old man gently there is no reason why you should be sacrificed for others  mrs gimpson was of the same opinion and in some haste she reeled off the events of the evening  she had a good memory and no detail was lost  strange strange said the venerable mr silver when he had finished he is an ingenious man  isnt it true  inquired his listener  he says he can prove it  and he is going to find out what you meant by saying you were afraid of making mischief  he can prove some of it said the old man his eyes snapping spitefully  i can guarantee that  but it wouldnt have made mischief if you had told us that ventured mrs gimpson  a man cant help being cast away  true said the astrologer slowly true  but let them come and question me and whatever you do for your own sake dont let a soul know that you have been here  if you do the danger to yourself will be so terrible that even i may be unable to help you  mrs gimpson shivered and more than ever impressed by his marvellous powers made her way slowly home where she found the unconscious mr boxer relating his adventures again with much gusto to a married couple from next door  its a wonder hes alive said mr jem thompson looking up as the old woman entered the room it sounds like a storybook  show us that cut on your head again mate  the obliging mr boxer complied  were going on with em after theyve ad supper continued mr thompson as he and his wife rose to depart  itll be a fair treat to me to see old silver bowled out  mrs gimpson sniffed and eyed his retreating figure disparagingly mrs boxer prompted by her husband began to set the table for supper  it was a lengthy meal owing principally to mr boxer but it was over at last and after that gentleman had assisted in shutting up the shop they joined the thompsons who were waiting outside and set off for crowners alley  the way was enlivened by mr boxer who had thrills of horror every ten yards at the idea of the supernatural things he was about to witness and by mr thompson who not to be outdone persisted in standing stockstill at frequent intervals until he had received the assurances of his giggling betterhalf that he would not be made to vanish in a cloud of smoke  by the time they reached mr silvers abode the party had regained its decorum and except for a tremendous shudder on the part of mr boxer as his gaze fell on a couple of skulls which decorated the magicians table their behaviour left nothing to be desired  mrs gimpson in a few awkward words announced the occasion of their visit  mr boxer she introduced as a friend of the family from london  i will do what i can said the old man slowly as his visitors seated themselves but i can only tell you what i see  if i do not see all or see clearly it cannot be helped  mr boxer winked at mr thompson and received an understanding pinch in return mrs thompson in a hot whisper told them to behave themselves  the mystic preparations were soon complete  a little cloud of smoke through which the fierce red eyes of the astrologer peered keenly at mr boxer rose from the table  then he poured various liquids into a small china bowl and holding up his hand to command silence gazed steadfastly into it  i see pictures he announced in a deep voice  the docks of a great city london  i see an illshaped man with a bent left leg standing on the deck of a ship  mr thompson his eyes wide open with surprise jerked mr boxer in the ribs but mr boxer whose figure was a sore point with him made no response  the ship leaves the docks continued mr silver still peering into the bowl  as she passes through the entrance her stern comes into view with the name painted on it  thethethe  look agin old chap growled mr boxer in an undertone  the north star said the astrologer  the illshaped man is still standing on the forepart of the ship i do not know his name or who he is  he takes the portrait of a beautiful young woman from his pocket and gazes at it earnestly  mrs boxer who had no illusions on the subject of her personal appearance sat up as though she had been stung mr thompson who was about to nudge mr boxer in the ribs again thought better of it and assumed an air of uncompromising virtue  the picture disappears said mr silver  ah  i see i see  a ship in a gale at sea  it is the north star it is sinking  the illshaped man sheds tears and loses his head  i cannot discover the name of this man  mr boxer who had been several times on the point of interrupting cleared his throat and endeavoured to look unconcerned  the ship sinks continued the astrologer in thrilling tones  ah what is this  a piece of wreckage with a monkey clinging to it  no noo  the illshaped man again  dear me  illustration ah  what is this  a piece of wreckage with a monkey clinging to it  his listeners sat spellbound  only the laboured and intense breathing of mr boxer broke the silence  he is alone on the boundless sea pursued the seer night falls  day breaks and a canoe propelled by a slender and pretty but dusky maiden approaches the castaway  she assists him into the canoe and his head sinks on her lap as with vigorous strokes of her paddle she propels the canoe toward a small island fringed with palm trees  here look ere began the overwrought mr boxer  hsh hsh  ejaculated the keenly interested mr thompson  wy dont you keep quiet  the picture fades continued the old man  i see another a native wedding  it is the dusky maiden and the man she rescued  ah the wedding is interrupted a young man a native breaks into the group  he has a long knife in his hand  he springs upon the illshaped man and wounds him in the head  involuntarily mr boxers hand went up to his honourable scar and the heads of the others swung round to gaze at it  mrs boxers face was terrible in its expression but mrs gimpsons bore the look of sad and patient triumph of one who knew men and could not be surprised at anything they do  the scene vanishes resumed the monotonous voice and another one forms  the same man stands on the deck of a small ship  the name on the stern is the peerno parisno no no pearl it fades from the shore where the dusky maiden stands with hands stretched out imploringly  the illshaped man smiles and takes the portrait of the young and beautiful girl from his pocket  look ere said the infuriated mr boxer i think weve ad about enough of this rubbish  i havemore than enough  i dont wonder at it said his wife trembling furiously  you can go if you like  im going to stay and hear all that there is to hear  you sit quiet urged the intensely interested mr thompson  he aint said its you  theres more than one misshaped man in the world i spose  i see an ocean liner said the seer who had appeared to be in a trance state during this colloquy  she is sailing for england from australia i see the name distinctly the marston towers  the same man is on board of her  the ship arrives at london  the scene closes another one forms  the illshaped man is sitting with a woman with a beautiful face not the same as the photograph  what they can see in him i cant think muttered mr thompson in an envious whisper  hes a perfick terror and to look at him  they sit hand in hand continued the astrologer raising his voice she smiles up at him and gently strokes his head he  a loud smack rang through the room and startled the entire company mrs boxer unable to contain herself any longer had so far from profiting by the example gone to the other extreme and slapped her husbands head with hearty goodwill  mr boxer sprang raging to his feet and in the confusion which ensued the fortuneteller to the great regret of mr thompson upset the contents of the magic bowl  i can see no more he said sinking hastily into his chair behind the table as mr boxer advanced upon him  mrs gimpson pushed her soninlaw aside and laying a modest fee upon the table took her daughters arm and led her out  the thompsons followed and mr boxer after an irresolute glance in the direction of the ingenuous mr silver made his way after them and fell into the rear the people in front walked on for some time in silence and then the voice of the greatly impressed mrs thompson was heard to the effect that if there were only more fortunetellers in the world there would be a lot more better men  mr boxer trotted up to his wifes side  look here mary he began  dont you speak to me said his wife drawing closer to her mother because i wont answer you  mr boxer laughed bitterly  this is a nice homecoming he remarked  he fell to the rear again and walked along raging his temper by no means being improved by observing that mrs thompson doubtless with a firm belief in the saying that evil communications corrupt good manners kept a tight hold of her husbands arm  his position as an outcast was clearly defined and he ground his teeth with rage as he observed the virtuous uprightness of mrs gimpsons back  by the time they reached home he was in a spirit of mad recklessness far in advance of the character given him by the astrologer  his wife gazed at him with a look of such strong interrogation as he was about to follow her into the house that he paused with his foot on the step and eyed her dumbly  have you left anything inside that you want she inquired  illustration have you left anything inside that you want she inquired  mr boxer shook his head  i only wanted to come in and make a clean breast of it he said in a curious voice then ill go  mrs gimpson stood aside to let him pass and mr thompson not to be denied followed close behind with his faintly protesting wife  they sat down in a row against the wall and mr boxer sitting opposite in a hangdog fashion eyed them with scornful wrath  well  said mrs boxer at last  all that he said was quite true said her husband defiantly  the only thing is he didnt tell the arf of it  altogether i married three dusky maidens  everybody but mr thompson shuddered with horror  then i married a white girl in australia pursued mr boxer musingly i wonder old silver didnt see that in the bowl not arf a fortune teller i call im  what they see in im whispered the astounded mr thompson to his wife  and did you marry the beautiful girl in the photograph demanded mrs boxer in trembling accents  i did said her husband  hussy cried mrs boxer  i married her said mr boxer consideringi married her at camberwell in eighteen ninetythree  eighteen ninetythree said his wife in a startled voice  but you couldnt  why you didnt marry me till eighteen ninetyfour  whats that got to do with it inquired the monster calmly  mrs boxer pale as ashes rose from her seat and stood gazing at him with horrorstruck eyes trying in vain to speak  you villain cried mrs gimpson violently  i always distrusted you  illustration you villain cried mrs gimpson violently  i always distrusted you  i know you did said mr boxer calmly  youve been committing bigamy cried mrs gimpson  over and over agin assented mr boxer cheerfully  its got to be a obby with me  was the first wife alive when you married my daughter demanded mrs gimpson  alive said mr boxer  o course she was  shes alive nowbless her  he leaned back in his chair and regarded with intense satisfaction the horrified faces of the group in front  youyoull go to jail for this cried mrs gimpson breathlessly what is your first wifes address  i decline to answer that question said her soninlaw  what is your first wifes address  repeated mrs gimpson  ask the fortuneteller said mr boxer with an aggravating smile and then get im up in the box as a witness little bowl and all  he can tell you more than i can  i demand to know her name and address cried mrs gimpson putting a bony arm around the waist of the trembling mrs boxer  i decline to give it said mr boxer with great relish  it aint likely im going to give myself away like that besides its agin the law for a man to criminate himself  you go on and start your bigamy case and call old redeyes as a witness  mrs gimpson gazed at him in speechless wrath and then stooping down conversed in excited whispers with mrs thompson  mrs boxer crossed over to her husband  oh john she wailed say it isnt true say it isnt true  mr boxer hesitated  whats the good o me saying anything  he said doggedly  it isnt true persisted his wife  say it isnt true  what i told you when i first came in this evening was quite true said her husband slowly  and what ive just told you is as true as what that lying old fortuneteller told you  you can please yourself what you believe  i believe you john said his wife humbly  mr boxers countenance cleared and he drew her on to his knee  thats right he said cheerfully  so long as you believe in me i dont care what other people think  and before im much older ill find out how that old rascal got to know the names of the ships i was aboard seems to me somebodys been talking
