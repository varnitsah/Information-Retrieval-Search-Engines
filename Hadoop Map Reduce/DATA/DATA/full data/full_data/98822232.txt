98822232	travels with a donkey in the cevennes by robert louis stevenson   a new impression with a frontispiece by walter crane london chatto  windus 1907  frontispiece by walter crane frontjpg  my dear sidney colvin  the journey which this little book is to describe was very agreeable and fortunate for me  after an uncouth beginning i had the best of luck to the end  but we are all travellers in what john bunyan calls the wilderness of this worldall too travellers with a donkey and the best that we find in our travels is an honest friend  he is a fortunate voyager who finds many  we travel indeed to find them  they are the end and the reward of life  they keep us worthy of ourselves and when we are alone we are only nearer to the absent  every book is in an intimate sense a circular letter to the friends of him who writes it  they alone take his meaning they find private messages assurances of love and expressions of gratitude dropped for them in every corner  the public is but a generous patron who defrays the postage  yet though the letter is directed to all we have an old and kindly custom of addressing it on the outside to one  of what shall a man be proud if he is not proud of his friends  and so my dear sidney colvin it is with pride that i sign myself affectionately yours  r l s     velay      many are the mighty things and nought is more mighty than man       he masters by his devices the tenant of the fields     sophocles     who hath loosed the bands of the wild ass     job    the donkey the pack and the packsaddle   in a little place called le monastier in a pleasant highland valley fifteen miles from le puy i spent about a month of fine days  monastier is notable for the making of lace for drunkenness for freedom of language and for unparalleled political dissension  there are adherents of each of the four french partieslegitimists orleanists imperialists and republicansin this little mountaintown and they all hate loathe decry and calumniate each other  except for business purposes or to give each other the lie in a tavern brawl they have laid aside even the civility of speech  tis a mere mountain poland  in the midst of this babylon i found myself a rallyingpoint every one was anxious to be kind and helpful to the stranger  this was not merely from the natural hospitality of mountain people nor even from the surprise with which i was regarded as a man living of his own free will in le monastier when he might just as well have lived anywhere else in this big world it arose a good deal from my projected excursion southward through the cevennes  a traveller of my sort was a thing hitherto unheard of in that district  i was looked upon with contempt like a man who should project a journey to the moon but yet with a respectful interest like one setting forth for the inclement pole  all were ready to help in my preparations a crowd of sympathisers supported me at the critical moment of a bargain not a step was taken but was heralded by glasses round and celebrated by a dinner or a breakfast  it was already hard upon october before i was ready to set forth and at the high altitudes over which my road lay there was no indian summer to be looked for  i was determined if not to camp out at least to have the means of camping out in my possession for there is nothing more harassing to an easy mind than the necessity of reaching shelter by dusk and the hospitality of a village inn is not always to be reckoned sure by those who trudge on foot  a tent above all for a solitary traveller is troublesome to pitch and troublesome to strike again and even on the march it forms a conspicuous feature in your baggage  a sleepingsack on the other hand is always readyyou have only to get into it it serves a double purposea bed by night a portmanteau by day and it does not advertise your intention of camping out to every curious passer by  this is a huge point  if a camp is not secret it is but a troubled restingplace you become a public character the convivial rustic visits your bedside after an early supper and you must sleep with one eye open and be up before the day  i decided on a sleepingsack and after repeated visits to le puy and a deal of high living for myself and my advisers a sleepingsack was designed constructed and triumphantly brought home  this child of my invention was nearly six feet square exclusive of two triangular flaps to serve as a pillow by night and as the top and bottom of the sack by day  i call it the sack but it was never a sack by more than courtesy only a sort of long roll or sausage green waterproof cartcloth without and blue sheeps fur within  it was commodious as a valise warm and dry for a bed  there was luxurious turning room for one and at a pinch the thing might serve for two  i could bury myself in it up to the neck for my head i trusted to a fur cap with a hood to fold down over my ears and a band to pass under my nose like a respirator and in case of heavy rain i proposed to make myself a little tent or tentlet with my waterproof coat three stones and a bent branch  it will readily be conceived that i could not carry this huge package on my own merely human shoulders  it remained to choose a beast of burden  now a horse is a fine lady among animals flighty timid delicate in eating of tender health he is too valuable and too restive to be left alone so that you are chained to your brute as to a fellow galleyslave a dangerous road puts him out of his wits in short hes an uncertain and exacting ally and adds thirtyfold to the troubles of the voyager  what i required was something cheap and small and hardy and of a stolid and peaceful temper and all these requisites pointed to a donkey  there dwelt an old man in monastier of rather unsound intellect according to some much followed by streetboys and known to fame as father adam  father adam had a cart and to draw the cart a diminutive sheass not much bigger than a dog the colour of a mouse with a kindly eye and a determined underjaw  there was something neat and highbred a quakerish elegance about the rogue that hit my fancy on the spot  our first interview was in monastier marketplace  to prove her good temper one child after another was set upon her back to ride and one after another went head over heels into the air until a want of confidence began to reign in youthful bosoms and the experiment was discontinued from a dearth of subjects  i was already backed by a deputation of my friends but as if this were not enough all the buyers and sellers came round and helped me in the bargain and the ass and i and father adam were the centre of a hubbub for near half an hour  at length she passed into my service for the consideration of sixtyfive francs and a glass of brandy  the sack had already cost eighty francs and two glasses of beer so that modestine as i instantly baptized her was upon all accounts the cheaper article  indeed that was as it should be for she was only an appurtenance of my mattress or selfacting bedstead on four castors  i had a last interview with father adam in a billiardroom at the witching hour of dawn when i administered the brandy  he professed himself greatly touched by the separation and declared he had often bought white bread for the donkey when he had been content with black bread for himself but this according to the best authorities must have been a flight of fancy  he had a name in the village for brutally misusing the ass yet it is certain that he shed a tear and the tear made a clean mark down one cheek  by the advice of a fallacious local saddler a leather pad was made for me with rings to fasten on my bundle and i thoughtfully completed my kit and arranged my toilette  by way of armoury and utensils i took a revolver a little spiritlamp and pan a lantern and some halfpenny candles a jackknife and a large leather flask  the main cargo consisted of two entire changes of warm clothingbesides my travelling wear of country velveteen pilotcoat and knitted spencersome books and my railwayrug which being also in the form of a bag made me a double castle for cold nights  the permanent larder was represented by cakes of chocolate and tins of bologna sausage  all this except what i carried about my person was easily stowed into the sheepskin bag and by good fortune i threw in my empty knapsack rather for convenience of carriage than from any thought that i should want it on my journey  for more immediate needs i took a leg of cold mutton a bottle of beaujolais an empty bottle to carry milk an eggbeater and a considerable quantity of black bread and white like father adam for myself and donkey only in my scheme of things the destinations were reversed  monastrians of all shades of thought in politics had agreed in threatening me with many ludicrous misadventures and with sudden death in many surprising forms  cold wolves robbers above all the nocturnal practical joker were daily and eloquently forced on my attention  yet in these vaticinations the true patent danger was left out  like christian it was from my pack i suffered by the way  before telling my own mishaps let me in two words relate the lesson of my experience  if the pack is well strapped at the ends and hung at full lengthnot doubled for your lifeacross the packsaddle the traveller is safe the saddle will certainly not fit such is the imperfection of our transitory life it will assuredly topple and tend to overset but there are stones on every roadside and a man soon learns the art of correcting any tendency to overbalance with a welladjusted stone  on the day of my departure i was up a little after five by six we began to load the donkey and ten minutes after my hopes were in the dust  the pad would not stay on modestines back for half a moment  i returned it to its maker with whom i had so contumelious a passage that the street outside was crowded from wall to wall with gossips looking on and listening  the pad changed hands with much vivacity perhaps it would be more descriptive to say that we threw it at each others heads and at any rate we were very warm and unfriendly and spoke with a deal of freedom  i had a common donkey packsaddlea barde as they call itfitted upon modestine and once more loaded her with my effects  the doubled sack my pilotcoat for it was warm and i was to walk in my waistcoat a great bar of black bread and an open basket containing the white bread the mutton and the bottles were all corded together in a very elaborate system of knots and i looked on the result with fatuous content  in such a monstrous deckcargo all poised above the donkeys shoulders with nothing below to balance on a brandnew packsaddle that had not yet been worn to fit the animal and fastened with brandnew girths that might be expected to stretch and slacken by the way even a very careless traveller should have seen disaster brewing  that elaborate system of knots again was the work of too many sympathisers to be very artfully designed  it is true they tightened the cords with a will as many as three at a time would have a foot against modestines quarters and be hauling with clenched teeth but i learned afterwards that one thoughtful person without any exercise of force can make a more solid job than halfadozen heated and enthusiastic grooms  i was then but a novice even after the misadventure of the pad nothing could disturb my security and i went forth from the stable door as an ox goeth to the slaughter    the green donkeydriver   the bell of monastier was just striking nine as i got quit of these preliminary troubles and descended the hill through the common  as long as i was within sight of the windows a secret shame and the fear of some laughable defeat withheld me from tampering with modestine  she tripped along upon her four small hoofs with a sober daintiness of gait from time to time she shook her ears or her tail and she looked so small under the bundle that my mind misgave me  we got across the ford without difficultythere was no doubt about the matter she was docility itselfand once on the other bank where the road begins to mount through pinewoods i took in my right hand the unhallowed staff and with a quaking spirit applied it to the donkey  modestine brisked up her pace for perhaps three steps and then relapsed into her former minuet another application had the same effect and so with the third  i am worthy the name of an englishman and it goes against my conscience to lay my hand rudely on a female  i desisted and looked her all over from head to foot the poor brutes knees were trembling and her breathing was distressed it was plain that she could go no faster on a hill  god forbid thought i that i should brutalise this innocent creature let her go at her own pace and let me patiently follow  what that pace was there is no word mean enough to describe it was something as much slower than a walk as a walk is slower than a run it kept me hanging on each foot for an incredible length of time in five minutes it exhausted the spirit and set up a fever in all the muscles of the leg  and yet i had to keep close at hand and measure my advance exactly upon hers for if i dropped a few yards into the rear or went on a few yards ahead modestine came instantly to a halt and began to browse  the thought that this was to last from here to alais nearly broke my heart  of all conceivable journeys this promised to be the most tedious  i tried to tell myself it was a lovely day i tried to charm my foreboding spirit with tobacco but i had a vision ever present to me of the long long roads up hill and down dale and a pair of figures ever infinitesimally moving foot by foot a yard to the minute and like things enchanted in a nightmare approaching no nearer to the goal  in the meantime there came up behind us a tall peasant perhaps forty years of age of an ironical snuffy countenance and arrayed in the green tailcoat of the country  he overtook us hand over hand and stopped to consider our pitiful advance  your donkey says he is very old  i told him i believed not  then he supposed we had come far  i told him we had but newly left monastier  et vous marchez comme ca cried he and throwing back his head he laughed long and heartily  i watched him half prepared to feel offended until he had satisfied his mirth and then you must have no pity on these animals said he and plucking a switch out of a thicket he began to lace modestine about the sternworks uttering a cry  the rogue pricked up her ears and broke into a good round pace which she kept up without flagging and without exhibiting the least symptom of distress as long as the peasant kept beside us  her former panting and shaking had been i regret to say a piece of comedy  my deus ex machina before he left me supplied some excellent if inhumane advice presented me with the switch which he declared she would feel more tenderly than my cane and finally taught me the true cry or masonic word of donkeydrivers proot  all the time he regarded me with a comical incredulous air which was embarrassing to confront and smiled over my donkeydriving as i might have smiled over his orthography or his green tailcoat  but it was not my turn for the moment  i was proud of my new lore and thought i had learned the art to perfection  and certainly modestine did wonders for the rest of the fore noon and i had a breathing space to look about me  it was sabbath the mountainfields were all vacant in the sunshine and as we came down through st martin de frugeres the church was crowded to the door there were people kneeling without upon the steps and the sound of the priests chanting came forth out of the dim interior  it gave me a home feeling on the spot for i am a countryman of the sabbath so to speak and all sabbath observances like a scottish accent strike in me mixed feelings grateful and the reverse  it is only a traveller hurrying by like a person from another planet who can rightly enjoy the peace and beauty of the great ascetic feast  the sight of the resting country does his spirit good  there is something better than music in the wide unusual silence and it disposes him to amiable thoughts like the sound of a little river or the warmth of sunlight  in this pleasant humour i came down the hill to where goudet stands in a green end of a valley with chateau beaufort opposite upon a rocky steep and the stream as clear as crystal lying in a deep pool between them above and below you may hear it wimpling over the stones an amiable stripling of a river which it seems absurd to call the loire  on all sides goudet is shut in by mountains rocky footpaths practicable at best for donkeys join it to the outer world of france and the men and women drink and swear in their green corner or look up at the snowclad peaks in winter from the threshold of their homes in an isolation you would think like that of homers cyclops  but it is not so the postman reaches goudet with the letterbag the aspiring youth of goudet are within a days walk of the railway at le puy and here in the inn you may find an engraved portrait of the hosts nephew regis senac professor of fencing and champion of the two americas a distinction gained by him along with the sum of five hundred dollars at tammany hall new york on the 10th april 1876  i hurried over my midday meal and was early forth again  but alas as we climbed the interminable hill upon the other side proot seemed to have lost its virtue  i prooted like a lion i prooted mellifluously like a suckingdove but modestine would be neither softened nor intimidated  she held doggedly to her pace nothing but a blow would move her and that only for a second  i must follow at her heels incessantly belabouring  a moments pause in this ignoble toil and she relapsed into her own private gait  i think i never heard of any one in as mean a situation  i must reach the lake of bouchet where i meant to camp before sundown and to have even a hope of this i must instantly maltreat this uncomplaining animal  the sound of my own blows sickened me  once when i looked at her she had a faint resemblance to a lady of my acquaintance who formerly loaded me with kindness and this increased my horror of my cruelty  to make matters worse we encountered another donkey ranging at will upon the roadside and this other donkey chanced to be a gentleman  he and modestine met nickering for joy and i had to separate the pair and beat down their young romance with a renewed and feverish bastinado  if the other donkey had had the heart of a male under his hide he would have fallen upon me tooth and hoof and this was a kind of consolationhe was plainly unworthy of modestines affection  but the incident saddened me as did everything that spoke of my donkeys sex  it was blazing hot up the valley windless with vehement sun upon my shoulders and i had to labour so consistently with my stick that the sweat ran into my eyes  every five minutes too the pack the basket and the pilotcoat would take an ugly slew to one side or the other and i had to stop modestine just when i had got her to a tolerable pace of about two miles an hour to tug push shoulder and readjust the load and at last in the village of ussel saddle and all the whole hypothec turned round and grovelled in the dust below the donkeys belly  she none better pleased incontinently drew up and seemed to smile and a party of one man two women and two children came up and standing round me in a halfcircle encouraged her by their example  i had the devils own trouble to get the thing righted and the instant i had done so without hesitation it toppled and fell down upon the other side  judge if i was hot  and yet not a hand was offered to assist me the man indeed told me i ought to have a package of a different shape i suggested if he knew nothing better to the point in my predicament he might hold his tongue  and the goodnatured dog agreed with me smilingly  it was the most despicable fix  i must plainly content myself with the pack for modestine and take the following items for my own share of the portage a cane a quartflask a pilotjacket heavily weighted in the pockets two pounds of black bread and an open basket full of meats and bottles  i believe i may say i am not devoid of greatness of soul for i did not recoil from this infamous burden  i disposed it heaven knows how so as to be mildly portable and then proceeded to steer modestine through the village  she tried as was indeed her invariable habit to enter every house and every courtyard in the whole length and encumbered as i was without a hand to help myself no words can render an idea of my difficulties  a priest with six or seven others was examining a church in process of repair and he and his acolytes laughed loudly as they saw my plight  i remembered having laughed myself when i had seen good men struggling with adversity in the person of a jackass and the recollection filled me with penitence  that was in my old light days before this trouble came upon me  god knows at least that i shall never laugh again thought i but oh what a cruel thing is a farce to those engaged in it  a little out of the village modestine filled with the demon set her heart upon a byroad and positively refused to leave it  i dropped all my bundles and i am ashamed to say struck the poor sinner twice across the face  it was pitiful to see her lift her head with shut eyes as if waiting for another blow  i came very near crying but i did a wiser thing than that and sat squarely down by the roadside to consider my situation under the cheerful influence of tobacco and a nip of brandy modestine in the meanwhile munched some black bread with a contrite hypocritical air  it was plain that i must make a sacrifice to the gods of shipwreck  i threw away the empty bottle destined to carry milk i threw away my own white bread and disdaining to act by general average kept the black bread for modestine lastly i threw away the cold leg of mutton and the eggwhisk although this last was dear to my heart  thus i found room for everything in the basket and even stowed the boating coat on the top  by means of an end of cord i slung it under one arm and although the cord cut my shoulder and the jacket hung almost to the ground it was with a heart greatly lightened that i set forth again  i had now an arm free to thrash modestine and cruelly i chastised her if i were to reach the lakeside before dark she must bestir her little shanks to some tune  already the sun had gone down into a windylooking mist and although there were still a few streaks of gold far off to the east on the hills and the black firwoods all was cold and grey about our onward path  an infinity of little country byroads led hither and thither among the fields  it was the most pointless labyrinth  i could see my destination overhead or rather the peak that dominates it but choose as i pleased the roads always ended by turning away from it and sneaking back towards the valley or northward along the margin of the hills  the failing light the waning colour the naked unhomely stony country through which i was travelling threw me into some despondency  i promise you the stick was not idle i think every decent step that modestine took must have cost me at least two emphatic blows  there was not another sound in the neighbourhood but that of my unwearying bastinado  suddenly in the midst of my toils the load once more bit the dust and as by enchantment all the cords were simultaneously loosened and the road scattered with my dear possessions  the packing was to begin again from the beginning and as i had to invent a new and better system i do not doubt but i lost half an hour  it began to be dusk in earnest as i reached a wilderness of turf and stones  it had the air of being a road which should lead everywhere at the same time and i was falling into something not unlike despair when i saw two figures stalking towards me over the stones  they walked one behind the other like tramps but their pace was remarkable  the son led the way a tall illmade sombre scottishlooking man the mother followed all in her sundays best with an elegantly embroidered ribbon to her cap and a new felt hat atop and proffering as she strode along with kilted petticoats a string of obscene and blasphemous oaths  i hailed the son and asked him my direction  he pointed loosely west and northwest muttered an inaudible comment and without slackening his pace for an instant stalked on as he was going right athwart my path  the mother followed without so much as raising her head  i shouted and shouted after them but they continued to scale the hillside and turned a deaf ear to my outcries  at last leaving modestine by herself i was constrained to run after them hailing the while  they stopped as i drew near the mother still cursing and i could see she was a handsome motherly respectablelooking woman  the son once more answered me roughly and inaudibly and was for setting out again  but this time i simply collared the mother who was nearest me and apologising for my violence declared that i could not let them go until they had put me on my road  they were neither of them offendedrather mollified than otherwise told me i had only to follow them and then the mother asked me what i wanted by the lake at such an hour  i replied in the scottish manner by inquiring if she had far to go herself  she told me with another oath that she had an hour and a halfs road before her and then without salutation the pair strode forward again up the hillside in the gathering dusk  i returned for modestine pushed her briskly forward and after a sharp ascent of twenty minutes reached the edge of a plateau  the view looking back on my days journey was both wild and sad  mount mezenc and the peaks beyond st julien stood out in trenchant gloom against a cold glitter in the east and the intervening field of hills had fallen together into one broad wash of shadow except here and there the outline of a wooded sugarloaf in black here and there a white irregular patch to represent a cultivated farm and here and there a blot where the loire the gazeille or the laussonne wandered in a gorge  soon we were on a highroad and surprise seized on my mind as i beheld a village of some magnitude close at hand for i had been told that the neighbourhood of the lake was uninhabited except by trout  the road smoked in the twilight with children driving home cattle from the fields and a pair of mounted stridelegged women hat and cap and all dashed past me at a hammering trot from the canton where they had been to church and market  i asked one of the children where i was  at bouchet st nicolas he told me  thither about a mile south of my destination and on the other side of a respectable summit had these confused roads and treacherous peasantry conducted me  my shoulder was cut so that it hurt sharply my arm ached like toothache from perpetual beating i gave up the lake and my design to camp and asked for the auberge    i have a goad   the auberge of bouchet st nicolas was among the least pretentious i have ever visited but i saw many more of the like upon my journey  indeed it was typical of these french highlands  imagine a cottage of two stories with a bench before the door the stable and kitchen in a suite so that modestine and i could hear each other dining furniture of the plainest earthern floors a single bedchamber for travellers and that without any convenience but beds  in the kitchen cooking and eating go forward side by side and the family sleep at night  any one who has a fancy to wash must do so in public at the common table  the food is sometimes spare hard fish and omelette have been my portion more than once the wine is of the smallest the brandy abominable to man and the visit of a fat sow grouting under the table and rubbing against your legs is no impossible accompaniment to dinner  but the people of the inn in nine cases out of ten show themselves friendly and considerate  as soon as you cross the doors you cease to be a stranger and although these peasantry are rude and forbidding on the highway they show a tincture of kind breeding when you share their hearth  at bouchet for instance i uncorked my bottle of beaujolais and asked the host to join me  he would take but little  i am an amateur of such wine do you see he said and i am capable of leaving you not enough  in these hedgeinns the traveller is expected to eat with his own knife unless he ask no other will be supplied with a glass a whang of bread and an iron fork the table is completely laid  my knife was cordially admired by the landlord of bouchet and the spring filled him with wonder  i should never have guessed that he said  i would bet he added weighing it in his hand that this cost you not less than five francs  when i told him it had cost me twenty his jaw dropped  he was a mild handsome sensible friendly old man astonishingly ignorant  his wife who was not so pleasant in her manners knew how to read although i do not suppose she ever did so  she had a share of brains and spoke with a cutting emphasis like one who ruled the roast  my man knows nothing she said with an angry nod he is like the beasts  and the old gentleman signified acquiescence with his head  there was no contempt on her part and no shame on his the facts were accepted loyally and no more about the matter  i was tightly crossexamined about my journey and the lady understood in a moment and sketched out what i should put into my book when i got home  whether people harvest or not in such or such a place if there were forests studies of manners what for example i and the master of the house say to you the beauties of nature and all that  and she interrogated me with a look  it is just that said i  you see she added to her husband i understood that  they were both much interested by the story of my misadventures  in the morning said the husband i will make you something better than your cane  such a beast as that feels nothing it is in the proverbdur comme un ane you might beat her insensible with a cudgel and yet you would arrive nowhere  something better  i little knew what he was offering  the sleepingroom was furnished with two beds  i had one and i will own i was a little abashed to find a young man and his wife and child in the act of mounting into the other  this was my first experience of the sort and if i am always to feel equally silly and extraneous i pray god it be my last as well  i kept my eyes to myself and know nothing of the woman except that she had beautiful arms and seemed no whit embarrassed by my appearance  as a matter of fact the situation was more trying to me than to the pair  a pair keep each other in countenance it is the single gentleman who has to blush  but i could not help attributing my sentiments to the husband and sought to conciliate his tolerance with a cup of brandy from my flask  he told me that he was a cooper of alais travelling to st etienne in search of work and that in his spare moments he followed the fatal calling of a maker of matches  me he readily enough divined to be a brandy merchant  i was up first in the morning monday september 23rd and hastened my toilette guiltily so as to leave a clear field for madam the coopers wife  i drank a bowl of milk and set off to explore the neighbourhood of bouchet  it was perishing cold a grey windy wintry morning misty clouds flew fast and low the wind piped over the naked platform and the only speck of colour was away behind mount mezenc and the eastern hills where the sky still wore the orange of the dawn  it was five in the morning and four thousand feet above the sea and i had to bury my hands in my pockets and trot  people were trooping out to the labours of the field by twos and threes and all turned round to stare upon the stranger  i had seen them coming back last night i saw them going afield again and there was the life of bouchet in a nutshell  when i came back to the inn for a bit of breakfast the landlady was in the kitchen combing out her daughters hair and i made her my compliments upon its beauty  oh no said the mother it is not so beautiful as it ought to be look it is too fine  thus does a wise peasantry console itself under adverse physical circumstances and by a startling democratic process the defects of the majority decide the type of beauty  and where said i is monsieur  the master of the house is upstairs she answered making you a goad  blessed be the man who invented goads  blessed the innkeeper of bouchet st nicolas who introduced me to their use  this plain wand with an eighth of an inch of pin was indeed a sceptre when he put it in my hands  thenceforward modestine was my slave  a prick and she passed the most inviting stable door  a prick and she broke forth into a gallant little trotlet that devoured the miles  it was not a remarkable speed when all was said and we took four hours to cover ten miles at the best of it  but what a heavenly change since yesterday  no more wielding of the ugly cudgel no more flailing with an aching arm no more broadsword exercise but a discreet and gentlemanly fence  and what although now and then a drop of blood should appear on modestines mouse coloured wedgelike rump  i should have preferred it otherwise indeed but yesterdays exploits had purged my heart of all humanity  the perverse little devil since she would not be taken with kindness must even go with pricking  it was bleak and bitter cold and except a cavalcade of stridelegged ladies and a pair of postrunners the road was dead solitary all the way to pradelles  i scarce remember an incident but one  a handsome foal with a bell about his neck came charging up to us upon a stretch of common sniffed the air martially as one about to do great deeds and suddenly thinking otherwise in his green young heart put about and galloped off as he had come the bell tinkling in the wind  for a long while afterwards i saw his noble attitude as he drew up and heard the note of his bell and when i struck the highroad the song of the telegraphwires seemed to continue the same music  pradelles stands on a hillside high above the allier surrounded by rich meadows  they were cutting aftermath on all sides which gave the neighbourhood this gusty autumn morning an untimely smell of hay  on the opposite bank of the allier the land kept mounting for miles to the horizon a tanned and sallow autumn landscape with black blots of fir wood and white roads wandering through the hills  over all this the clouds shed a uniform and purplish shadow sad and somewhat menacing exaggerating height and distance and throwing into still higher relief the twisted ribbons of the highway  it was a cheerless prospect but one stimulating to a traveller  for i was now upon the limit of velay and all that i beheld lay in another countywild gevaudan mountainous uncultivated and but recently disforested from terror of the wolves  wolves alas like bandits seem to flee the travellers advance and you may trudge through all our comfortable europe and not meet with an adventure worth the name  but here if anywhere a man was on the frontiers of hope  for this was the land of the evermemorable beast the napoleon bonaparte of wolves  what a career was his  he lived ten months at free quarters in gevaudan and vivarais he ate women and children and shepherdesses celebrated for their beauty he pursued armed horsemen he has been seen at broad noonday chasing a postchaise and outrider along the kings highroad and chaise and outrider fleeing before him at the gallop  he was placarded like a political offender and ten thousand francs were offered for his head  and yet when he was shot and sent to versailles behold a common wolf and even small for that  though i could reach from pole to pole sang alexander pope the little corporal shook europe and if all wolves had been as this wolf they would have changed the history of man  m elie berthet has made him the hero of a novel which i have read and do not wish to read again  i hurried over my lunch and was proof against the landladys desire that i should visit our lady of pradelles who performed many miracles although she was of wood and before threequarters of an hour i was goading modestine down the steep descent that leads to langogne on the allier  on both sides of the road in big dusty fields farmers were preparing for next spring  every fifty yards a yoke of greatnecked stolid oxen were patiently haling at the plough  i saw one of these mild formidable servants of the glebe who took a sudden interest in modestine and me  the furrow down which he was journeying lay at an angle to the road and his head was solidly fixed to the yoke like those of caryatides below a ponderous cornice but he screwed round his big honest eyes and followed us with a ruminating look until his master bade him turn the plough and proceed to reascend the field  from all these furrowing ploughshares from the feet of oxen from a labourer here and there who was breaking the dry clods with a hoe the wind carried away a thin dust like so much smoke  it was a fine busy breathing rustic landscape and as i continued to descend the highlands of gevaudan kept mounting in front of me against the sky  i had crossed the loire the day before now i was to cross the allier so near are these two confluents in their youth  just at the bridge of langogne as the longpromised rain was beginning to fall a lassie of some seven or eight addressed me in the sacramental phrase doustce que vous venez  she did it with so high an air that she set me laughing and this cut her to the quick  she was evidently one who reckoned on respect and stood looking after me in silent dudgeon as i crossed the bridge and entered the county of gevaudan     upper gevaudan      the way also here was very wearisome through dirt and slabbiness nor    was there on all this ground so much as one inn or victuallinghouse    wherein to refresh the feebler sort     pilgrims progress    a camp in the dark   the next day tuesday september 24th it was two oclock in the afternoon before i got my journal written up and my knapsack repaired for i was determined to carry my knapsack in the future and have no more ado with baskets and half an hour afterwards i set out for le cheylard leveque a place on the borders of the forest of mercoire  a man i was told should walk there in an hour and a half and i thought it scarce too ambitious to suppose that a man encumbered with a donkey might cover the same distance in four hours  all the way up the long hill from langogne it rained and hailed alternately the wind kept freshening steadily although slowly plentiful hurrying cloudssome dragging veils of straight rainshower others massed and luminous as though promising snowcareered out of the north and followed me along my way  i was soon out of the cultivated basin of the allier and away from the ploughing oxen and suchlike sights of the country  moor heathery marsh tracts of rock and pines woods of birch all jewelled with the autumn yellow here and there a few naked cottages and bleak fieldsthese were the characters of the country  hill and valley followed valley and hill the little green and stony cattletracks wandered in and out of one another split into three or four died away in marshy hollows and began again sporadically on hillsides or at the borders of a wood  there was no direct road to cheylard and it was no easy affair to make a passage in this uneven country and through this intermittent labyrinth of tracks  it must have been about four when i struck sagnerousse and went on my way rejoicing in a sure point of departure  two hours afterwards the dusk rapidly falling in a lull of the wind i issued from a firwood where i had long been wandering and found not the lookedfor village but another marish bottom among roughandtumble hills  for some time past i had heard the ringing of cattlebells ahead and now as i came out of the skirts of the wood i saw near upon a dozen cows and perhaps as many more black figures which i conjectured to be children although the mist had almost unrecognisably exaggerated their forms  these were all silently following each other round and round in a circle now taking hands now breaking up with chains and reverences  a dance of children appeals to very innocent and lively thoughts but at nightfall on the marshes the thing was eerie and fantastic to behold  even i who am well enough read in herbert spencer felt a sort of silence fall for an instant on my mind  the next i was pricking modestine forward and guiding her like an unruly ship through the open  in a path she went doggedly ahead of her own accord as before a fair wind but once on the turf or among heather and the brute became demented  the tendency of lost travellers to go round in a circle was developed in her to the degree of passion and it took all the steering i had in me to keep even a decently straight course through a single field  while i was thus desperately tacking through the bog children and cattle began to disperse until only a pair of girls remained behind  from these i sought direction on my path  the peasantry in general were but little disposed to counsel a wayfarer  one old devil simply retired into his house and barricaded the door on my approach and i might beat and shout myself hoarse he turned a deaf ear  another having given me a direction which as i found afterwards i had misunderstood complacently watched me going wrong without adding a sign  he did not care a stalk of parsley if i wandered all night upon the hills  as for these two girls they were a pair of impudent sly sluts with not a thought but mischief one put out her tongue at me the other bade me follow the cows and they both giggled and jogged each others elbows  the beast of gevaudan ate about a hundred children of this district i began to think of him with sympathy  leaving the girls i pushed on through the bog and got into another wood and upon a wellmarked road  it grew darker and darker  modestine suddenly beginning to smell mischief bettered the pace of her own accord and from that time forward gave me no trouble  it was the first sign of intelligence i had occasion to remark in her  at the same time the wind freshened into half a gale and another heavy discharge of rain came flying up out of the north  at the other side of the wood i sighted some red windows in the dusk  this was the hamlet of fouzilhic three houses on a hillside near a wood of birches  here i found a delightful old man who came a little way with me in the rain to put me safely on the road for cheylard  he would hear of no reward but shook his hands above his head almost as if in menace and refused volubly and shrilly in unmitigated patois  all seemed right at last  my thoughts began to turn upon dinner and a fireside and my heart was agreeably softened in my bosom  alas and i was on the brink of new and greater miseries  suddenly at a single swoop the night fell  i have been abroad in many a black night but never in a blacker  a glimmer of rocks a glimmer of the track where it was well beaten a certain fleecy density or night within night for a treethis was all that i could discriminate  the sky was simply darkness overhead even the flying clouds pursued their way invisibly to human eyesight  i could not distinguish my hand at armslength from the track nor my goad at the same distance from the meadows or the sky  soon the road that i was following split after the fashion of the country into three or four in a piece of rocky meadow  since modestine had shown such a fancy for beaten roads i tried her instinct in this predicament  but the instinct of an ass is what might be expected from the name in half a minute she was clambering round and round among some boulders as lost a donkey as you would wish to see  i should have camped long before had i been properly provided but as this was to be so short a stage i had brought no wine no bread for myself and little over a pound for my lady friend  add to this that i and modestine were both handsomely wetted by the showers  but now if i could have found some water i should have camped at once in spite of all  water however being entirely absent except in the form of rain i determined to return to fouzilhic and ask a guide a little farther on my waya little farther lend thy guiding hand  the thing was easy to decide hard to accomplish  in this sensible roaring blackness i was sure of nothing but the direction of the wind  to this i set my face the road had disappeared and i went across country now in marshy opens now baffled by walls unscalable to modestine until i came once more in sight of some red windows  this time they were differently disposed  it was not fouzilhic but fouzilhac a hamlet little distant from the other in space but worlds away in the spirit of its inhabitants  i tied modestine to a gate and groped forward stumbling among rocks plunging midleg in bog until i gained the entrance of the village  in the first lighted house there was a woman who would not open to me  she could do nothing she cried to me through the door being alone and lame but if i would apply at the next house there was a man who could help me if he had a mind  they came to the next door in force a man two women and a girl and brought a pair of lanterns to examine the wayfarer  the man was not ill looking but had a shifty smile  he leaned against the doorpost and heard me state my case  all i asked was a guide as far as cheylard  cest que voyezvous il fait noir said he  i told him that was just my reason for requiring help  i understand that said he looking uncomfortable maiscestde la peine  i was willing to pay i said  he shook his head  i rose as high as ten francs but he continued to shake his head  name your own price then said i  ce nest pas ca he said at length and with evident difficulty but i am not going to cross the doormais je ne sortirai pas de la porte  i grew a little warm and asked him what he proposed that i should do  where are you going beyond cheylard he asked by way of answer  that is no affair of yours i returned for i was not going to indulge his bestial curiosity it changes nothing in my present predicament  cest vrai ca he acknowledged with a laugh oui cest vrai  et dou venezvous  a better man than i might have felt nettled  oh said i i am not going to answer any of your questions so you may spare yourself the trouble of putting them  i am late enough already i want help  if you will not guide me yourself at least help me to find some one else who will  hold on he cried suddenly  was it not you who passed in the meadow while it was still day  yes yes said the girl whom i had not hitherto recognised it was monsieur i told him to follow the cow  as for you mademoiselle said i you are a farceuse  and added the man what the devil have you done to be still here  what the devil indeed  but there i was  the great thing said i is to make an end of it and once more proposed that he should help me to find a guide  cest que he said again cest queil fait noir  very well said i take one of your lanterns  no he cried drawing a thought backward and again intrenching himself behind one of his former phrases i will not cross the door  i looked at him  i saw unaffected terror struggling on his face with unaffected shame he was smiling pitifully and wetting his lip with his tongue like a detected schoolboy  i drew a brief picture of my state and asked him what i was to do  i dont know he said i will not cross the door  here was the beast of gevaudan and no mistake  sir said i with my most commanding manners you are a coward  and with that i turned my back upon the family party who hastened to retire within their fortifications and the famous door was closed again but not till i had overheard the sound of laughter  filia barbara pater barbarior  let me say it in the plural the beasts of gevaudan  the lanterns had somewhat dazzled me and i ploughed distressfully among stones and rubbishheaps  all the other houses in the village were both dark and silent and though i knocked at here and there a door my knocking was unanswered  it was a bad business i gave up fouzilhac with my curses  the rain had stopped and the wind which still kept rising began to dry my coat and trousers  very well thought i water or no water i must camp  but the first thing was to return to modestine  i am pretty sure i was twenty minutes groping for my lady in the dark and if it had not been for the unkindly services of the bog into which i once more stumbled i might have still been groping for her at the dawn my next business was to gain the shelter of a wood for the wind was cold as well as boisterous  how in this wellwooded district i should have been so long in finding one is another of the insoluble mysteries of this days adventures but i will take my oath that i put near an hour to the discovery  at last black trees began to show upon my left and suddenly crossing the road made a cave of unmitigated blackness right in front  i call it a cave without exaggeration to pass below that arch of leaves was like entering a dungeon  i felt about until my hand encountered a stout branch and to this i tied modestine a haggard drenched desponding donkey  then i lowered my pack laid it along the wall on the margin of the road and unbuckled the straps  i knew well enough where the lantern was but where were the candles  i groped and groped among the tumbled articles and while i was thus groping suddenly i touched the spirit lamp  salvation  this would serve my turn as well  the wind roared unwearyingly among the trees i could hear the boughs tossing and the leaves churning through half a mile of forest yet the scene of my encampment was not only as black as the pit but admirably sheltered  at the second match the wick caught flame  the light was both livid and shifting but it cut me off from the universe and doubled the darkness of the surrounding night  i tied modestine more conveniently for herself and broke up half the black bread for her supper reserving the other half against the morning then i gathered what i should want within reach took off my wet boots and gaiters which i wrapped in my waterproof arranged my knapsack for a pillow under the flap of my sleepingbag insinuated my limbs into the interior and buckled myself in like a bambino  i opened a tin of bologna sausage and broke a cake of chocolate and that was all i had to eat  it may sound offensive but i ate them together bite by bite by way of bread and meat  all i had to wash down this revolting mixture was neat brandy a revolting beverage in itself  but i was rare and hungry ate well and smoked one of the best cigarettes in my experience  then i put a stone in my straw hat pulled the flap of my fur cap over my neck and eyes put my revolver ready to my hand and snuggled well down among the sheepskins  i questioned at first if i were sleepy for i felt my heart beating faster than usual as if with an agreeable excitement to which my mind remained a stranger  but as soon as my eyelids touched that subtle glue leaped between them and they would no more come separate  the wind among the trees was my lullaby  sometimes it sounded for minutes together with a steady even rush not rising nor abating and again it would swell and burst like a great crashing breaker and the trees would patter me all over with big drops from the rain of the afternoon  night after night in my own bedroom in the country i have given ear to this perturbing concert of the wind among the woods but whether it was a difference in the trees or the lie of the ground or because i was myself outside and in the midst of it the fact remains that the wind sang to a different tune among these woods of gevaudan  i hearkened and hearkened and meanwhile sleep took gradual possession of my body and subdued my thoughts and senses but still my last waking effort was to listen and distinguish and my last conscious state was one of wonder at the foreign clamour in my ears  twice in the course of the dark hoursonce when a stone galled me underneath the sack and again when the poor patient modestine growing angry pawed and stamped upon the roadi was recalled for a brief while to consciousness and saw a star or two overhead and the lacelike edge of the foliage against the sky  when i awoke for the third time wednesday september 25th the world was flooded with a blue light the mother of the dawn  i saw the leaves labouring in the wind and the ribbon of the road and on turning my head there was modestine tied to a beech and standing half across the path in an attitude of inimitable patience  i closed my eyes again and set to thinking over the experience of the night  i was surprised to find how easy and pleasant it had been even in this tempestuous weather  the stone which annoyed me would not have been there had i not been forced to camp blindfold in the opaque night and i had felt no other inconvenience except when my feet encountered the lantern or the second volume of peyrats pastors of the desert among the mixed contents of my sleepingbag nay more i had felt not a touch of cold and awakened with unusually lightsome and clear sensations  with that i shook myself got once more into my boots and gaiters and breaking up the rest of the bread for modestine strolled about to see in what part of the world i had awakened  ulysses left on ithaca and with a mind unsettled by the goddess was not more pleasantly astray  i have been after an adventure all my life a pure dispassionate adventure such as befell early and heroic voyagers and thus to be found by morning in a random woodside nook in gevaudannot knowing north from south as strange to my surroundings as the first man upon the earth an inland castawaywas to find a fraction of my daydreams realised  i was on the skirts of a little wood of birch sprinkled with a few beeches behind it adjoined another wood of fir and in front it broke up and went down in open order into a shallow and meadowy dale  all around there were bare hilltops some near some far away as the perspective closed or opened but none apparently much higher than the rest  the wind huddled the trees  the golden specks of autumn in the birches tossed shiveringly  overhead the sky was full of strings and shreds of vapour flying vanishing reappearing and turning about an axis like tumblers as the wind hounded them through heaven  it was wild weather and famishing cold  i ate some chocolate swallowed a mouthful of brandy and smoked a cigarette before the cold should have time to disable my fingers  and by the time i had got all this done and had made my pack and bound it on the packsaddle the day was tiptoe on the threshold of the east  we had not gone many steps along the lane before the sun still invisible to me sent a glow of gold over some cloud mountains that lay ranged along the eastern sky  the wind had us on the stern and hurried us bitingly forward  i buttoned myself into my coat and walked on in a pleasant frame of mind with all men when suddenly at a corner there was fouzilhic once more in front of me  nor only that but there was the old gentleman who had escorted me so far the night before running out of his house at sight of me with hands upraised in horror  my poor boy he cried what does this mean  i told him what had happened  he beat his old hands like clappers in a mill to think how lightly he had let me go but when he heard of the man of fouzilhac anger and depression seized upon his mind  this time at least said he there shall be no mistake  and he limped along for he was very rheumatic for about half a mile and until i was almost within sight of cheylard the destination i had hunted for so long    cheylard and luc   candidly it seemed little worthy of all this searching  a few broken ends of village with no particular street but a succession of open places heaped with logs and fagots a couple of tilted crosses a shrine to our lady of all graces on the summit of a little hill and all this upon a rattling highland river in the corner of a naked valley  what went ye out for to see thought i to myself  but the place had a life of its own  i found a board commemorating the liberalities of cheylard for the past year hung up like a banner in the diminutive and tottering church  in 1877 it appeared the inhabitants subscribed fortyeight francs ten centimes for the work of the propagation of the faith  some of this i could not help hoping would be applied to my native land cheylard scrapes together halfpence for the darkened souls in edinburgh while balquhidder and dunrossness bemoan the ignorance of rome  thus to the high entertainment of the angels do we pelt each other with evangelists like schoolboys bickering in the snow  the inn was again singularly unpretentious  the whole furniture of a not illtodo family was in the kitchen the beds the cradle the clothes the platerack the mealchest and the photograph of the parish priest there were five children one of whom was set to its morning prayers at the stairfoot soon after my arrival and a sixth would ere long be forthcoming  i was kindly received by these good folk  they were much interested in my misadventure  the wood in which i had slept belonged to them the man of fouzilhac they thought a monster of iniquity and counselled me warmly to summon him at lawbecause i might have died the good wife was horrorstricken to see me drink over a pint of uncreamed milk  you will do yourself an evil she said  permit me to boil it for you  after i had begun the morning on this delightful liquor she having an infinity of things to arrange i was permitted nay requested to make a bowl of chocolate for myself  my boots and gaiters were hung up to dry and seeing me trying to write my journal on my knee the eldest daughter let down a hinged table in the chimneycorner for my convenience  here i wrote drank my chocolate and finally ate an omelette before i left  the table was thick with dust for as they explained it was not used except in winter weather  i had a clear look up the vent through brown agglomerations of soot and blue vapour to the sky and whenever a handful of twigs was thrown on to the fire my legs were scorched by the blaze  the husband had begun life as a muleteer and when i came to charge modestine showed himself full of the prudence of his art  you will have to change this package said he it ought to be in two parts and then you might have double the weight  i explained that i wanted no more weight and for no donkey hitherto created would i cut my sleepingbag in two  it fatigues her however said the innkeeper it fatigues her greatly on the march  look  alas there were her two forelegs no better than raw beef on the inside and blood was running from under her tail  they told me when i started and i was ready to believe it that before a few days i should come to love modestine like a dog  three days had passed we had shared some misadventures and my heart was still as cold as a potato towards my beast of burden  she was pretty enough to look at but then she had given proof of dead stupidity redeemed indeed by patience but aggravated by flashes of sorry and illjudged lightheartedness  and i own this new discovery seemed another point against her  what the devil was the good of a sheass if she could not carry a sleepingbag and a few necessaries  i saw the end of the fable rapidly approaching when i should have to carry modestine  aesop was the man to know the world  i assure you i set out with heavy thoughts upon my short days march  it was not only heavy thoughts about modestine that weighted me upon the way it was a leaden business altogether  for first the wind blew so rudely that i had to hold on the pack with one hand from cheylard to luc and second my road lay through one of the most beggarly countries in the world  it was like the worst of the scottish highlands only worse cold naked and ignoble scant of wood scant of heather scant of life a road and some fences broke the unvarying waste and the line of the road was marked by upright pillars to serve in time of snow  why any one should desire to visit either luc or cheylard is more than my muchinventing spirit can suppose  for my part i travel not to go anywhere but to go  i travel for travels sake  the great affair is to move to feel the needs and hitches of our life more nearly to come down off this featherbed of civilisation and find the globe granite underfoot and strewn with cutting flints  alas as we get up in life and are more preoccupied with our affairs even a holiday is a thing that must be worked for  to hold a pack upon a packsaddle against a gale out of the freezing north is no high industry but it is one that serves to occupy and compose the mind  and when the present is so exacting who can annoy himself about the future  i came out at length above the allier  a more unsightly prospect at this season of the year it would be hard to fancy  shelving hills rose round it on all sides here dabbled with wood and fields there rising to peaks alternately naked and hairy with pines  the colour throughout was black or ashen and came to a point in the ruins of the castle of luc which pricked up impudently from below my feet carrying on a pinnacle a tall white statue of our lady which i heard with interest weighed fifty quintals and was to be dedicated on the 6th of october  through this sorry landscape trickled the allier and a tributary of nearly equal size which came down to join it through a broad nude valley in vivarais  the weather had somewhat lightened and the clouds massed in squadron but the fierce wind still hunted them through heaven and cast great ungainly splashes of shadow and sunlight over the scene  luc itself was a straggling double file of houses wedged between hill and river  it had no beauty nor was there any notable feature save the old castle overhead with its fifty quintals of brandnew madonna  but the inn was clean and large  the kitchen with its two boxbeds hung with clean check curtains with its wide stone chimney its chimneyshelf four yards long and garnished with lanterns and religious statuettes its array of chests and pair of ticking clocks was the very model of what a kitchen ought to be a melodrama kitchen suitable for bandits or noblemen in disguise  nor was the scene disgraced by the landlady a handsome silent dark old woman clothed and hooded in black like a nun even the public bedroom had a character of its own with the long deal tables and benches where fifty might have dined set out as for a harvesthome and the three boxbeds along the wall  in one of these lying on straw and covered with a pair of tablenapkins did i do penance all night long in gooseflesh and chattering teeth and sigh from time to time as i awakened for my sheepskin sack and the lee of some great wood     our lady of the snows            i behold    the house the brotherhood austere    and what am i that i am here     matthew arnold    father apollinaris   next morning thursday 26th september i took the road in a new order the sack was no longer doubled but hung at full length across the saddle a green sausage six feet long with a tuft of blue wool hanging out of either end  it was more picturesque it spared the donkey and as i began to see it would ensure stability blow high blow low  but it was not without a pang that i had so decided  for although i had purchased a new cord and made all as fast as i was able i was yet jealously uneasy lest the flaps should tumble out and scatter my effects along the line of march  my way lay up the bald valley of the river along the march of vivarais and gevaudan  the hills of gevaudan on the right were a little more naked if anything than those of vivarais upon the left and the former had a monopoly of a low dotty underwood that grew thickly in the gorges and died out in solitary burrs upon the shoulders and the summits  black bricks of firwood were plastered here and there upon both sides and here and there were cultivated fields  a railway ran beside the river the only bit of railway in gevaudan although there are many proposals afoot and surveys being made and even as they tell me a station standing ready built in mende  a year or two hence and this may be another world  the desert is beleaguered  now may some languedocian wordsworth turn the sonnet into patois mountains and vales and floods heard ye that whistle  at a place called la bastide i was directed to leave the river and follow a road that mounted on the left among the hills of vivarais the modern ardeche for i was now come within a little way of my strange destination the trappist monastery of our lady of the snows  the sun came out as i left the shelter of a pinewood and i beheld suddenly a fine wild landscape to the south  high rocky hills as blue as sapphire closed the view and between these lay ridge upon ridge heathery craggy the sun glittering on veins of rock the underwood clambering in the hollows as rude as god made them at the first  there was not a sign of mans hand in all the prospect and indeed not a trace of his passage save where generation after generation had walked in twisted footpaths in and out among the beeches and up and down upon the channelled slopes the mists which had hitherto beset me were now broken into clouds and fled swiftly and shone brightly in the sun  i drew a long breath  it was grateful to come after so long upon a scene of some attraction for the human heart  i own i like definite form in what my eyes are to rest upon and if landscapes were sold like the sheets of characters of my boyhood one penny plain and twopence coloured i should go the length of twopence every day of my life  but if things had grown better to the south it was still desolate and inclement near at hand  a spidery cross on every hilltop marked the neighbourhood of a religious house and a quarter of a mile beyond the outlook southward opening out and growing bolder with every step a white statue of the virgin at the corner of a young plantation directed the traveller to our lady of the snows  here then i struck leftward and pursued my way driving my secular donkey before me and creaking in my secular boots and gaiters towards the asylum of silence  i had not gone very far ere the wind brought to me the clanging of a bell and somehow i can scarce tell why my heart sank within me at the sound  i have rarely approached anything with more unaffected terror than the monastery of our lady of the snows  this it is to have had a protestant education  and suddenly on turning a corner fear took hold on me from head to footslavish superstitious fear and though i did not stop in my advance yet i went on slowly like a man who should have passed a bourne unnoticed and strayed into the country of the dead  for there upon the narrow newmade road between the stripling pines was a mediaeval friar fighting with a barrowful of turfs  every sunday of my childhood i used to study the hermits of marco sadelerenchanting prints full of wood and field and mediaeval landscapes as large as a county for the imagination to go atravelling in and here sure enough was one of marco sadelers heroes  he was robed in white like any spectre and the hood falling back in the instancy of his contention with the barrow disclosed a pate as bald and yellow as a skull  he might have been buried any time these thousand years and all the lively parts of him resolved into earth and broken up with the farmers harrow  i was troubled besides in my mind as to etiquette  durst i address a person who was under a vow of silence  clearly not  but drawing near i doffed my cap to him with a faraway superstitious reverence  he nodded back and cheerfully addressed me  was i going to the monastery  who was i  an englishman  ah an irishman then  no i said a scotsman  a scotsman  ah he had never seen a scotsman before  and he looked me all over his good honest brawny countenance shining with interest as a boy might look upon a lion or an alligator  from him i learned with disgust that i could not be received at our lady of the snows i might get a meal perhaps but that was all  and then as our talk ran on and it turned out that i was not a pedlar but a literary man who drew landscapes and was going to write a book he changed his manner of thinking as to my reception for i fear they respect persons even in a trappist monastery and told me i must be sure to ask for the father prior and state my case to him in full  on second thoughts he determined to go down with me himself he thought he could manage for me better  might he say that i was a geographer  no i thought in the interests of truth he positively might not  very well then with disappointment an author  it appeared he had been in a seminary with six young irishmen all priests long since who had received newspapers and kept him informed of the state of ecclesiastical affairs in england  and he asked me eagerly after dr pusey for whose conversion the good man had continued ever since to pray night and morning  i thought he was very near the truth he said and he will reach it yet there is so much virtue in prayer  he must be a stiff ungodly protestant who can take anything but pleasure in this kind and hopeful story  while he was thus near the subject the good father asked me if i were a christian and when he found i was not or not after his way he glossed it over with great goodwill  the road which we were following and which this stalwart father had made with his own two hands within the space of a year came to a corner and showed us some white buildings a little farther on beyond the wood  at the same time the bell once more sounded abroad  we were hard upon the monastery  father apollinaris for that was my companions name stopped me  i must not speak to you down there he said  ask for the brother porter and all will be well  but try to see me as you go out again through the wood where i may speak to you  i am charmed to have made your acquaintance  and then suddenly raising his arms flapping his fingers and crying out twice i must not speak i must not speak he ran away in front of me and disappeared into the monastery door  i own this somewhat ghastly eccentricity went a good way to revive my terrors  but where one was so good and simple why should not all be alike  i took heart of grace and went forward to the gate as fast as modestine who seemed to have a disaffection for monasteries would permit  it was the first door in my acquaintance of her which she had not shown an indecent haste to enter  i summoned the place in form though with a quaking heart  father michael the father hospitaller and a pair of brownrobed brothers came to the gate and spoke with me a while  i think my sack was the great attraction it had already beguiled the heart of poor apollinaris who had charged me on my life to show it to the father prior  but whether it was my address or the sack or the idea speedily published among that part of the brotherhood who attend on strangers that i was not a pedlar after all i found no difficulty as to my reception  modestine was led away by a layman to the stables and i and my pack were received into our lady of the snows    the monks   father michael a pleasant freshfaced smiling man perhaps of thirty five took me to the pantry and gave me a glass of liqueur to stay me until dinner  we had some talk or rather i should say he listened to my prattle indulgently enough but with an abstracted air like a spirit with a thing of clay  and truly when i remember that i descanted principally on my appetite and that it must have been by that time more than eighteen hours since father michael had so much as broken bread i can well understand that he would find an earthly savour in my conversation  but his manner though superior was exquisitely gracious and i find i have a lurking curiosity as to father michaels past  the whet administered i was left alone for a little in the monastery garden  this is no more than the main court laid out in sandy paths and beds of particoloured dahlias and with a fountain and a black statue of the virgin in the centre  the buildings stand around it foursquare bleak as yet unseasoned by the years and weather and with no other features than a belfry and a pair of slated gables  brothers in white brothers in brown passed silently along the sanded alleys and when i first came out three hooded monks were kneeling on the terrace at their prayers  a naked hill commands the monastery upon one side and the wood commands it on the other  it lies exposed to wind the snow falls off and on from october to may and sometimes lies six weeks on end but if they stood in eden with a climate like heavens the buildings themselves would offer the same wintry and cheerless aspect and for my part on this wild september day before i was called to dinner i felt chilly in and out  when i had eaten well and heartily brother ambrose a hearty conversible frenchman for all those who wait on strangers have the liberty to speak led me to a little room in that part of the building which is set apart for mm les retraitants  it was clean and whitewashed and furnished with strict necessaries a crucifix a bust of the late pope the imitation in french a book of religious meditations and the life of elizabeth seton evangelist it would appear of north america and of new england in particular  as far as my experience goes there is a fair field for some more evangelisation in these quarters but think of cotton mather  i should like to give him a reading of this little work in heaven where i hope he dwells but perhaps he knows all that already and much more and perhaps he and mrs seton are the dearest friends and gladly unite their voices in the everlasting psalm  over the table to conclude the inventory of the room hung a set of regulations for mm les retraitants what services they should attend when they were to tell their beads or meditate and when they were to rise and go to rest  at the foot was a notable nb le temps libre est employe a lexamen de conscience a la confession a faire de bonnes resolutions etc  to make good resolutions indeed  you might talk as fruitfully of making the hair grow on your head  i had scarce explored my niche when brother ambrose returned  an english boarder it appeared would like to speak with me  i professed my willingness and the friar ushered in a fresh young little irishman of fifty a deacon of the church arrayed in strict canonicals and wearing on his head what in default of knowledge i can only call the ecclesiastical shako  he had lived seven years in retreat at a convent of nuns in belgium and now five at our lady of the snows he never saw an english newspaper he spoke french imperfectly and had he spoken it like a native there was not much chance of conversation where he dwelt with this he was a man eminently sociable greedy of news and simple minded like a child  if i was pleased to have a guide about the monastery he was no less delighted to see an english face and hear an english tongue  he showed me his own room where he passed his time among breviaries hebrew bibles and the waverley novels  thence he led me to the cloisters into the chapterhouse through the vestry where the brothers gowns and broad straw hats were hanging up each with his religious name upon a boardnames full of legendary suavity and interest such as basil hilarion raphael or pacifique into the library where were all the works of veuillot and chateaubriand and the odes et ballades if you please and even moliere to say nothing of innumerable fathers and a great variety of local and general historians thence my good irishman took me round the workshops where brothers bake bread and make cartwheels and take photographs where one superintends a collection of curiosities and another a gallery of rabbits  for in a trappist monastery each monk has an occupation of his own choice apart from his religious duties and the general labours of the house  each must sing in the choir if he has a voice and ear and join in the haymaking if he has a hand to stir but in his private hours although he must be occupied he may be occupied on what he likes  thus i was told that one brother was engaged with literature while father apollinaris busies himself in making roads and the abbot employs himself in binding books  it is not so long since this abbot was consecrated by the way and on that occasion by a special grace his mother was permitted to enter the chapel and witness the ceremony of consecration  a proud day for her to have a son a mitred abbot it makes you glad to think they let her in  in all these journeyings to and fro many silent fathers and brethren fell in our way  usually they paid no more regard to our passage than if we had been a cloud but sometimes the good deacon had a permission to ask of them and it was granted by a peculiar movement of the hands almost like that of a dogs paws in swimming or refused by the usual negative signs and in either case with lowered eyelids and a certain air of contrition as of a man who was steering very close to evil  the monks by special grace of their abbot were still taking two meals a day but it was already time for their grand fast which begins somewhere in september and lasts till easter and during which they eat but once in the twentyfour hours and that at two in the afternoon twelve hours after they have begun the toil and vigil of the day  their meals are scanty but even of these they eat sparingly and though each is allowed a small carafe of wine many refrain from this indulgence  without doubt the most of mankind grossly overeat themselves our meals serve not only for support but as a hearty and natural diversion from the labour of life  yet though excess may be hurtful i should have thought this trappist regimen defective  and i am astonished as i look back at the freshness of face and cheerfulness of manner of all whom i beheld  a happier nor a healthier company i should scarce suppose that i have ever seen  as a matter of fact on this bleak upland and with the incessant occupation of the monks life is of an uncertain tenure and death no infrequent visitor at our lady of the snows  this at least was what was told me  but if they die easily they must live healthily in the meantime for they seemed all firm of flesh and high in colour and the only morbid sign that i could observe an unusual brilliancy of eye was one that served rather to increase the general impression of vivacity and strength  those with whom i spoke were singularly sweettempered with what i can only call a holy cheerfulness in air and conversation  there is a note in the direction to visitors telling them not to be offended at the curt speech of those who wait upon them since it is proper to monks to speak little  the note might have been spared to a man the hospitallers were all brimming with innocent talk and in my experience of the monastery it was easier to begin than to break off a conversation  with the exception of father michael who was a man of the world they showed themselves full of kind and healthy interest in all sorts of subjectsin politics in voyages in my sleepingsackand not without a certain pleasure in the sound of their own voices  as for those who are restricted to silence i can only wonder how they bear their solemn and cheerless isolation  and yet apart from any view of mortification i can see a certain policy not only in the exclusion of women but in this vow of silence  i have had some experience of lay phalansteries of an artistic not to say a bacchanalian character and seen more than one association easily formed and yet more easily dispersed  with a cistercian rule perhaps they might have lasted longer  in the neighbourhood of women it is but a touchandgo association that can be formed among defenceless men the stronger electricity is sure to triumph the dreams of boyhood the schemes of youth are abandoned after an interview of ten minutes and the arts and sciences and professional male jollity deserted at once for two sweet eyes and a caressing accent  and next after this the tongue is the great divider  i am almost ashamed to pursue this worldly criticism of a religious rule but there is yet another point in which the trappist order appeals to me as a model of wisdom  by two in the morning the clapper goes upon the bell and so on hour by hour and sometimes quarter by quarter till eight the hour of rest so infinitesimally is the day divided among different occupations  the man who keeps rabbits for example hurries from his hutches to the chapel the chapterroom or the refectory all day long every hour he has an office to sing a duty to perform from two when he rises in the dark till eight when he returns to receive the comfortable gift of sleep he is upon his feet and occupied with manifold and changing business  i know many persons worth several thousands in the year who are not so fortunate in the disposal of their lives  into how many houses would not the note of the monastery bell dividing the day into manageable portions bring peace of mind and healthful activity of body  we speak of hardships but the true hardship is to be a dull fool and permitted to mismanage life in our own dull and foolish manner  from this point of view we may perhaps better understand the monks existence  a long novitiate and every proof of constancy of mind and strength of body is required before admission to the order but i could not find that many were discouraged  in the photographers studio which figures so strangely among the outbuildings my eye was attracted by the portrait of a young fellow in the uniform of a private of foot  this was one of the novices who came of the age for service and marched and drilled and mounted guard for the proper time among the garrison of algiers  here was a man who had surely seen both sides of life before deciding yet as soon as he was set free from service he returned to finish his novitiate  this austere rule entitles a man to heaven as by right  when the trappist sickens he quits not his habit he lies in the bed of death as he has prayed and laboured in his frugal and silent existence and when the liberator comes at the very moment even before they have carried him in his robe to lie his little last in the chapel among continual chantings joybells break forth as if for a marriage from the slated belfry and proclaim throughout the neighbourhood that another soul has gone to god  at night under the conduct of my kind irishman i took my place in the gallery to hear compline and salve regina with which the cistercians bring every day to a conclusion  there were none of those circumstances which strike the protestant as childish or as tawdry in the public offices of rome  a stern simplicity heightened by the romance of the surroundings spoke directly to the heart  i recall the whitewashed chapel the hooded figures in the choir the lights alternately occluded and revealed the strong manly singing the silence that ensued the sight of cowled heads bowed in prayer and then the clear trenchant beating of the bell breaking in to show that the last office was over and the hour of sleep had come and when i remember i am not surprised that i made my escape into the court with somewhat whirling fancies and stood like a man bewildered in the windy starry night  but i was weary and when i had quieted my spirits with elizabeth setons memoirsa dull workthe cold and the raving of the wind among the pines for my room was on that side of the monastery which adjoins the woods disposed me readily to slumber  i was wakened at black midnight as it seemed though it was really two in the morning by the first stroke upon the bell  all the brothers were then hurrying to the chapel the dead in life at this untimely hour were already beginning the uncomforted labours of their day  the dead in lifethere was a chill reflection and the words of a french song came back into my memory telling of the best of our mixed existence     que tas de belles filles          girofle          girofla    que tas de belles filles    lamour let comptera  and i blessed god that i was free to wander free to hope and free to love    the boarders   but there was another side to my residence at our lady of the snows  at this late season there were not many boarders and yet i was not alone in the public part of the monastery  this itself is hard by the gate with a small diningroom on the groundfloor and a whole corridor of cells similar to mine upstairs  i have stupidly forgotten the board for a regular retraitant but it was somewhere between three and five francs a day and i think most probably the first  chance visitors like myself might give what they chose as a freewill offering but nothing was demanded  i may mention that when i was going away father michael refused twenty francs as excessive  i explained the reasoning which led me to offer him so much but even then from a curious point of honour he would not accept it with his own hand  i have no right to refuse for the monastery he explained but i should prefer if you would give it to one of the brothers  i had dined alone because i arrived late but at supper i found two other guests  one was a country parish priest who had walked over that morning from the seat of his cure near mende to enjoy four days of solitude and prayer  he was a grenadier in person with the hale colour and circular wrinkles of a peasant and as he complained much of how he had been impeded by his skirts upon the march i have a vivid fancy portrait of him striding along upright bigboned with kilted cassock through the bleak hills of gevaudan  the other was a short grizzling thickset man from fortyfive to fifty dressed in tweed with a knitted spencer and the red ribbon of a decoration in his buttonhole  this last was a hard person to classify  he was an old soldier who had seen service and risen to the rank of commandant and he retained some of the brisk decisive manners of the camp  on the other hand as soon as his resignation was accepted he had come to our lady of the snows as a boarder and after a brief experience of its ways had decided to remain as a novice  already the new life was beginning to modify his appearance already he had acquired somewhat of the quiet and smiling air of the brethren and he was as yet neither an officer nor a trappist but partook of the character of each  and certainly here was a man in an interesting nick of life  out of the noise of cannon and trumpets he was in the act of passing into this still country bordering on the grave where men sleep nightly in their graveclothes and like phantoms communicate by signs  at supper we talked politics  i make it my business when i am in france to preach political goodwill and moderation and to dwell on the example of poland much as some alarmists in england dwell on the example of carthage  the priest and the commandant assured me of their sympathy with all i said and made a heavy sighing over the bitterness of contemporary feeling  why you cannot say anything to a man with which he does not absolutely agree said i but he flies up at you in a temper  they both declared that such a state of things was antichristian  while we were thus agreeing what should my tongue stumble upon but a word in praise of gambettas moderation  the old soldiers countenance was instantly suffused with blood with the palms of his hands he beat the table like a naughty child  comment monsieur he shouted  comment  gambetta moderate  will you dare to justify these words  but the priest had not forgotten the tenor of our talk  and suddenly in the height of his fury the old soldier found a warning look directed on his face the absurdity of his behaviour was brought home to him in a flash and the storm came to an abrupt end without another word  it was only in the morning over our coffee friday september 27th that this couple found out i was a heretic  i suppose i had misled them by some admiring expressions as to the monastic life around us and it was only by a pointblank question that the truth came out  i had been tolerantly used both by simple father apollinaris and astute father michael and the good irish deacon when he heard of my religious weakness had only patted me upon the shoulder and said you must be a catholic and come to heaven  but i was now among a different sect of orthodox  these two men were bitter and upright and narrow like the worst of scotsmen and indeed upon my heart i fancy they were worse the priest snorted aloud like a battlehorse  et vous pretendez mourir dans cette espece de croyance he demanded and there is no type used by mortal printers large enough to qualify his accent  i humbly indicated that i had no design of changing  but he could not away with such a monstrous attitude  no no he cried you must change  you have come here god has led you here and you must embrace the opportunity  i made a slip in policy i appealed to the family affections though i was speaking to a priest and a soldier two classes of men circumstantially divorced from the kind and homely ties of life  your father and mother cried the priest  very well you will convert them in their turn when you go home  i think i see my fathers face  i would rather tackle the gaetulian lion in his den than embark on such an enterprise against the family theologian  but now the hunt was up priest and soldier were in full cry for my conversion and the work of the propagation of the faith for which the people of cheylard subscribed fortyeight francs ten centimes during 1877 was being gallantly pursued against myself  it was an odd but most effective proselytising  they never sought to convince me in argument where i might have attempted some defence but took it for granted that i was both ashamed and terrified at my position and urged me solely on the point of time  now they said when god had led me to our lady of the snows now was the appointed hour  do not be withheld by false shame observed the priest for my encouragement  for one who feels very similarly to all sects of religion and who has never been able even for a moment to weigh seriously the merit of this or that creed on the eternal side of things however much he may see to praise or blame upon the secular and temporal side the situation thus created was both unfair and painful  i committed my second fault in tact and tried to plead that it was all the same thing in the end and we were all drawing near by different sides to the same kind and undiscriminating friend and father  that as it seems to lay spirits would be the only gospel worthy of the name  but different men think differently and this revolutionary aspiration brought down the priest with all the terrors of the law  he launched into harrowing details of hell  the damned he saidon the authority of a little book which he had read not a week before and which to add conviction to conviction he had fully intended to bring along with him in his pocketwere to occupy the same attitude through all eternity in the midst of dismal tortures  and as he thus expatiated he grew in nobility of aspect with his enthusiasm  as a result the pair concluded that i should seek out the prior since the abbot was from home and lay my case immediately before him  cest mon conseil comme ancien militaire observed the commandant et celui de monsieur comme pretre  oui added the cure sententiously nodding comme ancien militaireet comme pretre  at this moment whilst i was somewhat embarrassed how to answer in came one of the monks a little brown fellow as lively as a grig and with an italian accent who threw himself at once into the contention but in a milder and more persuasive vein as befitted one of these pleasant brethren  look at him he said  the rule was very hard he would have dearly liked to stay in his own country italyit was well known how beautiful it was the beautiful italy but then there were no trappists in italy and he had a soul to save and here he was  i am afraid i must be at bottom what a cheerful indian critic has dubbed me a faddling hedonist for this description of the brothers motives gave me somewhat of a shock  i should have preferred to think he had chosen the life for its own sake and not for ulterior purposes and this shows how profoundly i was out of sympathy with these good trappists even when i was doing my best to sympathise  but to the cure the argument seemed decisive  hear that he cried  and i have seen a marquis here a marquis a marquishe repeated the holy word three times overand other persons high in society and generals  and here at your side is this gentleman who has been so many years in armiesdecorated an old warrior  and here he is ready to dedicate himself to god  i was by this time so thoroughly embarrassed that i pled cold feet and made my escape from the apartment  it was a furious windy morning with a sky much cleared and long and potent intervals of sunshine and i wandered until dinner in the wild country towards the east sorely staggered and beaten upon by the gale but rewarded with some striking views  at dinner the work of the propagation of the faith was recommenced and on this occasion still more distastefully to me  the priest asked me many questions as to the contemptible faith of my fathers and received my replies with a kind of ecclesiastical titter  your sect he said once for i think you will admit it would be doing it too much honour to call it a religion  as you please monsieur said i  la parole est a vous  at length i grew annoyed beyond endurance and although he was on his own ground and what is more to the purpose an old man and so holding a claim upon my toleration i could not avoid a protest against this uncivil usage  he was sadly discountenanced  i assure you he said i have no inclination to laugh in my heart  i have no other feeling but interest in your soul  and there ended my conversion  honest man he was no dangerous deceiver but a country parson full of zeal and faith  long may he tread gevaudan with his kilted skirtsa man strong to walk and strong to comfort his parishioners in death  i daresay he would beat bravely through a snowstorm where his duty called him and it is not always the most faithful believer who makes the cunningest apostle    upper gevaudan continued      the bed was made the room was fit    by punctual eve the stars were lit    the air was still the water ran    no need there was for maid or man    when we put up my ass and i    at gods green caravanserai     old play    across the goulet   the wind fell during dinner and the sky remained clear so it was under better auspices that i loaded modestine before the monastery gate  my irish friend accompanied me so far on the way  as we came through the wood there was pere apollinaire hauling his barrow and he too quitted his labours to go with me for perhaps a hundred yards holding my hand between both of his in front of him  i parted first from one and then from the other with unfeigned regret but yet with the glee of the traveller who shakes off the dust of one stage before hurrying forth upon another  then modestine and i mounted the course of the allier which here led us back into gevaudan towards its sources in the forest of mercoire  it was but an inconsiderable burn before we left its guidance thence over a hill our way lay through a naked plateau until we reached chasserades at sundown  the company in the inn kitchen that night were all men employed in survey for one of the projected railways  they were intelligent and conversible and we decided the future of france over hot wine until the state of the clock frightened us to rest  there were four beds in the little upstairs room and we slept six  but i had a bed to myself and persuaded them to leave the window open  he bourgeois il est cinq heures was the cry that wakened me in the morning saturday september 28th  the room was full of a transparent darkness which dimly showed me the other three beds and the five different nightcaps on the pillows  but out of the window the dawn was growing ruddy in a long belt over the hilltops and day was about to flood the plateau  the hour was inspiriting and there seemed a promise of calm weather which was perfectly fulfilled  i was soon under way with modestine  the road lay for a while over the plateau and then descended through a precipitous village into the valley of the chassezac this stream ran among green meadows well hidden from the world by its steep banks the broom was in flower and here and there was a hamlet sending up its smoke  at last the path crossed the chassezac upon a bridge and forsaking this deep hollow set itself to cross the mountain of la goulet  it wound up through lestampes by upland fields and woods of beech and birch and with every corner brought me into an acquaintance with some new interest  even in the gully of the chassezac my ear had been struck by a noise like that of a great bass bell ringing at the distance of many miles but this as i continued to mount and draw nearer to it seemed to change in character and i found at length that it came from some one leading flocks afield to the note of a rural horn  the narrow street of lestampes stood full of sheep from wall to wallblack sheep and white bleating with one accord like the birds in spring and each one accompanying himself upon the sheepbell round his neck  it made a pathetic concert all in treble  a little higher and i passed a pair of men in a tree with pruninghooks and one of them was singing the music of a bourree  still further and when i was already threading the birches the crowing of cocks came cheerfully up to my ears and along with that the voice of a flute discoursing a deliberate and plaintive air from one of the upland villages  i pictured to myself some grizzled applecheeked country schoolmaster fluting in his bit of a garden in the clear autumn sunshine  all these beautiful and interesting sounds filled my heart with an unwonted expectation and it appeared to me that once past this range which i was mounting i should descend into the garden of the world  nor was i deceived for i was now done with rains and winds and a bleak country  the first part of my journey ended here and this was like an induction of sweet sounds into the other and more beautiful  there are other degrees of feyness as of punishment besides the capital and i was now led by my good spirits into an adventure which i relate in the interest of future donkeydrivers  the road zigzagged so widely on the hillside that i chose a short cut by map and compass and struck through the dwarf woods to catch the road again upon a higher level  it was my one serious conflict with modestine  she would none of my short cut she turned in my face she backed she reared she whom i had hitherto imagined to be dumb actually brayed with a loud hoarse flourish like a cock crowing for the dawn  i plied the goad with one hand with the other so steep was the ascent i had to hold on the pack saddle  halfadozen times she was nearly over backwards on the top of me halfadozen times from sheer weariness of spirit i was nearly giving it up and leading her down again to follow the road  but i took the thing as a wager and fought it through  i was surprised as i went on my way again by what appeared to be chill raindrops falling on my hand and more than once looked up in wonder at the cloudless sky  but it was only sweat which came dropping from my brow  over the summit of the goulet there was no marked roadonly upright stones posted from space to space to guide the drovers  the turf underfoot was springy and well scented  i had no company but a lark or two and met but one bullockcart between lestampes and bleymard  in front of me i saw a shallow valley and beyond that the range of the lozere sparsely wooded and well enough modelled in the flanks but straight and dull in outline  there was scarce a sign of culture only about bleymard the white highroad from villefort to mende traversed a range of meadows set with spiry poplars and sounding from side to side with the bells of flocks and herds    a night among the pines   from bleymard after dinner although it was already late i set out to scale a portion of the lozere  an illmarked stony droveroad guided me forward and i met nearly halfadozen bullockcarts descending from the woods each laden with a whole pinetree for the winters firing  at the top of the woods which do not climb very high upon this cold ridge i struck leftward by a path among the pines until i hit on a dell of green turf where a streamlet made a little spout over some stones to serve me for a watertap  in a more sacred or sequestered bower    nor nymph nor faunus haunted  the trees were not old but they grew thickly round the glade there was no outlook except northeastward upon distant hill tops or straight upward to the sky and the encampment felt secure and private like a room  by the time i had made my arrangements and fed modestine the day was already beginning to decline  i buckled myself to the knees into my sack and made a hearty meal and as soon as the sun went down i pulled my cap over my eyes and fell asleep  night is a dead monotonous period under a roof but in the open world it passes lightly with its stars and dews and perfumes and the hours are marked by changes in the face of nature  what seems a kind of temporal death to people choked between walls and curtains is only a light and living slumber to the man who sleeps afield  all night long he can hear nature breathing deeply and freely even as she takes her rest she turns and smiles and there is one stirring hour unknown to those who dwell in houses when a wakeful influence goes abroad over the sleeping hemisphere and all the outdoor world are on their feet  it is then that the cock first crows not this time to announce the dawn but like a cheerful watchman speeding the course of night  cattle awake on the meadows sheep break their fast on dewy hillsides and change to a new lair among the ferns and houseless men who have lain down with the fowls open their dim eyes and behold the beauty of the night  at what inaudible summons at what gentle touch of nature are all these sleepers thus recalled in the same hour to life  do the stars rain down an influence or do we share some thrill of mother earth below our resting bodies  even shepherds and old countryfolk who are the deepest read in these arcana have not a guess as to the means or purpose of this nightly resurrection  towards two in the morning they declare the thing takes place and neither know nor inquire further  and at least it is a pleasant incident  we are disturbed in our slumber only like the luxurious montaigne that we may the better and more sensibly relish it  we have a moment to look upon the stars  and there is a special pleasure for some minds in the reflection that we share the impulse with all outdoor creatures in our neighbourhood that we have escaped out of the bastille of civilisation and are become for the time being a mere kindly animal and a sheep of natures flock  when that hour came to me among the pines i wakened thirsty  my tin was standing by me half full of water  i emptied it at a draught and feeling broad awake after this internal cold aspersion sat upright to make a cigarette  the stars were clear coloured and jewellike but not frosty  a faint silvery vapour stood for the milky way  all around me the black firpoints stood upright and stockstill  by the whiteness of the packsaddle i could see modestine walking round and round at the length of her tether i could hear her steadily munching at the sward but there was not another sound save the indescribable quiet talk of the runnel over the stones  i lay lazily smoking and studying the colour of the sky as we call the void of space from where it showed a reddish grey behind the pines to where it showed a glossy blueblack between the stars  as if to be more like a pedlar i wear a silver ring  this i could see faintly shining as i raised or lowered the cigarette and at each whiff the inside of my hand was illuminated and became for a second the highest light in the landscape  a faint wind more like a moving coolness than a stream of air passed down the glade from time to time so that even in my great chamber the air was being renewed all night long  i thought with horror of the inn at chasserades and the congregated nightcaps with horror of the nocturnal prowesses of clerks and students of hot theatres and passkeys and close rooms  i have not often enjoyed a more serene possession of myself nor felt more independent of material aids  the outer world from which we cower into our houses seemed after all a gentle habitable place and night after night a mans bed it seemed was laid and waiting for him in the fields where god keeps an open house  i thought i had rediscovered one of those truths which are revealed to savages and hid from political economists at the least i had discovered a new pleasure for myself  and yet even while i was exulting in my solitude i became aware of a strange lack  i wished a companion to lie near me in the starlight silent and not moving but ever within touch  for there is a fellowship more quiet even than solitude and which rightly understood is solitude made perfect  and to live out of doors with the woman a man loves is of all lives the most complete and free  as i thus lay between content and longing a faint noise stole towards me through the pines  i thought at first it was the crowing of cocks or the barking of dogs at some very distant farm but steadily and gradually it took articulate shape in my ears until i became aware that a passenger was going by upon the highroad in the valley and singing loudly as he went  there was more of goodwill than grace in his performance but he trolled with ample lungs and the sound of his voice took hold upon the hillside and set the air shaking in the leafy glens  i have heard people passing by night in sleeping cities some of them sang one i remember played loudly on the bagpipes  i have heard the rattle of a cart or carriage spring up suddenly after hours of stillness and pass for some minutes within the range of my hearing as i lay abed there is a romance about all who are abroad in the black hours and with something of a thrill we try to guess their business  but here the romance was double first this glad passenger lit internally with wine who sent up his voice in music through the night and then i on the other hand buckled into my sack and smoking alone in the pinewoods between four and five thousand feet towards the stars  when i awoke again sunday 29th september many of the stars had disappeared only the stronger companions of the night still burned visibly overhead and away towards the east i saw a faint haze of light upon the horizon such as had been the milky way when i was last awake day was at hand  i lit my lantern and by its glowworm light put on my boots and gaiters then i broke up some bread for modestine filled my can at the watertap and lit my spiritlamp to boil myself some chocolate  the blue darkness lay long in the glade where i had so sweetly slumbered but soon there was a broad streak of orange melting into gold along the mountaintops of vivarais  a solemn glee possessed my mind at this gradual and lovely coming in of day  i heard the runnel with delight i looked round me for something beautiful and unexpected but the still black pinetrees the hollow glade the munching ass remained unchanged in figure  nothing had altered but the light and that indeed shed over all a spirit of life and of breathing peace and moved me to a strange exhilaration  i drank my waterchocolate which was hot if it was not rich and strolled here and there and up and down about the glade  while i was thus delaying a gush of steady wind as long as a heavy sigh poured direct out of the quarter of the morning  it was cold and set me sneezing  the trees near at hand tossed their black plumes in its passage and i could see the thin distant spires of pine along the edge of the hill rock slightly to and fro against the golden east  ten minutes after the sunlight spread at a gallop along the hillside scattering shadows and sparkles and the day had come completely  i hastened to prepare my pack and tackle the steep ascent that lay before me but i had something on my mind  it was only a fancy yet a fancy will sometimes be importunate  i had been most hospitably received and punctually served in my green caravanserai  the room was airy the water excellent and the dawn had called me to a moment  i say nothing of the tapestries or the inimitable ceiling nor yet of the view which i commanded from the windows but i felt i was in some ones debt for all this liberal entertainment  and so it pleased me in a halflaughing way to leave pieces of money on the turf as i went along until i had left enough for my nights lodging  i trust they did not fall to some rich and churlish drover     the country of the camisards      we travelled in the print of olden wars          yet all the land was green          and love we found and peace          where fire and war had been    they pass and smile the children of the sword          no more the sword they wield          and o how deep the corn          along the battlefield     w p bannatyne    across the lozere   the track that i had followed in the evening soon died out and i continued to follow over a bald turf ascent a row of stone pillars such as had conducted me across the goulet  it was already warm  i tied my jacket on the pack and walked in my knitted waistcoat  modestine herself was in high spirits and broke of her own accord for the first time in my experience into a jolting trot that set the oats swashing in the pocket of my coat  the view back upon the northern gevaudan extended with every step scarce a tree scarce a house appeared upon the fields of wild hill that ran north east and west all blue and gold in the haze and sunlight of the morning  a multitude of little birds kept sweeping and twittering about my path they perched on the stone pillars they pecked and strutted on the turf and i saw them circle in volleys in the blue air and show from time to time translucent flickering wings between the sun and me  almost from the first moment of my march a faint large noise like a distant surf had filled my ears  sometimes i was tempted to think it the voice of a neighbouring waterfall and sometimes a subjective result of the utter stillness of the hill  but as i continued to advance the noise increased and became like the hissing of an enormous teaurn and at the same time breaths of cool air began to reach me from the direction of the summit  at length i understood  it was blowing stiffly from the south upon the other slope of the lozere and every step that i took i was drawing nearer to the wind  although it had been long desired it was quite unexpectedly at last that my eyes rose above the summit  a step that seemed no way more decisive than many other steps that had preceded itand like stout cortez when with eagle eyes he stared on the pacific i took possession in my own name of a new quarter of the world  for behold instead of the gross turf rampart i had been mounting for so long a view into the hazy air of heaven and a land of intricate blue hills below my feet  the lozere lies nearly east and west cutting gevaudan into two unequal parts its highest point this pic de finiels on which i was then standing rises upwards of five thousand six hundred feet above the sea and in clear weather commands a view over all lower languedoc to the mediterranean sea  i have spoken with people who either pretended or believed that they had seen from the pic de finiels white ships sailing by montpellier and cette  behind was the upland northern country through which my way had lain peopled by a dull race without wood without much grandeur of hillform and famous in the past for little beside wolves but in front of me half veiled in sunny haze lay a new gevaudan rich picturesque illustrious for stirring events  speaking largely i was in the cevennes at monastier and during all my journey but there is a strict and local sense in which only this confused and shaggy country at my feet has any title to the name and in this sense the peasantry employ the word  these are the cevennes with an emphasis the cevennes of the cevennes  in that undecipherable labyrinth of hills a war of bandits a war of wild beasts raged for two years between the grand monarch with all his troops and marshals on the one hand and a few thousand protestant mountaineers upon the other  a hundred and eighty years ago the camisards held a station even on the lozere where i stood they had an organisation arsenals a military and religious hierarchy their affairs were the discourse of every coffeehouse in london england sent fleets in their support their leaders prophesied and murdered with colours and drums and the singing of old french psalms their bands sometimes affronted daylight marched before walled cities and dispersed the generals of the king and sometimes at night or in masquerade possessed themselves of strong castles and avenged treachery upon their allies and cruelty upon their foes  there a hundred and eighty years ago was the chivalrous roland count and lord roland generalissimo of the protestants in france grave silent imperious pockmarked exdragoon whom a lady followed in his wanderings out of love  there was cavalier a bakers apprentice with a genius for war elected brigadier of camisards at seventeen to die at fiftyfive the english governor of jersey  there again was castanet a partisan leader in a voluminous peruke and with a taste for controversial divinity  strange generals who moved apart to take counsel with the god of hosts and fled or offered battle set sentinels or slept in an unguarded camp as the spirit whispered to their hearts  and there to follow these and other leaders was the rank and file of prophets and disciples bold patient indefatigable hardy to run upon the mountains cheering their rough life with psalms eager to fight eager to pray listening devoutly to the oracles of brainsick children and mystically putting a grain of wheat among the pewter balls with which they charged their muskets  i had travelled hitherto through a dull district and in the track of nothing more notable than the childeating beast of gevaudan the napoleon bonaparte of wolves  but now i was to go down into the scene of a romantic chapteror better a romantic footnote in the history of the world  what was left of all this bygone dust and heroism  i was told that protestantism still survived in this head seat of protestant resistance so much the priest himself had told me in the monastery parlour  but i had yet to learn if it were a bare survival or a lively and generous tradition  again if in the northern cevennes the people are narrow in religious judgments and more filled with zeal than charity what was i to look for in this land of persecution and reprisalin a land where the tyranny of the church produced the camisard rebellion and the terror of the camisards threw the catholic peasantry into legalised revolt upon the other side so that camisard and florentin skulked for each others lives among the mountains  just on the brow of the hill where i paused to look before me the series of stone pillars came abruptly to an end and only a little below a sort of track appeared and began to go down a breakneck slope turning like a corkscrew as it went  it led into a valley between falling hills stubbly with rocks like a reaped field of corn and floored farther down with green meadows  i followed the track with precipitation the steepness of the slope the continual agile turning of the line of the descent and the old unwearied hope of finding something new in a new country all conspired to lend me wings  yet a little lower and a stream began collecting itself together out of many fountains and soon making a glad noise among the hills  sometimes it would cross the track in a bit of waterfall with a pool in which modestine refreshed her feet  the whole descent is like a dream to me so rapidly was it accomplished i had scarcely left the summit ere the valley had closed round my path and the sun beat upon me walking in a stagnant lowland atmosphere  the track became a road and went up and down in easy undulations  i passed cabin after cabin but all seemed deserted and i saw not a human creature nor heard any sound except that of the stream  i was however in a different country from the day before  the stony skeleton of the world was here vigorously displayed to sun and air  the slopes were steep and changeful  oaktrees clung along the hills well grown wealthy in leaf and touched by the autumn with strong and luminous colours  here and there another stream would fall in from the right or the left down a gorge of snowwhite and tumultuary boulders  the river in the bottom for it was rapidly growing a river collecting on all hands as it trotted on its way here foamed a while in desperate rapids and there lay in pools of the most enchanting seagreen shot with watery browns  as far as i have gone i have never seen a river of so changeful and delicate a hue crystal was not more clear the meadows were not by half so green and at every pool i saw i felt a thrill of longing to be out of these hot dusty and material garments and bathe my naked body in the mountain air and water  all the time as i went on i never forgot it was the sabbath the stillness was a perpetual reminder and i heard in spirit the churchbells clamouring all over europe and the psalms of a thousand churches  at length a human sound struck upon my eara cry strangely modulated between pathos and derision and looking across the valley i saw a little urchin sitting in a meadow with his hands about his knees and dwarfed to almost comical smallness by the distance  but the rogue had picked me out as i went down the road from oak wood on to oak wood driving modestine and he made me the compliments of the new country in this tremulous highpitched salutation  and as all noises are lovely and natural at a sufficient distance this also coming through so much clean hill air and crossing all the green valley sounded pleasant to my ear and seemed a thing rustic like the oaks or the river  a little after the stream that i was following fell into the tarn at pont de montvert of bloody memory    pont de montvert   one of the first things i encountered in pont de montvert was if i remember rightly the protestant temple but this was but the type of other novelties  a subtle atmosphere distinguishes a town in england from a town in france or even in scotland  at carlisle you can see you are in the one country at dumfries thirty miles away you are as sure that you are in the other  i should find it difficult to tell in what particulars pont de montvert differed from monastier or langogne or even bleymard but the difference existed and spoke eloquently to the eyes the place with its houses its lanes its glaring riverbed wore an indescribable air of the south  all was sunday bustle in the streets and in the publichouse as all had been sabbath peace among the mountains  there must have been near a score of us at dinner by eleven before noon and after i had eaten and drunken and sat writing up my journal i suppose as many more came dropping in one after another or by twos and threes  in crossing the lozere i had not only come among new natural features but moved into the territory of a different race  these people as they hurriedly despatched their viands in an intricate swordplay of knives questioned and answered me with a degree of intelligence which excelled all that i had met except among the railway folk at chasserades  they had open telling faces and were lively both in speech and manner  they not only entered thoroughly into the spirit of my little trip but more than one declared if he were rich enough he would like to set forth on such another  even physically there was a pleasant change  i had not seen a pretty woman since i left monastier and there but one  now of the three who sat down with me to dinner one was certainly not beautifula poor timid thing of forty quite troubled at this roaring table dhote whom i squired and helped to wine and pledged and tried generally to encourage with quite a contrary effect but the other two both married were both more handsome than the average of women  and clarisse  what shall i say of clarisse  she waited the table with a heavy placable nonchalance like a performing cow her great grey eyes were steeped in amorous languor her features although fleshy were of an original and accurate design her mouth had a curl her nostril spoke of dainty pride her cheek fell into strange and interesting lines  it was a face capable of strong emotion and with training it offered the promise of delicate sentiment  it seemed pitiful to see so good a model left to country admirers and a country way of thought  beauty should at least have touched society then in a moment it throws off a weight that lay upon it it becomes conscious of itself it puts on an elegance learns a gait and a carriage of the head and in a moment patet dea  before i left i assured clarisse of my hearty admiration  she took it like milk without embarrassment or wonder merely looking at me steadily with her great eyes and i own the result upon myself was some confusion  if clarisse could read english i should not dare to add that her figure was unworthy of her face  hers was a case for stays but that may perhaps grow better as she gets up in years  pont de montvert or greenhill bridge as we might say at home is a place memorable in the story of the camisards  it was here that the war broke out here that those southern covenanters slew their archbishop sharp  the persecution on the one hand the febrile enthusiasm on the other are almost equally difficult to understand in these quiet modern days and with our easy modern beliefs and disbeliefs  the protestants were one and all beside their right minds with zeal and sorrow  they were all prophets and prophetesses  children at the breast would exhort their parents to good works  a child of fifteen months at quissac spoke from its mothers arms agitated and sobbing distinctly and with a loud voice  marshal villars has seen a town where all the women seemed possessed by the devil and had trembling fits and uttered prophecies publicly upon the streets  a prophetess of vivarais was hanged at montpellier because blood flowed from her eyes and nose and she declared that she was weeping tears of blood for the misfortunes of the protestants  and it was not only women and children  stalwart dangerous fellows used to swing the sickle or to wield the forest axe were likewise shaken with strange paroxysms and spoke oracles with sobs and streaming tears  a persecution unsurpassed in violence had lasted near a score of years and this was the result upon the persecuted hanging burning breaking on the wheel had been in vain the dragoons had left their hoofmarks over all the countryside there were men rowing in the galleys and women pining in the prisons of the church and not a thought was changed in the heart of any upright protestant  now the head and forefront of the persecutionafter lamoignon de bavilefrancois de langlade du chayla pronounce cheila archpriest of the cevennes and inspector of missions in the same country had a house in which he sometimes dwelt in the town of pont de montvert  he was a conscientious person who seems to have been intended by nature for a pirate and now fiftyfive an age by which a man has learned all the moderation of which he is capable  a missionary in his youth in china he there suffered martyrdom was left for dead and only succoured and brought back to life by the charity of a pariah  we must suppose the pariah devoid of secondsight and not purposely malicious in this act such an experience it might be thought would have cured a man of the desire to persecute but the human spirit is a thing strangely put together and having been a christian martyr du chayla became a christian persecutor  the work of the propagation of the faith went roundly forward in his hands  his house in pont de montvert served him as a prison  there he closed the hands of his prisoners upon live coal and plucked out the hairs of their beards to convince them that they were deceived in their opinions  and yet had not he himself tried and proved the inefficacy of these carnal arguments among the buddhists in china  not only was life made intolerable in languedoc but flight was rigidly forbidden  one massip a muleteer and well acquainted with the mountain paths had already guided several troops of fugitives in safety to geneva and on him with another convoy consisting mostly of women dressed as men du chayla in an evil hour for himself laid his hands the sunday following there was a conventicle of protestants in the woods of altefage upon mount bouges where there stood up one seguierspirit seguier as his companions called hima woolcarder tall blackfaced and toothless but a man full of prophecy  he declared in the name of god that the time for submission had gone by and they must betake themselves to arms for the deliverance of their brethren and the destruction of the priests  the next night 24th july 1702 a sound disturbed the inspector of missions as he sat in his prisonhouse at pont de montvert the voices of many men upraised in psalmody drew nearer and nearer through the town  it was ten at night he had his court about him priests soldiers and servants to the number of twelve or fifteen and now dreading the insolence of a conventicle below his very windows he ordered forth his soldiers to report  but the psalmsingers were already at his door fifty strong led by the inspired seguier and breathing death  to their summons the archpriest made answer like a stout old persecutor and bade his garrison fire upon the mob  one camisard for according to some it was in this nights work that they came by the name fell at this discharge his comrades burst in the door with hatchets and a beam of wood overran the lower story of the house set free the prisoners and finding one of them in the vine a sort of scavengers daughter of the place and period redoubled in fury against du chayla and sought by repeated assaults to carry the upper floors  but he on his side had given absolution to his men and they bravely held the staircase  children of god cried the prophet hold your hands  let us burn the house with the priest and the satellites of baal  the fire caught readily  out of an upper window du chayla and his men lowered themselves into the garden by means of knotted sheets some escaped across the river under the bullets of the insurgents but the archpriest himself fell broke his thigh and could only crawl into the hedge  what were his reflections as this second martyrdom drew near  a poor brave besotted hateful man who had done his duty resolutely according to his light both in the cevennes and china  he found at least one telling word to say in his defence for when the roof fell in and the upbursting flames discovered his retreat and they came and dragged him to the public place of the town raging and calling him damnedif i be damned said he why should you also damn yourselves  here was a good reason for the last but in the course of his inspectorship he had given many stronger which all told in a contrary direction and these he was now to hear  one by one seguier first the camisards drew near and stabbed him  this they said is for my father broken on the wheel  this for my brother in the galleys  that for my mother or my sister imprisoned in your cursed convents  each gave his blow and his reason and then all kneeled and sang psalms around the body till the dawn  with the dawn still singing they defiled away towards frugeres farther up the tarn to pursue the work of vengeance leaving du chaylas prisonhouse in ruins and his body pierced with two andfifty wounds upon the public place  tis a wild nights work with its accompaniment of psalms and it seems as if a psalm must always have a sound of threatening in that town upon the tarn  but the story does not end even so far as concerns pont de montvert with the departure of the camisards  the career of seguier was brief and bloody  two more priests and a whole family at ladeveze from the father to the servants fell by his hand or by his orders and yet he was but a day or two at large and restrained all the time by the presence of the soldiery  taken at length by a famous soldier of fortune captain poul he appeared unmoved before his judges  your name they asked  pierre seguier  why are you called spirit  because the spirit of the lord is with me  your domicile  lately in the desert and soon in heaven  have you no remorse for your crimes  i have committed none  my soul is like a garden full of shelter and of fountains  at pont de montvert on the 12th of august he had his right hand stricken from his body and was burned alive  and his soul was like a garden  so perhaps was the soul of du chayla the christian martyr  and perhaps if you could read in my soul or i could read in yours our own composure might seem little less surprising  du chaylas house still stands with a new roof beside one of the bridges of the town and if you are curious you may see the terracegarden into which he dropped    in the valley of the tarn   a new road leads from pont de montvert to florac by the valley of the tarn a smooth sandy ledge it runs about halfway between the summit of the cliffs and the river in the bottom of the valley and i went in and out as i followed it from bays of shadow into promontories of afternoon sun  this was a pass like that of killiecrankie a deep turning gully in the hills with the tarn making a wonderful hoarse uproar far below and craggy summits standing in the sunshine high above  a thin fringe of ash trees ran about the hilltops like ivy on a ruin but on the lower slopes and far up every glen the spanish chestnuttrees stood each four square to heaven under its tented foliage  some were planted each on its own terrace no larger than a bed some trusting in their roots found strength to grow and prosper and be straight and large upon the rapid slopes of the valley others where there was a margin to the river stood marshalled in a line and mighty like cedars of lebanon  yet even where they grew most thickly they were not to be thought of as a wood but as a herd of stalwart individuals and the dome of each tree stood forth separate and large and as it were a little hill from among the domes of its companions  they gave forth a faint sweet perfume which pervaded the air of the afternoon autumn had put tints of gold and tarnish in the green and the sun so shone through and kindled the broad foliage that each chestnut was relieved against another not in shadow but in light  a humble sketcher here laid down his pencil in despair  i wish i could convey a notion of the growth of these noble trees of how they strike out boughs like the oak and trail sprays of drooping foliage like the willow of how they stand on upright fluted columns like the pillars of a church or like the olive from the most shattered bole can put out smooth and youthful shoots and begin a new life upon the ruins of the old  thus they partake of the nature of many different trees and even their prickly topknots seen near at hand against the sky have a certain palmlike air that impresses the imagination  but their individuality although compounded of so many elements is but the richer and the more original  and to look down upon a level filled with these knolls of foliage or to see a clan of old unconquerable chestnuts cluster like herded elephants upon the spur of a mountain is to rise to higher thoughts of the powers that are in nature  between modestines laggard humour and the beauty of the scene we made little progress all that afternoon and at last finding the sun although still far from setting was already beginning to desert the narrow valley of the tarn i began to cast about for a place to camp in  this was not easy to find the terraces were too narrow and the ground where it was unterraced was usually too steep for a man to lie upon  i should have slipped all night and awakened towards morning with my feet or my head in the river  after perhaps a mile i saw some sixty feet above the road a little plateau large enough to hold my sack and securely parapeted by the trunk of an aged and enormous chestnut  thither with infinite trouble i goaded and kicked the reluctant modestine and there i hastened to unload her  there was only room for myself upon the plateau and i had to go nearly as high again before i found so much as standingroom for the ass it was on a heap of rolling stones on an artificial terrace certainly not five feet square in all  here i tied her to a chestnut and having given her corn and bread and made a pile of chestnutleaves of which i found her greedy i descended once more to my own encampment  the position was unpleasantly exposed  one or two carts went by upon the road and as long as daylight lasted i concealed myself for all the world like a hunted camisard behind my fortification of vast chestnut trunk for i was passionately afraid of discovery and the visit of jocular persons in the night  moreover i saw that i must be early awake for these chestnut gardens had been the scene of industry no further gone than on the day before  the slope was strewn with lopped branches and here and there a great package of leaves was propped against a trunk for even the leaves are serviceable and the peasants use them in winter by way of fodder for their animals  i picked a meal in fear and trembling half lying down to hide myself from the road and i daresay i was as much concerned as if i had been a scout from joanis band above upon the lozere or from salomons across the tarn in the old times of psalmsinging and blood  or indeed perhaps more for the camisards had a remarkable confidence in god and a tale comes back into my memory of how the count of gevaudan riding with a party of dragoons and a notary at his saddlebow to enforce the oath of fidelity in all the country hamlets entered a valley in the woods and found cavalier and his men at dinner gaily seated on the grass and their hats crowned with boxtree garlands while fifteen women washed their linen in the stream such was a field festival in 1703 at that date antony watteau would be painting similar subjects  this was a very different camp from that of the night before in the cool and silent pinewoods  it was warm and even stifling in the valley  the shrill song of frogs like the tremolo note of a whistle with a pea in it rang up from the riverside before the sun was down  in the growing dusk faint rustlings began to run to and fro among the fallen leaves from time to time a faint chirping or cheeping noise would fall upon my ear and from time to time i thought i could see the movement of something swift and indistinct between the chestnuts  a profusion of large ants swarmed upon the ground bats whisked by and mosquitoes droned overhead  the long boughs with their bunches of leaves hung against the sky like garlands and those immediately above and around me had somewhat the air of a trellis which should have been wrecked and half overthrown in a gale of wind  sleep for a long time fled my eyelids and just as i was beginning to feel quiet stealing over my limbs and settling densely on my mind a noise at my head startled me broad awake again and i will frankly confess it brought my heart into my mouth  it was such a noise as a person would make scratching loudly with a fingernail it came from under the knapsack which served me for a pillow and it was thrice repeated before i had time to sit up and turn about  nothing was to be seen nothing more was to be heard but a few of these mysterious rustlings far and near and the ceaseless accompaniment of the river and the frogs  i learned next day that the chestnut gardens are infested by rats rustling chirping and scraping were probably all due to these but the puzzle for the moment was insoluble and i had to compose myself for sleep as best i could in wondering uncertainty about my neighbours  i was wakened in the grey of the morning monday 30th september by the sound of footsteps not far off upon the stones and opening my eyes i beheld a peasant going by among the chestnuts by a footpath that i had not hitherto observed  he turned his head neither to the right nor to the left and disappeared in a few strides among the foliage  here was an escape  but it was plainly more than time to be moving  the peasantry were abroad scarce less terrible to me in my nondescript position than the soldiers of captain poul to an undaunted camisard  i fed modestine with what haste i could but as i was returning to my sack i saw a man and a boy come down the hillside in a direction crossing mine  they unintelligibly hailed me and i replied with inarticulate but cheerful sounds and hurried forward to get into my gaiters  the pair who seemed to be father and son came slowly up to the plateau and stood close beside me for some time in silence  the bed was open and i saw with regret my revolver lying patently disclosed on the blue wool  at last after they had looked me all over and the silence had grown laughably embarrassing the man demanded in what seemed unfriendly tones  you have slept here  yes said i  as you see  why he asked  my faith i answered lightly i was tired  he next inquired where i was going and what i had had for dinner and then without the least transition cest bien he added come along and he and his son without another word turned off to the next chestnut tree but one which they set to pruning  the thing had passed of more simply than i hoped  he was a grave respectable man and his unfriendly voice did not imply that he thought he was speaking to a criminal but merely to an inferior  i was soon on the road nibbling a cake of chocolate and seriously occupied with a case of conscience  was i to pay for my nights lodging i had slept ill the bed was full of fleas in the shape of ants there was no water in the room the very dawn had neglected to call me in the morning  i might have missed a train had there been any in the neighbourhood to catch  clearly i was dissatisfied with my entertainment and i decided i should not pay unless i met a beggar  the valley looked even lovelier by morning and soon the road descended to the level of the river  here in a place where many straight and prosperous chestnuts stood together making an aisle upon a swarded terrace i made my morning toilette in the water of the tarn  it was marvellously clear thrillingly cool the soapsuds disappeared as if by magic in the swift current and the white boulders gave one a model for cleanliness  to wash in one of gods rivers in the open air seems to me a sort of cheerful solemnity or semipagan act of worship  to dabble among dishes in a bedroom may perhaps make clean the body but the imagination takes no share in such a cleansing  i went on with a light and peaceful heart and sang psalms to the spiritual ear as i advanced  suddenly up came an old woman who pointblank demanded alms  good thought i here comes the waiter with the bill  and i paid for my nights lodging on the spot  take it how you please but this was the first and the last beggar that i met with during all my tour  a step or two farther i was overtaken by an old man in a brown nightcap cleareyed weatherbeaten with a faint excited smile  a little girl followed him driving two sheep and a goat but she kept in our wake while the old man walked beside me and talked about the morning and the valley  it was not much past six and for healthy people who have slept enough that is an hour of expansion and of open and trustful talk  connaissezvous le seigneur he said at length  i asked him what seigneur he meant but he only repeated the question with more emphasis and a look in his eyes denoting hope and interest  ah said i pointing upwards i understand you now  yes i know him he is the best of acquaintances  the old man said he was delighted  hold he added striking his bosom it makes me happy here  there were a few who knew the lord in these valleys he went on to tell me not many but a few  many are called he quoted and few chosen  my father said i it is not easy to say who know the lord and it is none of our business  protestants and catholics and even those who worship stones may know him and be known by him for he has made all  i did not know i was so good a preacher  the old man assured me he thought as i did and repeated his expressions of pleasure at meeting me  we are so few he said  they call us moravians here but down in the department of gard where there are also a good number they are called derbists after an english pastor  i began to understand that i was figuring in questionable taste as a member of some sect to me unknown but i was more pleased with the pleasure of my companion than embarrassed by my own equivocal position indeed i can see no dishonesty in not avowing a difference and especially in these high matters where we have all a sufficient assurance that whoever may be in the wrong we ourselves are not completely in the right  the truth is much talked about but this old man in a brown nightcap showed himself so simple sweet and friendly that i am not unwilling to profess myself his convert  he was as a matter of fact a plymouth brother  of what that involves in the way of doctrine i have no idea nor the time to inform myself but i know right well that we are all embarked upon a troublesome world the children of one father striving in many essential points to do and to become the same  and although it was somewhat in a mistake that he shook hands with me so often and showed himself so ready to receive my words that was a mistake of the truthfinding sort  for charity begins blindfold and only through a series of similar misapprehensions rises at length into a settled principle of love and patience and a firm belief in all our fellowmen  if i deceived this good old man in the like manner i would willingly go on to deceive others  and if ever at length out of our separate and sad ways we should all come together into one common house i have a hope to which i cling dearly that my mountain plymouth brother will hasten to shake hands with me again  thus talking like christian and faithful by the way he and i came down upon a hamlet by the tarn  it was but a humble place called la vernede with less than a dozen houses and a protestant chapel on a knoll  here he dwelt and here at the inn i ordered my breakfast  the inn was kept by an agreeable young man a stonebreaker on the road and his sister a pretty and engaging girl  the village schoolmaster dropped in to speak with the stranger  and these were all protestantsa fact which pleased me more than i should have expected and what pleased me still more they seemed all upright and simple people  the plymouth brother hung round me with a sort of yearning interest and returned at least thrice to make sure i was enjoying my meal  his behaviour touched me deeply at the time and even now moves me in recollection  he feared to intrude but he would not willingly forego one moment of my society and he seemed never weary of shaking me by the hand  when all the rest had drifted off to their days work i sat for near half an hour with the young mistress of the house who talked pleasantly over her seam of the chestnut harvest and the beauties of the tarn and old family affections broken up when young folk go from home yet still subsisting  hers i am sure was a sweet nature with a country plainness and much delicacy underneath and he who takes her to his heart will doubtless be a fortunate young man  the valley below la vernede pleased me more and more as i went forward now the hills approached from either hand naked and crumbling and walled in the river between cliffs and now the valley widened and became green  the road led me past the old castle of miral on a steep past a battlemented monastery long since broken up and turned into a church and parsonage and past a cluster of black roofs the village of cocures sitting among vineyards and meadows and orchards thick with red apples and where along the highway they were knocking down walnuts from the roadside trees and gathering them in sacks and baskets  the hills however much the vale might open were still tall and bare with cliffy battlements and here and there a pointed summit and the tarn still rattled through the stones with a mountain noise  i had been led by bagmen of a picturesque turn of mind to expect a horrific country after the heart of byron but to my scottish eyes it seemed smiling and plentiful as the weather still gave an impression of high summer to my scottish body although the chestnuts were already picked out by the autumn and the poplars that here began to mingle with them had turned into pale gold against the approach of winter  there was something in this landscape smiling although wild that explained to me the spirit of the southern covenanters  those who took to the hills for conscience sake in scotland had all gloomy and bedevilled thoughts for once that they received gods comfort they would be twice engaged with satan but the camisards had only bright and supporting visions  they dealt much more in blood both given and taken yet i find no obsession of the evil one in their records  with a light conscience they pursued their life in these rough times and circumstances  the soul of seguier let us not forget was like a garden  they knew they were on gods side with a knowledge that has no parallel among the scots for the scots although they might be certain of the cause could never rest confident of the person  we flew says one old camisard when we heard the sound of psalmsinging we flew as if with wings  we felt within us an animating ardour a transporting desire  the feeling cannot be expressed in words it is a thing that must have been experienced to be understood  however weary we might be we thought no more of our weariness and grew light so soon as the psalms fell upon our ears  the valley of the tarn and the people whom i met at la vernede not only explain to me this passage but the twenty years of suffering which those who were so stiff and so bloody when once they betook themselves to war endured with the meekness of children and the constancy of saints and peasants    florac   on a branch of the tarn stands florac the seat of a subprefecture with an old castle an alley of planes many quaint streetcorners and a live fountain welling from the hill  it is notable besides for handsome women and as one of the two capitals alais being the other of the country of the camisards  the landlord of the inn took me after i had eaten to an adjoining cafe where i or rather my journey became the topic of the afternoon  every one had some suggestion for my guidance and the subprefectorial map was fetched from the subprefecture itself and much thumbed among coffee cups and glasses of liqueur  most of these kind advisers were protestant though i observed that protestant and catholic intermingled in a very easy manner and it surprised me to see what a lively memory still subsisted of the religious war  among the hills of the southwest by mauchline cumnock or carsphairn in isolated farms or in the manse serious presbyterian people still recall the days of the great persecution and the graves of local martyrs are still piously regarded but in towns and among the socalled better classes i fear that these old doings have become an idle tale  if you met a mixed company in the kings arms at wigton it is not likely that the talk would run on covenanters  nay at muirkirk of glenluce i found the beadles wife had not so much as heard of prophet peden  but these cevenols were proud of their ancestors in quite another sense the war was their chosen topic its exploits were their own patent of nobility and where a man or a race has had but one adventure and that heroic we must expect and pardon some prolixity of reference  they told me the country was still full of legends hitherto uncollected i heard from them about cavaliers descendantsnot direct descendants be it understood but only cousins or nephewswho were still prosperous people in the scene of the boygenerals exploits and one farmer had seen the bones of old combatants dug up into the air of an afternoon in the nineteenth century in a field where the ancestors had fought and the greatgrandchildren were peaceably ditching  later in the day one of the protestant pastors was so good as to visit me a young man intelligent and polite with whom i passed an hour or two in talk  florac he told me is part protestant part catholic and the difference in religion is usually doubled by a difference in politics  you may judge of my surprise coming as i did from such a babbling purgatorial poland of a place as monastier when i learned that the population lived together on very quiet terms and there was even an exchange of hospitalities between households thus doubly separated  black camisard and white camisard militiaman and miquelet and dragoon protestant prophet and catholic cadet of the white cross they had all been sabring and shooting burning pillaging and murdering their hearts hot with indignant passion and here after a hundred and seventy years protestant is still protestant catholic still catholic in mutual toleration and mild amity of life  but the race of man like that indomitable nature whence it sprang has medicating virtues of its own the years and seasons bring various harvests the sun returns after the rain and mankind outlives secular animosities as a single man awakens from the passions of a day  we judge our ancestors from a more divine position and the dust being a little laid with several centuries we can see both sides adorned with human virtues and fighting with a show of right  i have never thought it easy to be just and find it daily even harder than i thought  i own i met these protestants with a delight and a sense of coming home  i was accustomed to speak their language in another and deeper sense of the word than that which distinguishes between french and english for the true babel is a divergence upon morals  and hence i could hold more free communication with the protestants and judge them more justly than the catholics  father apollinaris may pair off with my mountain plymouth brother as two guileless and devout old men yet i ask myself if i had as ready a feeling for the virtues of the trappist or had i been a catholic if i should have felt so warmly to the dissenter of la vernede  with the first i was on terms of mere forbearance but with the other although only on a misunderstanding and by keeping on selected points it was still possible to hold converse and exchange some honest thoughts  in this world of imperfection we gladly welcome even partial intimacies  and if we find but one to whom we can speak out of our heart freely with whom we can walk in love and simplicity without dissimulation we have no ground of quarrel with the world or god    in the valley of the mimente   on tuesday 1st october we left florac late in the afternoon a tired donkey and tired donkeydriver  a little way up the tarnon a covered bridge of wood introduced us into the valley of the mimente  steep rocky red mountains overhung the stream great oaks and chestnuts grew upon the slopes or in stony terraces here and there was a red field of millet or a few appletrees studded with red apples and the road passed hard by two black hamlets one with an old castle atop to please the heart of the tourist  it was difficult here again to find a spot fit for my encampment  even under the oaks and chestnuts the ground had not only a very rapid slope but was heaped with loose stones and where there was no timber the hills descended to the stream in a red precipice tufted with heather  the sun had left the highest peak in front of me and the valley was full of the lowing sound of herdsmens horns as they recalled the flocks into the stable when i spied a bight of meadow some way below the roadway in an angle of the river  thither i descended and tying modestine provisionally to a tree proceeded to investigate the neighbourhood  a grey pearly evening shadow filled the glen objects at a little distance grew indistinct and melted bafflingly into each other and the darkness was rising steadily like an exhalation  i approached a great oak which grew in the meadow hard by the rivers brink when to my disgust the voices of children fell upon my ear and i beheld a house round the angle on the other bank  i had half a mind to pack and be gone again but the growing darkness moved me to remain  i had only to make no noise until the night was fairly come and trust to the dawn to call me early in the morning  but it was hard to be annoyed by neighbours in such a great hotel  a hollow underneath the oak was my bed  before i had fed modestine and arranged my sack three stars were already brightly shining and the others were beginning dimly to appear  i slipped down to the river which looked very black among its rocks to fill my can and dined with a good appetite in the dark for i scrupled to light a lantern while so near a house  the moon which i had seen a pallid crescent all afternoon faintly illuminated the summit of the hills but not a ray fell into the bottom of the glen where i was lying  the oak rose before me like a pillar of darkness and overhead the heartsome stars were set in the face of the night  no one knows the stars who has not slept as the french happily put it a la belle etoile  he may know all their names and distances and magnitudes and yet be ignorant of what alone concerns mankindtheir serene and gladsome influence on the mind  the greater part of poetry is about the stars and very justly for they are themselves the most classical of poets  these same faraway worlds sprinkled like tapers or shaken together like a diamond dust upon the sky had looked not otherwise to roland or cavalier when in the words of the latter they had no other tent but the sky and no other bed than my mother earth  all night a strong wind blew up the valley and the acorns fell pattering over me from the oak  yet on this first night of october the air was as mild as may and i slept with the fur thrown back  i was much disturbed by the barking of a dog an animal that i fear more than any wolf  a dog is vastly braver and is besides supported by the sense of duty  if you kill a wolf you meet with encouragement and praise but if you kill a dog the sacred rights of property and the domestic affections come clamouring round you for redress  at the end of a fagging day the sharp cruel note of a dogs bark is in itself a keen annoyance and to a tramp like myself he represents the sedentary and respectable world in its most hostile form  there is something of the clergyman or the lawyer about this engaging animal and if he were not amenable to stones the boldest man would shrink from travelling afoot  i respect dogs much in the domestic circle but on the highway or sleeping afield i both detest and fear them  i was wakened next morning wednesday october 2nd by the same dogfor i knew his barkmaking a charge down the bank and then seeing me sit up retreating again with great alacrity  the stars were not yet quite extinguished  the heaven was of that enchanting mild greyblue of the early morn  a still clear light began to fall and the trees on the hillside were outlined sharply against the sky  the wind had veered more to the north and no longer reached me in the glen but as i was going on with my preparations it drove a white cloud very swiftly over the hill top and looking up i was surprised to see the cloud dyed with gold  in these high regions of the air the sun was already shining as at noon  if only the clouds travelled high enough we should see the same thing all night long  for it is always daylight in the fields of space  as i began to go up the valley a draught of wind came down it out of the seat of the sunrise although the clouds continued to run overhead in an almost contrary direction  a few steps farther and i saw a whole hillside gilded with the sun and still a little beyond between two peaks a centre of dazzling brilliancy appeared floating in the sky and i was once more face to face with the big bonfire that occupies the kernel of our system  i met but one human being that forenoon a dark militarylooking wayfarer who carried a gamebag on a baldric but he made a remark that seems worthy of record  for when i asked him if he were protestant or catholic  oh said he i make no shame of my religion  i am a catholic  he made no shame of it  the phrase is a piece of natural statistics for it is the language of one in a minority  i thought with a smile of bavile and his dragoons and how you may ride roughshod over a religion for a century and leave it only the more lively for the friction ireland is still catholic the cevennes still protestant  it is not a basketful of lawpapers nor the hoofs and pistolbutts of a regiment of horse that can change one tittle of a ploughmans thoughts  outdoor rustic people have not many ideas but such as they have are hardy plants and thrive flourishingly in persecution  one who has grown a long while in the sweat of laborious noons and under the stars at night a frequenter of hills and forests an old honest countryman has in the end a sense of communion with the powers of the universe and amicable relations towards his god  like my mountain plymouth brother he knows the lord  his religion does not repose upon a choice of logic it is the poetry of the mans experience the philosophy of the history of his life  god like a great power like a great shining sun has appeared to this simple fellow in the course of years and become the ground and essence of his least reflections and you may change creeds and dogmas by authority or proclaim a new religion with the sound of trumpets if you will but here is a man who has his own thoughts and will stubbornly adhere to them in good and evil  he is a catholic a protestant or a plymouth brother in the same indefeasible sense that a man is not a woman or a woman not a man  for he could not vary from his faith unless he could eradicate all memory of the past and in a strict and not a conventional meaning change his mind    the heart of the country   i was now drawing near to cassagnas a cluster of black roofs upon the hillside in this wild valley among chestnut gardens and looked upon in the clear air by many rocky peaks  the road along the mimente is yet new nor have the mountaineers recovered their surprise when the first cart arrived at cassagnas  but although it lay thus apart from the current of mens business this hamlet had already made a figure in the history of france  hard by in caverns of the mountain was one of the five arsenals of the camisards where they laid up clothes and corn and arms against necessity forged bayonets and sabres and made themselves gunpowder with willow charcoal and saltpetre boiled in kettles  to the same caves amid this multifarious industry the sick and wounded were brought up to heal and there they were visited by the two surgeons chabrier and tavan and secretly nursed by women of the neighbourhood  of the five legions into which the camisards were divided it was the oldest and the most obscure that had its magazines by cassagnas  this was the band of spirit seguier men who had joined their voices with his in the 68th psalm as they marched down by night on the archpriest of the cevennes  seguier promoted to heaven was succeeded by salomon couderc whom cavalier treats in his memoirs as chaplaingeneral to the whole army of the camisards  he was a prophet a great reader of the heart who admitted people to the sacrament or refused them by intensively viewing every man between the eyes and had the most of the scriptures off by rote  and this was surely happy since in a surprise in august 1703 he lost his mule his portfolios and his bible  it is only strange that they were not surprised more often and more effectually for this legion of cassagnas was truly patriarchal in its theory of war and camped without sentries leaving that duty to the angels of the god for whom they fought  this is a token not only of their faith but of the trackless country where they harboured  m de caladon taking a stroll one fine day walked without warning into their midst as he might have walked into a flock of sheep in a plain and found some asleep and some awake and psalmsinging  a traitor had need of no recommendation to insinuate himself among their ranks beyond his faculty of singing psalms and even the prophet salomon took him into a particular friendship  thus among their intricate hills the rustic troop subsisted and history can attribute few exploits to them but sacraments and ecstasies  people of this tough and simple stock will not as i have just been saying prove variable in religion nor will they get nearer to apostasy than a mere external conformity like that of naaman in the house of rimmon  when louis xvi in the words of the edict convinced by the uselessness of a century of persecutions and rather from necessity than sympathy granted at last a royal grace of toleration cassagnas was still protestant and to a man it is so to this day  there is indeed one family that is not protestant but neither is it catholic  it is that of a catholic cure in revolt who has taken to his bosom a schoolmistress  and his conduct it is worth noting is disapproved by the protestant villagers  it is a bad idea for a man said one to go back from his engagements  the villagers whom i saw seemed intelligent after a countrified fashion and were all plain and dignified in manner  as a protestant myself i was well looked upon and my acquaintance with history gained me further respect  for we had something not unlike a religious controversy at table a gendarme and a merchant with whom i dined being both strangers to the place and catholics  the young men of the house stood round and supported me and the whole discussion was tolerantly conducted and surprised a man brought up among the infinitesimal and contentious differences of scotland  the merchant indeed grew a little warm and was far less pleased than some others with my historical acquirements but the gendarme was mighty easy over it all  its a bad idea for a man to change said he and the remark was generally applauded  that was not the opinion of the priest and soldier at our lady of the snows  but this is a different race and perhaps the same greatheartedness that upheld them to resist now enables them to differ in a kind spirit  for courage respects courage but where a faith has been trodden out we may look for a mean and narrow population  the true work of bruce and wallace was the union of the nations not that they should stand apart a while longer skirmishing upon their borders but that when the time came they might unite with selfrespect  the merchant was much interested in my journey and thought it dangerous to sleep afield  there are the wolves said he and then it is known you are an englishman  the english have always long purses and it might very well enter into some ones head to deal you an ill blow some night  i told him i was not much afraid of such accidents and at any rate judged it unwise to dwell upon alarms or consider small perils in the arrangement of life  life itself i submitted was a far too risky business as a whole to make each additional particular of danger worth regard  something said i might burst in your inside any day of the week and there would be an end of you if you were locked into your room with three turns of the key  cependant said he coucher dehors  god said i is everywhere  cependant coucher dehors he repeated and his voice was eloquent of terror  he was the only person in all my voyage who saw anything hardy in so simple a proceeding although many considered it superfluous  only one on the other hand professed much delight in the idea and that was my plymouth brother who cried out when i told him i sometimes preferred sleeping under the stars to a close and noisy alehouse now i see that you know the lord  the merchant asked me for one of my cards as i was leaving for he said i should be something to talk of in the future and desired me to make a note of his request and reason a desire with which i have thus complied  a little after two i struck across the mimente and took a rugged path southward up a hillside covered with loose stones and tufts of heather at the top as is the habit of the country the path disappeared and i left my sheass munching heather and went forward alone to seek a road  i was now on the separation of two vast watersheds behind me all the streams were bound for the garonne and the western ocean before me was the basin of the rhone  hence as from the lozere you can see in clear weather the shining of the gulf of lyons and perhaps from here the soldiers of salomon may have watched for the topsails of sir cloudesley shovel and the longpromised aid from england  you may take this ridge as lying in the heart of the country of the camisards four of the five legions camped all round it and almost within viewsalomon and joani to the north castanet and roland to the south and when julien had finished his famous work the devastation of the high cevennes which lasted all through october and november 1703 and during which four hundred and sixty villages and hamlets were with fire and pickaxe utterly subverted a man standing on this eminence would have looked forth upon a silent smokeless and dispeopled land  time and mans activity have now repaired these ruins cassagnas is once more roofed and sending up domestic smoke and in the chestnut gardens in low and leafy corners many a prosperous farmer returns when the days work is done to his children and bright hearth  and still it was perhaps the wildest view of all my journey  peak upon peak chain upon chain of hills ran surging southward channelled and sculptured by the winter streams feathered from head to foot with chestnuts and here and there breaking out into a coronal of cliffs  the sun which was still far from setting sent a drift of misty gold across the hilltops but the valleys were already plunged in a profound and quiet shadow  a very old shepherd hobbling on a pair of sticks and wearing a black cap of liberty as if in honour of his nearness to the grave directed me to the road for st germain de calberte  there was something solemn in the isolation of this infirm and ancient creature  where he dwelt how he got upon this high ridge or how he proposed to get down again were more than i could fancy  not far off upon my right was the famous plan de font morte where poul with his armenian sabre slashed down the camisards of seguier  this methought might be some rip van winkle of the war who had lost his comrades fleeing before poul and wandered ever since upon the mountains  it might be news to him that cavalier had surrendered or roland had fallen fighting with his back against an olive  and while i was thus working on my fancy i heard him hailing in broken tones and saw him waving me to come back with one of his two sticks  i had already got some way past him but leaving modestine once more retraced my steps  alas it was a very commonplace affair  the old gentleman had forgot to ask the pedlar what he sold and wished to remedy this neglect  i told him sternly nothing  nothing cried he  i repeated nothing and made off  its odd to think of but perhaps i thus became as inexplicable to the old man as he had been to me  the road lay under chestnuts and though i saw a hamlet or two below me in the vale and many lone houses of the chestnut farmers it was a very solitary march all afternoon and the evening began early underneath the trees  but i heard the voice of a woman singing some sad old endless ballad not far off  it seemed to be about love and a bel amoureux her handsome sweetheart and i wished i could have taken up the strain and answered her as i went on upon my invisible woodland way weaving like pippa in the poem my own thoughts with hers  what could i have told her  little enough and yet all the heart requires  how the world gives and takes away and brings sweethearts near only to separate them again into distant and strange lands but to love is the great amulet which makes the world a garden and hope which comes to all outwears the accidents of life and reaches with tremulous hand beyond the grave and death  easy to say yea but also by gods mercy both easy and grateful to believe  we struck at last into a wide white highroad carpeted with noiseless dust  the night had come the moon had been shining for a long while upon the opposite mountain when on turning a corner my donkey and i issued ourselves into her light  i had emptied out my brandy at florac for i could bear the stuff no longer and replaced it with some generous and scented volnay and now i drank to the moons sacred majesty upon the road  it was but a couple of mouthfuls yet i became thenceforth unconscious of my limbs and my blood flowed with luxury  even modestine was inspired by this purified nocturnal sunshine and bestirred her little hoofs as to a livelier measure  the road wound and descended swiftly among masses of chestnuts  hot dust rose from our feet and flowed away  our two shadowsmine deformed with the knapsack hers comically bestridden by the packnow lay before us clearly outlined on the road and now as we turned a corner went off into the ghostly distance and sailed along the mountain like clouds  from time to time a warm wind rustled down the valley and set all the chestnuts dangling their bunches of foliage and fruit the ear was filled with whispering music and the shadows danced in tune  and next moment the breeze had gone by and in all the valley nothing moved except our travelling feet on the opposite slope the monstrous ribs and gullies of the mountain were faintly designed in the moonshine and high overhead in some lone house there burned one lighted window one square spark of red in the huge field of sad nocturnal colouring  at a certain point as i went downward turning many acute angles the moon disappeared behind the hill and i pursued my way in great darkness until another turning shot me without preparation into st germain de calberte  the place was asleep and silent and buried in opaque night only from a single open door some lamplight escaped upon the road to show me that i was come among mens habitations  the two last gossips of the evening still talking by a garden wall directed me to the inn  the landlady was getting her chicks to bed the fire was already out and had not without grumbling to be rekindled half an hour later and i must have gone supperless to roost    the last day   when i awoke thursday 2nd october and hearing a great flourishing of cocks and chuckling of contented hens betook me to the window of the clean and comfortable room where i had slept the night i looked forth on a sunshiny morning in a deep vale of chestnut gardens  it was still early and the cockcrows and the slanting lights and the long shadows encouraged me to be out and look round me  st germain de calberte is a great parish nine leagues round about  at the period of the wars and immediately before the devastation it was inhabited by two hundred and seventyfive families of which only nine were catholic and it took the cure seventeen september days to go from house to house on horseback for a census  but the place itself although capital of a canton is scarce larger than a hamlet  it lies terraced across a steep slope in the midst of mighty chestnuts  the protestant chapel stands below upon a shoulder in the midst of the town is the quaint old catholic church  it was here that poor du chayla the christian martyr kept his library and held a court of missionaries here he had built his tomb thinking to lie among a grateful population whom he had redeemed from error and hither on the morrow of his death they brought the body pierced with two andfifty wounds to be interred  clad in his priestly robes he was laid out in state in the church  the cure taking his text from second samuel twentieth chapter and twelfth verse and amasa wallowed in his blood in the highway preached a rousing sermon and exhorted his brethren to die each at his post like their unhappy and illustrious superior  in the midst of this eloquence there came a breeze that spirit seguier was near at hand and behold all the assembly took to their horses heels some east some west and the cure himself as far as alais  strange was the position of this little catholic metropolis a thimbleful of rome in such a wild and contrary neighbourhood  on the one hand the legion of salomon overlooked it from cassagnas on the other it was cut off from assistance by the legion of roland at mialet  the cure louvrelenil although he took a panic at the archpriests funeral and so hurriedly decamped to alais stood well by his isolated pulpit and thence uttered fulminations against the crimes of the protestants salomon besieged the village for an hour and a half but was beaten back the militiamen on guard before the cures door could be heard in the black hours singing protestant psalms and holding friendly talk with the insurgents  and in the morning although not a shot had been fired there would not be a round of powder in their flasks  where was it gone all handed over to the camisards for a consideration  untrusty guardians for an isolated priest  that these continual stirs were once busy in st germain de calberte the imagination with difficulty receives all is now so quiet the pulse of human life now beats so low and still in this hamlet of the mountains boys followed me a great way off like a timid sort of lionhunters and people turned round to have a second look or came out of their houses as i went by  my passage was the first event you would have fancied since the camisards  there was nothing rude or forward in this observation it was but a pleased and wondering scrutiny like that of oxen or the human infant yet it wearied my spirits and soon drove me from the street  i took refuge on the terraces which are here greenly carpeted with sward and tried to imitate with a pencil the inimitable attitudes of the chestnuts as they bear up their canopy of leaves  ever and again a little wind went by and the nuts dropped all around me with a light and dull sound upon the sward  the noise was as of a thin fall of great hailstones but there went with it a cheerful human sentiment of an approaching harvest and farmers rejoicing in their gains  looking up i could see the brown nut peering through the husk which was already gaping and between the stems the eye embraced an amphitheatre of hill sunlit and green with leaves  i have not often enjoyed a place more deeply  i moved in an atmosphere of pleasure and felt light and quiet and content  but perhaps it was not the place alone that so disposed my spirit  perhaps some one was thinking of me in another country or perhaps some thought of my own had come and gone unnoticed and yet done me good  for some thoughts which sure would be the most beautiful vanish before we can rightly scan their features as though a god travelling by our green highways should but ope the door give one smiling look into the house and go again for ever  was it apollo or mercury or love with folded wings  who shall say  but we go the lighter about our business and feel peace and pleasure in our hearts  i dined with a pair of catholics  they agreed in the condemnation of a young man a catholic who had married a protestant girl and gone over to the religion of his wife  a protestant born they could understand and respect indeed they seemed to be of the mind of an old catholic woman who told me that same day there was no difference between the two sects save that wrong was more wrong for the catholic who had more light and guidance but this of a mans desertion filled them with contempt  it is a bad idea for a man to change said one  it may have been accidental but you see how this phrase pursued me and for myself i believe it is the current philosophy in these parts  i have some difficulty in imagining a better  its not only a great flight of confidence for a man to change his creed and go out of his family for heavens sake but the odds arenay and the hope isthat with all this great transition in the eyes of man he has not changed himself a hairbreadth to the eyes of god  honour to those who do so for the wrench is sore  but it argues something narrow whether of strength or weakness whether of the prophet or the fool in those who can take a sufficient interest in such infinitesimal and human operations or who can quit a friendship for a doubtful process of the mind  and i think i should not leave my old creed for another changing only words for other words but by some brave reading embrace it in spirit and truth and find wrong as wrong for me as for the best of other communions  the phylloxera was in the neighbourhood and instead of wine we drank at dinner a more economical juice of the grapela parisienne they call it it is made by putting the fruit whole into a cask with water one by one the berries ferment and burst what is drunk during the day is supplied at night in water so with ever another pitcher from the well and ever another grape exploding and giving out its strength one cask of parisienne may last a family till spring  it is as the reader will anticipate a feeble beverage but very pleasant to the taste  what with dinner and coffee it was long past three before i left st germain de calberte  i went down beside the gardon of mialet a great glaring watercourse devoid of water and through st etienne de vallee francaise or val francesque as they used to call it and towards evening began to ascend the hill of st pierre  it was a long and steep ascent  behind me an empty carriage returning to st jean du gard kept hard upon my tracks and near the summit overtook me  the driver like the rest of the world was sure i was a pedlar but unlike others he was sure of what i had to sell  he had noticed the blue wool which hung out of my pack at either end and from this he had decided beyond my power to alter his decision that i dealt in bluewool collars such as decorate the neck of the french draughthorse  i had hurried to the topmost powers of modestine for i dearly desired to see the view upon the other side before the day had faded  but it was night when i reached the summit the moon was riding high and clear and only a few grey streaks of twilight lingered in the west  a yawning valley gulfed in blackness lay like a hole in created nature at my feet but the outline of the hills was sharp against the sky  there was mount aigoal the stronghold of castanet  and castanet not only as an active undertaking leader deserves some mention among camisards for there is a spray of rose among his laurel and he showed how even in a public tragedy love will have its way  in the high tide of war he married in his mountain citadel a young and pretty lass called mariette  there were great rejoicings and the bridegroom released five andtwenty prisoners in honour of the glad event  seven months afterwards mariette the princess of the cevennes as they called her in derision fell into the hands of the authorities where it was like to have gone hard with her  but castanet was a man of execution and loved his wife  he fell on valleraugue and got a lady there for a hostage and for the first and last time in that war there was an exchange of prisoners  their daughter pledge of some starry night upon mount aigoal has left descendants to this day  modestine and iit was our last meal togetherhad a snack upon the top of st pierre i on a heap of stones she standing by me in the moonlight and decorously eating bread out of my hand  the poor brute would eat more heartily in this manner for she had a sort of affection for me which i was soon to betray  it was a long descent upon st jean du gard and we met no one but a carter visible afar off by the glint of the moon on his extinguished lantern  before ten oclock we had got in and were at supper fifteen miles and a stiff hill in little beyond six hours    farewell modestine   on examination on the morning of october 3rd modestine was pronounced unfit for travel  she would need at least two days repose according to the ostler but i was now eager to reach alais for my letters and being in a civilised country of stagecoaches i determined to sell my lady friend and be off by the diligence that afternoon  our yesterdays march with the testimony of the driver who had pursued us up the long hill of st pierre spread a favourable notion of my donkeys capabilities  intending purchasers were aware of an unrivalled opportunity  before ten i had an offer of twentyfive francs and before noon after a desperate engagement i sold her saddle and all for five andthirty  the pecuniary gain is not obvious but i had bought freedom into the bargain  st jean du gard is a large place and largely protestant  the maire a protestant asked me to help him in a small matter which is itself characteristic of the country  the young women of the cevennes profit by the common religion and the difference of the language to go largely as governesses into england and here was one a native of mialet struggling with english circulars from two different agencies in london i gave what help i could and volunteered some advice which struck me as being excellent  one thing more i note  the phylloxera has ravaged the vineyards in this neighbourhood and in the early morning under some chestnuts by the river i found a party of men working with a ciderpress  i could not at first make out what they were after and asked one fellow to explain  making cider he said  oui cest comme ca  comme dans le nord  there was a ring of sarcasm in his voice the country was going to the devil  it was not until i was fairly seated by the driver and rattling through a rocky valley with dwarf olives that i became aware of my bereavement i had lost modestine  up to that moment i had thought i hated her but now she was gone           and oh    the difference to me  for twelve days we had been fast companions we had travelled upwards of a hundred and twenty miles crossed several respectable ridges and jogged along with our six legs by many a rocky and many a boggy byroad after the first day although sometimes i was hurt and distant in manner i still kept my patience and as for her poor soul she had come to regard me as a god  she loved to eat out of my hand  she was patient elegant in form the colour of an ideal mouse and inimitably small  her faults were those of her race and sex her virtues were her own farewell and if for ever  father adam wept when he sold her to me after i had sold her in my turn i was tempted to follow his example and being alone with a stagedriver and four or five agreeable young men i did not hesitate to yield to my emotion
