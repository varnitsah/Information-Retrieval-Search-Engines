willies ladye robin hood and the monk robin hood and the potter robin hood and the butcher    introduction    when the learned first gave serious attention to popular ballads from the time of percy to that of scott they laboured under certain disabilities  the comparative method was scarcely understood and was little practised  editors were content to study the ballads of their own countryside or at most of great britain  teutonic and northern parallels to our ballads were then adduced as by scott and jamieson  it was later that the ballads of europe from the faroes to modern greece were compared with our own with european marchen or childrens tales and with the popular songs dances and traditions of classical and savage peoples  the results of this more recent comparison may be briefly stated  poetry begins as aristotle says in improvisation  every man is his own poet and in moments of stronge motion expresses himself in song  a typical example is the song of lamech in genesis   i have slain a man to my wounding and a young man to my hurt   instances perpetually occur in the sagas  grettir egil skarphedin are always singing  in kidnapped mr stevenson introduces the song of the sword of alan a fine example of celtic practice  words and air are beaten out together in the heat of victory  in the same way the women sang improvised dirges like helen lullabies like the lullaby of danae in simonides and flower songs as in modern italy  every function of life war agriculture the chase had its appropriate magical and mimetic dance and song as in finland among red indians and among australian blacks  the deeds of men were chanted by heroes as by achilles stories were told in alternate verse and prose girls like homers nausicaa accompanied dance and ball play priests and medicinemen accompanied rites and magical ceremonies by songs  these practices are worldwide and worldold  the thoroughly popular songs thus evolved became the rude material of a professional class of minstrels when these arose as in the heroic age of greece  a minstrel might be attached to a court or a noble or he might go wandering with song and harp among the people  in either case this class of men developed more regular and ample measures  they evolved the hexameter the laisse of the chansons de geste the strange technicalities of scandinavian poetry the metres of vedic hymns the choral odes of greece  the narrative popular chant became in their hands the epic or the mediaeval rhymed romance  the metre of improvised verse changed into the artistic lyric  these lyric forms were fixed in many cases by the art of writing  but poetry did not remain solely in professional and literary hands  the mediaeval minstrels and jongleurs who may best be studied in leon gautiers introduction to his epopees francaises sang in court and camp  the poorer less regular brethren of the art harped and played conjuring tricks in farm and grange or at street corners  the foreign newer metres took the place of the old alliterative english verse but unprofessional men and women did not cease to make and sing  some writers have decided among them mr courthope that our traditional ballads are degraded popular survivals of literary poetry  the plots and situations of some ballads are indeed the same as those of some literary mediaeval romances  but these plots and situations in epic and romance are themselves the final literary form of marchen myths and inventions originally popular and still in certain cases extant in popular form among races which have not yet evolved or borrowed the ampler and more polished and complex genres of literature  thus when a literary romance and a ballad have the same theme the ballad may be a popular degradation of the romance or it may be the original popular shape of it still surviving in tradition  a wellknown case in prose is that of the french fairy tales  perrault in 1697 borrowed these from tradition and gave them literary and courtly shape  but cendrillon or chaperon rouge in the mouth of a french peasant is apt to be the old traditional version uncontaminated by the refinements of perrault despite perraults immense success and circulation  thus tradition preserves preliterary forms even though on occasion it may borrow from literature  peasant poets have been authors of ballads without being for all that professional minstrels  many such poems survive in our ballad literature  the material of the ballad may be either romantic or historical the former class is based on one of the primeval invented situations one of the elements of the marchen in prose  such tales or myths occur in the stories of savages in the legends of peasants are interwoven later with the plot in epic or romance and may also inspire ballads  popular superstitions the witch metamorphosis the returning ghost the fairy all of them survivals of the earliest thought naturally play a great part the historical ballad on the other hand has a basis of resounding fact murder battle or fireraising but the facts being derived from popular rumour are immediately corrupted and distorted sometimes out of all knowledge  good examples are the ballads on darnleys murder and the youth of james vi  in the romantic class we may take tamlane  here the idea of fairies stealing children is thoroughly popular they also steal young men as lovers and again men may win fairy brides by clinging to them through all transformations  a classical example is the seizure of thetis by peleus and child quotes a modern cretan example  the dipping in milk and water i may add has precedent in ancient egypt in the two brothers and in modern senegambia  the fairy tax tithe or teind paid to hell is illustrated by old trials for witchcraft in scotland 1  now in literary forms and romance as in ogier le danois persons are carried away by the fairy king or queen  but here the literary romance borrows from popular superstition the ballad has no need to borrow a familiar fact from literary romance  on the whole subject the curious may consult the secret commonwealth of elves fauns and fairies by the reverend robert kirk of aberfoyle himself according to tradition a victim of the fairies  thus in tamlane the whole donnee is popular  but the current version that of scott is contaminated as scott knew by incongruous modernisms  burnss version from tradition already localizes the events at carterhaugh the junction of ettrick and yarrow  but burnss version does not make the earl of murray father of the hero nor the earl of march father of the heroine roxburgh is the heros father in burnss variant which is more plausible and the modern verses do not occur  this ballad apparently owes nothing to literary romance  in mary hamilton we have a notable instance of the historical ballad  no marie of mary stuarts suffered death for child murder  she had no marie hamilton no marie carmichael among her four maries though a lady of the latter name was at her court  but early in the reign a frenchwoman of the queens was hanged with her paramour an apothecary for slaying her infant  knox mentions the fact which is also recorded in letters from the english ambassador uncited by mr child  knox adds that there were ballads against the maries  now in march 1719 a mary hamilton of scots descent a maid of honour of catherine of russia was hanged for child murder child vi 383  it has therefore been supposed first by charles kirkpatrick sharpe long ago later by professor child and then by mr courthope that our ballad is of 1719 or later and deals with the russian not the scotch tragedy  to this we may reply 1 that we have no example of such a throwing back of a contemporary event in ballads  2 there is a version child viii 507 in which mary hamiltons paramour is a pottinger or apothecary as in the real old scotch affair  3 the number of variants of a ballad is likely to be proportionate to its antiquity and wide distribution  now only sir patrick spens has so many widely different variants as mary hamilton  these could hardly have been evolved between 1719 and 1790 when burns quotes the poem as an old ballad  4 we have no example of a poem so much in the old ballad manner for perhaps a hundred and fifty years before 1719  the style first degraded and then expired compare rob roy and killiecrankie in this collection also the ballads of loudoun hill the battle of philiphaugh and others much earlier than 1719  new styles of popular poetry on contemporary events as sherriffmuir and tranent brae had arisen  5 the extreme historic inaccuracy of mary hamilton is paralleled by that of all the ballads on real events  the mention of the pottinger is a trace of real history which has no parallel in the russian affair and there is no room says professor child for the supposition that it was voluntarily inserted by reciter or copyist to tally with the narrative in knoxs history  on the other side we have the name of mary hamilton occurring in a tragic event of 1719 but then the name does not uniformly appear in the variants of the ballad  the lady is there spoken of generally as mary hamilton but also as mary myle lady maisry as daughter of the duke of york stuart as marie mild and so forth though she bids sailors carry the tale of her doom she is not abroad but in edinburgh town  nothing can be less probable than that a scots popular balladmaker in 1719 telling the tale of a yesterdays tragedy in russia should throw the time back by a hundred and fifty years should change the scene to scotland the heart of the sorrow would be marys exile and above all should compose a ballad in a style long obsolete  this is not the method of the popular poet and such imitations of the old ballad as hardyknute show that literary poets of 1719 had not knowledge or skill enough to mimic the antique manner with any success  we may therefore even in face of professor child regard mary hamilton as an old example of popular perversion of history in ballad not as one of the very latest and also one of the very best of scottish popular ballads  rob roy shows the same power of perversion  it was not rob roy but his sons robin oig who shot maclaren at the ploughtail and james mohr alternately the spy the jacobite and the hanoverian spy once more who carried off the heiress of edenbelly  indeed a kind of added epilogue in a different measure proves that a poet was aware of the facts and wished to correct his predecessor  such then are ballads in relation to legend and history  they are on the whole with exceptions absolutely popular in origin composed by men of the people for the people and then diffused among and altered by popular reciters  in england they soon won their way into printed stall copies and were grievously handled and moralized by the hack editors  no ballad has a stranger history than the loving ballad of lord bateman illustrated by the pencils of cruikshank and thackeray their form is a ludicrous cockney perversion but it retains the essence  bateman a captive of this turk is beloved by the turks daughter a staple incident of old french romance and by her released  the lady after seven years rejoins lord bateman  he has just married a local bride but orders another marriage and sends home his bride in a coach and three  this incident is stereotyped in the ballads and occurs in an example in the romaic 2  now lord bateman is young bekie in the scotch ballads who becomes young beichan young bichem and so forth and has adventures identical with those of lord bateman though the proud porter in the scots version is scarcely so prominent and illustrious  as motherwell saw bekie beichan buchan bateman is really becket gilbert becket father of thomas of canterbury  every one has heard how his saracen bride sought him in london  robert of gloucesters life and martyrdom of thomas becket percy society see childs introduction iv i 1861 and motherwells minstrelsy p xv 1827  the legend of the dissolved marriage is from the common stock of ballad lore motherwell found an example in the state of cantefable alternate prose and verse like aucassin and nicolette  thus the cockney rhyme descends from the twelfth century  such are a few of the curiosities of the ballad  the examples selected are chiefly chosen for their romantic charm and for the spirit of the border raids which they record  a few notes are added in an appendix  the text is chosen from among the many variants in childs learned but still unfinished collection and an effort has been made to choose the copies which contain most poetry with most signs of uncontaminated originality  in a few cases sir walter scotts versions though confessedly made up are preferred  perhaps the editor may be allowed to say that he does not merely plough with professor childs heifer but has made a study of ballads from his boyhood  this fact may exempt him even in the eyes of too patriotic american critics from the common blame of a plagiary  indeed as professor child has not yet published his general theory of the ballad the editor does not know whether he agrees with the ideas here set forth  so far the editor had written when news came of professor childs regretted death  he had lived to finish it is said the vast collection of all known traditional scottish and english ballads with all accessible variants a work of great labour and research and a distinguished honour to american scholarship  we are not told however that he had written a general study of the topic with his conclusions as to the evolution and diffusion of the ballads  as to the influences which directed the selection of certain themes of marchen for poetic treatment and the processes by which identical ballads were distributed throughout europe  no one it is to be feared is left in europe at least whose knowledge of the subject is so wide and scientific as that of professor child  it is to be hoped that some pupil of his may complete the task in his sense if indeed he has left it unfinished    ballad  sir patrick spens    border minstrelsy  the king sits in dunfermline town drinking the bludered wine o o whare will i get a skeely skipper to sail this new ship of mine o  o up and spake an eldernknight sat at the kings right knee sir patrick spens

percy wi the douglas met i wat he was fu fain they swakked their swords till sair they swat and the blood ran down like rain  but percy with his good broad sword that could so sharply wound has

gallants and listen awhile with hey down down an a down that are in the bowers within for of robin hood that archer good a song i intend for to sing  upon a time it chanced so bold robin in forrest did spy a jolly butcher with a bonny fine mare with his flesh to the market did hye  good morrow good fellow said jolly robin what food hast thou tell unto me thy trade to me tell and where thou dost dwell for i like well thy company  the butcher he answerd jolly robin no matter where i dwell for a butcher i am and to nottingham i am going my flesh to sell  whats the price of thy flesh said jolly robin come tell it soon unto me and the price of thy mare be she never so dear for a butcher fain would i be  the price of my flesh the butcher replid i soon will tell unto thee with my bonny mare and they are not too dear four mark thou must give unto me  four mark i will give thee saith jolly robin four mark it shall be thy fee the mony come count and let me mount for a butcher i fain would be  now robin he is to nottingham gone his butchers trade to begin with good intent to the sheriff he went and there he took up his inn  when other butchers did open their meat bold robin he then begun but how for to sell he knew not well for a butcher he was but young  when other butchers no meat could sell robin got both gold and fee for he sold more meat for one peny then others could do for three  but when he sold his meat so fast no butcher by him could thrive for he sold more meat for one peny than others could do for five  which made the butchers of nottingham to study as they did stand saying surely he is some prodigal that hath sold his fathers land  the butchers stepped to jolly robin acquainted with him for to be come brother one said we be all of one trade come will you go dine with me  accurst of his heart said jolly robin that a butcher doth deny i will go with you my brethren true as fast as i can hie  but when to the sheriffs house they came to dinner they hied apace and robin hood he the man must be before them all to say grace  pray god bless us all said jolly robin and our meat within this place a cup of sack so good will nourish our blood and so do i end my grace  come fill us more wine said jolly robin let us be merry while we do stay for wine and good cheer be it never so dear i vow i the reckning will pay  come brothers be merry said jolly robin let us drink and never give ore for the shot i will pay ere i go my way if it cost me five pounds and more  this is a mad blade the butchers then said saies the sheriff he is some prodigal that some land has sold for silver and gold and now he doth mean to spend all  hast thou any horn beasts the sheriff replid good fellow to sell unto me yes that i have good master sheriff i have hundreds two or three  and a hundred aker of good free land if you please it to see and ile make you as good assurance of it as ever my father made me  the sheriff he saddled his good palfrey and with three hundred pound in gold away he went with bold robin hood his horned beasts to behold  away then the sheriff and robin did ride to the forrest of merry sherwood then the sheriff did say god bless us this day from a man they call robin hood  but when a little farther they came bold robin he chanced to spy a hundred head of good red deer come tripping the sheriff full nigh  how like you my hornd beasts good master sheriff they be fat and fair for to see i tell thee good fellow i would i were gone for i like not thy company  then robin set his horn to his mouth and blew but blasts three then quickly anon there came little john and all his company  what is your will master then said little john good master come tell unto me i have brought hither the sheriff of nottingham this day to dine with thee  he is welcome to me then said little john i hope he will honestly pay i know he has gold if it be but well told will serve us to drink a whole day  then robin took his mantle from his back and laid it upon the ground and out of the sheriffs portmantle he told three hundred pound  then robin he brought him thorow the wood and set him on his dapple gray o have me commanded to your wife at home so robin went laughing away    notes    sir patrick spens   mr child finds the first published version of the grand old ballad of sir patrick spens as coleridge calls it in bishop percys reliques  here the name is spence and the middle rhyme   haf owre haf owre to aberdour  is not of early date  the corkheeled shoon too cannot be early but ballads are subject in oral tradition to such modern interpolations  the verse about the ladies waiting vainly is anticipated in a popular song of the fourteenth century on a defeat of the noblesse in flanders  their ladies them may abide in bower and hall well long  if there be historical foundation for the ballad it is probably a blending of the voyage of margaret daughter of alexander iii to wed eric king of norway in 1281 some of her escort were drowned on their way home with the rather mysterious death or disappearance of margarets daughter the maid of norway on her voyage to marry the son of edward i in 1290  a woman who alleged that she was the maid of norway was later burned at the stake  the great number and variety of versions sufficiently indicate the antiquity of this ballad wherein exact history is not to be expected   the battle of otterburn   from the border minstrelsy sir walter scotts latest edition of 1833  the copy in the edition of 1802 is less complete  the gentle and joyous passage of arms here recorded took place in august 1388  we have an admirable account of otterburn fight from froissart who revels in a gallant encounter fairly fought out hand to hand with no intervention of archery or artillery and for no wretched practical purpose  in such a combat the scots never renowned for success at long bowls and led by a douglas were likely to prove victorious even against long odds and when taken by surprise  choosing an advantage in the discordant days of richard ii the scots mustered a very large force near jedburgh merely to break lances on english ground and take loot  learning that as they advanced by the carlisle route the english intended to invade scotland by berwick and the east coast the scots sent three or four hundred menatarms with a few thousand mounted archers and pikemen who should harry northumberland to the walls of newcastle these were led by james earl of douglas march and murray  in a fight at newcastle douglas took harry percys pennon which hotspur vowed to recover  the retreat began but the scots waited at otterburn partly to besiege the castle partly to abide hotspurs challenge  he made his attack at moonlight with overwhelming odds but was hampered by a marsh and incommoded by a flank attach of the scots  then it came to who would pound longest with axe and sword  douglas cut his way through the english axe in hand and was overthrown but his men protected his body  the sinclairs and lindsay raised his banner with his cry march and dunbar came up hotspur was taken by montgomery and the english were routed with heavy loss  douglas was buried in melrose abbey very many years later the english defiled his grave but were punished at ancram moor  there is an english poem on the fight of about 1550 it has many analogies with our scottish version and doubtless ours descends from a ballad almost contemporary  the ballad was a great favourite of scotts  in a severe illness thinking of lockhart not yet his soninlaw he quoted   my wound is deep i fain would sleep take thou the vanguard of the three   mr child thinks the command to   yield to the brackenbush   unmartial  this does not seem a strong objection in froissarts time  it is explained in an oral fragment   for there lies aneth yon brackenbush wha aft has conquered mair than thee   mr child also thinks that the dreamy dream may be copied from hume of godscroft  it is at least as probable that godscroft borrowed from the ballad which he cites  the embroidered gauntlet of the percy is in the possession of douglas of cavers to this day   tam lin or tamlane   burnss version in johnsons museum 1792  scotts version is made up of this copy riddells herds and oral recitations and contains feeble literary interpolations not of course by sir walter  the complaint of scotland 1549 mentions the tale of the young tamlene as then popular  it is needless here to enter into the subject of fairyland and captures of mortals by fairies  the editor has said his say in his edition of kirks secret commonwealth  the nereids in modern greece practise fairy cantrips and the same beliefs exist in samoa and new caledonia the metamorphoses are found in the odyssey book iv in the winning of thetis the nereid or fairy bride by peleus in a modern cretan fairy tale and so on  there is a similar incident in penda baloa a senegambian ballad contes populaires de la senegambie berenger ferand paris 1885  the dipping of tamlane has precedents in old deccan days in a hottentot tale by bleek and in les deux freres the egyptian story translated by maspero the editor has already given these parallels in a note to border ballads by graham r thomson  mr child also cites mannhardt wald und feldkulte ii 6470  carterhaugh the scene of the ballad is at the junction of ettrick and yarrow between bowhill and philiphaugh   thomas rymer   from the border minstrelsy the original was derived from a lady living near erceldoune earlston and from mrs browns mss  that thomas of erceldoune had some popular fame as a rhymer and soothsayer as early as 13201350 seems to be established  as late as the forty five nay even as late as the expected napoleonic invasion sayings attributed to thomas were repeated with some measure of belief  a real thomas rymer of erceldoune witnessed an undated deed of peter de haga early in the thirteenth century the de hagas or haigs of bemersyde were the subjects of the prophecy attributed to thomas   betide betide whateer betide there will aye be a haig in bemersyde   and a haig still owns that ancient chateau on the tweed which has a singular set of traditions  learmont is usually given as the erceldoune family name a branch of the family owned dairsie in fifeshire and were a kind of hereditary provosts of st andrews if thomas did predict the death of alexander iii or rather report it by dint of clairvoyance he must have lived till 1285  the date of the poem on the fairy queen attributed to thomas is uncertain the story itself is a variant of ogier the dane  the scene is huntly bank under eildon hill and was part of the lands acquired at fantastic prices by sir walter scott  his passion for land was really part of his passion for collecting antiquities  the theory of fairyland here as in many other scottish legends and witch trials is borrowed from the prechristian hades and the fairy queen is a late refraction from persephone  not to eat in the realm of the dead is a regular precept of savage belief all the world over  mr robert kirks secret commonwealth of elves fauns and fairies may be consulted or the editors perrault p xxxv oxford 1888  of the later legends about thomas scott gives plenty in the border minstrelsy  the long ancient romantic poem on the subject is probably the source of the ballad though a local ballad may have preceded the long poem  scott named the glen through which the bogle burn flows to chiefswood the rhymers glen   sir hugh   the date of the martyrdom of hugh is attributed by matthew paris to 1225  chaucer puts a version in the mouth of his prioress  no doubt the story must have been a mere excuse for jewbaiting  in america the jew becomes the duke in a version picked up by mr newells from the recitation of a street boy in new york  the daughter of a jew is not more likely than the daughter of a duke to have been concerned in the cruel and blasphemous imitation of the horrors attributed by horace to the witch canidia  but some such survivals of pagan sorcery did exist in the middle ages under the influence of satanism   son davie   motherwells version  one of many ballads on fratricide instigated by the mother  or inquired into by her as the case may be  edward is another example of this gloomy situation   the wife of ushers well   here   the cock doth craw the day doth daw   having a middle rhyme can scarcely be of extreme antiquity probably in the original poem the dead return to rebuke the extreme grief of the mother but the poem is perhaps really more affecting in the absence of a didactic motive  scott obtained it from an old woman in west lothian  probably the reading fashes troubles in the flood is correct not fishes or freshes the mother desires that the sea may never cease to be troubled till her sons return verse 4 line 2  the peculiar doom of women dead in childbearing occurs even in aztec mythology   the twa corbies   from the third volume of border minstrelsy derived by charles kirkpatrick sharpe from a traditional version  the english version three ravens was published in melismata by t ravensworth 1611  in scots the lady has taen another mate his hawk and hound have deserted the dead knight  in the english song the hounds watch by him the hawks keep off carrion birds as for the lady   she buried him before the prime she was dead herselfe ere evensong time   probably the english is the earlier version   the bonnie earl of murray   huntly had a commission to apprehend the earl who was in the disgrace of james vi  huntly as an ally of bothwell asked him to surrender at donibristle in fife he would not yield to his private enemy the house was burned and murray was slain huntly gashing his face  you have spoiled a better face than your own said the dying earl 1592  james melville mentions contemporary ballads on the murder  ramsay published the ballad in his tea table miscellany and it is often sung to this day   clerk saunders   first known as published in border minstrelsy 1802  the apparition of the lover is borrowed from sweet willies ghost the evasions practised by the lady and the austerities vowed by her have many norse french and spanish parallels in folkpoetry scotts version is made up from several sources but is in any case verse most satisfactory as poetry   waly waly   from ramsays tea table miscellany a curiously composite gathering of verses  there is a verse obviously a variant in a sixteenth century song cited by leyden  st anthons well is on a hill slope of arthurs seat near holyrood  here jeanie deans trysted with her sisters seducer in the heart of midlothian  the cairn of nichol mushat the wifemurderer is not far off  the ruins of anthonys chapel are still extant   love gregor   there are french and romaic variants of this ballad  lochroyal where the ballad is localized is in wigtownshire but the localization varies  the tokens are as old as the return of odysseus in the odyssey  his token is the singular construction of his bridal bed attached by him to a living treetrunk  a similar legend occurs in chinese  see gerlands altgiechische marchen   the queens mariemary hamilton   a madeup copy from scotts edition of 1833  this ballad has caused a great deal of controversy  queen mary had no mary hamilton among her four maries  no marie was executed for child murder  but we know from knox that ballads were recited against the maries and that one of the marys chamberwomen was hanged with her lover a pottinger or apothecary for getting rid of her infant  these last facts were certainly quite basis enough for a ballad the ballad echoing not history but rumour and rumour adapted to the popular taste  thus the ballad might have passed unchallenged as a survival more or less modified in time of queen marys period  but in 1719 a mary hamilton a maid of honour of scottish descent was executed in russia for infanticide  charles kirkpatrick sharpe conceived that this affair was the origin of the ballad and is followed by mr child  we reply 1 the ballad has almost the largest number of variants on record  this is a proof of antiquity  variants so many differing in all sorts of points could not have arisen between 1719 and the age of burns who quotes the poem  2  this is especially improbable because in 1719 the old vein of ballad poetry had run dry popular song had chosen other forms and no literary imitator could have written mary hamilton in 1719  3  there is no example of a popular ballad in which a contemporary event interesting just because it is contemporary is thrown back into a remote age  4  the name mary hamilton is often not given to the heroine in variants of the ballad  she is of several names and ranks in the variants  5  as mr child himself remarked the pottinger of the real story of queen marys time occurs in one variant  there was no pottinger in the russian affair  all these arguments to which others might be added seem fatal to the late date and modern origin of the ballad and mr childs own faith in the hypothesis was shaken if not overthrown   kinmont willie   from the border minstrelsy  the account in satchells has either been based on the ballad or the ballad is based on satchells after a meeting on the border of salkeld of corby and scott of haining kinmont willie was seized by the english as he rode home from the tryst  being wanted he was lodged in carlisle castle and this was a breach of the days truce  buccleugh as warder tried to obtain willies release by peaceful means  these failing buccleugh did what the ballad reports april 13 1596  harden and goudilands were with buccleugh being his neighbours near branxholme  dicky of dryhope with others armstrongs was also true to the call of duty  a few verses in the ballad are clearly by aut gualterus aut diabolus and none the worse for that salkeld of course was not really slain and if the men were left for dead probably they were not long in that debatable condition  in the rising of 1745 prince charlies men forded eden as boldly as buccleuch the prince saving a drowning highlander with his own hand   jamie telfer   scott for once was wrong in his localities  the dodhead of the poem is not that near singlee in ettrick but a place of the same name near skelfhill on the southern side of teviot within three miles of stobs where telfer vainly seeks help from elliot  the other dodhead is at a great distance from stobs up borthwick water over the tableland past clearburn loch and buccleugh and so down ettrick past tushielaw  the catslockhill is not that on yarrow near ladhope but another near branxholme whence it is no far cry to branxholme hall  borthwick water goudilands below branxholme commonside a little farther up teviot allanhaugh and the other places of the scotts were all easily warned there are traces of a modern hand in this excellent ballad  the topography is here corrected from ms notes in a first edition of the minstrelsy in the library of mr charles grieve at branxholme park a scion of auld jock grieve of the coultart cleugh  names linger long in pleasant teviotdale   the douglas tragedy   the ballad has norse analogues but is here localized on the douglas burn a tributary of yarrow on the left bank  the st marys kirk would be that now ruinous on st marys loch the chapel burned by the lady of branxholme when she   gathered a band of the best that would ride at her command   in the lay of the last minstrel  the ancient keep of blackhouse on douglas burn may have been the home of the heroine if we are to localize   the bonny hind   herd got this tragic ballad from a milkmaid in 1771  mr child quotes a verse parallel preserved in faroe and in the icelandic there is a similar incident in the cycle of kullervo in the finnish kalevala  scott says that similar tragedies are common in scotch popular poetry such cases are lizzie wan and the kings dochter lady jean  a sorrow nearly as bitter occurs in the french milk white dove  a brother kills his sister metamorphosed into a white deer  the bridge of death french seems to hint at something of the same kind or rather the editor finds that he has arbitrarily read the bonny hind into le pont des morts in puymaigres chants populaires du pays messin p 60 ballads and lyrics of old france p 63   young beichan or young bicham   this is the original of the cockney loving ballad of lord bateman illustrated by cruikshank and by thackeray  there is a vast number of variants evidence to the antiquity of the story  the earliest known trace is in the familiar legend of the saracen lady who sought and found her lover gilbert becket father of thomas a becket in london see preface to life of becket or beket percy society 1845  the date may be circ 1300  the kind of story the loving daughter of the cruel captor is as old as medea and jason and her search for her lover comes in such marchen as the black bull o norraway  no story is more widely diffused see a far travelled tale in the editors custom and myth  the appearance of the true love just at her lovers wedding is common in the marchen of the world and occurs in a romaic ballad as well as in many from northern europe  the local colourthe moor or saracenis derived from crusading times perhaps  motherwell found the ballad recited with intervals of prose narrative as in aucassin and nicolette  the notes to cruikshanks loving ballad are obviously by thackeray   the bonny house o airly   lord airlys houses were destroyed by argyll representing the covenanters and also in pursuance of a private feud in 1639 or 1640  there are erroneous versions of this ballad in which lochiel appears and the date is apparently transferred to 1745 montrose in his early covenanting days was not actually concerned in the burning of the bonnie house which he when a royalist revenged on the possessions of gleyed argyll  the reference to charlie is out of keeping no one perhaps ever called charles i by that affectionate name  lady ogilvie had not the large family attributed to her  her son lord ogilvie escaped from prison in the castle of st andrews after philiphaugh  a lord ogilvie was out in 1745 and later had a regiment in the french service  few families have a record so consistently loyal   rob roy   the abductors of the widowed young heiress of edenhelly were robs sons robin oig who went through a form of marriage with the girl and james mohr a good soldier but a doubledyed spy and scoundrel  robin oig was hanged in 1753  james mohr a detected traitor to prince charles died miserably in paris in 1754 readers of mr stevensons catriona know james well information as to his villanies is extant in additional mss british museum this is probably the latest ballad in the collection  it occurs in several variants some of which copied out by burns derive thence a certain accidental interest  in mr stevensons catriona the heroine of that name takes a thoroughly highland view of the abduction  robin oig in any case was nane the waur o a hanging for he shot a maclaren at the ploughtail before the fortyfive  the trial of these sons of alpen was published shortly after scotts rob roy   killiecrankie   fought on july 27 1689  not on the haugh near the modern road by the railway but higher up the hill in the grounds of urrard house  two shelter trenches whence dundees men charged are still visible high on the hillside above urrand  there is said by mr child to have been a contemporary broadside of the ballad which is an example of the evolution of popular ballads from the old traditional model  there is another song by or attributed to burns and of remarkable spirit and vigour   annan water   from the border minstrelsy scott says that these are the original words of the tune of allan water and that he has added two verses from a variant with a fortunate conclusion  allan water is a common river name the stream so called joins teviot above branxholme  annan is the large stream that flows into the solway frith  the gateslack in annandale fixes the locality   the elphin nourrice   this curious poem is taken from the reprint of charles kirkpatrick sharpes tiny ballad book itself now almost introuvable  it does not to the editors knowledge occur elsewhere but is probably authentic  the view of the faery queen is more pleasing and sympathetic than usual  why mortal women were desired as nurses except to attend on stolen mortal children kept to pay the kane to hell is not obvious  irish beliefs are precisely similar in england they are of frequent occurrence   johnnie armstrang   armstrang of gilnockie was a brother of the laird of mangertoun he had a kind of robin hood reputation on the scottish border as one who only robbed the english  pitscotties account of his slaying by james v 1529 reads as if the ballad were his authority and an air for the subject is mentioned in the complaint of scotland  in sir herbert maxwells history of dumfries and galloway is an excellent account of the historical facts of the case   edom o gordon   founded on an event in the wars between kingsmen and queensmen in the minority of james vi while queen mary was imprisoned in england  edom was adam gordon of auchindown brother of huntley and a queens man  he by his retainer car or ker burned towie house a seat of the forbess  ker recurs in the long and more or less literary ballad of the battle of balrinnes  in variants the localities are much altered and in one version the scene is transferred to ayrshire and loudoun castle  all the ballads of fireraising a very usual practice have points in common and transference was easy   lady anne bothwells lament   tradition has confused the heroine of this piece with the wife of bothwelhaugh who slew the regent murray  that his motive was not mere political assassination but to avenge the illtreatment and death of his wife seems to be disproved by maidment  the affair however is still obscure  this deserted lady anne of the ballad was in fact not the wife of bothwelhaugh but the daughter of the bishop of orkney her lover is said to have been her cousin alexander erskine son of the earl of mar  part of the poem mr child points out occurs in broomes play the northern lass 1632  though a popular favourite the piece is clearly of literary origin and has been severely edited by a literary hand this version is allan ramsays   jock o the side   a liddesdale chant  jock flourished about 15501570 and is commemorated as a receiver by sir richard maitland in a poem often quoted  the analogies of this ballad with that of kinmont willie are very close  the reference to a punchbowl sounds modern and the tale is much less plausible than that of kinmont willie which however bears a few obvious marks of sir walters own hand a sceptical editor must choose between two theories  either scott of satchells founded his account of the affair of kinmont willie on a preexisting ballad of that name or the ballad printed by scott is based on the prose narrative of scott of satchells  the former hypothesis everything considered is the more probable   lord thomas and fair annet   published in percys reliques from a scotch manuscript with some corrections  the situation with various differences in detail and conclusion is popular in norse and romaic ballads and also in many marchen of the type of the black bull of norraway   fair annie   from the border minstrelsy  there are danish swedish dutch and german versions and the theme enters artistic poetry as early as marie de france le lai del freisne  in scotch the earl of wemyss is a recent importation  the earldom dates from 1633  of course this process of attaching a legend or marchen to a wellknown name or place is one of the most common in mythological evolution and by itself invalidates the theory which would explain myths by a philological analysis of the proper names in the tale  these may not be and probably are not the original names   the downie dens of yarrow   from the border minstrelsy  scott thought that the hero was walter scott third son of thirlestane slain by scott of tushielaw  the monument a standing stone near yarrow is really of a very early rather postroman date and refers to no feud of thirlestane oakwood kirkhope or tushielaw  the stone is not far from yarrow krik near a place called warriors rest  hamilton of bangours version is beautiful and well known  quite recently a very early interment of a corpse in the curved position was discovered not far from the standing stone with the inscription ballad stone and interment may all be distinct and separate   sir roland   from motherwells minstrelsy  the authenticity of the ballad is dubious but if a forgery it is a very skilled one for the early nineteenth century  poets like mr swinburne mr rossetti and mrs marriot watson have imitated the genuine popular ballad but never so closely as the author of sir roland   rose the red and white lily   from the jamiesonbrown ms originally written out by mrs brown in 1783  sir waiter made changes in the border minstrelsy  the ballad is clearly a composite affair  robert chambers regarded mrs brown as the mrs harris of ballad lore but mr norval clynes reply was absolutely crushing and satisfactory   the battle of harlaw   fought on july 24 1411  this fight broke the highland force in scotland  the first version is of course literary perhaps a composition of 1550 or even earlier  the second version is traditional and was procured by aytoun from lady john scott herself the author of some beautiful songs  but the best ballad on the red harlaw is that placed by scott in the mouth of elspeth in the antiquary  this indeed is beyond all rivalry the most splendid modern imitation of the ancient popular muse   dickie macphalion   a great favourite of scotts who heard it sung at miss edgeworths during his tour in ireland 1825  one verse recurs in a jacobite chant probably of 17451760 but the bibliography of jacobite songs is especially obscure   a lykewake dirge   from the border minstrelsy  the ideas are mainly prechristian the brig o dread occurs in islamite and iroquois belief and in almost all mythologies the souls have to cross a river  music for this dirge is given in mr harold boultons and miss macleods songs of the north   the laird of waristoun   this version was taken down by sir walter scott from his mothers recitation for jamiesons book of ballads  jamieson later quarrelled bitterly with sir walter as letters at abbotsford prove  a variant is given by kinloch and a longer less poetical but more historically accurate version is given by buchan  the house of waristoun is or lately was a melancholy place hanging above a narrow lake in the northern suburbs of edinburgh near the water of leith  kincaid was the name of the laird according to chambers the more famous lairds of covenanting times were johnstons  kincaid is said to have treated his wife cruelly wherefore she or her nurse engaged one robert weir an old servant of her father livingstone of dunipace to strangle the unhappy man in his own bedroom july 2 1600  the lady was beheaded the nurse was burned and later weir was also executed the line   i wish that ye may sink for sin   occurs in an earlier ballad on edinburgh castle   and that all for the black dinner earl douglas got therein   may colven   from herds ms  versions occur in polish german magyar portuguese scandinavian and in french  the ballad is here localised on the carrick coast near girvan  the lady is called a kennedy of culzean  prof bugge regards this widely diffused ballad as based on the apocryphal legend of judith and holofernes if so the legend is diablement change en route  more probably the origin is a marchen of a kind of rakshasa fatal to women  mr child has collected a vast mass of erudition on the subject and by no means acquiesces in prof bugges ingenious hypothesis   johnie faa   from pinkertons scottish ballads  the event narrated is a legend of the house of cassilis kennedy but is wholly unhistorical sir john faa in the fable is aided by gypsies but apparently is not one of the earls of egypt on whom mr crocketts novel the raiders may be consulted  the ballad was first printed as far as is known in ramsays tea table miscellany   hobbie noble   the hero recurs in jock o the side and jock o the mains is an historical character that is finds mention in authentic records as scott points out  the armstrongs were deported in great numbers as an ill colony to ulster by james i  sir herbert maxwells history of dumfries and galloway may be consulted for these and similar reivers   the twa sisters   a version of binnorie  the ballad here ends abruptly doubtless the fiddler made fiddlestrings of the ladys hair and a fiddle of her breastbone while the instrument probably revealed the cruelty of the sister  other extant versions are composite or interpolated so this fragment sharpes has been preferred in this place   mary ambree   taken by percy from a piece in the pepys collection  the girl warrior is a favourite figure in popular romance  often she slays a treacherous lover as in billy taylor  nothing is known of mary ambree as an historical personage she may be as legendary as fair maiden lilias of liliarids edge who fought upon her stumps in that case the local name is demonstrably earlier than the mythical lilias who fought with such tenacity   alison gross   jamieson gave this ballad from a manuscript altering the spelling in conformity with scots orthography  mr child prints the manuscript here jamiesons more familiar spelling is retained the idea of the romance occurs in a romaic marchen but in place of the queen of faery a more beautiful girl than the sorceress nereid in romaic restores the youth to his true shape  mr child regarded the tale as one of the numerous wild growths from beauty and the beast  it would be more correct to say that beauty and the beast is a late courtly french adaptation and amplification of the original popular wild growth which first appears in literary form as cupid and psyche in apuleius except for the metamorphosis however there is little analogy in this case  the friendly act of the fairy queen is without parallel in british folklore but mr child points out that the nereid queen in greece is still as kind as thetis of old not a sepulchral siren the shadow of the pagan fairy queen proserpina as campion calls her   the heir of lynne   from percys folio manuscript  there is a cognate greek epigram  greek text which cannot be reproduced   gordon of brackley   this though probably not the most authentic is decidedly the most pleasing version it is from mackays collection perhaps from his pen   edward   percy got this piece from lord hailes with pseudoantiquated spelling  mr swinburne has published a parallel ballad from the finnish  there are a number of parallel ballads on cruel brothers and cruel sisters such as son davie which may be compared  fratricides and unconscious incests were motives dear to popular poetry   young benjie   from the border minstrelsy  that corpses might begin to thraw if carelessly watched was a prevalent superstition  scott gives an example  the following may be added as less well known  the watchers had left the corpse alone and were dining in the adjoining room when a terrible noise was heard in the chamber of death  none dared enter the minister was sent for and passed into the room  he emerged asked for a pair of tongs and returned bearing in the tongs a bloody glove and the noise ceased  he always declined to say what he had witnessed ministers were exorcists in the last century and the father of james thomson the poet died suddenly in an interview with a guest in a haunted house  the house was pulled down as being uninhabitable   auld maitland   from the border minstrelsy  this ballad is inserted not for its merit still less for its authenticity but for the problem of its puzzling history  scott certainly got it from the mother of the ettrick shepherd in 1801  the shepherds father had been a grown up man in 1745 and his mother was also of a great age and unlikely to be able to learn a newforged ballad by heart  the shepherd himself then a most unsophisticated person said in a letter of june 30 1801 that he was surprized to hear this song is suspected by some to be a modern forgery the contrary will be best proved by most of the old people here about having a great part of it by heart  the two last lines of verse seven were confessedly added by hogg to fill a lacuna  they are especially modern in style  now thus to fill up sham lacunae in sham ballads of his own with lines manifestly modern was a favourite trick of surtees of mainsforth  he used the device in barthrams dirge which entirely took in sir walter and was guilty of many other supercheries especially of the fray of suport mill  could the unlettered shepherd fond of hoaxes as he was have invented this stratagem sixteen years before he joined the blackwood set  and is it conceivable that his old mother entering into the joke would commit her sons fraudulent verses to memory and recite them to sir walter as genuine tradition  she said to scott that the ballad never was printed i the world for my brothers and me learned it and many mae frae auld andrew moore and he learned it frae auld baby mettlin maitland wha was housekeeper to the first laird o tushilaw  on ettrick near thirlestane  she doubtless meant the first of the andersons of tushielaw who succeeded the old lairds the scotts  she was said to hae been another or a guid ane and there are many queer stories about hersel but o she had been a grand singer o auld songs an ballads  hoggs domestic manners of sir walter scott p 61 1834  maitland upon auld beird gray is mentioned by gawain douglas in his palice of honour which the shepherd can hardly have read and scott identified this maitland with the ancestor of lethington his date was 12501296  on the whole even the astute shepherd in his early days of authorship could hardly have laid a plot so insidious and the question of the authenticity and origin of the ballad obvious interpolations apart remains a mystery  who could have forged it  it is as an exercise in imitation far beyond hardyknute and at least on a level with sir roland  the possibility of such forgeries is now very slight indeed but vitiates early collections  if we suspect leyden who alone had the necessary knowledge of antiquities we are still met by the improbability of old mrs hogg being engaged in the hoax  moreover leyden was probably too keen an antiquary to take part in one of the deceptions which ritson wished to punish so severely  mr child expresses his strong and natural suspicions of the authenticity of the ballad and hogg is certainly a dubious source  he took in jeffrey with the song of donald macgillavray and instantly boasted of his triumph  he could not have kept his secret after the death of scott  these considerations must not be neglected however suspicious auld maitland may appear   the broomfield hill   from buchans ballads of the north of scotland  there are elizabethan references to the poem and a twelfth century romance turns on the main idea of sleep magically induced  the lover therein is more fortunate than the hero of the ballad and finally overcomes the spell  the idea recurs in the norse poetry   willies ladye   scott took this ballad from mrs browns celebrated manuscript the kind of spell indicated was practised by hera upon alcmena before the birth of heracles  analogous is the spell by binding witchknots practised by simaetha on her lover in the second idyll of theocritus  montaigne has some curious remarks on these enchantments explaining their power by what is now called suggestion  there is a danish parallel to willies ladye translated by jamieson   robin hood ballads   there is plentiful learning about robin hood but no real knowledge  he is first mentioned in literature as the subject of rhymes in piers plowman circ 1377  as a topic of ballads he must be much older than that date  in 1439 his name was a synonym for a bandit  wyntoun the scots chronicler dates the outlaw in the time of edward i  major the scots philosopher and master of john knox makes a guess taken up by scott in ivanhoe as the period of richard i  kuhn seeks to show that hood is a survival of woden or of his wooden wooden horse or hobby horse  the robin hood play was parallel with the may games which as mr frazer shows in his golden bough were really survivals of a worldwide religious practice  but robin hood need not be confused with the legendary may king  mr child judiciously rejects these mythological conjectures based as they are on farfetched etymologies and analogies  robin is an idealized bandit reiver or klepht as in modern romaic ballads and his adventures are precisely such as popular fancy everywhere attaches to such popular heroes  an historical robin there may have been but premit nox alta   robin hood and the monk   this copy follows in mr childs early edition from the second edition of ritsons robin hood as collated by sir frederic madden  it is conjectured to be possibly as old as the reign of edward ii  that the murder of a monk should be pardoned in the facile way described is manifestly improbable  even in the lawless galloway of 1508 mcghie of phumpton
