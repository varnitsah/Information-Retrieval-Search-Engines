15670360	a millionaire of roughandready   by  bret harte   jtable 4 7 1  prologue  there was no mistake this time he had struck gold at last  it had lain there before him a moment agoa misshapen piece of brownstained quartz interspersed with dull yellow metal yielding enough to have allowed the points of his pick to penetrate its honeycombed recesses yet heavy enough to drop from the point of his pick as he endeavored to lift it from the red earth  he was seeing all this plainly although he found himself he knew not why at some distance from the scene of his discovery his heart foolishly beating his breath impotently hurried  yet he was walking slowly and vaguely conscious of stopping and staring at the landscape which no longer looked familiar to him  he was hoping for some instinct or force of habit to recall him to himself yet when he saw a neighbor at work in an adjacent claim he hesitated and then turned his back upon him  yet only a moment before he had thought of running to him saying by jingo  ive struck it or dn it old man ive got it but that moment had passed and now it seemed to him that he could scarce raise his voice or if he did the ejaculation would appear forced and artificial  neither could he go over to him coolly and tell his good fortune and partly from this strange shyness and partly with a hope that another survey of the treasure might restore him to natural expression he walked back to his tunnel  yes it was there  no mere pocket or deposit but a part of the actual vein he had been so long seeking  it was there sure enough lying beside the pick and the debris of the face of the vein that he had exposed sufficiently after the first shock of discovery to assure himself of the fact and the permanence of his fortune  it was there and with it the refutation of his enemies sneers the corroboration of his friends belief the practical demonstration of his own theories the reward of his patient labors  it was there sure enough  but somehow he not only failed to recall the first joy of discovery but was conscious of a vague sense of responsibility and unrest  it was no doubt an enormous fortune to a man in his circumstances perhaps it meant a couple of hundred thousand dollars or more judging from the value of the old martin lead which was not as rich as this but it required to be worked constantly and judiciously  it was with a decided sense of uneasiness that he again sought the open sunlight of the hillside  his neighbor was still visible on the adjacent claim but he had apparently stopped working and was contemplatively smoking a pipe under a large pinetree  for an instant he envied him his apparent contentment  he had a sudden fierce and inexplicable desire to go over to him and exasperate his easy poverty by a revelation of his own newfound treasure  but even that sensation quickly passed and left him staring blankly at the landscape again  as soon as he had made his discovery known and settled its value he would send for his wife and her children in the states  he would build a fine house on the opposite hillside if she would consent to it unless she preferred for the childrens sake to live in san francisco  a sense of a loss of independenceof a change of circumstances that left him no longer his own masterbegan to perplex him in the midst of his brightest projects certain other relations with other members of his family which had lapsed by absence and his insignificance must now be taken up anew  he must do something for his sister jane for his brother william for his wifes poor connections  it would be unfair to him to say that he contemplated those things with any other instinct than that of generosity yet he was conscious of being already perplexed and puzzled  meantime however the neighbor had apparently finished his pipe and knocking the ashes out of it rose suddenly and ended any further uncertainty of their meeting by walking over directly towards him  the treasurefinder advanced a few steps on his side and then stopped irresolutely  hollo slinn said the neighbor confidently  hollo masters responded slinn faintly  from the sound of the two voices a stranger might have mistaken their relative condition what in thunder are you mooning about for  whats up  then catching sight of slinns pale and anxious face he added abruptly are you sick  slinn was on the point of telling him his good fortune but stopped the unlucky question confirmed his consciousness of his physical and mental disturbance and he dreaded the ready ridicule of his companion he would tell him later masters need not know when he had made the strike  besides in his present vagueness he shrank from the brusque practical questioning that would be sure to follow the revelation to a man of masters temperament  im a little giddy here he answered putting his hand to his head and i thought id knock off until i was better  masters examined him with two very critical gray eyes  tell ye what old manif you dont quit this doggoned foolin of yours in that godforsaken tunnel youll get loony  times you get so tangled up in follerin that blind lead o yours you aint sensible  here was the opportunity to tell him all and vindicate the justice of his theories  but he shrank from it again and now adding to the confusion was a singular sense of dread at the mental labor of explanation  he only smiled painfully and began to move away look you said masters peremptorily ye want about three fingers of straight whiskey to set you right and youve got to take it with me dn it man it may be the last drink we take together  dont look so skeered  i meani made up my mind about ten minutes ago to cut the whole dd thing and light out for fresh diggings  im sick of getting only grub wages out o this bill  so thats what i mean by saying its the last drink you and mell take together  you know my ways sayin and doin with mes the same thing  it was true  slinn had often envied masters promptness of decision and resolution  but he only looked at the grim face of his interlocutor with a feeble sense of relief  he was going  and he slinn would not have to explain anything  he murmured something about having to go over to the settlement on business  he dreaded lest masters should insist upon going into the tunnel  i suppose you want to mail that letter said masters drily the mail dont go till tomorrow so youve got time to finish it and put it in an envelope  following the direction of masters eyes slinn looked down and saw to his utter surprise that he was holding an unfinished pencilled note in his hand  how it came there when he had written it he could not tell he dimly remembered that one of his first impulses was to write to his wife but that he had already done so he had forgotten  he hastily concealed the note in his breastpocket with a vacant smile masters eyed him half contemptuously half compassionately  dont forget yourself and drop it in some hollow tree for a letterbox he said  wellso longsince you wont drink take care of yourself and turning on his heel masters walked away  slinn watched him as he crossed over to his abandoned claim saw him gather his few mining utensils strap his blanket over his back lift his hat on his longhandled shovel as a token of farewell and then stride lightheartedly over the ridge  he was alone now with his secret and his treasure  the only man in the world who knew of the exact position of his tunnel had gone away forever  it was not likely that this chance companion of a few weeks would ever remember him or the locality again he would now leave his treasure alonefor even a day perhapsuntil he had thought out some plan and sought out some friend in whom to confide  his secluded life the singular habits of concentration which had at last proved so successful had at the same time left him few acquaintances and no associates  and in all his welllaid plans and patientlydigested theories for finding the treasure the means and methods of working it and disposing of it had never entered  and now at the hour when he most needed his faculties what was the meaning of this strange benumbing of them  patience  he only wanted a little resta little time to recover himself  there was a large boulder under a tree in the highway of the settlementa sheltered spot where he had often waited for the coming of the stagecoach  he would go there and when he was sufficiently rested and composed he would go on  nevertheless on his way he diverged and turned into the woods for no other apparent purpose than to find a hollow tree  a hollow tree yes that was what masters had said he remembered it distinctly and something was to be done there but what it was or why it should be done he could not tell  however it was done and very luckily for his limbs could scarcely support him further and reaching that boulder he dropped upon it like another stone  and now strange to say the uneasiness and perplexity which had possessed him ever since he had stood before his revealed wealth dropped from him like a burden laid upon the wayside  a measureless peace stole over him in which visions of his newfound fortune no longer a trouble and perplexity but crowned with happiness and blessing to all around him assumed proportions far beyond his own weak selfish plans  in its evenhanded benefaction his wife and children his friends and relations even his late poor companion of the hillside met and moved harmoniously together in its farreaching consequences there was only the influence of good  it was not strange that this poor finite mind should never have conceived the meaning of the wealth extended to him or that conceiving it he should faint and falter under the revelation  enough that for a few minutes he must have tasted a joy of perfect anticipation that years of actual possession might never bring  the sun seemed to go down in a rosy dream of his own happiness as he still sat there  later the shadows of the trees thickened and surrounded him and still later fell the calm of a quiet evening sky with farspaced passionless stars that seemed as little troubled by what they looked upon as he was by the stealthy creeping life in the grasses and underbrush at his feet  the dull patter of soft little feet in the soft dust of the road the gentle gleam of moist and wondering little eyes on the branches and in the mossy edges of the boulder did not disturb him  he sat patiently through it all as if he had not yet made up his mind  but when the stage came with the flashing sun the next morning and the irresistible clamor of life and action the driver suddenly laid his four spirited horses on their haunches before the quiet spot  the express messenger clambered down from the box and approached what seemed to be a heap of castoff clothes upon the boulder  he dont seem to be drunk he said in reply to a querulous interrogation from the passengers  i cant make him out  his eyes are open but he cannot speak or move  take a look at him doc  a rough unprofessionallooking man here descended from the inside of the coach and carelessly thrusting aside the other curious passengers suddenly leant over the heap of clothes in a professional attitude  he is dead said one of the passengers  the rough man let the passive head sink softly down again  no such luck for him he said curtly but not unkindly  its a stroke of paralysisand about as big as they make em  its a tossup if he ever speaks or moves again as long as he lives    chapter i  when alvin mulrady announced his intention of growing potatoes and garden truck on the green slopes of los gatos the mining community of that region and the adjacent hamlet of roughandready regarded it with the contemptuous indifference usually shown by those adventurers towards all bucolic pursuits  there was certainly no active objection to the occupation of two hillsides which gave so little promise to the prospector for gold that it was currently reported that a single prospector called slinn had once gone mad or imbecile through repeated failures  the only opposition came incongruously enough from the original pastoral owner of the soil one don ramon alvarado whose claim for seven leagues of hill and valley including the now prosperous towns of roughandready and red dog was met with simple derision from the squatters and miners  looks ez ef we woz goin to travel three thousand miles to open up his dd old wilderness and then pay for the increased valoo we give itdont it oh yes certainly was their ironical commentary  mulrady might have been pardoned for adopting this popular opinion but by an equally incongruous sentiment peculiar however to the man he called upon don ramon and actually offered to purchase the land or go shares with him in the agricultural profits  it was alleged that the don was so struck with this concession that he not only granted the land but struck up a quaint reserved friendship for the simpleminded agriculturist and his family  it is scarcely necessary to add that this intimacy was viewed by the miners with the contempt that it deserved  they would have been more contemptuous however had they known the opinion that don ramon entertained of their particular vocation and which he early confided to mulrady  they are savages who expect to reap where they have not sown to take out of the earth without returning anything to it but their precious carcasses heathens who worship the mere stones they dig up  and was there no spaniard who ever dug gold asked mulrady simply  ah there are spaniards and moors responded don ramon sententiously gold has been dug and by caballeros but no good ever came of it there were alvarados in sonora look you who had mines of silver and worked them with peons and mules and lost their moneya gold mine to work a silver onelike gentlemen  but this grubbing in the dirt with ones fingers that a little gold may stick to them is not for caballeros  and then one says nothing of the curse  the curse echoed mary mulrady with youthful feminine superstition what is that  you knew not friend mulrady that when these lands were given to my ancestors by charles v the bishop of monterey laid a curse upon any who should desecrate them  good  let us see  of the three americanos who founded yonder town one was shot another died of a feverpoisoned you understand by the soiland the last got himself crazy of aguardiente  even the scientifico1 who came here years ago and spied into the trees and the herbs he was afterwards punished for his profanation and died of an accident in other lands  but added don ramon with grave courtesy this touches not yourself  through me you are of the soil  indeed it would seem as if a secure if not a rapid prosperity was the result of don ramons manorial patronage  the potato patch and market garden flourished exceedingly the rich soil responded with magnificent vagaries of growth the even sunshine set the seasons at defiance with extraordinary and premature crops  the salt pork and biscuit consuming settlers did not allow their contempt of mulradys occupation to prevent their profiting by this opportunity for changing their diet the gold they had taken from the soil presently began to flow into his pockets in exchange for his more modest treasures  the little cabin which barely sheltered his familya wife son and daughterwas enlarged extended and refitted but in turn abandoned for a more pretentious house on the opposite hill  a whitewashed fence replaced the rudelysplit rails which had kept out the wilderness  by degrees the first evidences of cultivationthe gashes of red soil the piles of brush and undergrowth the bared boulders and heaps of stonemelted away and were lost under a carpet of lighter green which made an oasis in the tawny desert of wild oats on the hillside water was the only free boon denied this garden of eden what was necessary for irrigation had to be brought from a mining ditch at great expense and was of insufficient quantity  in this emergency mulrady thought of sinking an artesian well on the sunny slope beside his house not however without serious consultation and much objection from his spanish patron  with great austerity don ramon pointed out that this trifling with the entrails of the earth was not only an indignity to nature almost equal to shaftsinking and tunneling but was a disturbance of vested interests  i and my fathers san diego rest them said don ramon crossing himself were content with wells and cisterns filled by heaven at its appointed seasons the cattle dumb brutes though they were knew where to find water when they wanted it  but thou sayest truly he added with a sigh that was before streams and rain were choked with hellish engines and poisoned with their spume  go on friend mulrady dig and bore if thou wilt but in a seemly fashion and not with impious earthquakes of devilish gunpowder  with this concession alvin mulrady began to sink his first artesian shaft  being debarred the auxiliaries of steam and gunpowder the work went on slowly  the market garden did not suffer meantime as mulrady had employed two chinamen to take charge of the ruder tillage while he superintended the engineering work of the well this trifling incident marked an epoch in the social condition of the family  mrs mulrady at once assumed a conscious importance among her neighbors  she spoke of her husbands men she alluded to the well as the works she checked the easy frontier familiarity of her customers with pretty mary mulrady her seventeenyearold daughter  simple alvin mulrady looked with astonishment at this sudden development of the germ planted in all feminine nature to expand in the slightest sunshine of prosperity look yer malviny aint ye rather puttin on airs with the boys that want to be civil to mamie  like as not one of em may be makin up to her already  you dont mean to say alvin mulrady responded mrs mulrady with sudden severity that you ever thought of givin your daughter to a common miner or that im goin to allow her to marry out of our own set  our own set echoed mulrady feebly blinking at her in astonishment and then glancing hurriedly across at his frecklefaced son and the two chinamen at work in the cabbages  oh you know what i mean said mrs mulrady sharply the set that we move in  the alvarados and their friends  doesnt the old don come here every day and aint his son the right age for mamie  and aint they the real first families hereall the same as if they were noblemen no leave mamie to me and keep to your shaft there never was a man yet had the least sabe about these things or knew what was due to his family  like most of his larger minded but feebler equipped sex mulrady was too glad to accept the truth of the latter proposition which left the meannesses of life to feminine manipulation and went off to his shaft on the hillside  but during that afternoon he was perplexed and troubled  he was too loyal a husband not to be pleased with this proof of an unexpected and superior foresight in his wife although he was like all husbands a little startled by it  he tried to dismiss it from his mind  but looking down from the hillside upon his little venture where gradual increase and prosperity had not been beyond his faculties to control and understand he found himself haunted by the more ambitious projects of his helpmate  from his own knowledge of men he doubted if don ramon any more than himself had ever thought of the possibility of a matrimonial connection between the families  he doubted if he would consent to it  and unfortunately it was this very doubt that touching his own pride as a selfmade man made him first seriously consider his wifes proposition  he was as good as don ramon any day  with this subtle feminine poison instilled in his veins carried completely away by the logic of his wifes illogical premises he almost hated his old benefactor  he looked down upon the little garden of eden where his eve had just tempted him with the fatal fruit and felt a curious consciousness that he was losing its simple and innocent enjoyment forever  happily about this time don ramon died  it is not probable that he ever knew the amiable intentions of mrs mulrady in regard to his son who now succeeded to the paternal estate sadly partitioned by relatives and lawsuits  the feminine mulradys attended the funeral in expensive mourning from sacramento even the gentle alvin was forced into readymade broadcloth which accented his goodnatured but unmistakably common presence  mrs mulrady spoke openly of her loss declared that the old families were dying out and impressed the wives of a few new arrivals at red dog with the belief that her own family was contemporary with the alvarados and that her husbands health was far from perfect she extended a motherly sympathy to the orphaned don caesar reserved like his father in natural disposition he was still more gravely ceremonious from his loss and perhaps from the shyness of an evident partiality for mamie mulrady he rarely availed himself of her mothers sympathizing hospitality  but he carried out the intentions of his father by consenting to sell to mulrady for a small sum the property he had leased  the idea of purchasing had originated with mrs mulrady  itll be all in the family had observed that astute lady and its better for the looks of the things that we shouldnt he his tenants  it was only a few weeks later that she was startled by hearing her husbands voice calling her from the hillside as he rapidly approached the house  mamie was in her room putting on a new pink cotton gown in honor of an expected visit from young don caesar and mrs mulrady was tidying the house in view of the same event something in the tone of her good mans voice and the unusual circumstance of his return to the house before work was done caused her however to drop her dusting cloth and run to the kitchen door to meet him  she saw him running through the rows of cabbages his face shining with perspiration and excitement a light in his eyes which she had not seen for years  she recalled without sentiment that he looked like that when she had called hima poor farm hand of her fathersout of the brush heap at the back of their former home in illinois to learn the consent of her parents  the recollection was the more embarrassing as he threw his arms around her and pressed a resounding kiss upon her sallow cheek  sakes alive  mulrady she said exorcising the ghost of a blush that had also been recalled from the past with her housewifes apron what are you doin and company expected every minit  malviny ive struck it and struck it rich  she disengaged herself from his arms without excitement and looked at him with bright but shrewdly observant eyes  ive struck it in the wellthe regular vein that the boys have been looking fer  theres a fortin fer you and mamie thousands and tens of thousands  wait a minit  she left him quickly and went to the foot of the stairs  he could hear her wonderingly and distinctly  ye can take off that new frock mamie she called out  there was a sound of undisguised expostulation from mamie  im speaking said mrs mulrady emphatically  the murmuring ceased  mrs mulrady returned to her husband  the interruption seemed to have taken off the keen edge of his enjoyment he at once abdicated his momentary elevation as a discoverer and waited for her to speak  ye havent told any one yet she asked  no  i was alone down in the shaft  ye see malviny i wasnt expectin of anything  he began with an attempt at fresh enjoyment i was just clearin out and hadnt reckoned on anythin  you see i was right when i advised you taking the land she said without heeding him  mulradys face fell  i hope don caesar wont thinkhe began hesitatingly  i reckon perhaps i oughter make some sorter compensationyou know  stuff said mrs mulrady decidedly  dont be a fool  any gold discovery anyhow would have been yoursthats the law  and you bought the land without any restrictions  besides you never had any idea of thisshe stopped and looked him suddenly in the facehad you  mulrady opened his honest palegray eyes widely  why malviny  you know i hadnt  i could swear  dont swear and dont let on to anybody but what you did know it was there  now alvin mulrady listen to me  her voice here took the strident form of action  knock off work at the shaft and send your man away at once  put on your things catch the next stage to sacramento at four oclock and take mamie with you  mamie echoed mulrady feebly  you want to see lawyer cole and my brother jim at once she went on without heeding him and mamie wants a change and some proper clothes  leave the rest to me and abner  ill break it to mamie and get her ready  mulrady passed his hands through his tangled hair wet with perspiration  he was proud of his wifes energy and action he did not dream of opposing her but somehow he was disappointed  the charming glamour and joy of his discovery had vanished before he could fairly dazzle her with it or rather she was not dazzled with it at all  it had become like business and the expression breaking it to mamie jarred upon him  he would have preferred to tell her himself to watch the color come into her delicate oval face to have seen her soft eyes light with an innocent joy he had not seen in his wifes and he felt a sinking conviction that his wife was the last one to awaken it  you aint got any time to lose she said impatiently as he hesitated  perhaps it was her impatience that struck harshly upon him perhaps if she had not accepted her good fortune so confidently he would not have spoken what was in his mind at the time but he said gravely wait a minit malviny ive suthin to tell you bout this find of mine thats singlar  go on she said quickly  lyin among the rotten quartz of the vein was a pick he said constrainedly and the face of the vein sorter looked ez if it had been worked at  follering the line outside to the base of the hill there was signs of there having been an old tunnel but it had fallen in and was blocked up  well said mrs mulrady contemptuously  well returned her husband somewhat disconnectedly it kinder looked as if some feller might have discovered it before  and went away and left it for others  thats likelyaint it interrupted his wife with illdisguised intolerance  everybody knows the hill wasnt worth that for prospectin and it was abandoned when we came here  its your property and youve paid for it  are you goin to wait to advertise for the owner alvin mulrady or are you going to sacramento at four oclock today  mulrady started  he had never seriously believed in the possibility of a previous discovery but his conscientious nature had prompted him to give it a fair consideration  she was probably right  what he might have thought had she treated it with equal conscientiousness he did not consider  all right he said simply  i reckon well go at once  and when you talk to lawyer cole and jim keep that silly stuff about the pick to yourself  theres no use of putting queer ideas into other peoples heads because you happen to have em yourself  when the hurried arrangements were at last completed and mr mulrady and mamie accompanied by a taciturn and discreet chinaman carrying their scant luggage were on their way to the high road to meet the up stage the father gazed somewhat anxiously and wistfully into his daughters face  he had looked forward to those few moments to enjoy the freshness and naivete of mamies youthful delight and enthusiasm as a relief to his wifes practical farsighted realism  there was a pretty pink suffusion in her delicate cheek the breathless happiness of a child in her halfopened little mouth and a beautiful absorption in her large gray eyes that augured well for him  well mamie how do we like bein an heiress  how do we like layin over all the gals between this and frisco  eh  she had not heard him  the tender beautiful eyes were engaged in an anticipatory examination of the remembered shelves in the fancy emporium at sacramento in reading the admiration of the clerks in glancing down a little criticisingly at the broad cowhide brogues that strode at her side in looking up the road for the stagecoach in regarding the fit of her new gloveseverywhere but in the loving eyes of the man beside her  he however repeated the question touched with her charming preoccupation and passing his arm around her little waist  i like it well enough pa you know she said slightly disengaging his arm but adding a perfunctory little squeeze to his elbow to soften the separation  i always had an idea something would happen  i suppose im looking like a fright she added but ma made me hurry to get away before don caesar came  and you didnt want to go without seeing him he added archly  i didnt want him to see me in this frock said mamie simply i reckon thats why ma made me change she added with a slight laugh  well i reckon youre allus good enough for him in any dress said mulrady watching her attentively and more than a match for him now he added triumphantly  i dont know about that said mamie  hes been rich all the time and his father and grandfather before him while weve been poor and his tenants  his face changed the look of bewilderment with which he had followed her words gave way to one of pain and then of anger did he get off such stuff as that he asked quickly  no  id like to catch him at it responded mamie promptly theres better nor him to be had for the asking now  they had walked on a few moments in aggrieved silence and the chinaman might have imagined some misfortune had just befallen them  but mamies teeth shone again between her parted lips  la pa it aint that  he cares everything for me and i do for him and if ma hadnt got new ideas  she stopped suddenly  what new ideas queried her father anxiously  oh nothing  i wish pa youd put on your other boots everybody can see these are made for the farrows  and you aint a market gardener any more  what am i then asked mulrady with a halfpleased halfuneasy laugh  youre a capitalist i say but ma says a landed proprietor nevertheless the landed proprietor when he reached the boulder on the red dog highway sat down in somewhat moody contemplation with his head bowed over the broad cowhide brogues that seemed to have already gathered enough of the soil to indicate his right to that title mamie who had recovered her spirits but had not lost her preoccupation wandered off by herself in the meadow or ascended the hillside as her occasional impatience at the delay of the coach or the following of some ambitious fancy alternately prompted her  she was so far away at one time that the stagecoach which finally drew up before mulrady was obliged to wait for her  when she was deposited safely inside and mulrady had climbed to the box beside the driver the latter remarked curtly  ye gave me a right smart skeer a minit ago stranger  ez how  well about three years ago i was comin down this yer grade at just this time and sittin right on that stone in just your attitude was a man about your build and years  i pulled up to let him in when darn my skin if he ever moved but sorter looked at me without speakin  i called to him and he never answered cept with that idiotic stare  i then let him have my opinion of him in mighty strong english and drove off leavin him there  the next morning when i came by on the uptrip darn my skin if he wasnt thar but lyin all of a heap on the boulder  jim drops down and picks him up  doctor duchesne ez was along allowst it was a playedout prospector with a big case of paralysis and we expressed him through to the county hospital like so much dead freight  ive allus been kinder superstitious about passin that rock and when i saw you jist now sittin thar dazed like with your head down like the other chap it rather threw me off my centre  in the inexplicable and halfsuperstitious uneasiness that this coincidence awakened in mulradys unimaginative mind he was almost on the point of disclosing his good fortune to the driver in order to prove how preposterous was the parallel but checked himself in time  did you find out who he was broke in a rash passenger  did you ever get over it added another unfortunate  with a pause of insulting scorn at the interruption the driver resumed pointedly to mulrady the pint of the whole thing was my cussin a helpless man ez could neither cuss back nor shoot and then afterwards takin you for his ghost layin for me to get even  he paused again and then added carelessly they say he never kem to enuff to let on who he was or whar he kem from and he was eventooally taken to a sylum for doddering idjits and ginral and permiskus imbeciles at sacramento  ive heerd its considered a firstclass institooshun not only for them ez is paralyzed and cant talk as for them ez is the reverse and is too chipper now he added languidly turning for the first time to his miserable questioners how did you find it   1 don ramon probably alluded to the eminent naturalist douglas who visited california before the gold excitement and died of an accident in the sandwich islands    chapter ii  when the news of the discovery of gold in mulrady shaft was finally made public it created an excitement hitherto unknown in the history of the country  half of red dog and all roughandready were emptied upon the yellow hills surrounding mulradys until their circling camp fires looked like a besieging army that had invested his peaceful pastoral home preparatory to carrying it by assault  unfortunately for them they found the various points of vantage already garrisoned with notices of preemption for mining purposes in the name of the various members of the alvarado family this stroke of business was due to mrs mulrady as a means of mollifying the conscientious scruples of her husband and of placating the alvarados in view of some remote contingency  it is but fair to say that this degradation of his fathers castilian principles was opposed by don caesar  you neednt work them yourself but sell out to them that will its the only way to keep the prospectors from taking it without paying for it at all argued mrs mulrady  don caesar finally assented perhaps less to the business arguments of mulradys wife than to the simple suggestion of mamies mother  enough that he realized a sum in money for a few acres that exceeded the last ten years income of don ramons seven leagues  equally unprecedented and extravagant was the realization of the discovery in mulradys shaft  it was alleged that a company hastily formed in sacramento paid him a million of dollars down leaving him still a controlling twothirds interest in the mine with an obstinacy however that amounted almost to a moral conviction he refused to include the house and potatopatch in the property  when the company had yielded the point he declined with equal tenacity to part with it to outside speculators on even the most extravagant offers  in vain mrs mulrady protested in vain she pointed out to him that the retention of the evidence of his former humble occupation was a green blot upon their social escutcheon  if you will keep the land build on it and root up the garden but mulrady was adamant  its the only thing i ever made myself and got out of the soil with my own hands its the beginning of my fortune and it may be the end of it  mebbee ill be glad enough to have it to come back to some day and be thankful for the square meal i can dig out of it  by repeated pressure however mulrady yielded the compromise that a portion of it should be made into a vineyard and flowergarden and by a suitable coloring of ornament and luxury obliterate its vulgar part less successful however was that energetic woman in another effort to mitigate the austerities of their earlier state it occurred to her to utilize the softer accents of don caesar in the pronunciation of their family name and privately had mulrade take the place of mulrady on her visiting card  it might be spanish she argued with her husband lawyer cole says most american names are corrupted and how do you know that yours aint  mulrady who would not swear that his ancestors came from ireland to the carolinas in 98 was helpless to refute the assertion  but the terrible nemesis of an unspanish american provincial speech avenged the orthographical outrage at once when mrs mulrady began to be addressed orally as well as by letter as mrs mulraid and when simple amatory effusions to her daughter rhymed with lovely maid she promptly refused the original vowel but she fondly clung to the spanish courtesy which transformed her husbands baptismal name and usually spoke of himin his absenceas don alvino  but in the presence of his short square figure his orange tawny hair his twinkling gray eyes and retrousse nose even that dominant woman withheld his title  it was currently reported at red dog that a distinguished foreigner had one day approached mulrady with the formula i believe i have the honor of addressing don alvino mulrady  you kin bet your boots stranger thats me had returned that simple hidalgo  although mrs mulrady would have preferred that mamie should remain at sacramento until she could join her preparatory to a trip to the states and europe she yielded to her daughters desire to astonish roughandready before she left with her new wardrobe and unfold in the parent nest the delicate and painted wings with which she was to fly from them forever  i dont want them to remember me afterwards in those spotted prints ma and like as not say i never had a decent frock until i went away  there was something so like the daughter of her mother in this delicate foresight that the touched and gratified parent kissed her and assented  the result was gratifying beyond her expectation  in that few weeks sojourn at sacramento the young girl seemed to have adapted and assimilated herself to the latest modes of fashion with even more than the usual american girls pliancy and taste equal to all emergencies of style and material she seemed to supply from some hitherto unknown quality she possessed the grace and manner peculiar to each  untrammeled by tradition education or precedent she had the western girls confidence in all things being possible which made them so often probable  mr mulrady looked at his daughter with mingled sentiments of pride and awe was it possible that this delicate creature so superior to him that he seemed like a degenerate scion of her remoter race was his own flesh and blood  was she the daughter of her mother who even in her remembered youth was never equipped like this  if the thought brought no pleasure to his simple loving nature it at least spared him the pain of what might have seemed ingratitude in one more akin to himself  the fact is we aint quite up to her style was his explanation and apology  a vague belief that in another and a better world than this he might approximate and understand this perfection somewhat soothed and sustained him  it was quite consistent therefore that the embroidered cambric dress which mamie mulrady wore one summer afternoon on the hillside at los gatos while to the critical feminine eye at once artistic and expensive should not seem incongruous to her surroundings or to herself in the eyes of a general audience  it certainly did not seem so to one pair of frank humorous ones that glanced at her from time to time as their owner a young fellow of fiveandtwenty walked at her side  he was the new editor of the roughandready record and having been her fellowpassenger from sacramento had already once or twice availed himself of her fathers invitation to call upon them mrs mulrady had not discouraged this mild flirtation  whether she wished to disconcert don caesar for some occult purpose or whether like the rest of her sex she had an overweening confidence in the unheroic unseductive and purely platonic character of masculine humor did not appear  when i say im sorry you are going to leave us miss mulrady said the young fellow lightly you will comprehend my unselfishness since i frankly admit your departure would be a positive relief to me as an editor and a man  the pressure in the poets corner of the record since it was mistakingly discovered that a person of your name might be induced to seek the glade and shade without being afraid dismayed or betrayed has been something enormous and unfortunately i am debarred from rejecting anything on the just ground that i am myself an interested admirer  its dreadful to be placarded around the country by ones own full name isnt it said mamie without however expressing much horror in her face  they think it much more respectful than to call you mamie he responded lightly and many of your admirers are middleaged men with a mediaeval style of compliment  ive discovered that amatory versifying wasnt entirely a youthful passion  colonel cash is about as fatal with a couplet as with a doublebarreled gun and scatters as terribly  judge butts and dr wilson have both discerned the resemblance of your gifts to those of venus and their own to apollo but dont undervalue those tributes miss mulrady he added more seriously  youll have thousands of admirers where you are going but youll be willing to admit in the end i think that none were more honest and respectful than your subjects at roughandready and red dog  he stopped and added in a graver tone does don caesar write poetry  he has something better to do said the young lady pertly  i can easily imagine that he returned mischievously it must be a pallid substitute for other opportunities  what did you come here for she asked suddenly  to see you  nonsense  you know what i mean  why did you ever leave sacramento to come here  i should think it would suit you so much better than this place  i suppose i was fired by your fathers example and wished to find a gold mine  men like you never do she said simply  is that a compliment miss mulrady  i dont know  but i think that you think that it is  he gave her the pleased look of one who had unexpectedly found a sympathetic intelligence  do i  this is interesting  lets sit down  in their desultory rambling they had reached quite unconsciously the large boulder at the roadside  mamie hesitated a moment looked up and down the road and then with an already opulent indifference to the damaging of her spotless skirt sat herself upon it with her furled parasol held by her two little hands thrown over her halfdrawnup knee  the young editor half sitting half leaning against the stone began to draw figures in the sand with his cane  on the contrary miss mulrady i hope to make some money here you are leaving roughandready because you are rich  we are coming to it because we are poor  we echoed mamie lazily looking up the road  yes  my father and two sisters  i am sorry  i might have known them if i hadnt been going away at the same moment it flashed across her mind that if they were like the man before her they might prove disagreeably independent and critical is your father in business she asked  he shook his head  after a pause he said punctuating his sentences with the point of his stick in the soft dust he is paralyzed and out of his mind miss mulrady  i came to california to seek him as all news of him ceased three years since and i found him only two weeks ago alone friendlessan unrecognized pauper in the county hospital  two weeks ago  that was when i went to sacramento  very probably  it must have been very shocking to you  it was  i should think youd feel real bad  i do at times  he smiled and laid his stick on the stone you now see miss mulrady how necessary to me is this good fortune that you dont think me worthy of  meantime i must try to make a home for them at roughandready  miss mulrady put down her knee and her parasol  we mustnt stay here much longer you know  why  why the stagecoach comes by at about this time  and you think the passengers will observe us sitting here  of course they will  miss mulrady i implore you to stay  he was leaning over her with such apparent earnestness of voice and gesture that the color came into her cheek  for a moment she scarcely dared to lift her conscious eyes to his  when she did so she suddenly glanced her own aside with a flash of anger  he was laughing  if you have any pity for me do not leave me now he repeated stay a moment longer and my fortune is made  the passengers will report us all over red dog as engaged  i shall be supposed to be in your fathers secrets and shall be sought after as a director of all the new companies  the record will double its circulation poetry will drop out of its columns advertising rush to fill its place and i shall receive five dollars a week more salary if not seven and a half never mind the consequences to yourself at such a moment  i assure you there will be none  you can deny it the next dayi will deny itnay more the record itself will deny it in an extra edition of one thousand copies at ten cents each  linger a moment longer miss mulrady  fly oh fly not yet  theyre cominghark oh  by jove its only don caesar  it was indeed only the young scion of the house of alvarado blueeyed sallowskinned and highshouldered coming towards them on a fiery halfbroken mustang whose very spontaneous lawlessness seemed to accentuate and bring out the grave and decorous ease of his rider even in his burlesque preoccupation the editor of the record did not withhold his admiration of this perfect horsemanship  mamie who in her wounded amour propre would like to have made much of it to annoy her companion was thus estopped any ostentatious compliment  don caesar lifted his hat with sweet seriousness to the lady with grave courtesy to the gentleman  while the lower half of this centaur was apparently quivering with fury and stamping the ground in his evident desire to charge upon the pair the upper half with natural dignity looked from the one to the other as if to leave the privilege of an explanation with them  but mamie was too wise and her companion too indifferent to offer one  a slight shade passed over don caesars face  to complicate the situation at that moment the expected stagecoach came rattling by  with quick feminine intuition mamie caught in the faces of the driver and the expressman and reflected in the mischievous eyes of her companion a peculiar interpretation of their meeting that was not removed by the whispered assurance of the editor that the passengers were anxiously looking back to see the shooting  the young spaniard equally oblivious of humor or curiosity remained impassive  you know mr slinn of the record said mamie dont you  don caesar had never before met the senor esslinn  he was under the impression that it was a senor robinson that was of the record  oh he was shot said slinn  im taking his place  bueno  to be shot too  i trust not  slinn looked quickly and sharply into don caesars grave face  he seemed to be incapable of any double meaning  however as he had no serious reason for awakening don caesars jealousy and very little desire to become an embarrassing third in this conversation and possibly a burden to the young lady he proceeded to take his leave of her  from a sudden feminine revulsion of sympathy or from some unintelligible instinct of diplomacy mamie said as she extended her hand i hope youll find a home for your family near here  mamma wants pa to let our old house  perhaps it might suit you if not too far from your work  you might speak to ma about it  thank you i will responded the young man pressing her hand with unaffected cordiality  don caesar watched him until he had disappeared behind the wayside buckeyes  he is a man of familythis oneyour countryman  it seemed strange to her to have a mere acquaintance spoken of as her countrymannot the first time nor the last time in her career  as there appeared no trace or sign of jealousy in her questioners manner she answered briefly but vaguely  yes its a shocking story  his father disappeared some years ago and he has just found hima helpless paralyticin the sacramento hospital  hell have to support himand theyre very poor  so then they are not independent of each other alwaysthese fathers and children of americans  no said mamie shortly  without knowing why she felt inclined to resent don caesars manner  his serious gravitygentle and highbred as it was undoubtedlywas somewhat trying to her at times and seemed even more so after slinns irreverent humor  she picked up her parasol a little impatiently as if to go  but don caesar had already dismounted and tied his horse to a tree with a strong lariat that hung at his saddlebow  let us walk through the woods towards your home  i can return alone for the horse when you shall dismiss me  they turned in among the pines that overcrowding the hollow crept partly up the side of the hill of mulradys shaft  a disused trail almost hidden by the waxenhued yerba buena led from the highway and finally lost itself in the undergrowth  it was a lovers walk they were lovers evidently and yet the man was too selfpoised in his gravity the young woman too conscious and critical to suggest an absorbing or oblivious passion  i should not have made myself so obtrusive today before your friend said don caesar with proud humility but i could not understand from your mother whether you were alone or whether my company was desirable it is of this i have now to speak mamie lately your mother has seemed strange to me avoiding any reference to our affection treating it lightly and even as today i fancy putting obstacles in the way of our meeting alone  she was disappointed at your return from sacramento where i have been told she intended you to remain until you left the country and since your return i have seen you but twice  i may be wrong perhaps i do not comprehend the american mother i havewho knowsperhaps offended in some point of etiquette omitted some ceremony that was her due  but when you told me mamie that it was not necessary to speak to her first that it was not the american fashion  mamie started and blushed slightly  yes she said hurriedly certainly but ma has been quite queer of late and she may thinkyou knowthat sincesince there has been so much property to dispose of she ought to have been consulted  then let us consult her at once dear child  and as to the property in heavens name let her dispose of it as she will saints forbid that an alvarado should ever interfere  and what is it to us my little one  enough that dona mameta alvarado will never have less state than the richest bride that ever came to los gatos  mamie had not forgotten that scarcely a month ago even had she loved the man before her no more than she did at present she would still have been thrilled with delight at these words  even now she was movedconscious as she had become that the state of a bride of the alvarados was not all she had imagined and that the bare adobe court of los gatos was open to the sky and the free criticism of sacramento capitalists  yes dear she murmured with a half childlike pleasure that lit up her face and eyes so innocently that it stopped any minute investigation into its origin and real meaning  yes dear but we need not have a fuss made about it at present and perhaps put ma against us  she wouldnt hear of our marrying now and she might forbid our engagement  but you are going away  i should have to go to new york or europe first you know she answered naively even if it were all settled  i should have to get things  one couldnt be decent here  with the recollection of the pink cotton gown in which she had first pledged her troth to him before his eyes he said but you are charming now  you cannot be more so to me  if i am satisfied little one with you as you are let us go together and then you can get dresses to please others  she had not expected this importunity  really if it came to this she might have engaged herself to some one like slinn he at least would have understood her  he was much cleverer and certainly more of a man of the world  when slinn had treated her like a child it was with the humorous tolerance of an admiring superior and not the didactic impulse of a guardian  she did not say this nor did her pretty eyes indicate it as in the instance of her brief anger with slinn  she only said gently  i should have thought you of all men would have been particular about your wife doing the proper thing  but never mind  dont let us talk any more about it  perhaps as it seems such a great thing to you and so much trouble there may be no necessity for it at all  i do not think that the young lady deliberately planned this charmingly illogical deduction from don caesars speech or that she calculated its effect upon him but it was part of her nature to say it and profit by it  under the unjust lash of it his pride gave way  ah do you not see why i wish to go with you he said with sudden and unexpected passion  you are beautiful you are good it has pleased heaven to make you rich also but you are a child in experience and know not your own heart  with your beauty your goodness and your wealth you will attract all to youas you do herebecause you cannot help it  but you will be equally helpless little one if they should attract you and you had no tie to fall back upon  it was an unfortunate speech  the words were don caesars but the thought she had heard before from her mother although the deduction had been of a very different kind  mamie followed the speaker with bright but visionary eyes  there must be some truth in all this  her mother had said it mr slinn had laughingly admitted it  she had a brilliant future before her  was she right in making it impossible by a rash and foolish tie  he himself had said she was inexperienced she knew it and yet what was he doing now but taking advantage of that inexperience  if he really loved her he would be willing to submit to the test  she did not ask a similar one from him and was willing if she came out of it free to marry him just the same  there was something so noble in this thought that she felt for a moment carried away by an impulse of compassionate unselfishness and smiled tenderly as she looked up in his face  then you consent mamie he said eagerly passing his arm around her waist  not now caesar she said gently disengaging herself  i must think it over we are both too young to act upon it rashly it would be unfair to you who are so quiet and have seen so few girlsi mean americansto tie yourself to the first one you have known  when i am gone you will go more into the world  there are mr slinns two sisters coming herei shouldnt wonder if they were far cleverer and talked far better than i doand think how i should feel if i knew that only a wretched pledge to me kept you from loving them  she stopped and cast down her eyes  it was her first attempt at coquetry for in her usual charming selfishness she was perfectly frank and open and it might not have been her last but she had gone too far at first and was not prepared for a recoil of her own argument  if you admit that it is possiblethat it is possible to you he said quickly  she saw her mistake  we may not have many opportunities to meet alone she answered quietly and i am sure we would be happier when we meet not to accuse each other of impossibilities  let us rather see how we can communicate together if anything should prevent our meeting  remember it was only by chance that you were able to see me now  if ma has believed that she ought to have been consulted our meeting together in this secret way will only make matters worse  she is even now wondering where i am and may be suspicious  i must go back at once  at any moment some one may come here looking for me  but i have so much to say he pleaded  our time has been so short  you can write  but what will your mother think of that he said in grave astonishment  she colored again as she returned quickly of course you must not write to the house  you can leave a letter somewhere for mesay somewhere about here  stop she added with a sudden girlish gayety see heres the very place  look there  she pointed to the decayed trunk of a blasted sycamore a few feet from the trail  a cavity breast high half filled with skeleton leaves and pinenuts showed that it had formerly been a squirrels hoard but for some reason had been deserted  look its a regular letterbox she continued gayly rising on tiptoe to peep into its recesses  don caesar looked at her admiringly it seemed like a return to their first idyllic lovemaking in the old days when she used to steal out of the cabbage rows in her brown linen apron and sunbonnet to walk with him in the woods  he recalled the fact to her with the fatality of a lover already seeking to restore in past recollections something that was wanting in the present  she received it with the impatience of youth to whom the present is all sufficient  i wonder how you could ever have cared for me in that holland apron she said looking down upon her new dress  shall i tell you why he said fondly passing his arm around her waist and drawing her pretty head nearer his shoulder  nonot now she said laughingly but struggling to free herself theres not time  write it and put it in the box there she added hastily listenwhats that  its only a squirrel he whispered reassuringly in her ear  no its somebody coming  i must go  please  caesar dear there then  she met his kiss halfway released herself with a lithe movement of her wrist and shoulder and the next moment seemed to slip into the woods and was gone  don caesar listened with a sigh as the last rustling ceased cast a look at the decayed tree as if to fix it in his memory and then slowly retraced his steps towards his tethered mustang  he was right however in his surmise of the cause of that interruption  a pair of bright eyes had been watching them from the bough of an adjacent tree  it was a squirrel who having had serious and prior intentions of making use of the cavity they had discovered had only withheld examination by an apparent courteous discretion towards the intruding pair  now that they were gone he slipped down the tree and ran towards the decayed stump    chapter iii  apparently dissatisfied with the result of an investigation which proved that the cavity was unfit as a treasure hoard for a discreet squirrel whatever its value as a receptacle for the lovetokens of incautious humanity the little animal at once set about to put things in order  he began by whisking out an immense quantity of dead leaves disturbed a family of treespiders dissipated a drove of patient aphides browsing in the bark as well as their attendant dairymen the ants and otherwise ruled it with the high hand of dispossession and a contemptuous opinion of the previous incumbents  it must not be supposed however that his proceedings were altogether free from contemporaneous criticism a venerable crow sitting on a branch above him displayed great interest in his occupation and hopping down a few moments afterwards disposed of some wormeaten nuts a few larvae and an insect or two with languid dignity and without prejudice  certain incumbrances however still resisted the squirrels general eviction among them a folded square of paper with sharply defined edges that declined investigation and owing to a nauseous smell of tobacco escaped nibbling as it had apparently escaped insect ravages  this owing to its sharp angles which persisted in catching in the soft decaying wood in his whirlwind of housecleaning he allowed to remain having thus in a general way prepared for the coming winter the selfsatisfied little rodent dismissed the subject from his active mind  his rage and indignation a few days later may be readily conceived when he found on returning to his newmade home another square of paper folded like the first but much fresher and whiter lying within the cavity on top of some moss which had evidently been placed there for the purpose  this he felt was really more than he could bear but it was smaller and with a few energetic kicks and whisks of his tail he managed to finally dislodge it through the opening where it fell ignominiously to the earth  the eager eyes of the everattendant crow however instantly detected it he flew to the ground and turning it over examined it gravely  it was certainly not edible but it was exceedingly rare and as an old collector of curios he felt he could not pass it by  he lifted it in his beak and with a desperate struggle against the superincumbent weight regained the branch with his prize  here by one of those delicious vagaries of animal nature he apparently at once discharged his mind of the whole affair became utterly oblivious of it allowed it to drop without the least concern and eventually flew away with an abstracted air as if he had been another bird entirely  the paper got into a manzanita bush where it remained suspended until the evening when being dislodged by a passing wildcat on its way to mulradys henroost it gave that delicately sensitive marauder such a turn that she fled into the adjacent county  but the troubles of the squirrel were not yet over  on the following day the young man who had accompanied the young woman returned to the trunk and the squirrel had barely time to make his escape before the impatient visitor approached the opening of the cavity peered into it and even passed his hand through its recesses  the delight visible upon his anxious and serious face at the disappearance of the letter and the apparent proof that it had been called for showed him to have been its original depositor and probably awakened a remorseful recollection in the dark bosom of the omnipresent crow who uttered a consciousstricken croak from the bough above him  but the young man quickly disappeared again and the squirrel was once more left in undisputed possession  a week passed  a weary anxious interval to don caesar who had neither seen nor heard from mamie since their last meeting  too conscious of his own selfrespect to call at the house after the equivocal conduct of mrs mulrady and too proud to haunt the lanes and approaches in the hope of meeting her daughter like an ordinary lover he hid his gloomy thoughts in the monastic shadows of the courtyard at los gatos or found relief in furious riding at night and early morning on the highway  once or twice the upstage had been overtaken and passed by a rushing figure as shadowy as a phantom horseman with only the starlike point of a cigarette to indicate its humanity  it was in one of these fierce recreations that he was obliged to stop in early morning at the blacksmiths shop at roughandready to have a loosened horseshoe replaced and while waiting picked up a newspaper  don caesar seldom read the papers but noticing that this was the record he glanced at its columns  a familiar name suddenly flashed out of the dark type like a spark from the anvil  with a brain and heart that seemed to be beating in unison with the blacksmiths sledge he read as follows  our distinguished fellowtownsman alvin mulrady esq left town day before yesterday to attend an important meeting of directors of the red dog ditch company in san francisco  society will regret to hear that mrs mulrady and her beautiful and accomplished daughter who are expecting to depart for europe at the end of the month anticipated the event nearly a fortnight by taking this opportunity of accompanying mr mulrady as far as san francisco on their way to the east  mrs and miss mulrady intend to visit london paris and berlin and will be absent three years  it is possible that mr mulrady may join them later at one or other of those capitals  considerable disappointment is felt that a more extended leavetaking was not possible and that under the circumstances no opportunity was offered for a send off suitable to the condition of the parties and the esteem in which they are held in roughandready  the paper dropped from his hands  gone and without a word  no that was impossible  there must be some mistake she had written the letter had miscarried she must have sent word to los gatos and the stupid messenger had blundered she had probably appointed another meeting or expected him to follow to san francisco  the day before yesterday  it was the mornings papershe had been gone scarcely two daysit was not too late yet to receive a delayed message by post by some forgetful handbyahthe tree  of course it was in the tree and he had not been there for a week why had he not thought of it before  the fault was his not hers perhaps she had gone away believing him faithless or a country boor  in the name of the devil will you keep me here till eternity  the blacksmith stared at him  don caesar suddenly remembered that he was speaking as he was thinkingin spanish  ten dollars my friend if you have done in five minutes  the man laughed  thats good enough american he said beginning to quicken his efforts  don caesar again took up the paper  there was another paragraph that recalled his last interview with mamie  mr harry slinn jr the editor of this paper has just moved into the pioneer house formerly occupied by alvin mulrady esq which has already become historic in the annals of the county  mr slinn brings with him his fatherh j slinn esqand his two sisters  mr slinn sen who has been suffering for many years from complete paralysis we understand is slowly improving and it is by the advice of his physicians that he has chosen the invigorating air of the foothills as a change to the debilitating heat of sacramento  the affair had been quickly settled certainly reflected don caesar with a slight chill of jealousy as he thought of mamies interest in the young editor  but the next moment he dismissed it from his mind all except a dull consciousness that if she really loved himdon caesaras he loved her she could not have assisted in throwing into his society the young sisters of the editor who she expected might be so attractive  within the five minutes the horse was ready and don caesar in the saddle again  in less than half an hour he was at the wayside boulder here he picketed his horse and took the narrow foottrail through the hollow  it did not take him long to reach their old trystingplace with a beating heart he approached the decaying trunk and looked into the cavity  there was no letter there  a few blackened nuts and some of the dry moss he had put there were lying on the ground at its roots  he could not remember whether they were there when he had last visited the spot  he began to grope in the cavity with both hands  his fingers struck against the sharp angles of a flat paper packet a thrill of joy ran through them and stopped his beating heart he drew out the hidden object and was chilled with disappointment  it was an ordinarysized envelope of yellowishbrown paper bearing besides the usual government stamp the official legend of an express company and showing its age as much by this record of a now obsolete carrying service as by the discoloration of time and atmosphere  its weight which was heavier than that of any ordinary letter of the same size and thickness was evidently due to some loose enclosures that slightly rustled and could be felt by the fingers like minute pieces of metal or grains of gravel it was within don caesars experience that gold specimens were often sent in that manner  it was in a state of singular preservation except the address which being written in pencil was scarcely discernible and even when deciphered appeared to be incoherent and unfinished  the unknown correspondent had written dear mary and then mrs mary slinn with an unintelligible scrawl following for the direction  if don caesars mind had not been lately preoccupied with the name of the editor he would hardly have guessed the superscription  in his cruel disappointment and fully aroused indignation he at once began to suspect a connection of circumstances which at any other moment he would have thought purely accidental or perhaps not have considered at all  the cavity in the tree had evidently been used as a secret receptacle for letters before did mamie know it at the time and how did she know it  the apparent age of the letter made it preposterous to suppose that it pointed to any secret correspondence of hers with young mr slinn and the address was not in her handwriting was there any secret previous intimacy between the families  there was but one way in which he could connect this letter with mamies faithlessness  it was an infamous a grotesquely horrible idea a thought which sprang as much from his inexperience of the world and his habitual suspiciousness of all humor as anything else  it was that the letter was a brutal joke of slinnsa joke perhaps concocted by mamie and himselfa parting insult that should at the last moment proclaim their treachery and his own credulity  doubtless it contained a declaration of their shame and the reason why she had fled from him without a word of explanation  and the enclosure of course was some significant and degrading illustration  those americans are full of those low conceits it was their national vulgarity  he had the letter in his angry hand  he could break it open if he wished and satisfy himself but it was not addressed to him and the instinct of honor strong even in his rage was the instinct of an adversary as well  no slinn should open the letter before him slinn should explain everything and answer for it  if it was nothinga mere accidentit would lead to some general explanation and perhaps even news of mamie  but he would arraign slinn and at once  he put the letter in his pocket quickly retraced his steps to his horse and putting spurs to the animal followed the high road to the gate of mulradys pioneer cabin  he remembered it well enough  to a cultivated taste it was superior to the more pretentious new house  during the first year of mulradys tenancy the plain square logcabin had received those additions and attractions which only a tenant can conceive and actual experience suggest and in this way the hideous right angles were broken with sheds leanto extensions until a certain picturesqueness was given to the irregularity of outline and a homelike security and companionship to the congregated buildings  it typified the former life of the great capitalist as the tall new house illustrated the loneliness and isolation that wealth had given him but the real points of vantage were the years of cultivation and habitation that had warmed and enriched the soil and evoked the climbing vines and roses that already hid its unpainted boards rounded its hard outlines and gave projection and shadow from the pitiless glare of a summers long sun or broke the steady beating of the winter rains  it was true that pea and bean poles surrounded it on one side and the only access to the house was through the cabbage rows that once were the pride and sustenance of the mulradys  it was this fact more than any other that had impelled mrs mulrady to abandon its site she did not like to read the history of their humble origin reflected in the faces of their visitors as they entered  don caesar tied his horse to the fence and hurriedly approached the house  the door however hospitably opened when he was a few paces from it and when he reached the threshold he found himself unexpectedly in the presence of two pretty girls  they were evidently slinns sisters whom he had neither thought of nor included in the meeting he had prepared  in spite of his preoccupation he felt himself suddenly embarrassed not only by the actual distinction of their beauty but by a kind of likeness that they seemed to bear to mamie  we saw you coming said the elder unaffectedly  you are don caesar alvarado  my brother has spoken of you  the words recalled don caesar to himself and a sense of courtesy he was not here to quarrel with these fair strangers at their first meeting he must seek slinn elsewhere and at another time  the frankness of his reception and the allusion to their brother made it appear impossible that they should be either a party to his disappointment or even aware of it  his excitement melted away before a certain lazy ease which the consciousness of their beauty seemed to give them  he was able to put a few courteous inquiries and thanks to the paragraph in the record to congratulate them upon their fathers improvement  oh pa is a great deal better in his health and has picked up even in the last few days so that he is able to walk round with crutches said the elder sister  the air here seems to invigorate him wonderfully  and you know esther said the younger i think he begins to take more notice of things especially when he is outofdoors  he looks around on the scenery and his eye brightens as if he knew all about it and sometimes he knits his brows and looks down so as if he was trying to remember  you know i suppose exclaimed esther that since his seizure his memory has been a blankthat is three or four years of his life seem to have been dropped out of his recollection  it might be a mercy sometimes senora said don caesar with a grave sigh as he looked at the delicate features before him which recalled the face of the absent mamie  thats not very complimentary said the younger girl laughingly for pa didnt recognize us and only remembered us as little girls  vashti interrupted esther rebukingly then turning to don caesar she added my sister vashti means that father remembers more what happened before he came to california when we were quite young than he does of the interval that elapsed  dr duchesne says its a singular case  he thinks that with his present progress he will recover the perfect use of his limbs though his memory may never come back again  unless  you forget what the doctor told us this morning interrupted vashti again briskly  i was going to say it said esther a little curtly  unless he has another stroke  then he will either die or recover his mind entirely  don caesar glanced at the bright faces a trifle heightened in color by their eager recital and the slight rivalry of narration and looked grave  he was a little shocked at a certain lack of sympathy and tenderness towards their unhappy parent  they seemed to him not only to have caught that dry curious toleration of helplessness which characterizes even relationship in its attendance upon chronic suffering and weakness but to have acquired an unconscious habit of turning it to account  in his present sensitive condition he even fancied that they flirted mildly over their parents infirmity  my brother harry has gone to red dog continued esther hell be right sorry to have missed you  mrs mulrady spoke to him about you you seem to have been great friends  i spose you knew her daughter mamie i hear she is very pretty  although don caesar was now satisfied that the slinns knew nothing of mamies singular behavior to him he felt embarrassed by this conversation  miss mulrady is very pretty he said with grave courtesy it is a custom of her race  she left suddenly he added with affected calmness  i reckon she did calculate to stay here longerso her mother said but the whole thing was settled a week ago  i know my brother was quite surprised to hear from mr mulrady that if we were going to decide about this house we must do it at once he had an idea himself about moving out of the big one into this when they left  mamie mulrady hadnt much to keep her here considerin the money and the good looks she has i reckon said vashti  she isnt the sort of girl to throw herself away in the wilderness when she can pick and choose elsewhere  i only wonder she ever come back from sacramento they talk about papa mulrady having business at san francisco and that hurrying them off  depend upon it that business was mamie herself her wish is gospel to them  if shed wanted to stay and have a farewell party old mulradys business would have been nowhere  aint you a little rough on mamie said esther who had been quietly watching the young mans face with her large languid eyes considering that we dont know her and havent even the right of friends to criticise  i dont call it rough returned vashti frankly for id do the same if i were in her shoesand theyre fourandahalves for harry told me so  give me her money and her looks and you wouldnt catch me hanging round these diggingsgoin to choir meetings saturdays church sundays and buggyriding once a monthfor society  nomamies head was levelyou bet  don caesar rose hurriedly  they would present his compliments to their father and he would endeavor to find their brother at red dog  he alas had neither father mother nor sister but if they would receive his aunt the dona inez sepulvida the next sunday when she came from mass she should be honored and he would be delighted  it required all his selfpossession to deliver himself of this formal courtesy before he could take his leave and on the back of his mustang give way to the rage disgust and hatred of everything connected with mamie that filled his heart  conscious of his disturbance but not entirely appreciating their own share in it the two girls somewhat wickedly prolonged the interview by following him into the garden  well if you must leave now said esther at last languidly it aint much out of your way to go down through the garden and take a look at pa as you go  hes somewhere down there near the woods and we dont like to leave him alone too long  you might pass the time of day with him see if hes right side up  vashti and i have got a heap of things to fix here yet but if anythings wrong with him you can call us  solong  don caesar was about to excuse himself hurriedly but that sudden and acute perception of all kindred sorrow which belongs to refined suffering checked his speech  the loneliness of the helpless old man in this atmosphere of active and youthful selfishness touched him  he bowed assent and turned aside into one of the long perspectives of beanpoles  the girls watched him until out of sight  well said vashti dont tell me  but if there wasnt something between him and that mamie mulrady i dont know a jilted man when i see him  well you neednt have let him see that you knew it so that any civility of ours would look as if we were ready to take up with her leavings responded esther astutely as the girls reentered the house  meantime the unconscious object of their criticism walked sadly down the old marketgarden whose rude outlines and homely details he once clothed with the poetry of a sensitive mans first love well it was a common cabbage field and potato patch after all  in his disgust he felt conscious of even the loss of that sense of patronage and superiority which had invested his affection for a girl of meaner condition  his selfrespect was humiliated with his love  the soil and dirt of those wretched cabbages had clung to him but not to her it was she who had gone higher it was he who was left in the vulgar ruins of his misplaced passion  he reached the bottom of the garden without observing any sign of the lonely invalid  he looked up and down the cabbage rows and through the long perspective of peavines without result  there was a newer trail leading from a gap in the pines to the wooded hollow which undoubtedly intersected the little path that he and mamie had once followed from the high road  if the old man had taken this trail he had possibly overtasked his strength and there was the more reason why he should continue his search and render any assistance if required  there was another idea that occurred to him which eventually decided him to go on  it was that both these trails led to the decayed sycamore stump and that the older slinn might have something to do with the mysterious letter  quickening his steps through the field he entered the hollow and reached the intersecting trail as he expected  to the right it lost itself in the dense woods in the direction of the ominous stump to the left it descended in nearly a straight line to the highway now plainly visible as was equally the boulder on which he had last discovered mamie sitting with young slinn  if he were not mistaken there was a figure sitting there now it was surely a man  and by that halfbowed helpless attitude the object of his search  it did not take him long to descend the track to the highway and approach the stranger  he was seated with his hands upon his knees gazing in a vague absorbed fashion upon the hillside now crowned with the enginehouse and chimney that marked the site of mulradys shaft he started slightly and looked up as don caesar paused before him the young man was surprised to see that the unfortunate man was not as old as he had expected and that his expression was one of quiet and beatified contentment  your daughters told me you were here said don caesar with gentle respect  i am caesar alvarado your not very far neighbor very happy to pay his respects to you as he has to them  my daughters said the old man vaguely  oh yes nice little girls  and my boy harry  did you see harry  fine little fellow harry  i am glad to hear that you are better said don caesar hastily and that the air of our country does you no harm  god benefit you senor he added with a profoundly reverential gesture dropping unconsciously into the religious habit of his youth  may he protect you and bring you back to health and happiness  happiness said slinn amazedly  i am happyvery happy  i have everything i want good air good food good clothes pretty little children kind friends  he smiled benignantly at don caesar  god is very good to me  indeed he seemed very happy and his face albeit crowned with white hair unmarked by care and any disturbing impression had so much of satisfied youth in it that the grave features of his questioner made him appear the elder  nevertheless don caesar noticed that his eyes when withdrawn from him sought the hillside with the same visionary abstraction  it is a fine view senor esslinn said don caesar  it is a beautiful view sir said slinn turning his happy eyes upon him for a moment only to rest them again on the green slope opposite  beyond that hill which you are looking atnot far senor esslinni live  you shall come and see me thereyou and your family  youyoulive there stammered the invalid with a troubled expressionthe first and only change to the complete happiness that had hitherto suffused his face  youand your name isis ma  alvarado said don caesar gently  caesar alvarado  you said masters said the old man with sudden querulousness  no good friend  i said alvarado returned don caesar gravely  if you didnt say masters how could i say it  i dont know any masters  don caesar was silent  in another moment the happy tranquillity returned to slinns face and don caesar continued  it is not a long walk over the hill though it is far by the road when you are better you shall try it  yonder little trail leads to the top of the hill and then  he stopped for the invalids face had again assumed its troubled expression  partly to change his thoughts and partly for some inexplicable idea that had suddenly seized him don caesar continued  there is a strange old stump near the trail and in it a hole  in the hole i found this letter  he stopped againthis time in alarm slinn had staggered to his feet with ashen and distorted features and was glancing at the letter which don caesar had drawn from his pocket the muscles of his throat swelled as if he was swallowing his lips moved but no sound issued from them  at last with a convulsive effort he regained a disjointed speech in a voice scarcely audible  my letter my letter  its mine  give it me  its my fortuneall mine  in the tunnelhill  masters stole itstole my fortune  stole it all  see see  he seized the letter from don caesar with trembling hands and tore it open forcibly a few dull yellow grains fell from it heavily like shot to the ground  see its true  my letter  my gold  my strike  mymymy god  a tremor passed over his face  the hand that held the letter suddenly dropped sheer and heavy as the gold had fallen  the whole side of his face and body nearest don caesar seemed to drop and sink into itself as suddenly  at the same moment and without a word he slipped through don caesars outstretched hands to the ground  don caesar bent quickly over him but no longer than to satisfy himself that he lived and breathed although helpless  he then caught up the fallen letter and glancing over it with flashing eyes thrust it and the few specimens in his pocket  he then sprang to his feet so transformed with energy and intelligence that he seemed to have added the lost vitality of the man before him to his own  he glanced quickly up and down the highway every moment to him was precious now but he could not leave the stricken man in the dust of the road nor could he carry him to the house nor having alarmed his daughters could he abandon his helplessness to their feeble arms  he remembered that his horse was still tied to the garden fence  he would fetch it and carry the unfortunate man across the saddle to the gate  he lifted him with difficulty to the boulder and ran rapidly up the road in the direction of his tethered steed  he had not proceeded far when he heard the noise of wheels behind him  it was the up stage coming furiously along  he would have called to the driver for assistance but even through that fastsweeping cloud of dust and motion he could see that the man was utterly oblivious of anything but the speed of his rushing chariot and had even risen in his box to lash the infuriated and frightened animals forward  an hour later when the coach drew up at the red dog hotel the driver descended from the box white but taciturn  when he had swallowed a glass of whiskey at a single gulp he turned to the astonished express agent who had followed him in  one of two things jim hez got to happen he said huskily either that there rock hez got to get off the road or i have ive seed him on it agin    chapter iv  no further particulars of the invalids second attack were known than those furnished by don caesars brief statement that he had found him lying insensible on the boulder  this seemed perfectly consistent with the theory of dr duchesne and as the young spaniard left los gatos the next day he escaped not only the active reporter of the record but the perusal of a grateful paragraph in the next days paper recording his prompt kindness and courtesy  dr duchesnes prognosis however seemed at fault the elder slinn did not succumb to this second stroke nor did he recover his reason  he apparently only relapsed into his former physical weakness losing the little ground he had gained during the last month and exhibiting no change in his mental condition unless the fact that he remembered nothing of his seizure and the presence of don caesar could be considered as favorable  dr duchesnes gravity seemed to give that significance to this symptom and his crossquestioning of the patient was characterized by more than his usual curtness  you are sure you dont remember walking in the garden before you were ill he said  come think again  you must remember that the old mans eyes wandered restlessly around the room but he answered by a negative shake of his head  and you dont remember sitting down on a stone by the road  the old man kept his eyes resolutely fixed on the bedclothes before him  no he said with a certain sharp decision that was new to him  the doctors eye brightened  all right old man then dont  on his way out he took the eldest miss slinn aside  hell do he said grimly hes beginning to lie  why he only said he didnt remember responded esther  that was because he didnt want to remember said the doctor authoritatively  the brain is acting on some impression that is either painful and unpleasant or so vague that he cant formulate it he is conscious of it and wont attempt it yet  its a heap better than his old selfsatisfied incoherency  a few days later when the fact of slinns identification with the paralytic of three years ago by the stagedriver became generally known the doctor came in quite jubilant  its all plain now he said decidedly  that second stroke was caused by the nervous shock of his coming suddenly upon the very spot where he had the first one  it proved that his brain still retained old impressions but as this first act of his memory was a painful one the strain was too great  it was mighty unlucky but it was a good sign  and you think then hesitated harry slinn  i think said dr duchesne that this activity still exists and the proof of it as i said before is that he is trying now to forget it and avoid thinking of it  you will find that he will fight shy of any allusion to it and will be cunning enough to dodge it every time  he certainly did  whether the doctors hypothesis was fairly based or not it was a fact that when he was first taken out to drive with his watchful physician he apparently took no notice of the boulderwhich still remained on the roadside thanks to the later practical explanation of the stagedrivers visionand curtly refused to talk about it  but more significant to duchesne and perhaps more perplexing was a certain morose abstraction which took the place of his former vacuity of contentment and an intolerance of his attendants which supplanted his old habitual trustfulness to their care that had been varied only by the occasional querulousness of an invalid  his daughters sometimes found him regarding them with an attention little short of suspicion and even his son detected a halfsuppressed aversion in his interviews with him  referring this among themselves to his unfortunate malady his children perhaps justified this estrangement by paying very little attention to it  they were more pleasantly occupied  the two girls succeeded to the position held by mamie mulrady in the society of the neighborhood and divided the attentions of roughandready  the young editor of the record had really achieved through his supposed intimacy with the mulradys the good fortune he had jestingly prophesied  the disappearance of don caesar was regarded as a virtual abandonment of the field to his rival and the general opinion was that he was engaged to the millionaires daughter on a certain probation of work and influence in his prospective fatherinlaws interests  he became successful in one or two speculations the magic of the lucky mulradys name befriending him  in the superstition of the mining community much of this luck was due to his having secured the old cabin  to think remarked one of the augurs of red dog french pete a polyglot jester that while every fool went to taking up claims where the gold had already been found no one thought of stepping into the old mans old choux in the cabbagegarden  any doubt however of the alliance of the families was dissipated by the intimacy that sprang up between the elder slinn and the millionaire after the latters return from san francisco  it began in a strange kind of pity for the physical weakness of the man which enlisted the sympathies of mulrady whose great strength had never been deteriorated by the luxuries of wealth and who was still able to set his workmen an example of hard labor it was sustained by a singular and superstitious reverence for his mental condition which to the paternal mulrady seemed to possess that spiritual quality with which popular ignorance invests demented people  then you mean to say that during these three years the vein o your mind so to speak was a lost lead and sorter dropped out o sight or follerin queried mulrady with infinite seriousness  yes returned slinn with less impatience than he usually showed to questions  and durin that time when you was dried up and waitin for rain i reckon you kinder had visions  a cloud passed over slinns face  of course of course said mulrady a little frightened at his tenacity in questioning the oracle  natrally this was private and not to be talked about  i meant you had plenty of room for em without crowdin you kin tell me some day when youre better and kin sorter select whats points and what aint  perhaps i may some day said the invalid gloomily glancing in the direction of his preoccupied daughters when were alone  when his physical strength had improved and his left arm and side had regained a feeble but slowly gathering vitality alvin mulrady one day surprised the family by bringing the convalescent a pile of letters and accounts and spreading them on a board before slinns invalid chair with the suggestion that he should look over arrange and docket them the idea seemed preposterous until it was found that the old man was actually able to perform this service and exhibited a degree of intellectual activity and capacity for this kind of work that was unsuspected  dr duchesne was delighted and divided with admiration between his patients progress and the millionaires sagacity  and there are envious people said the enthusiastic doctor who believe that a man like him who could conceive of such a plan for occupying a weak intellect without taxing its memory or judgment is merely a lucky fool  look here  may be it didnt require much brains to stumble on a gold mine and it is a gift of providence  but in my experience providence dont go round buyin up dd fools or investin in dead beats  when mr slinn finally with the aid of crutches was able to hobble every day to the imposing countinghouse and the office of mr mulrady which now occupied the lower part of the new house and contained some of its gorgeous furniture he was installed at a rosewood desk behind mr mulradys chair as his confidential clerk and private secretary the astonishment of red dog and roughandready at this singular innovation knew no bounds but the boldness and novelty of the idea carried everything before it  judge butts the oracle of roughandready delivered its decision hes got a man whos physically incapable of running off with his money and has no memory to run off with his ideas  how could he do better even his own son harry coming upon his father thus installed was for a moment struck with a certain filial respect and for a day or two patronized him  in this capacity slinn became the confidant not only of mulradys business secrets but of his domestic affairs  he knew that young mulrady from a frecklefaced slow country boy had developed into a frecklefaced fast city man with coarse habits of drink and gambling it was through the old mans hands that extravagant bills and shameful claims passed on their way to be cashed by mulrady it was he that at last laid before the father one day his signature perfectly forged by the son  your eyes are not ez good ez mine you know slinn said mulrady gravely  its all right  i sometimes make my ys like that  id clean forgot to cash that check  you must not think youve got the monopoly of disremembering he added with a faint laugh  equally through slinns hands passed the record of the lavish expenditure of mrs mulrady and the fair mamie as well as the chronicle of their movements and fashionable triumphs  as mulrady had already noticed that slinn had no confidence with his own family he did not try to withhold from them these domestic details possibly as an offset to the dreary catalogue of his sons misdeeds but more often in the hope of gaining from the taciturn old man some comment that might satisfy his innocent vanity as father and husband and perhaps dissipate some doubts that were haunting him  twelve hundred dollars looks to be a good figger for a dress aint it  but malviny knows i reckon what ought to be worn at the tooilleries and she dont want our mamie to take a back seat before them furrin princesses and gran dukes  its a slapup affair i kalkilate  lets see  i disremember whether its an emperor or a king thats rulin over thar now  it must be suthin first class and a1 for malviny aint the woman to throw away twelve hundred dollars on any of them smallpotato despots  she says mamie speaks french already like them french petes  i dont quite make out what she means here she met don caesar in paris and she says i think mamie is nearly off with don caesar who has followed her here  i dont care about her dropping him too suddenly the reason ill tell you hereafter  i think the man might be a dangerous enemy  now what do you make of this  i allus thought mamie rather cottoned to him and it was the old woman who fought shy thinkin mamie would do better  now i am agreeable that my gal should marry any one she likes whether its a dook or a poor man as long as hes on the square  i was ready to take don caesar but now things seem to have shifted round  as to don caesars being a dangerous enemy if mamie wont have him thats a little too high and mighty for me and i wonder the old woman dont make him climb down  what do you think  who is don caesar asked slinn  the man what picked you up that day  i mean continued mulrady seeing the marks of evident ignorance on the old mans facei mean a sort of grave genteel chap suthin between a parson and a circusrider  you might have seen him round the house talkin to your gals  but slinns entire forgetfulness of don caesar was evidently unfeigned whatever sudden accession of memory he had at the time of his attack the incident that caused it had no part in his recollection  with the exception of these rare intervals of domestic confidences with his crippled private secretary mulrady gave himself up to moneygetting without any especial faculty for itan easy prey often to unscrupulous financiershis unfailing luck however carried him safely through until his very mistakes seemed to be simply insignificant means to a large significant end and a part of his original plan  he sank another shaft at a great expense with a view to following the lead he had formerly found against the opinions of the best mining engineers and struck the artesian spring he did not find at that time with a volume of water that enabled him not only to work his own mine but to furnish supplies to his less fortunate neighbors at a vast profit a league of tangled forest and canyon behind roughandready for which he had paid don ramons heirs an extravagant price in the presumption that it was auriferous furnished the most accessible timber to build the town at prices which amply remunerated him the practical schemes of experienced men the wildest visions of daring dreams delayed or abortive for want of capital eventually fell into his hands  men sneered at his methods but bought his shares  some who affected to regard him simply as a man of money were content to get only his name to any enterprise  courted by his superiors quoted by his equals and admired by his inferiors he bore his elevation equally without ostentation or dignity bidden to banquets and forced by his position as director or president into the usual gastronomic feats of that civilization and period he partook of simple food and continued his old habit of taking a cup of coffee with milk and sugar at dinner without professing temperance he drank sparingly in a community where alcoholic stimulation was a custom  with neither refinement nor an extended vocabulary he was seldom profane and never indelicate with nothing of the puritan in his manner or conversation he seemed to be as strange to the vices of civilization as he was to its virtues  that such a man should offer little to and receive little from the companionship of women of any kind was a foregone conclusion  without the dignity of solitude he was pathetically alone  meantime the days passed the first six months of his opulence were drawing to a close and in that interval he had more than doubled the amount of his discovered fortune  the rainy season set in early although it dissipated the clouds of dust under which nature and art seemed to be slowly disappearing it brought little beauty to the landscape at first and only appeared to lay bare the crudenesses of civilization  the unpainted wooden buildings of roughandready soaked and dripping with rain took upon themselves a sleek and shining ugliness as of secondhand garments the absence of cornices or projections to break the monotony of the long straight lines of downpour made the town appear as if it had been recently submerged every vestige of ornamentation swept away and only the bare outlines left  mud was everywhere the outer soil seemed to have risen and invaded the houses even to their most secret recesses as if outraged nature was trying to revenge herself  mud was brought into the saloons and barrooms and express offices on boots on clothes on baggage and sometimes appeared mysteriously in splashes of red color on the walls without visible conveyance  the dust of six months closely packed in cornice and carving yielded under the steady rain a thin yellow paint that dropped on wayfarers or unexpectedly oozed out of ceilings and walls on the wretched inhabitants within  the outskirts of roughandready and the dried hills round los gatos did not appear to fare much better the new vegetation had not yet made much headway against the dead grasses of the summer the pines in the hollow wept lugubriously into a small rivulet that had sprung suddenly into life near the old trail everywhere was the sound of dropping splashing gurgling or rushing waters  more hideous than ever the new mulrady house lifted itself against the leaden sky and stared with all its largeframed shutterless windows blankly on the prospect until they seemed to the wayfarer to become mere mirrors set in the walls reflecting only the watery landscape and unable to give the least indication of light or heat within nevertheless there was a fire in mulradys private office that december afternoon of a smoky intermittent variety that sufficed more to record the defects of hasty architecture than to comfort the millionaire and his private secretary who had lingered after the early withdrawal of the clerks  for the next day was christmas and out of deference to the near approach of this festivity a halfholiday had been given to the employees theyll want some of them to spend their money before tomorrow and others would like to be able to rise up comfortably drunk christmas morning the superintendent had suggested  mr mulrady had just signed a number of checks indicating his largess to those devoted adherents with the same unostentatious undemonstrative matteroffact manner that distinguished his ordinary business the men had received it with something of the same manner  a halfhumorous thank you siras if to show that with their patron they tolerated this deference to a popular custom but were a little ashamed of giving way to itexpressed their gratitude and their independence  i reckon that the old lady and mamie are having a high old time in some of them gilded pallises in st petersburg or berlin about this time  them diamonds that i ordered at tiffany ought to have reached em about now so that mamie could cut a swell at christmas with her warpaint  i suppose its the style to give presents in furrin countries ez it is here and i allowed to the old lady that whatever she orders in that way she is to do in californy styleno dollarjewelry and galvanizedwatches business  if she wants to make a present to any of them nobles ez has been purlite to her its got to be something that roughandready aint ashamed of  i showed you that pin mamie bought me in paris didnt i  its just come for my christmas present  no  i reckon i put it in the safe for them kind o things dont suit my style but spose i orter sport it tomorrow it was mighty thoughtful in mamie and it must cost a lump its got no slouch of a pearl in it  i wonder what mamie gave for it  you can easily tell the bill is here  you paid it yesterday said slinn  there was no satire in the mans voice nor was there the least perception of irony in mulradys manner as he returned quietly  thats so it was suthin like a thousand francs but french money when you pan it out as dollars and cents dont make so much after all  there was a few moments silence when he continued in the same tone of voice talkin o them things slinn ive got suthin for you  he stopped suddenly  ever watchful of any undue excitement in the invalid he had noticed a slight flush of disturbance pass over his face and continued carelessly but well talk it over tomorrow a day or two dont make much difference to you and me in such things you know praps ill drop in and see you  well be shut up here  then youre going out somewhere asked slinn mechanically  no said mulrady hesitatingly  it had suddenly occurred to him that he had nowhere to go if he wanted to and he continued half in explanation i aint reckoned much on christmas myself abners at the springs it wouldnt pay him to come here for a dayeven if there was anybody here he cared to see  i reckon ill hang round the shanty and look after things generally  i havent been over the house upstairs to put things to rights since the folks left  but you neednt come here you know  he helped the old man to rise assisted him in putting on his overcoat and than handed him the cane which had lately replaced his crutches  goodby old man  you musnt trouble yourself to say merry christmas now but wait until you see me again  take care of yourself  he slapped him lightly on the shoulder and went back into his private office  he worked for some time at his desk and then laid his pen aside put away his papers methodically placing a large envelope on his private secretarys vacant table  he then opened the office door and ascended the staircase  he stopped on the first landing to listen to the sound of rain on the glass skylight that seemed to echo through the empty hall like the gloomy roll of a drum  it was evident that the searching water had found out the secret sins of the houses construction for there were great fissures of discoloration in the white and gold paper in the corners of the wall  there was a strange odor of the dank forest in the mirrored drawingroom as if the rain had brought out the sap again from the unseasoned timbers the blue and white satin furniture looked cold and the marble mantels and centre tables had taken upon themselves the clamminess of tombstones  mr mulrady who had always retained his old farmerlike habit of taking off his coat with his hat on entering his own house and appearing in his shirtsleeves to indicate domestic ease and security was obliged to replace it on account of the chill  he had never felt at home in this room  its strangeness had lately been heightened by mrs mulradys purchase of a family portrait of some one she didnt know but who she had alleged resembled her uncle bob which hung on the wall beside some paintings in massive frames  mr mulrady cast a hurried glance at the portrait that on the strength of a high coatcollar and high top curlboth rolled with equal precision and singular sameness of colorhad always glared at mulrady as if he was the intruder and passing through his wifes gorgeous bedroom entered the little dressingroom where he still slept on the smallest of cots with hastily improvised surroundings as if he was a bailiff in possession  he didnt linger here long but taking a key from a drawer continued up the staircase to the ominous funeral marches of the beating rain on the skylight and paused on the landing to glance into his sons and daughters bedrooms duplicates of the bizarre extravagance below  if he were seeking some characteristic traces of his absent family they certainly were not here in the painted and still damp blazoning of their later successes  he ascended another staircase and passing to the wing of the house paused before a small door which was locked  already the ostentatious decorations of wall and passages were left behind and the plain lathandplaster partition of the attic lay before him  he unlocked the door and threw it open    chapter v  the apartment he entered was really only a lumberroom or loft over the wing of the house which had been left bare and unfinished and which revealed in its meagre skeleton of beams and joints the hollow sham of the whole structure  but in more violent contrast to the fresher glories of the other part of the house were its contents which were the heterogeneous collection of old furniture old luggage and castoff clothing left over from the past life in the old cabin  it was a much plainer record of the simple beginnings of the family than mrs mulrady cared to have remain in evidence and for that reason it had been relegated to the hidden recesses of the new house in the hope that it might absorb or digest it  there were old cribs in which the infant limbs of mamie and abner had been tucked up old lookingglasses that had reflected their shining soapy faces and mamies best chip sunday hat an old sewingmachine that had been worn out in active service old patchwork quilts an old accordion to whose long drawn inspirations mamie had sung hymns old pictures books and old toys  there were one or two old chromos and stuck in an old frame a colored print from the illustrated london news of a christmas gathering in an old english country house  he stopped and picked up this print which he had often seen before gazing at it with a new and singular interest  he wondered if mamie had seen anything of this kind in england and why couldnt he have had something like it here in their own fine house with themselves and a few friends  he remembered a past christmas when he had bought mamie that now headless doll with the few coins that were left him after buying their frugal christmas dinner  there was an old spotted hobbyhorse that another christmas had brought to abnerabner who would be driving a fast trotter tomorrow at the springs  how everything had changed  how they all had got up in the world and how far beyond this kind of thingand yetyet it would have been rather comfortable to have all been together again here  would they have been more comfortable  no yet then he might have had something to do and been less lonely tomorrow what of that  he had something to do to look after this immense fortune  what more could a man want or should he want  it was rather mean in him able to give his wife and children everything they wanted to be wanting anything more  he laid down the print gently after dusting its glass and frame with his silk handkerchief and slowly left the room  the drumbeat of the rain followed him down the staircase but he shut it out with his other thoughts when he again closed the door of his office  he set diligently to work by the declining winter light until he was interrupted by the entrance of his chinese waiter to tell him that supperwhich was the meal that mulrady religiously adhered to in place of the late dinner of civilizationwas ready in the diningroom mulrady mechanically obeyed the summons but on entering the room the oasis of a few plates in a desert of white tablecloth which awaited him made him hesitate in its best aspect the high dark gothic mahogany ecclesiastical sideboard and chairs of this room which looked like the appointments of a mortuary chapel were not exhilarating and today in the light of the rainfilmed windows and the feeble rays of a lamp halfobscured by the dark shining walls it was most depressing  you kin take up supper into my office said mulrady with a sudden inspiration  ill eat it there  he ate it there with his usual healthy appetite which did not require even the stimulation of company  he had just finished when his irish cookthe one female servant of the housecame to ask permission to be absent that evening and the next day  i suppose the likes of your honor wont be at home on the christmas day  and its me cousins from the old counthry at roughandready that are invitin me  why dont you ask them over here said mulrady with another vague inspiration  ill stand treat  lord preserve you for a jinerous gintleman  but its the likes of them and myself that wouldnt be at home here on such a day  there was so much truth in this that mulrady checked a sigh as he gave the required permission without saying that he had intended to remain he could cook his own breakfast he had done it before and it would be something to occupy him  as to his dinner perhaps he could go to the hotel at roughandready  he worked on until the night had well advanced  then overcome with a certain restlessness that disturbed him he was forced to put his books and papers away  it had begun to blow in fitful gusts and occasionally the rain was driven softly across the panes like the passing of childish fingers  this disturbed him more than the monotony of silence for he was not a nervous man he seldom read a book and the county paper furnished him only the financial and mercantile news which was part of his business  he knew he could not sleep if he went to bed  at last he rose opened the window and looked out from pure idleness of occupation  a splash of wheels in the distant muddy road and fragments of a drunken song showed signs of an early wandering reveller  there were no lights to be seen at the closed works a profound darkness encompassed the house as if the distant pines in the hollow had moved up and round it  the silence was broken now only by the occasional sighing of wind and rain  it was not an inviting night for a perfunctory walk but an idea struck himhe would call upon the slinns and anticipate his next days visit  they would probably have company and be glad to see him he could tell the girls of mamie and her success  that he had not thought of this before was a proof of his usual selfcontained isolation that he thought of it now was an equal proof that he was becoming at last accessible to loneliness he was angry with himself for what seemed to him a selfish weakness  he returned to his office and putting the envelope that had been lying on slinns desk in his pocket threw a serape over his shoulders and locked the front door of the house behind him  it was well that the way was a familiar one to him and that his feet instinctively found the trail for the night was very dark  at times he was warned only by the gurgling of water of little rivulets that descended the hill and crossed his path  without the slightest fear and with neither imagination nor sensitiveness he recalled how the winter before one of don caesars vaqueros crossing this hill at night had fallen down the chasm of a landslip caused by the rain and was found the next morning with his neck broken in the gully  don caesar had to take care of the mans family  suppose such an accident should happen to him well he had made his will  his wife and children would be provided for and the work of the mine would go on all the same he had arranged for that  would anybody miss him  would his wife or his son or his daughter  no  he felt such a sudden and overwhelming conviction of the truth of this that he stopped as suddenly as if the chasm had opened before him  no  it was the truth  if he were to disappear forever in the darkness of the christmas night there was none to feel his loss  his wife would take care of mamie his son would take care of himself as he had beforerelieved of even the scant paternal authority he rebelled against  a more imaginative man than mulrady would have combated or have followed out this idea and then dismissed it to the millionaires matteroffact mind it was a deduction that having once presented itself to his perception was already a recognized fact  for the first time in his life he felt a sudden instinct of something like aversion towards his family a feeling that even his sons dissipation and criminality had never provoked  he hurried on angrily through the darkness  it was very strange the old house should be almost before him now across the hollow yet there were no indications of light  it was not until he actually reached the garden fence and the black bulk of shadow rose out against the sky that he saw a faint ray of light from one of the leanto windows  he went to the front door and knocked after waiting in vain for a reply he knocked again the second knock proving equally futile he tried the door it was unlocked and pushing it open he walked in  the narrow passage was quite dark but from his knowledge of the house he knew the leanto was next to the kitchen and passing through the diningroom into it he opened the door of the little room from which the light proceeded  it came from a single candle on a small table and beside it with his eyes moodily fixed on the dying embers of the fire sat old slinn  there was no other light nor another human being in the whole house  for the instant mulrady forgetting his own feelings in the mute picture of the utter desolation of the helpless man remained speechless on the threshold  then recalling himself he stepped forward and laid his hand gayly on the bowed shoulders  rouse up out o this old man  come this wont do  look  ive run over here in the rain jist to have a sociable time with you all  i knew it said the old man without looking up i knew youd come  you knew id come echoed mulrady with an uneasy return of the strange feeling of awe with which he regarded slinns abstraction  yes you were alonelike myselfall alone  then why in thunder didnt you open the door or sing out just now he said with an affected brusquerie to cover his uneasiness wheres your daughters  gone to roughandready to a party  and your son  he never comes here when he can amuse himself elsewhere  your children might have stayed home on christmas eve  so might yours  he didnt say this impatiently but with a certain abstracted conviction far beyond any suggestion of its being a retort mulrady did not appear to notice it  well i dont see why us old folks cant enjoy ourselves without them said mulrady with affected cheerfulness  lets have a good time you and me  lets seeyou havent any one you can send to my house hev you  they took the servant with them said slinn briefly  there is no one here  all right said the millionaire briskly  ill go myself  do you think you can manage to light up a little more and build a fire in the kitchen while im gone  it used to be mighty comfortable in the old times  he helped the old man to rise from his chair and seemed to have infused into him some of his own energy  he then added now dont you get yourself down again into that chair until i come back and darted out into the night once more  in a quarter of an hour he returned with a bag on his broad shoulders which one of his porters would have shrunk from lifting and laid it before the blazing hearth of the now lighted kitchen its something the old woman got for her party that didnt come off he said apologetically  i reckon we can pick out enough for a spread  that darned chinaman wouldnt come with me he added with a laugh because he said hed knocked off work allee same mellican man look here slinn he said with a sudden decisiveness my payroll of the men around here dont run short of a hundred and fifty dollars a day and yet i couldnt get a hand to help me bring this truck over for my christmas dinner  of course said slinn gloomily  of course so it oughter be returned mulrady shortly  why its only their one day out of 364 and i can have 363 days off as i am their boss  i dont mind a mans being independent he continued taking off his coat and beginning to unpack his sacka common gunny bagused for potatoes  were independent ourselves aint we slinn  his good spirits which had been at first labored and affected had become natural  slinn looking at his brightened eye and fresher color could not help thinking he was more like his own real self at this moment than in his countinghouse and officeswith all his simplicity as a capitalist  a less abstracted and more observant critic than slinn would have seen in this patient aptitude for real work and the recognition of the force of petty detail the dominance of the old marketgardener in his former humble as well as his later more ambitious successes  heaven keep us from being dependent upon our children said slinn darkly  let the young ones alone tonight we can get along without them as they can without us said mulrady with a slight twinge as he thought of his reflections on the hillside  but look here theres some champagne and them sweet cordials that women like theres jellies and such like stuff about as good as they make em i reckon and preserves and tongues and spiced beeftake your pick  stop lets spread them out  he dragged the table to the middle of the floor and piled the provisions upon it  they certainly were not deficient in quality or quantity  now slinn wade in  i dont feel hungry said the invalid who had lapsed again into a chair before the fire  no more do i said mulrady but i reckon its the right thing to do about this time  some folks think they cant be happy without theyre getting outside o suthin and my directors down at frisco cant do any business without a dinner  take some champagne to begin with  he opened a bottle and filled two tumblers  its past twelve oclock old man so heres a merry christmas to you and both of us ez is here  and heres another to our familiesez isnt  they both drank their wine stolidly  the rain beat against the windows sharply but without the hollow echoes of the house on the hill  i must write to the old woman and mamie and say that you and me had a high old time on christmas eve  by ourselves added the invalid  mr mulrady coughed  natrallyby ourselves  and her provisions he added with a laugh  were really beholden to her for em  if she hadnt thought of having them  for somebody else you wouldnt have had themwould you said slinn slowly gazing at the fire  no said mulrady dubiously  after a pause he began more vivaciously and as if to shake off some disagreeable thought that was impressing him but i mustnt forget to give you your christmas old man and ive got it right here with me  he took the folded envelope from his pocket and holding it in his hand with his elbow on the table continued i dont mind telling you what idea i had in giving you what im goin to give you now  ive been thinking about it for a day or two  a man like you dont want moneyyou wouldnt spend it  a man like you dont want stocks or fancy investments for you couldnt look after them  a man like you dont want diamonds and jewellery nor a goldheaded cane when its got to be used as a crutch  no sir what you want is suthin that wont run away from you that is always there before you and wont wear out and will last after youre gone thats land  and if it wasnt that i have sworn never to sell or give away this house and that garden if it wasnt that ive held out agin the old woman and mamie on that point you should have this house and that garden  but mebbee for the same reason that ive told you i want that land to keep for myself  but ive selected four acres of the hill this side of my shaft and heres the deed of it  as soon as youre ready ill put you up a house as big as thisthat shall be yours with the land as long as you live old man and after that your childrens  no not theirs broke in the old man passionately  never  mulrady recoiled for an instant in alarm at the sudden and unexpected vehemence of his manner go slow old man go slow he said soothingly  of course youll do with your own as you like  then as if changing the subject he went on cheerfully perhaps youll wonder why i picked out that spot on the hillside well first because i reserved it after my strike in case the lead should run that way but it didnt  next because when you first came here you seemed to like the prospect  you used to sit there looking at it as if it reminded you of something  you never said it did  they say you was sitting on that boulder there when you had that last attack you know but he added gently youve forgotten all about it  i have forgotten nothing said slinn rising with a choking voice i wish to god i had i wish to god i could  he was on his feet now supporting himself by the table  the subtle generous liquor he had drunk had evidently shaken his selfcontrol and burst those voluntary bonds he had put upon himself for the last six months the insidious stimulant had also put a strange vigor into his blood and nerves  his face was flushed but not distorted his eyes were brilliant but not fixed he looked as he might have looked to masters in his strength three years before on that very hillside  listen to me alvin mulrady he said leaning over him with burning eyes  listen while i have brain to think and strength to utter why i have learnt to distrust fear and hate them  you think you know my story  well hear the truth from me tonight alvin mulrady and do not wonder if i have cause  he stopped and with pathetic inefficiency passed the fingers and inwardturned thumb of his paralyzed hand across his mouth as if to calm himself  three years ago i was a miner but not a miner like you  i had experience i had scientific knowledge i had a theory and the patience and energy to carry it out  i selected a spot that had all the indications made a tunnel and without aid counsel or assistance of any kind worked it for six months without rest or cessation and with scarcely food enough to sustain my body  well i made a strike not like you mulrady not a blunder of good luck a fools fortunethere i dont blame you for itbut in perfect demonstration of my theory the reward of my labor  it was no pocket but a vein a lead that i had regularly hunted down and founda fortune  i never knew how hard i had worked until that morning i never knew what privations i had undergone until that moment of my success when i found i could scarcely think or move  i staggered out into the open air  the only human soul near me was a disappointed prospector a man named masters who had a tunnel not far away  i managed to conceal from him my good fortune and my feeble state for i was suspicious of himof any one and as he was going away that day i thought i could keep my secret until he was gone  i was dizzy and confused but i remember that i managed to write a letter to my wife telling her of my good fortune and begging her to come to me and i remember that i saw masters go  i dont remember anything else  they picked me up on the road near that boulder as you know  i know said mulrady with a swift recollection of the stagedrivers account of his discovery  they say continued slinn tremblingly that i never recovered my senses or consciousness for nearly three years they say i lost my memory completely during my illness and that by gods mercy while i lay in that hospital i knew no more than a babe they say because i could not speak or move and only had my food as nature required it that i was an imbecile and that i never really came to my senses until after my son found me in the hospital  they say thatbut i tell you tonight alvin mulrady he said raising his voice to a hoarse outcry i tell you that it is a lie  i came to my senses a week after i lay on that hospital cot i kept my senses and memory ever after during the three years that i was there until harry brought his cold hypocritical face to my bedside and recognized me  do you understand i the possessor of millions lay there a pauper  deserted by wife and childrena spectacle for the curious a sport for the doctorsand i knew it  i heard them speculate on the cause of my helplessness  i heard them talk of excesses and indulgencesi that never knew wine or woman  i heard a preacher speak of the finger of god and point to me may god curse him  go slow old man go slow said mulrady gently  i heard them speak of me as a friendless man an outcast a criminala being whom no one would claim  they were right no one claimed me  the friends of others visited them relations came and took away their kindred a few lucky ones got well a few equally lucky died  i alone lived on uncared for deserted  the first year he went on more rapidly i prayed for their coming i looked for them every day  i never lost hope  i said to myself she has not got my letter but when the time passes she will be alarmed by my silence and then she will come or send some one to seek me  a young student got interested in my case and by studying my eyes thought that i was not entirely imbecile and unconscious  with the aid of an alphabet he got me to spell my name and town in illinois and promised by signs to write to my family  but in an evil moment i told him of my cursed fortune and in that moment i saw that he thought me a fool and an idiot  he went away and i saw him no more  yet i still hoped  i dreamed of their joy at finding me and the reward that my wealth would give them  perhaps i was a little weak still perhaps a little flighty too at times but i was quite happy that year even in my disappointment for i had still hope  he paused and again composed his face with his paralyzed hand but his manner had become less excited and his voice was stronger  a change must have come over me the second year for i only dreaded their coming now and finding me so altered  a horrible idea that they might like the student believe me crazy if i spoke of my fortune made me pray to god that they might not reach me until after i had regained my health and strengthand found my fortune  when the third year found me still therei no longer prayed for themi cursed them  i swore to myself that they should never enjoy my wealth but i wanted to live and let them know i had it  i found myself getting stronger but as i had no money no friends and nowhere to go i concealed my real condition from the doctors except to give them my name and to try to get some little work to do to enable me to leave the hospital and seek my lost treasure  one day i found out by accident that it had been discovered  you understandmy treasurethat had cost me years of labor and my reason had left me a helpless forgotten pauper that gold i had never enjoyed had been found and taken possession of by another  he checked an exclamation from mulrady with his hand  they say they picked me up senseless from the floor where i must have fallen when i heard the newsi dont rememberi recall nothing until i was confronted nearly three weeks after by my son who had called at the hospital as a reporter for a paper and had accidentally discovered me through my name and appearance  he thought me crazy or a fool  i didnt undeceive him  i did not tell him the story of the mine to excite his doubts and derision or worse if i could bring proof to claim it have it perhaps pass into his ungrateful hands  no i said nothing  i let him bring me here  he could do no less and common decency obliged him to do that  and what proof could you show of your claim asked mulrady gravely  if i had that letterif i could find masters began slinn vaguely  have you any idea where the letter is or what has become of masters continued mulrady with a matteroffact gravity that seemed to increase slinns vagueness and excite his irritability  i dont knowi sometimes think  he stopped sat down again and passed his hands across his forehead  i have seen the letter somewhere since  yes he went on with sudden vehemence i know it i have seen it  i  his brows knitted his features began to work convulsively he suddenly brought his paralyzed hand down partly opened upon the table  i will remember where  go slow old man go slow  you asked me once about my visions  well that is one of them  i remember a man somewhere showing me that letter  i have taken it from his hands and opened it and knew it was mine by the specimens of gold that were in it  but whereor whenor what became of it i cannot tell  it will come to meit must come to me soon  he turned his eyes upon mulrady who was regarding him with an expression of grave curiosity and said bitterly you think me crazy i know it  it needed only this  where is this mine asked mulrady without heeding him  the old mans eyes swiftly sought the ground  it is a secret then  no  you have spoken of it to any one  no  not to the man who possesses it  no  why  because i wouldnt take it from him  why wouldnt you  because that man is yourself  in the instant of complete silence that followed they could hear that the monotonous patter of rain on the roof had ceased  then all this was in my shaft and the vein i thought i struck there was your lead found three years ago in your tunnel  is that your idea  yes  then i dont sabe why you dont want to claim it  i have told you why i dont want it for my children  i go further now and i tell you alvin mulrady that i was willing that your children should squander it as they were doing  it has only been a curse to me it could only be a curse to them but i thought you were happy in seeing it feed selfishness and vanity you think me bitter and hard  well i should have left you in your fools paradise but that i saw tonight when you came here that your eyes had been opened like mine  you the possessor of my wealth my treasure could not buy your childrens loving care and company with your millions any more than i could keep mine in my poverty  you were tonight lonely and forsaken as i was  we were equal for the first time in our lives  if that cursed gold had dropped down the shaft between us into the hell from which it sprang we might have clasped hands like brothers across the chasm  mulrady who in a friendly show of being at his ease had not yet resumed his coat rose in his shirtsleeves and standing before the hearth straightened his square figure by drawing down his waistcoat on each side with two powerful thumbs  after a moments contemplative survey of the floor between him and the speaker he raised his eyes to slinn  they were small and colorless the forehead above them was low and crowned with a shock of tawny reddish hair even the rude strength of his lower features was enfeebled by a long straggling goatlike beard but for the first time in his life the whole face was impressed and transformed with a strong and simple dignity  ez far ez i kin see slinn he said gravely the pint between you and me aint to be settled by our children or wot we allow is doo and right from them to us  afore we preach at them for playing in the slumgullion and gettin themselves splashed perhaps we mout ez well remember that that thar slumgullion comes from our own sluiceboxes where we wash our gold  so well just put them behind us so he continued with a backward sweep of his powerful hand towards the chimney and goes on  the next thing that crops up ahead of us is your three years in the hospital and wot you went through at that time  i aint sayin it wasnt rough on you and that you didnt have it about as big as its made but ez youll allow that youd hev had that for three years whether id found your mine or whether i hadnt i think we can put that behind us too  theres nothin now left to prospect but your story of your strike  well take your own proofs masters is not here and if he was accordin to your own story he knows nothin of your strike that day and could only prove you were a disappointed prospector in a tunnel your letterthat the person you wrote to never gotyou cant produce and if you did would be only your own story without proof  there is not a business man ez would look at your claim there isnt a friend of yours that wouldnt believe you were crazy and dreamed it all there isnt a rival of yours ez wouldnt say ez youd invented it  slinn im a business mani am your friendi am your rivalbut i dont think youre lyini dont think youre crazyand im not sure your claim aint a good one  ef you reckon from that that im goin to hand you over the mine tomorrow he went on after a pause raising his hand with a deprecating gesture youre mistaken  for your own sake and the sake of my wife and children youve got to prove it more clearly than you hev but i promise you that from this night forward i will spare neither time nor money to help you to do it  i have more than doubled the amount that you would have had had you taken the mine the day you came from the hospital  when you prove to me that your story is trueand we will find some way to prove it if it is truethat amount will be yours at once without the need of a word from law or lawyers if you want my name to that in black and white come to the office tomorrow and you shall have it  and you think ill take it now said the old man passionately do you think that your charity will bring back my dead wife the three years of my lost life the love and respect of my children or do you think that your own wife and children who deserted you in your wealth will come back to you in your poverty  no  let the mine stay with its curse where it isill have none of it  go slow old man go slow said mulrady quietly putting on his coat  you will take the mine if it is yours if it isnt ill keep it  if it is yours you will give your children a chance to sho what they can do for you in your sudden prosperity as i shall give mine a chance to show how they can stand reverse and disappointment  if my head is leveland i reckon it istheyll both pan out all right  he turned and opened the door  with a quick revulsion of feeling slinn suddenly seized mulradys hand between both of his own and raised it to his lips  mulrady smiled disengaged his hand gently and saying soothingly go slow old man go slow closed the door behind him and passed out into the clear christmas dawn  for the stars with the exception of one that seemed to sparkle brightly over the shaft of his former fortunes were slowly paling a burden seemed to have fallen from his square shoulders as he stepped out sturdily into the morning air  he had already forgotten the lonely man behind him for he was thinking only of his wife and daughter  and at the same moment they were thinking of him and in their elaborate villa overlooking the blue mediterranean at cannes were discussing in the event of mamies marriage with prince rosso e negro the possibility of mr mulradys paying two hundred and fifty thousand dollars the gambling debts of that unfortunate but deeply conscientious nobleman    chapter vi  when alvin mulrady reentered his own house he no longer noticed its loneliness  whether the events of the last few hours had driven it from his mind or whether his late reflections had repeopled it with his family under pleasanter auspices it would be difficult to determine  destitute as he was of imagination and matteroffact in his judgments he realized his new situation as calmly as he would have considered any business proposition  while he was decided to act upon his moral convictions purely he was prepared to submit the facts of slinns claim to the usual patient and laborious investigation of his practical mind  it was the least he could do to justify the ready and almost superstitious assent he had given to slinns story  when he had made a few memoranda at his desk by the growing light he again took the key of the attic and ascended to the loft that held the tangible memories of his past life  if he was still under the influence of his reflections it was with very different sensations that he now regarded them  was it possible that these ashes might be warmed again and these scattered embers rekindled his practical sense said no whatever his wish might have been  a sudden chill came over him he began to realize the terrible change that was probable more by the impossibility of his accepting the old order of things than by his voluntarily abandoning the new his wife and children would never submit  they would go away from this place far away where no reminiscence of either former wealth or former poverty could obtrude itself upon them  mamiehis mamieshould never go back to the cabin since desecrated by slinns daughters and take their places  no  why should shebecause of the halfsick halfcrazy dreams of an old vindictive man  he stopped suddenly  in moodily turning over a heap of mining clothing blankets and indiarubber boots he had come upon an old pickaxethe one he had found in the shaft the one he had carefully preserved for a year and then forgotten  why had he not remembered it before  he was frightened not only at this sudden resurrection of the proof he was seeking but at his own fateful forgetfulness  why had he never thought of this when slinn was speaking  a sense of shame as if he had voluntarily withheld it from the wronged man swept over him he was turning away when he was again startled  this time it was by a voice from belowa voice calling himslinns voice  how had the crippled man got here so soon and what did he want  he hurriedly laid aside the pick which in his first impulse he had taken to the door of the loft with him and descended the stairs  the old man was standing at the door of his office awaiting him  as mulrady approached he trembled violently and clung to the doorpost for support  i had to come over mulrady he said in a choked voice i could stand it there no longer  ive come to beg you to forget all that i have said to drive all thought of what passed between us last night out of your head and mine forever  ive come to ask you to swear with me that neither of us will ever speak of this again forever  it is not worth the happiness i have had in your friendship for the last halfyear it is not worth the agony i have suffered in its loss in the last halfhour  mulrady grasped his outstretched hand  praps he said gravely there maynt be any use for another word if you can answer one now come with me  no matter he added as slinn moved with difficulty i will help you  he half supported half lifted the paralyzed man up the three flights of stairs and opened the door of the loft  the pick was leaning against the wall where he had left it  look around and see if you recognize anything  the old mans eyes fell upon the implement in a halffrightened way and then lifted themselves interrogatively to mulradys face  do you know that pick  slinn raised it in his trembling hands  i think i do and yet  slinn is it yours  no he said hurriedly  then what makes you think you know it  it has a short handle like one ive seen  and is isnt yours  no  the handle of mine was broken and spliced  i was too poor to buy a new one  then you say that this pick which i found in my shaft is not yours  yes  slinn  the old man passed his hand across his forehead looked at mulrady and dropped his eyes  it is not mine he said simply  that will do said mulrady gravely  and you will not speak of this again said the old man timidly  i promise younot until i have some more evidence  he kept his word but not before he had extorted from slinn as full a description of masters as his imperfect memory and still more imperfect knowledge of his former neighbor could furnish  he placed this with a large sum of money and the promise of a still larger reward in the hands of a trustworthy agent  when this was done he resumed his old relations with slinn with the exception that the domestic letters of mrs mulrady and mamie were no longer a subject of comment and their bills no longer passed through his private secretarys hands  three months passed the rainy season had ceased the hillsides around mulradys shaft were bridallike with flowers indeed there were rumors of an approaching fashionable marriage in the air and vague hints in the record that the presence of a distinguished capitalist might soon be required abroad  the face of that distinguished man did not however reflect the gayety of nature nor the anticipation of happiness on the contrary for the past few weeks he had appeared disturbed and anxious and that rude tranquillity which had characterized him was wanting  people shook their heads a few suggested speculations all agreed on extravagance  one morning after office hours slinn who had been watching the careworn face of his employer suddenly rose and limped to his side  we promised each other he said in a voice trembling with emotion never to allude to our talk of christmas eve again unless we had other proofs of what i told you then  we have none i dont believe well ever have any more  i dont care if we ever do and i break that promise now because i cannot bear to see you unhappy and know that this is the cause  mulrady made a motion of deprecation but the old man continued  you are unhappy alvin mulrady  you are unhappy because you want to give your daughter a dowry of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars and you will not use the fortune that you think may be mine  whos been talking about a dowry asked mulrady with an angry flush  don caesar alvarado told my daughter  then that is why he has thrown off on me since he returned said mulrady with sudden small malevolence just that he might unload his gossip because mamie wouldnt have him  the old woman was right in warnin me agin him  the outburst was so unlike him and so dwarfed his large though common nature with its littleness that it was easy to detect its feminine origin although it filled slinn with vague alarm  never mind him said the old man hastily what i wanted to say now is that i abandon everything to you and yours  there are no proofs there never will be any more than what we know than what we have tested and found wanting  i swear to you that except to show you that i have not lied and am not crazy i would destroy them on their way to your hands  keep the money and spend it as you will  make your daughter happy and through her yourself you have made me happy through your liberality dont make me suffer through your privation  i tell you what old man said mulrady rising to his feet with an awkward mingling of frankness and shame in his manner and accent i should like to pay that money for mamie and let her be a princess if it would make her happy  i should like to shut the lantern jaws of that don caesar whod be too glad if anything happened to break off mamies match  but i shouldnt touch that capitalunless youd lend it to me  if youll take a note from me payable if the property ever becomes yours id thank you  a mortgage on the old house and garden and the lands i bought of don caesar outside the mine will screen you  if that pleases you said the old man with a smile have your way and if i tear up the note it does not concern you  it did please the distinguished capitalist of roughandready for the next few days his face wore a brightened expression and he seemed to have recovered his old tranquillity  there was in fact a slight touch of consequence in his manner the first ostentation he had ever indulged in when he was informed one morning at his private office that don caesar alvarado was in the countinghouse desiring a few moments conference  tell him to come in said mulrady shortly the door opened upon don caesarerect sallow and grave  mulrady had not seen him since his return from europe and even his inexperienced eyes were struck with the undeniable ease and grace with which the young spanishamerican had assimilated the style and fashion of an older civilization  it seemed rather as if he had returned to a familiar condition than adopted a new one  take a cheer said mulrady  the young man looked at slinn with quietly persistent significance  you can talk all the same said mulrady accepting the significance hes my private secretary  it seems that for that reason we might choose another moment for our conversation returned don caesar haughtily  do i understand you cannot see me now  mulrady hesitated he had always revered and recognized a certain social superiority in don ramon alvarado somehow his sona young man of half his age and once a possible soninlawappeared to claim that recognition also  he rose without a word and preceded don caesar upstairs into the drawingroom  the alien portrait on the wall seemed to evidently take sides with don caesar as against the common intruder mulrady  i hoped the senora mulrady might have saved me this interview said the young man stiffly or at least have given you some intimation of the reason why i seek it  as you just now proposed my talking to you in the presence of the unfortunate senor esslinn himself it appears she has not  i dont know what youre driving at or what mrs mulradys got to do with slinn or you said mulrady in angry uneasiness  do i understand said don caesar sternly that senora mulrady has not told you that i entrusted to her an important letter belonging to senor esslinn which i had the honor to discover in the wood six months ago and which she said she would refer to you  letter echoed mulrady slowly my wife had a letter of slinns  don caesar regarded the millionaire attentively  it is as i feared he said gravely  you do not know or you would not have remained silent  he then briefly recounted the story of his finding slinns letter his exhibition of it to the invalid its disastrous effect upon him and his innocent discovery of the contents  i believed myself at that time on the eve of being allied with your family senor mulrady he said haughtily and when i found myself in the possession of a secret which affected its integrity and good name i did not choose to leave it in the helpless hands of its imbecile owner or his sillier children but proposed to trust it to the care of the senora that she and you might deal with it as became your honor and mine  i followed her to paris and gave her the letter there  she affected to laugh at any pretension of the writer or any claim he might have on your bounty but she kept the letter and i fear destroyed it  you will understand senor mulrady that when i found that my attentions were no longer agreeable to your daughter i had no longer the right to speak to you on the subject nor could i without misapprehension force her to return it  i should have still kept the secret to myself if i had not since my return here made the nearer acquaintance of senor esslinns daughters  i cannot present myself at his house as a suitor for the hand of the senorita vashti until i have asked his absolution for my complicity in the wrong that has been done to him  i cannot as a caballero do that without your permission  it is for that purpose i am here  it needed only this last blow to complete the humiliation that whitened mulradys face  but his eye was none the less clear and his voice none the less steady as he turned to don caesar  you know perfectly the contents of that letter  i have kept a copy of it  come with me  he preceded his visitor down the staircase and back into his private office  slinn looked up at his employers face in unrestrained anxiety  mulrady sat down at his desk wrote a few hurried lines and rang a bell  a manager appeared from the countingroom  send that to the bank  he wiped his pen as methodically as if he had not at that moment countermanded the order to pay his daughters dowry and turned quietly to slinn  don caesar alvarado has found the letter you wrote your wife on the day you made your strike in the tunnel that is now my shaft he gave the letter to mrs mulrady but he has kept a copy  unheeding the frightened gesture of entreaty from slinn equally with the unfeigned astonishment of don caesar who was entirely unprepared for this revelation of mulradys and slinns confidences he continued he has brought the copy with him  i reckon it would be only square for you to compare it with what you remember of the original  in obedience to a gesture from mulrady don caesar mechanically took from his pocket a folded paper and handed it to the paralytic  but slinns trembling fingers could scarcely unfold the paper and as his eyes fell upon its contents his convulsive lips could not articulate a word  praps id better read it for you said mulrady gently  you kin follow me and stop me when i go wrong  he took the paper and in dead silence read as follows  dear wifeive just struck gold in my tunnel and you must get ready to come here with the children at once  it was after six months hard work and im so weak i     its a fortune for us all  we should be rich even if it were only a branch vein dipping west towards the next tunnel instead of dipping east according to my theory  stop said slinn in a voice that shook the room  mulrady looked up  its wrong aint it he asked anxiously it should be east towards the next tunnel  no  its right  i am wrong  were all wrong  slinn had risen to his feet erect and inspired  dont you see he almost screamed with passionate vehemence its masters abandoned tunnel your shaft has struck  not mine  it was masters pick you found  i know it now  and your own tunnel said mulrady springing to his feet in excitement  and your strike  is still there  the next instant and before another question could be asked slinn had darted from the room  in the exaltation of that supreme discovery he regained the full control of his mind and body mulrady and don caesar no less excited followed him precipitately and with difficulty kept up with his feverish speed  their way lay along the base of the hill below mulradys shaft and on a line with masters abandoned tunnel only once he stopped to snatch a pick from the hand of an astonished chinaman at work in a ditch as he still kept on his way a quarter of a mile beyond the shaft  here he stopped before a jagged hole in the hillside  bared to the sky and air the very openness of its abandonment its unpropitious position and distance from the strike in mulradys shaft had no doubt preserved its integrity from wayfarer or prospector  you cant go in there alone and without a light said mulrady laying his hand on the arm of the excited man  let me get more help and proper tools  i know every step in the dark as in the daylight returned slinn struggling  let me go while i have yet strength and reason stand aside  he broke from them and the next moment was swallowed up in the yawning blackness  they waited with bated breath until after a seeming eternity of night and silence they heard his returning footsteps and ran forward to meet him  as he was carrying something clasped to his breast they supported him to the opening but at the same moment the object of his search and his burden a misshapen wedge of gold and quartz dropped with him and both fell together with equal immobility to the ground  he had still strength to turn his fading eyes to the other millionaire of roughandready who leaned over him  yousee he gasped brokenly i was notcrazy  no  he was dead
