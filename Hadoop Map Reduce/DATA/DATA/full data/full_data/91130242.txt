91130242	devils ford  by bret harte     devils ford     chapter i   it was a season of unequalled prosperity in devils ford the half a dozen cabins scattered along the banks of the north fork as if by some overflow of that capricious river had become augmented during a week of fierce excitement by twenty or thirty others that were huddled together on the narrow gorge of devils spur or cast up on its steep sides so sudden and violent had been the change of fortune that the dwellers in the older cabins had not had time to change with it but still kept their old habits customs and even their old clothes the flour pan in which their daily bread was mixed stood on the rude table side by side with the prospecting pans half full of gold washed up from their mornings work the front windows of the newer tenements looked upon the one single thoroughfare but the back door opened upon the uncleared wilderness still haunted by the misshapen bulk of bear or the nightly gliding of catamount  neither had success as yet affected their boyish simplicity and the frankness of old frontier habits they played with their newfound riches with the naive delight of children and rehearsed their glowing future with the importance and triviality of schoolboys  ive bin kalklatin said dick mattingly leaning on his longhandled shovel with lazy gravity that when i go to rome this winter ill get one o them marble sharps to chisel me a statoo o some kind to set up on the spot where we made our big strike suthin to remember it by you know  what kind o statoowashington or webster asked one of the kearney brothers without looking up from his work  noi reckon one o them fancy groupsone o them latin goddesses that fairfax is always gassin about sorter leadin directin and bossin us where to dig  youd make a healthylookin figger in a group responded kearney critically regarding an enormous patch in mattinglys trousers why dont you have a fountain instead  wherell you get the water demanded the first speaker in return you know there aint enough in the north fork to do a weeks washing for the campto say nothin of its color  leave that to me said kearney with selfpossession when ive built that there reservoir on devils spur and bring the water over the ridge from union ditch therell be enough to spare for that  better mix it up i reckonhave suthin half statoo half fountain interposed the elder mattingly better known as maryland joe and set it up afore the town hall and free library im kalklatin to give do that and you can count on me  after some further discussion it was gravely settled that kearney should furnish water brought from the union ditch twenty miles away at a cost of two hundred thousand dollars to feed a memorial fountain erected by mattingly worth a hundred thousand dollars as a crowning finish to public buildings contributed by maryland joe to the extent of half a million more the disposition of these vast sums by gentlemen wearing patched breeches awakened no sense of the ludicrous nor did any doubt reservation or contingency enter into the plans of the charming enthusiasts themselves the foundation of their airy castles lay already before them in the strip of rich alluvium on the river bank where the north fork sharply curving round the base of devils spur had for centuries swept the detritus of gulch and canyon they had barely crossed the threshold of this treasurehouse to find themselves rich men what possibilities of affluence might be theirs when they had fully exploited their possessions so confident were they of that ultimate prospect that the wealth already thus obtained was religiously expended in engines and machinery for the boring of wells and the conveyance of that precious water which the exhausted river had long since ceased to yield it seemed as if the gold they had taken out was by some ironical compensation gradually making its way back to the soil again through ditch and flume and reservoir  such was the position of affairs at devils ford on the 13th of august 1860 it was noon of a hot day whatever movement there was in the stifling air was seen rather than felt in a tremulous quivering upwardmoving dust along the flank of the mountain through which the spires of the pines were faintly visible there was no water in the bared and burning bars of the river to reflect the vertical sun but under its direct rays one or two tinned roofs and corrugated zinc cabins struck fire a few canvas tents became dazzling to the eye and the white wooded corral of the stage office and hotel insupportable for two hours no one ventured in the glare of the open or even to cross the narrow unshadowed street whose dull red dust seemed to glow between the lines of straggling houses the heated shells of these green unseasoned tenements gave out a pungent odor of scorching wood and resin the usual hurried feverish toil in the claim was suspended the pick and shovel were left sticking in the richest pay gravel the toiling millionaires themselves ragged dirty and perspiring lay panting under the nearest shade where the pipes went out listlessly and conversation sank to monosyllables  theres fairfax said dick mattingly at last with a lazy effort his face was turned to the hillside where a man had just emerged from the woods and was halting irresolutely before the glaring expanse of upheaved gravel and glistening boulders that stretched between him and the shaded group hes going to make a break for it he added as the stranger throwing his linen coat over his head suddenly started into an indian trot through the pelting sunbeams toward them this strange act was perfectly understood by the group who knew that in that intensely dry heat the danger of exposure was lessened by active exercise and the profuse perspiration that followed it in another moment the stranger had reached their side dripping as if rained upon mopping his damp curls and handsome bearded face with his linen coat as he threw himself pantingly on the ground  i struck out over here first boys to give you a little warning he said as soon as he had gained breath that engineer will be down here to take charge as soon as the six oclock stage comes in hes an oldish chap has got a family of two daughters andiamdd if he is not bringing them down here with him  oh go long exclaimed the five men in one voice raising themselves on their hands and elbows and glaring at the speaker  fact boys soon as i found it out i just waltzed into that jew shop at the crossing and bought up all the clothes that would be likely to suit you fellows before anybody else got a show i reckon i cleared out the shop the duds are a little mixed in style but i reckon theyre clean and whole and a man might face a lady in em i left them round at the old buckeye spring where theyre handy without attracting attention you boys can go there for a general washup rig yourselves up without saying anything and then meander back careless and easy in your store clothes just as the stage is coming in sabe  why didnt you let us know earlier asked mattingly aggrievedly youve been back here at least an hour  ive been getting some place ready for them returned the newcomer we might have managed to put the man somewhere if hed been alone but these women want family accommodation there was nothing left for me to do but to buy up thompsons saloon  no interrupted his audience half in incredulity half in protestation  fact you boys will have to take your drinks under canvas again i reckon but i made thompson let those goldframed mirrors that used to stand behind the bar go into the bargain and they sort of furnish the room you know the saloon is one of them patent houses you can take to pieces and ive been reckoning you boys will have to pitch in and help me to take the whole shanty over to the laurel bushes and put it up agin kearneys cabin  whats all that said the younger kearney with an odd mingling of astonishment and bashful gratification  yes i reckon yours is the cleanest house because its the newest so youll just step out and let us knock in one o the gables and clap it on to the saloon and make one house of it dont you see therell be two rooms one for the girls and the other for the old man  the astonishment and bewilderment of the party had gradually given way to a boyish and impatient interest  hadnt we better do the job at once suggested dick mattingly  or throw ourselves into those new clothes so as to be ready added the younger kearney looking down at his ragged trousers i say fairfax what are the girls like eh  all the others had been dying to ask the question yet one and all laughed at the conscious manner and blushing cheek of the questioner  youll find out quick enough returned fairfax whose curt carelessness did not however prevent a slight increase of color on his own cheek wed better get that job off our hands before doing anything else so if youre ready boys well just waltz down to thompsons and pack up the shanty hes out of it by this time i reckon you might as well be perspiring to some purpose over there as gaspin under this tree we wont go back to work this afternoon but knock off now and call it half a day come hump yourselves gentlemen are you ready one two three and away  in another instant the tree was deserted the figures of the five millionaires of devils ford crossing the fierce glare of the open space with boyish alacrity glistened in the sunlight and then disappeared in the nearest fringe of thickets     chapter ii   six hours later when the shadow of devils spur had crossed the river and spread a slight coolness over the flat beyond the pioneer coach leaving the summit began also to bathe its heated bulk in the long shadows of the descent conspicuous among the dusty passengers the two pretty and youthful faces of the daughters of philip carr mining superintendent and engineer looked from the windows with no little anxiety towards their future home in the straggling settlement below that occasionally came in view at the turns of the long zigzagging road a slight look of comical disappointment passed between them as they gazed upon the sterile flat dotted with unsightly excrescences that stood equally for cabins or mounds of stone and gravel it was so feeble and inconsistent a culmination to the beautiful scenery they had passed through so hopeless and imbecile a conclusion to the preparation of that long picturesque journey with its glimpses of sylvan and pastoral glades and canyons that as the coach swept down the last incline and the remorseless monotony of the dead level spread out before them furrowed by ditches and indented by pits under cover of shielding their cheeks from the impalpable dust that rose beneath the plunging wheels they buried their faces in their handkerchiefs to hide a few halfhysterical tears happily their father completely absorbed in a practical scientific and approving contemplation of the topography and material resources of the scene of his future labors had no time to notice their defection it was not until the stage drew up before a rambling tenement bearing the inscription hotel and stage office that he became fully aware of it  we cant stop here papa said christie carr decidedly with a shake of her pretty head you cant expect that  mr carr looked up at the building it was half grocery half saloon whatever other accommodations it contained must have been hidden in the rear as the flat roof above was almost level with the raftered ceiling of the shop  certainly he replied hurriedly well see to that in a moment i dare say its all right i told fairfax we were coming somebody ought to be here  but theyre not said jessie carr indignantly and the few that were here scampered off like rabbits to their burrows as soon as they saw us get down  it was true the little group of loungers before the building had suddenly disappeared there was the flash of a red shirt vanishing in an adjacent doorway the fading apparition of a pair of high boots and blue overalls in another the abrupt withdrawal of a curly blond head from a sashless window over the way even the saloon was deserted although a back door in the dim recess seemed to creak mysteriously the stagecoach with the other passengers had already rattled away  i certainly think fairfax understood that i began mr carr  he was interrupted by the pressure of christies fingers on his arm and a subdued exclamation from jessie who was staring down the street  what are they she whispered in her sisters ear nigger minstrels a circus or what  the five millionaires of devils ford had just turned the corner of the straggling street and were approaching in single file one glance was sufficient to show that they had already availed themselves of the new clothing bought by fairfax had washed and one or two had shaved but the result was startling  through some fortunate coincidence in size dick mattingly was the only one who had achieved an entire new suit but it was of funereal black cloth and although relieved at one extremity by a pair of high riding boots in which his too short trousers were tucked and at the other by a tall white hat and cravat of aggressive yellow the effect was depressing in agreeable contrast his brother maryland joe was attired in a thin fawncolored summer overcoat lightly worn open so as to show the unstarched bosom of a white embroidered shirt and a pair of nankeen trousers and pumps  the kearney brothers had divided a suit between them the elder wearing a tightlyfitting singlebreasted blue frockcoat and a pair of pink striped cotton trousers while the younger candidly displayed the trousers of his brothers suit as a harmonious change to a shining black alpaca coat and crimson neckerchief fairfax who brought up the rear had with characteristic unselfishness contented himself with a french workmans blue blouse and a pair of white duck trousers had they shown the least consciousness of their finery or of its absurdity they would have seemed despicable but only one expression beamed on the five sunburnt and shining facesa look of unaffected boyish gratification and unrestricted welcome  they halted before mr carr and his daughters simultaneously removed their various and remarkable head coverings and waited until fairfax advanced and severally presented them jessie carrs halffrightened smile took refuge in the trembling shadows of her dark lashes christie carr stiffened slightly and looked straight before her  we reckonedthat iswe intended to meet you and the young ladies at the grade said fairfax reddening a little as he endeavored to conceal his too ready slang and save you from trapesingfrom dragging yourselves up grade again to your house  then there is a house said jessie with an alarming frank laugh of relief that was however as frankly reflected in the boyishly appreciative eyes of the young men  such as it is responded fairfax with a shade of anxiety as he glanced at the fresh and pretty costumes of the young women and dubiously regarded the two saratoga trunks resting hopelessly on the veranda im afraid it isnt much for what youre accustomed to but he added more cheerfully it will do for a day or two and perhaps youll give us the pleasure of showing you the way there now  the procession was quickly formed mr carr alive only to the actual business that had brought him there at once took possession of fairfax and began to disclose his plans for the working of the mine occasionally halting to look at the work already done in the ditches and to examine the field of his future operations fairfax not displeased at being thus relieved of a lighter attendance on mr carrs daughters nevertheless from time to time cast a paternal glance backwards upon their escorts who had each seized a handle of the two trunks and were carrying them in couples at the young ladies side the occupation did not offer much freedom for easy gallantry but no sign of discomfiture or uneasiness was visible in the grateful faces of the young men the necessity of changing hands at times with their burdens brought a corresponding change of cavalier at the ladys side although it was observed that the younger kearney for the sake of continuing a conversation with miss jessie kept his grasp of the handle nearest the young lady until his hand was nearly cut through and his arm worn out by exhaustion  the only thing on wheels in the camp is a mule wagon and the mules are packin gravel from the river this afternoon explained dick mattingly apologetically to christie or wed have totedi mean carriedyou and your baggage up to the shanttheyour house give us two weeks more miss carronly two weeks to wash up our work and realizeand well give you a pair of 240 steppers and a skeleton buggy to meet you at the top of the hill and drive you over to the cabin perhaps youd prefer a regular carriage some ladies do and a nigger driver but whats the use of planning anything afore that time comes well have run you up a house on the hill and you shall pick out the spot it wouldnt take longunless you preferred brick i suppose we could get brick over from la grange if you cared for it but it would take longer if you could put up for a time with something of stained glass and a mahogany veranda  in spite of her cold indignation and the fact that she could understand only a part of mattinglys speech christie comprehended enough to make her lift her clear eyes to the speaker as she replied freezingly that she feared she would not trouble them long with her company  oh youll get over that responded mattingly with an exasperating confidence that drove her nearly frantic from the manifest kindliness of intent that made it impossible for her to resent it i felt that way myself at first things will look strange and unsociable for a while until you get the hang of them youll naturally stamp round and cuss a little he stopped in conscious consternation  with ready tact and before christie could reply maryland joe had put down the trunk and changed hands with his brother  you mustnt mind dick or hell go off and kill himself with shame he whispered laughingly in her ear he means all right but hes picked up so much slang here that hes about forgotten how to talk english and its nigh on to four years since hes met a young lady  christie did not reply yet the laughter of her sister in advance with the kearney brothers seemed to make the reserve with which she tried to crush further familiarity only ridiculous  do you know many operas miss carr  she looked at the boyish interested sunburnt face so near to her own and hesitated after all why should she add to her other real disappointments by taking this absurd creature seriously  in what way she returned with a half smile  to play on the piano of course there isnt one nearer here than sacramento but i reckon we could get a small one by thursday you couldnt do anything on a banjo he added doubtfully kearneys got one  i imagine it would be very difficult to carry a piano over those mountains said christie laughingly to avoid the collateral of the banjo  we got a billiardtable over from stockton half bashfully interrupted dick mattingly struggling from his end of the trunk to recover his composure and it had to be brought over in sections on the back of a mule so i dont see why he stopped short again in confusion at a sign from his brother and then added i mean of course that a piano is a heap more delicate and valuable and all that sort of thing but its worth trying for  fairfax was always saying hed get one for himself so i reckon its possible said joe  does he play asked christie  you bet said joe quite forgetting himself in his enthusiasm he can snatch mozart and beethoven baldheaded  in the embarrassing silence that followed this speech the fringe of pine wood nearest the flat was reached here there was a rude clearing and beneath an enormous pine stood the two recently joined tenements there was no attempt to conceal the point of junction between kearneys cabin and the newlytransported saloon from the flatno architectural illusion of the palpable collusion of the two buildings which seemed to be telescoped into each other the front room or living room occupied the whole of kearneys cabin it contained in addition to the necessary articles for housekeeping a bunk or berth for mr carr so as to leave the second building entirely to the occupation of his daughters as bedroom and boudoir  there was a halfhumorous halfapologetic exhibition of the rude utensils of the living room and then the young men turned away as the two girls entered the open door of the second room neither christie nor jessie could for a moment understand the delicacy which kept these young men from accompanying them into the room they had but a few moments before decorated and arranged with their own hands and it was not until they turned to thank their strange entertainers that they found that they were gone  the arrangement of the second room was rude and bizarre but not without a singular originality and even tastefulness of conception what had been the counter or bar of the saloon gorgeous in white and gold now sawn in two and divided was set up on opposite sides of the room as separate dressingtables decorated with huge bunches of azaleas that hid the rough earthenware bowls and gave each table the appearance of a vestal altar  the huge gilt plateglass mirror which had hung behind the bar still occupied one side of the room but its length was artfully divided by an enormous rosette of red white and blue muslinone of the surviving fourth of july decorations of thompsons saloon on either side of the door two patheticlooking conventlike cots covered with spotless sheeting and heaped up in the middle like a snowcovered grave had attracted their attention they were still staring at them when mr carr anticipated their curiosity  i ought to tell you that the young men confided to me the fact that there was neither bed nor mattress to be had on the ford they have filled some flour sacks with clean dry moss from the woods and put half a dozen blankets on the top and they hope you can get along until the messenger who starts tonight for la grange can bring some bedding over  jessie flew with mischievous delight to satisfy herself of the truth of this marvel its so christie she said laughinglythree floursacks apiece but im jealous yours are all marked superfine and mine middlings  mr carr had remained uneasily watching christies shadowed face  what matters she said drily the accommodation is all in keeping  it will be better in a day or two he continued casting a longing look towards the doorthe first refuge of masculine weakness in an impending domestic emergency ill go and see what can be done he said feebly with a sidelong impulse towards the opening and freedom ive got to see fairfax again tonight any way  one moment father said christie wearily did you know anything of this place and thesethese peoplebefore you came  certainlyof course i did he returned with the sudden testiness of disturbed abstraction what are you thinking of i knew the geological strata and thethe report of fairfax and his partners before i consented to take charge of the works and i can tell you that there is a fortune here i intend to make my own terms and share in it  and not take a salary or some sum of money down said christie slowly removing her bonnet in the same resigned way  i am not a hired man or a workman christie said her father sharply you ought not to oblige me to remind you of that  but the hired menthe superintendent and his workmenwere the only ones who ever got anything out of your last experience with colonel waters at la grange andand we at least lived among civilized people there  these young men are not common people christie even if they have forgotten the restraints of speech and manners theyre gentlemen  who are willing to live likelike negroes  you can make them what you please  christie raised her eyes there was a certain cynical ring in her fathers voice that was unlike his usual hesitating abstraction it both puzzled and pained her  i mean he said hastily that you have the same opportunity to direct the lives of these young men into more regular disciplined channels that i have to regulate and correct their foolish waste of industry and material here it would at least beguile the time for you  fortunately for mr carrs escape and christies uneasiness jessie who had been examining the details of the livingroom broke in upon this conversation  im sure it will be as good as a perpetual picnic george kearney says we can have a cookingstove under the tree outside at the back and as there will be no rain for three months we can do the cooking there and that will give us more room forfor the piano when it comes and theres an old squaw to do the cleaning and washingup any dayandandit will be real fun  she stopped breathlessly with glowing cheeks and sparkling eyesa charming picture of youth and trustfulness mr carr had seized the opportunity to escape  really now christie said jessie confidentially when they were alone and christie had begun to unpack her trunk and to mechanically put her things away theyre not so bad  who asked christie  why the kearneys and mattinglys and fairfax and the lot provided you dont look at their clothes and think of it they told mefor they tell one everything in the most alarming waythat those clothes were bought to please us a scramble of things bought at la grange without reference to size or style and to hear these creatures talk why youd think they were astors or rothschilds think of that little one with the curlsi dont believe he is over seventeen for all his baby moustachesays hes going to build an assembly hall for us to give a dance in next month and apologizes the next breath to tell us that there isnt any milk to be had nearer than la grange and we must do without it and use syrup in our tea tomorrow  and where is all this wealth said christie forcing herself to smile at her sisters animation  under our very feet my child and all along the river why what we thought was pure and simple mud is what they call goldbearing cement  i suppose that is why they dont brush their boots and trousers its so precious returned christie drily and have they ever translated this precious dirt into actual coin  bless you yes why that dirty little gutter you know that ran along the side of the road and followed us down the hill all the way here that cost themlet me seeyes nearly sixty thousand dollars and fancy papas just condemned itsays it wont do and theyve got to build another  an impatient sigh from christie drew jessies attention to her troubled eyebrows  dont worry about our disappointment dear it isnt so very great i dare say well be able to get along here in some way until papa is rich again you know they intend to make him share with them  it strikes me that he is sharing with them already said christie glancing bitterly round the cabin sharing everythingourselves our lives our tastes  yees said jessie with vaguely hesitating assent yes even these she showed two dice in the palm of her little hand i found em in the drawer of our dressingtable  throw them away said christie impatiently  but jessies small fingers closed over the dice ill give them to the little kearney i dare say they were the poor boys playthings  the appearance of these relics of wild dissipation however had lifted christie out of her sublime resignation for heavens sake jessie she said look around and see if there is anything more  to make sure they each began to scrimmage the brokenspirited christie exhibiting both alacrity and penetration in searching obscure corners in the diningroom behind the dresser three or four books were discovered an odd volume of thackeray another of dickens a memorandumbook or diary this seems to be latin said jessie fishing out a smaller book i cant read it  its just as well you shouldnt said christie shortly whose ideas of a general classical impropriety had been gathered from pages of lemprieres dictionary put it back directly  jessie returned certain odes of one horatius flaccus to the corner and uttered an exclamation oh christie here are some letters tied up with a ribbon  they were two or three prettily written letters exhaling a faint odor of refinement and of the pressed flowers that peeped from between the loose leaves i see my darling fairfax its from some woman  i dont think much of her whosoever she is said christie tossing the intact packet back into the corner  nor i echoed jessie  nevertheless by some feminine inconsistency evidently the circumstance did make them think more of him for a minute later when they had reentered their own room christie remarked the idea of petting a man by his family name think of mamma ever having called papa darling carr  oh but his family name isnt fairfax said jessie hastily thats his first name his christian name i forget whats his other name but nobody ever calls him by it  do you mean said christie with glistening eyes and awful deliberationdo you mean to say that were expected to fall in with this insufferable familiarity i suppose theyll be calling us by our christian names next  oh but they do said jessie mischievously  what  they call me miss jessie and kearney the little one asked me if christie played  and what did you say  i said that you did answered jessie with an affectation of cherubic simplicity you do dear dont you    there dont get angry darling i couldnt flare up all of a sudden in the face of that poor little creature he looked so absurdand soso honest  christie turned away relapsing into her old resigned manner and assuming her household duties in a quiet temporizing way that was however without hope or expectation  mr carr who had dined with his friends under the excuse of not adding to the awkwardness of the first days housekeeping returned late at night with a mass of papers and drawings into which he afterwards withdrew but not until he had delivered himself of a mysterious package entrusted to him by the young men for his daughters it contained a contribution to their board in the shape of a silver spoon and battered silver mug which jessie chose to facetiously consider as an affecting reminiscence of the youthful kearneys christening dayswhich it probably was  the young girls retired early to their white snowdrifts jessie not without some hilarious struggles with hers in which she was however quickly surprised by the deep and refreshing sleep of youth christie to lie awake and listen to the night wind that had changed from the first cool whispers of sunset to the sturdy breath of the mountain at times the frail house shook and trembled wandering gusts laden with the deep resinous odors of the wood found their way through the imperfect jointure of the two cabins swept her cheek and even stirred her long wideopen lashes a broken spray of pine needles rustled along the roof or a pine cone dropped with a quick reverberating taptap that for an instant startled her lying thus wide awake she fell into a dreamy reminiscence of the past hearing snatches of old melody in the moving pines fragments of sentences old words and familiar epithets in the murmuring wind at her ear and even the faint breath of longforgotten kisses on her cheek she remembered her mothera pallid creature who had slowly faded out of one of her fathers vague speculations in a vaguer speculation of her own beyond his kenwhose place she had promised to take at her fathers side the words watch over him christie he needs a womans care again echoed in her ears as if borne on the night wind from the lonely grave in the lonelier cemetery by the distant sea she had devoted herself to him with some little sacrifices of self only remembered now for their uselessness in saving her father the disappointment that sprang from his sanguine and oneidead temperament she thought of him lying asleep in the other room ready on the morrow to devote those fateful qualities to the new enterprise that with equally fateful disposition she believed would end in failure it did not occur to her that the doubts of her own practical nature were almost as dangerous and illogical as his enthusiasm and that for that reason she was fast losing what little influence she possessed over him with the example of her mothers weakness before her eyes she had become an unsparing and distrustful critic with the sole effect of awakening his distrust and withdrawing his confidence from her  he was beginning to deceive her as he had never deceived her mother even jessie knew more of this last enterprise than she did herself  all that did not tend to decrease her utter restlessness it was already past midnight when she noticed that the wind had again abated the mountain breeze had by this time possessed the stifling valleys and heated bars of the river in its strong cold embraces the equilibrium of nature was restored and a shadowy mist rose from the hollow a stillness more oppressive and intolerable than the previous commotion began to pervade the house and the surrounding woods she could hear the regular breathing of the sleepers she even fancied she could detect the faint impulses of the more distant life in the settlement the faroff barking of a dog a lost shout the indistinct murmur of some nearer watercoursemere phantoms of soundmade the silence more irritating with a sudden resolution she arose dressed herself quietly and completely threw a heavy cloak over her head and shoulders and opened the door between the livingroom and her own her father was sleeping soundly in his bunk in the corner she passed noiselessly through the room opened the lightly fastened door and stepped out into the night  in the irritation and disgust of her walk hither she had never noticed the situation of the cabin as it nestled on the slope at the fringe of the woods in the preoccupation of her disappointment and the mechanical putting away of her things she had never looked once from the window of her room or glanced backward out of the door that she had entered the view before her was a revelationa reproach a surprise that took away her breath over her shoulders the newly risen moon poured a flood of silvery light stretching from her feet across the shining bars of the river to the opposite bank and on up to the very crest of the devils spurno longer a huge bulk of crushing shadow but the steady exaltation of plateau spur and terrace clothed with replete and unutterable beauty in this magical light that beauty seemed to be sustained and carried along by the river winding at its base lifted again to the broad shoulder of the mountain and lost only in the distant vista of deathlike overcrowning snow behind and above where she stood the towering woods seemed to be waiting with opened ranks to absorb her with the little cabin she had quitted dwarfed into insignificance in the vast prospect but nowhere was there another sign or indication of human life and habitation she looked in vain for the settlement for the rugged ditches the scattered cabins and the unsightly heaps of gravel in the glamour of the moonlight they had vanished a veil of silvergray vapor touched here and there with ebony shadows masked its site a black strip beyond was the river bank all else was changed with a sudden sense of awe and loneliness she turned to the cabin and its sleeping inmatesall that seemed left to her in the vast and stupendous domination of rock and wood and sky  but in another moment the loneliness passed a new and delicious sense of an infinite hospitality and friendliness in their silent presence began to possess her this same slighted forgotten uncomprehended but still foolish and forgiving nature seemed to be bending over her frightened and listening ear with vague but thrilling murmurings of freedom and independence she felt her heart expand with its wholesome breath her soul fill with its sustaining truth  she felt  what was that  an unmistakable outburst of a drunken song at the foot of the slope       oh my name it is johnny from pike      im hll on a spree or a strike     she stopped as crimson with shame and indignation as if the viewless singer had risen before her       i knew when to bet and get up and get  hush dn it all dont you hear  there was the sound of hurried whispers a no and yes and then a dead silence  christie crept nearer to the edge of the slope in the shadow of a buckeye in the clearer view she could distinguish a staggering figure in the trail below who had evidently been stopped by two other expostulating shadows that were approaching from the shelter of a tree  shodidnt know  the staggering figure endeavored to straighten itself and then slouched away in the direction of the settlement the two mysterious shadows retreated again to the tree and were lost in its deeper shadow christie darted back to the cabin and softly reentered her room  i thought i heard a noise that woke me and i missed you said jessie rubbing her eyes did you see anything  no said christie beginning to undress  you werent frightened dear  not in the least said christie with a strange little laugh go to sleep     chapter iii   the five impulsive millionaires of devils ford fulfilled not a few of their most extravagant promises in less than six weeks mr carr and his daughters were installed in a new house built near the site of the double cabin which was again transferred to the settlement in order to give greater seclusion to the fair guests it was a long roomy onestoried villa with a not unpicturesque combination of deep veranda and trellis work which relieved the flat monotony of the interior and the barrenness of the freshlycleared ground an upright piano brought from sacramento occupied the corner of the parlor a suite of gorgeous furniture whose pronounced and extravagant glories the young girls instinctively hid under homemade linen covers had also been spoils from afar elsewhere the house was filled with ornaments and decorations that in their incongruity forcibly recalled the gilded plateglass mirrors of the bedroom in the old cabin in the hasty furnishing of this aladdins palace the slaves of the ring had evidently seized upon anything that would add to its glory without reference always to fitness  i wish it didnt look so cussedly like a robbers cave said george kearney when they were taking a quiet preliminary survey of the unclassified treasures before the carrs took possession  or a gambling hell said his brother reflectively  its about the same thing i reckon said dick mattingly who was supposed in his fiery youth to have encountered the similarity  nevertheless the two girls managed to bestow the heterogeneous collection with tasteful adaptation to their needs a crystal chandelier which had once lent a fascinating illusion to the game of monte hung unlighted in the broad hall where a few other bizarre and public articles were relegated a long red sofa or bench which had done duty beside a billiardtable found a place here also indeed it is to be feared that some of the more rustic and bashful youths of devils ford who had felt it incumbent upon them to pay their respects to the newcomers were more at ease in this vestibule than in the arcana beyond whose glories they could see through the open door to others it represented a recognized state of probation before their reentree into civilization again i reckon if you dont mind miss said the spokesman of one party ez this is our first call well sorter hang out in the hall yer until your used to us on another occasion one whiskey dick impelled by a sense of duty paid a visit to the new house and its fair occupants in a fashion frankly recounted by him afterwards at the bar of the tecumseh saloon  you see boys i dropped in there the other night when some of you fellers was doin the hightoned thankee marm business in the parlor i just came to anchor in the corner of the sofy in the hall without lettin on to say that i was there and took up a websters dictionary that was on the table and laid it openkeerless like on my knees ez if i was sorter consultin itand kinder dozed off there listenin to you fellows gassin with the young ladies and that yer miss christie just snakin music outer that pianner and i reckon i fell asleep anyhow i was there nigh on to two hours its mighty soothin them fashionable calls sorter knocks the old camp dust outer a fellow and sets him up again  it would have been well if the new life of the devils ford had shown no other irregularity than the harmless eccentricities of its original locaters but the news of its sudden fortune magnified by report began presently to flood the settlement with another class of adventurers a tide of waifs strays and malcontents of old camps along the river began to set towards devils ford in very much the same fashion as the debris drift and alluvium had been carried down in bygone days and cast upon its banks a few immigrant wagons diverted from the highways of travel by the fame of the new diggings halted upon the slopes of devils spur and on the arid flats of the ford and disgorged their sallow freight of alkalipoisoned prematurelyaged women and children and maimed and feverstricken men against this rude form of domesticity were opposed the chromotinted dresses and extravagant complexions of a few single unattended womenhappily seen more often at night behind gilded bars than in the garish light of dayand an equal number of palefaced darkmoustached welldressed and suspiciously idle men a dozen rivals of thompsons saloon had sprung up along the narrow main street there were two new hotelsone a temperance house whose ascetic quality was confined only to the abnegation of whiskeya rival stage office and a small onestoried building from which the sierran banner fluttered weekly for ten dollars a year in advance insufferable in the glare of a sabbath sun bleak windy and flaring in the gloom of a sabbath night and hopelessly depressing on all days of the week the first presbyterian church lifted its blunt steeple from the barrenest area of the flats and was hideous the civic improvements so enthusiastically contemplated by the five millionaires in the earlier pages of this veracious chroniclethe fountain reservoir townhall and free libraryhad not yet been erected their sites had been anticipated by more urgent buildings and mining works unfortunately not considered in the sanguine dreams of the enthusiasts and more significant still their cost and expense had been also anticipated by the enormous outlay of their earnings in the work upon devils ditch  nevertheless the liberal fulfilment of their promise in the new house in the suburbs blinded the young girls eyes to their shortcomings in the town their own remoteness and elevation above its feverish life kept them from the knowledge of much that was strange and perhaps disturbing to their equanimity as they did not mix with the immigrant womenmiss jessies goodnatured intrusion into one of their halfnomadic camps one day having been met with rudeness and suspicionthey gradually fell into the way of trusting the responsibility of new acquaintances to the hands of their original hosts and of consulting them in the matter of local recreation it thus occurred that one day the two girls on their way to the main street for an hours shopping at the villa de paris and variety store were stopped by dick mattingly a few yards from their house with the remark that as the county election was then in progress it would be advisable for them to defer their intention for a few hours as he did not deem it necessary to add that two citizens in the exercise of a freemans franchise had been supplementing their ballots with bullets in front of an admiring crowd they knew nothing of that accident that removed from devils ford an entertaining stranger who had only the night before partaken of their hospitality  a week or two later returning one morning from a stroll in the forest christie and jessie were waylaid by george kearney and fairfax and under pretext of being shown a new and romantic trail were diverted from the regular path this enabled mattingly and maryland joe to cut down the body of a man hanged by the vigilance committee a few hours before on the regular trail and to remonstrate with the committee on the incompatibility of such exhibitions with a maidenly worship of nature  with the whole county to hang a man in expostulated joe you might keep clear of carrs woods  it is needless to add that the young girls never knew of this act of violence or the delicacy that kept them in ignorance of it mr carr was too absorbed in business to give heed to what he looked upon as a convulsion of society as natural as a geological upheaval and too prudent to provoke the criticism of his daughters by comment in their presence  an equally unexpected confidence however took its place mr carr having finished his coffee one morning lingered a moment over his perfunctory paternal embraces with the awkwardness of a preoccupied man endeavoring by the assumption of a lighter interest to veil another abstraction  and what are we doing today christie he asked as jessie left the diningroom  oh pretty much the usual thingnothing in particular if george kearney gets the horses from the summit were going to ride over to indian spring to picnic fairfaxmr munroei always forget that mans real name in this dreadfully familiar countrywell hes coming to escort us and take me i supposethat is if kearney takes jessie  a very nice arrangement returned her father with a slight nervous contraction of the corners of his mouth and eyelids to indicate mischievousness ive no doubt theyll both be here you know they usually areha ha and what about the two mattinglys and philip kearney eh he continued wont they be jealous  it isnt their turn said christie carelessly besides theyll probably be there  and i suppose theyre beginning to be resigned said carr smiling  what on earth are you talking of father  she turned her clear brown eyes upon him and was regarding him with such manifest unconsciousness of the drift of his speech and withal a little vague impatience of his archness that mr carr was feebly alarmed it had the effect of banishing his assumed playfulness which made his serious explanation the more irritating  well i rather thought thatthat young kearney was paying considerable attention tototo jessie replied her father with hesitating gravity  what that boy  young kearney is one of the original locators and an equal partner in the mine a very enterprising young fellow in fact much more advanced and bolder in his conceptions than the others i find no difficulty with him  at another time christie would have questioned the convincing quality of this proof but she was too much shocked at her fathers first suggestion to think of anything else  you dont mean to say father that you are talking seriously of these menyour friendswhom we see every dayand our only company  no no said mr carr hastily you misunderstand i dont suppose that jessie or you  or me am i included  you dont let me speak christie i mean i am not talking seriously continued mr carr with his most serious aspect of you and jessie in this matter but it may be a serious thing to these young men to be thrown continually in the company of two attractive girls  i understandyou mean that we should not see so much of them said christie with a frank expression of relief so genuine as to utterly discompose her father perhaps you are right though i fail to discover anything serious in the attentions of young kearney to jessieorwhoever it may beto me but it will be very easy to remedy it and see less of them indeed we might begin today with some excuse  yescertainly of course said mr carr fully convinced of his utter failure but like most weak creatures consoling himself with the reflection that he had not shown his hand or committed himself yes but it would perhaps be just as well for the present to let things go on as they were well talk of it againim in a hurry now and edging himself through the door he slipped away  what do you think is fathers last idea said christie with i fear a slight lack of reverence in her tone as her sister reentered the room he thinks george kearney is paying you too much attention  no said jessie replying to her sisters halfinterrogative halfamused glance with a frank unconscious smile  yes and he says that fairfaxi think its fairfaxis equally fascinated with me  jessies brow slightly contracted as she looked curiously at her sister  of all things she said i wonder if any one has put that idea into his dear old head he couldnt have thought it himself  i dont know said christie musingly but perhaps its just as well if we kept a little more to ourselves for a while  did father say so said jessie quickly  no but that is evidently what he meant  yees said jessie slowly unless  unless what said christie sharply jessie you dont for a moment mean to say that you could possibly conceive of anything else  i mean to say said jessie stealing her arm around her sisters waist demurely that you are perfectly right well keep away from these fascinating devils forders and particularly the youngest kearney i believe there has been some illnatured gossip i remember that the other day when we passed the shanty of that pike county family on the slope there were three women at the door and one of them said something that made poor little kearney turn white and pink alternately and dance with suppressed rage i suppose the old ladymcorkle thats her namewould like to have a share of our cavaliers for her euphemy and mamie i dare say its only right i would lend them the cherub occasionally and you might let them have mr munroe twice a week  she laughed but her eyes sought her sisters with a certain watchfulness of expression  christie shrugged her shoulders with a suggestion of disgust  dont joke we ought to have thought of all this before  but when we first knew them in the dear old cabin there wasnt any other woman and nobody to gossip and thats what made it so nice i dont think so very much of civilization do you said the young lady pertly  christie did not reply perhaps she was thinking the same thing it certainly had been very pleasant to enjoy the spontaneous and chivalrous homage of these men with no further suggestion of recompense or responsibility than the permission to be worshipped but beyond that she racked her brain in vain to recall any look or act that proclaimed the lover these men whom she had found so relapsed into barbarism that they had forgotten the most ordinary forms of civilization these men even in whose extravagant admiration there was a certain loss of selfrespect that as a woman she would never forgive these men who seemed to belong to another raceimpossible yet it was so  what construction must they have put upon her fathers acceptance of their presentsof their companyof her freedom in their presence no they must have understood from the beginning that she and her sister had never looked upon them except as transient hosts and chance acquaintances any other idea was preposterous and yet  it was the recurrence of this yet that alarmed her for she remembered now that but for their slavish devotion they might claim to be her equal according to her fathers account they had come from homes as good as their own they were certainly more than her equal in fortune and her father had come to them as an employee until they had taken him into partnership if there had only been sentiment of any kind connected with any of them but they were all alike brave unselfish humorousand often ridiculous if anything dick mattingly was funniest by nature and made her laugh more maryland joe his brother told better stories sometimes of dick though not so good a mimic as the other kearney who had a fairly sympathetic voice in singing they were all goodlooking enough perhaps they set store on thatmen are so vain  and as for her own rejected suitor fairfax munroe except for a kind of grave and proper motherliness about his protecting manner he absolutely was the most indistinctive of them all he had once brought her some rare tea from the chinese camp and had taught her how to make it he had cautioned her against sitting under the trees at nightfall he had once taken off his coat to wrap around her really if this were the only evidence of devotion that could be shown she was safe  well said jessie it amuses you i see  christie checked the smile that had been dimpling the cheek nearest jessie and turned upon her the face of an elder sister  tell me have you noticed this extraordinary attention of mr munroe to me  candidly asked jessie seating herself comfortably on the table sideways and endeavoring to pull her skirt over her little feet honest injun  dont be idiotic and above all dont be slangy of course candidly  well no i cant say that i have  then said christie why in the name of all thats preposterous do they persist in pairing me off with the least interesting man of the lot  jessie leaped from the table  come now she said with a little nervous laugh hes not so bad as all that you dont know him but what does it matter now as long as were not going to see them any more  theyre coming here for the ride today said christie resignedly father thought it better not to break it off at once  father thought so echoed jessie stopping with her hand on the door  yes why do you ask  but jessie had already left the room and was singing in the hall   chapter iv   the afternoon did not however bring their expected visitors it brought instead a brief note by the hands of whiskey dick from fairfax apologizing for some business that kept him and george kearney from accompanying the ladies it added that the horses were at the disposal of themselves and any escort they might select if they would kindly give the message to whiskey dick  the two girls looked at each other awkwardly jessie did not attempt to conceal a slight pout  it looks as if they were anticipating us she said with a halfforced smile i wonder now if there really has been any gossip but no they wouldnt have stopped for that unless she looked curiously at her sister  unless what repeated christie you are horribly mysterious this morning  am i its nothing but theyre wanting an answer of course youll decline  and intimate we only care for their company no well say were sorry they cant come andaccept their horses we can do without an escort we two  capital said jessie clapping her hands well show them  well show them nothing interrupted christie decidedly in our place theres only the one thing to do where is thiswhiskey dick  in the parlor  the parlor echoed christie whiskey dick whatis he  yes hes all right said jessie confidently hes been here before but he stayed in the hall he was so shy i dont think you saw him  i should think notwhiskey dick  oh you can call him mr hall if you like said jessie laughing his real name is dick hall if you want to be funny you can say alky hall as the others do  christies only reply to this levity was a look of superior resignation as she crossed the hall and entered the parlor  then ensued one of those surprising mystifying and utterly inexplicable changes that leave the masculine being so helpless in the hands of his feminine master before christie opened the door her face underwent a rapid transformation the gentle glow of a refined womans welcome suddenly beamed in her interested eyes the impulsive courtesy of an expectant hostess eagerly seizing a longlookedfor opportunity broke in a smile upon her lips as she swept across the room and stopped with her two white outstretched hands before whiskey dick  it needed only the extravagant contrast presented by that gentleman to complete the tableau attired in a suit of shining black alpaca the visitor had evidently prepared himself with some care for a possible interview he was seated by the french window opening upon the veranda as if to secure a retreat in case of an emergency scrupulously washed and shaven some of the soap appeared to have lingered in his eyes and inflamed the lids even while it lent a sleek and shining lustre not unlike his coat to his smooth black hair nevertheless leaning back in his chair he had allowed a large white handkerchief to depend gracefully from his fingersa pose at once suggesting easy and elegant langour  how kind of you to give me an opportunity to make up for my misfortune when you last called i was so sorry to have missed you but it was entirely my fault you were hurried i thinkyou conversed with others in the hallyou  she stopped to assist him to pick up the handkerchief that had fallen and the panama hat that had rolled from his lap towards the window when he had started suddenly to his feet at the apparition of grace and beauty as he still nervously retained the two hands he had grasped this would have been a difficult feat even had he not endeavored at the same moment by a backward furtive kick to propel the hat out of the window at which she laughingly broke from his grasp and flew to the rescue  dont mind it miss he said hurriedly it is not worth your demeaning yourself to touch it leave it outside thar miss i wouldnt have toted it in anyhow if some of those highfalutin fellows hadnt allowed the other night ez it were the reglar thing to do as if miss any gentleman kalkilated to ever put on his hat in the house afore a lady  but christie had already possessed herself of the unlucky object and had placed it upon the table this compelled whiskey dick to rise again and as an act of careless good breeding to drop his handkerchief in it he then leaned one elbow upon the piano and crossing one foot over the other remained standing in an attitude he remembered to have seen in the pages of an illustrated paper as portraying the hero in some drawingroom scene it was easy and effective but seemed to be more favorable to revery than conversation indeed he remembered that he had forgotten to consult the letterpress as to which it represented  i see you agree with me that politeness is quite a matter of intention said christie and not of mere fashion and rules now for instance she continued with a dazzling smile i suppose according to the rules i ought to give you a note to mr munroe accepting his offer that is all that is required but it seems so much nicer dont you think to tell it to you for him and have the pleasure of your company and a little chat at the same time  thats it thats just it miss carr youve hit it in the centre this time said whiskey dick now quite convinced that his attitude was not intended for eloquence and shifting back to his own seat hat and all thats tantamount to what i said to the boys just now you want an excuse sez i for not goin out with the young ladies so accorden to rules you writes a letter allowin buzziness and that sorter thing detains you but wots the facts youre a gentleman and as gentlemen you and george comes to the opinion that youre rather playin it for all its worth in this yer house you knowcomin here night and day off and on reglar sociable and famly like and makin people talk about things they aint any call to talk about and whats a darned sight more you fellows aint got any right yet to allow em to talk about dye see he paused out of breath  it was miss christies turn to move about in changing her seat to the pianostool so as to be nearer her visitor she brushed down some loose music which whiskey dick hastened to pick up  pray dont mind it she said pray dont reallylet it be but whiskey dick feeling himself on safe ground in this attention persisted to the bitter end of a disintegrated and wellworn travatore so that is what mr munroe said she remarked quietly  not just then in course but its whats bin on his mind and in his talk for days off and on returned dick with a knowing smile and a nod of mysterious confidence bless your soul miss carr folks like you and me dont need to have them things explained thats what i said to him sez i dont send no note but just go up there and hev it out fair and square and say what you do mean but they would hev the note and i kalkilated to bring it but when i set my eyes on you and heard you express yourself as you did just now i sez to myself sez i dick yers a young lady and a fashnable lady at that ez dont go foolin round on rules and etikettsexcuse my freedom miss carrand you and her sez i kin just discuss this yer matter in a sociable offhand fashnable way theyre a good lot o boys miss carr a square lotwhite men all of em but theyre a little soft and green may be from livin in these yer pine woods along o the other sap they just worship the ground you and your sister tread oncertain of course of course he added hurriedly recognizing christies halfconscious deprecating gesture with more exaggerated deprecation i understand but what i wanter say is that theyd be willin to be that ground and lie down and let you walk over themso to speak miss carr so to speakif it would keep the hem of your gown from gettin soiled in the mud o the camp but it wouldnt do for them to make a reglar curderoy road o themselves for the houl camp to trapse over on the mere chance of your some time passin that way would it now  wont you let me offer you some refreshment mr hall said christie rising with a slight color im really ashamed of my forgetfulness again but im afraid its partly your fault for entertaining me to the exclusion of yourself no thank you let me fetch it for you  she turned to a handsome sideboard near the door and presently faced him again with a decanter of whiskey and a glass in her hand and a return of the bewitching smile she had worn on entering  but perhaps you dont take whiskey suggested the arch deceiver with a sudden affected but pretty perplexity of eye brow and lips  for the first time in his life whiskey dick hesitated between two forms of intoxication but he was still nervous and uneasy habit triumphed and he took the whiskey he however wiped his lips with a slight wave of his handkerchief to support a certain easy elegance which he firmly believed relieved the act of any vulgar quality  yes maam he continued after an exhilarated pause ez i said afore this yers a matter you and me can discuss after the fashion o society my idea is that these yer boys should kinder let up on you and miss jessie for a while and do a little more permiskus attention round the ford theres one or two families yer with grownup gals ez oughter be squared that isthe boys mighter put in a few fancy touches among themkinder take em buggy ridingor to churchonce in a whilejust to take the pizen outer their tongues and make a kind o bluff to the parents dye see that would sorter divert their own minds and even if it didnt it would kinder get em accustomed agin to the old style and their own kind i want to warn ye agin an idea that might occur to you in a giniral way i dont say you hev the idea but its kind o natral you might be thinkin of it some time and i thought id warn you agin it  i think we understand each other too well to differ much mr hall said christie still smiling but what is the idea  the delicate compliment to their confidential relations and the slight stimulus of liquor had tremulously exalted whiskey dick affecting to look cautiously out of the window and around the room he ventured to draw nearer the young woman with a halfpaternal halftimid familiarity  it might have occurred to you he said laying his handkerchief as if to veil mere vulgar contact on christies shoulder that it would be a good thing on your side to invite down some of your hightoned gentlemen friends from frisco to visit you and escort you round it seems quite natral like and i dont say it aint butthe boys wouldnt stand for it  in spite of her selfpossession christies eyes suddenly darkened and she involuntarily drew herself up but whiskey dick guiltily attributing the movement to his own indiscreet gesture said excuse me miss recovered himself by lightly dusting her shoulder with his handkerchief as if to remove the impression and her smile returned  they wouldnt stand for it said dick and thered be some shooting not afore you missnot afore you in course but theyd adjourn to the woods some morning with them city folks and hev it out with rifles at a hundred yards or seein ez theyre city folks the boys would do the square thing with pistols at twelve paces theyre good boys as i said afore but theyre quick and tetchygeorge being the youngest natrally is the tetchiest you know how it is miss carr his pretty gallike face and little moustaches haz cost him half a dozen scrimmages already hez had a fight for every hair thats growed in his moustache since he kem here  say no more mr hall said christie rising and pressing her hands lightly on dicks tremulous fingers if i ever had any such idea i should abandon it now you are quite right in this as in your other opinions i shall never cease to be thankful to mr munroe and mr kearney that they intrusted this delicate matter to your hands  well said the gratified and reddening visitor it aint perhaps the square thing to them or myself to say that they reckoned to have me discuss their delicate affairs for them but  i understand interrupted christie they simply gave you the letter as a friend it was my good fortune to find you a sympathizing and liberal man of the world the delighted dick with conscious vanity beaming from every feature of his shining face lightly waved the compliment aside with his handkerchief as she continued but i am forgetting the message we accept the horses of course we could do without an escort but forgive my speaking so frankly are you engaged this afternoon  excuse me miss i dont take stammered dick scarcely believing his ears  could you give us your company as an escort repeated christie with a smile  was he awake or dreaming or was this some trick of liquor in his often distorted fancy he whiskey dick the butt of his friends the chartered oracle of the barrooms even in whose wretched vanity there was always the haunting suspicion that he was despised and scorned he who had dared so much in speech and achieved so little in fact he whose habitual weakness had even led him into the wildest indiscretion here henow offered a reward for that indiscretion he whiskey dick the solicited escort of these two beautiful and peerless girls what would they say at the ford what would his friends think it would be all over the ford the next day his past would be vindicated his future secured he grew erect at the thought it was almost in other voice and with no trace of his previous exaggeration that he said with pleasure  then if you will bring the horses at once we shall be ready when you return  in another instant he had vanished as if afraid to trust the reality of his good fortune to the dangers of delay at the end of half an hour he reappeared leading the two horses himself mounted on a halfbroken mustang a pair of large jingling silver spurs and a stiff sombrero borrowed with the mustang from some mysterious source were donned to do honor to the occasion  the young girls were not yet ready but he was shown by the chinese servant into the parlor to wait for them the decanter of whiskey and glasses were still invitingly there he was hot trembling and flushed with triumph he walked to the table and laid his hand on the decanter when an odd thought flashed upon him he would not drink this time no it should not be said that he the selected escort of the elite of devils ford had to fill himself up with whiskey before they started the boys might turn to each other in their astonishment as he proudly passed with his fair companions and say its whiskey dick but hed be dd if they should add and full as ever no sir nor when he was riding beside these real ladies and leaning over them at some confidential moment should they even know it from his breath no    yet a thimbleful taken straight only a thimbleful wouldnt be much and might help to pull him together he again reached his trembling hand for the decanter hesitated and then turning his back upon it resolutely walked to the open window almost at the same instant he found himself face to face with christie on the veranda  she looked into his bloodshot eyes and cast a swift glance at the decanter  wont you take something before you go she said sweetly  ireckonnot jest now stammered whiskey dick with a heroic effort  youre right said christie i see you are like me its too hot for anything fiery come with me  she led him into the diningroom and pouring out a glass of iced tea handed it to him poor dick was not prepared for this terrible culmination whiskey dick and iced tea but under pretence of seeing if it was properly flavored christie raised it to her own lips  try it to please me  he drained the goblet  now then said christie gayly lets find jessie and be off     chapter v   whatever might have been his other deficiencies as an escort whiskey dick was a good horseman and in spite of his fractious brute exhibited such skill and confidence as to at once satisfy the young girls of his value to them in the management of their own horses to whom sidesaddles were still an alarming novelty jessie who had probably already learned from her sister the purport of dicks confidences had received him with equal cordiality and perhaps a more unqualified amusement and now when fairly lifted into the saddle by his tremulous but respectful hands made a very charming picture of youthful and rosy satisfaction and when christie more fascinating than ever in her ridinghabit took her place on the other side of dick as they sallied from the gate that gentleman felt his cup of happiness complete his triumphal entree into the world of civilization and fashion was secure he did not regret the untasted liquor here was an experience in after years to lean his back against comfortably in barrooms to entrance or defy mankind he had even got so far as to formulate in fancy the sentence i remember gentlemen that one afternoon being on a pasear with two fashnable young ladies etc etc  at present however he was obliged to confine himself to the functions of an elegant guide and ciceronewhen not engaged in having it out with his horse their way lay along the slope crossing the highroad at right angles to reach the deeper woods beyond dick would have lingered on the highwayostensibly to point out to his companions the new flume that had taken the place of the condemned ditch but really in the hope of exposing himself in his glory to the curious eyes of the wayfaring world  unhappily the road was deserted in the still powerful sunlight and he was obliged to seek the cover of the woods with a passing compliment to the parent of his charges waving his hands towards the flume he said look at that work of your fathers there aint no other man in californy but philip carr ez would hev the grit to hold up such a bluff agin natur and agin luck ez that yer flume stands for i dont say it cause youre his daughters ladies that aint the style ez you know in sassiety miss carr he added turning to christie as the more socially experienced no but there aint another man to be found ez could do it it cost already two hundred thousand itll cost five hundred thousand afore its done and every cent of it is got out of the yearth beneath it or hez got to be out of it taint evry man miss carr ez hev got the pluck to pledge not only what hes got but what he reckons to git  but suppose he dont get it said christie slightly contracting her brows  then theres the flume to show for it said dick  but of what use is the flume if there isnt any more gold continued christie almost angrily  thats good from you miss said dick giving way to a fit of hilarity thats good for a fashnable young ladyown daughter of philip carr she sez says she continued dick appealing to the sedate pines for appreciation of christies rare humor wots the use of a flume when gold aint there i must tell that to the boys  and whats the use of the gold in the ground when the flume isnt there to work it out said jessie to her sister with a cautioning glance towards dick  but dick did not notice the look that passed between the sisters the richer humor of jessies retort had thrown him into convulsions of laughter  and now she says wots the use o the gold without the flume xcuse me ladies but thats just puttin the hull question thats agitatin this yer camp inter two speeches as clear as crystal theres the hull crowd outsideand some on em inside like fairfax hez their doubtsez says with miss christie and theres all of us inside ez holds miss jessies views  i never heard mr munroe say that the flume was wrong said jessie quickly  not to you natrally said dick with a confidential look at christie but i reckon hed like some of the money it cost laid out for suthin else but whats the odds the gold is there and were bound to get it  dick was the foreman of a gang of paid workmen who had replaced the millionaires in mere manual labor and the we was a polite figure of speech  the conversation seemed to have taken an unfortunate turn and both the girls experienced a feeling of relief when they entered the long gulch or defile that led to indian spring the track now becoming narrow they were obliged to pass in single file along the precipitous hillside led by this escort this effectually precluded any further speech and christie at once surrendered herself to the calm obliterating influences of the forest the settlement and its gossip were far behind and forgotten in the absorption of nature her companions passed out of her mind even as they sometimes passed out of her sight in the windings of the shadowy trail as she rode alone the fronds of breasthigh ferns seemed to caress her with outstretched and gentlydetaining hands strange wildflowers sprang up through the parting underbrush even the granite rocks that at times pressed closely upon the trail appeared as if cushioned to her contact with starrayed mosses or lightly flung after her long lassoes of delicate vines she recalled the absolute freedom of their alfresco life in the old double cabin when she spent the greater part of her waking hours under the mute trees in the encompassing solitude and half regretting the more civilized restraints of this newer and more ambitious abode forgot that she had ever rebelled against it the social complication that threatened her now seemed to her rather the outcome of her halfcivilized parlor than of the sylvan glade how easy it would have been to have kept the cabin and then to have gone away entirely than for her father to have allowed them to be compromised with the growing fortunes of the settlement the suspicions and distrust that she had always felt of their fortunes seemed to grow with the involuntary admission of whiskey dick that they were shared by others who were practical men she was fain to have recourse to the prospect again to banish these thoughts and this opened her eyes to the fact that her companions had been missing from the trail ahead of her for some time she quickened her pace slightly to reach a projecting point of rock that gave her a more extended prospect but they had evidently disappeared  she was neither alarmed nor annoyed she could easily overtake them soon for they would miss her and return or wait for her at the spring at the worst she would have no difficulty in retracing her steps home in her present mood she could readily spare their company indeed she was not sorry that no other being should interrupt that sympathy with the free woods which was beginning to possess her  she was destined however to be disappointed she had not proceeded a hundred yards before she noticed the moving figure of a man beyond her in the hillside chaparral above the trail he seemed to be going in the same direction as herself and as she fancied endeavoring to avoid her this excited her curiosity to the point of urging her horse forward until the trail broadened into the level forest again which she now remembered was a part of the environs of indian spring the stranger hesitated pausing once or twice with his back towards her as if engaged in carefully examining the dwarf willows to select a switch christie slightly checked her speed as she drew nearer when as if obedient to a sudden resolution he turned and advanced towards her she was relieved and yet surprised to recognize the boyish face and figure of george kearney he was quite pale and agitated although attempting by a jaunty swinging of the switch he had just cut to assume the appearance of ease and confidence  here was an opportunity christie resolved to profit by it she did not doubt that the young fellow had already passed her sister on the trail but from bashfulness had not dared to approach her by inviting his confidence she would doubtless draw something from him that would deny or corroborate her fathers opinion of his sentiments if he was really in love with jessie she would learn what reasons he had for expecting a serious culmination of his suit and perhaps she might be able delicately to open his eyes to the truth if as she believed it was only a boyish fancy she would laugh him out of it with that camaraderie which had always existed between them a half motherly sympathy albeit born quite as much from a contemplation of his beautiful yearning eyes as from his interesting position lightened the smile with which she greeted him  so you contrived to throw over your stupid business and join us after all she said or was it that you changed your mind at the last moment she added mischievously i thought only we women were permitted that indeed she could not help noticing that there was really a strong feminine suggestion in the shifting color and slightly conscious eyelids of the young fellow  do young girls always change their minds asked george with an embarrassed smile  not always but sometimes they dont know their own mindparticularly if they are very young and when they do at last you clever creatures of men who have interpreted their ignorance to please yourselves abuse them for being fickle she stopped to observe the effect of what she believed a rather clear and significant exposition of jessies and georges possible situation but she was not prepared for the look of blank resignation that seemed to drive the color from his face and moisten the fire of his dark eyes  i reckon youre right he said looking down  oh were not accusing you of fickleness said christie gayly although you didnt come and we were obliged to ask mr hall to join us i suppose you found him and jessie just now  but george made no reply the color was slowly coming back to his face which as she glanced covertly at him seemed to have grown so much older that his returning blood might have brought two or three years with it  really mr kearney she said dryly one would think that some silly conceited girlshe was quite earnest in her epithets for a sudden angry conviction of some coquetry and disingenuousness in jessie had come to her in contemplating its effects upon the young fellow at her sidesome country jilt had been trying her rustic hand upon you  she is not silly conceited nor countrified said george slowly raising his beautiful eyes to the young girl half reproachfully it is i who am all that no she is right and you know it  much as christie admired and valued her sisters charms she thought this was really going too far what had jessie ever donewhat was jessieto provoke and remain insensible to such a blind devotion as this and really looking at him now he was not so very young for jessie whether his unfortunate passion had brought out all his latent manliness or whether he had hitherto kept his serious nature in the background certainly he was not a boy and certainly his was not a passion that he could be laughed out of it was getting very tiresome she wished she had not met himat least until she had had some clearer understanding with her sister he was still walking beside her with his hand on her bridle rein partly to lead her horse over some boulders in the trail and partly to conceal his first embarrassment when they had fairly reached the woods he stopped  i am going to say goodby miss carr  are you not coming further we must be near indian spring now mr hall andand jessiecannot be far away you will keep me company until we meet them  no he replied quietly i only stopped you to say goodby i am going away  not from devils ford she asked in halfincredulous astonishment at least not for long  i am not coming back he replied  but this is very abrupt she said hurriedly feeling that in some ridiculous way she had precipitated an equally ridiculous catastrophe surely you are not going away in this fashion without saying goodby to jessie andand father  i shall see your father of courseand you will give my regards to miss jessie  he evidently was in earnest was there ever anything so perfectly preposterous she became indignant  of course she said coldly i wont detain you your business must be urgent and i forgotat least i had forgotten until todaythat you have other duties more important than that of squire of dames i am afraid this forgetfulness made me think you would not part from us in quite such a business fashion i presume if you had not met me just now we should none of us have seen you again  he did not reply  will you say goodby miss carr  he held out his hand  one moment mr kearney if i have said anything which you think justifies this very abrupt leavetaking i beg you will forgive and forget itor at least let it have no more weight with you than the idle words of any woman i only spoke generally you knowii might be mistaken  his eyes which had dilated when she began to speak darkened his color which had quickly come as quickly sank when she had ended  dont say that miss carr it is not like you andit is useless you know what i meant a moment ago i read it in your reply you meant that i like others had deceived myself did you not  she could not meet those honest eyes with less than equal honesty she knew that jessie did not love himwould not marry himwhatever coquetry she might have shown  i did not mean to offend you she said hesitatingly i only half suspected it when i spoke  and you wish to spare me the avowal he said bitterly  to me perhaps yes by anticipating it i could not tell what ideas you might have gathered from some indiscreet frankness of jessieor my father she added with almost equal bitterness  i have never spoken to either he replied quickly he stopped and added after a moments mortifying reflection ive been brought up in the woods miss carr and i suppose i have followed my feelings instead of the etiquette of society  christie was too relieved at the rehabilitation of jessies truthfulness to notice the full significance of his speech  goodby he said again holding out his hand  goodby  she extended her own ungloved with a frank smile he held it for a moment with his eyes fixed upon hers then suddenly as if obeying an uncontrollable impulse he crushed it like a flower again and again against his burning lips and darted away  christie sank back in her saddle with a little cry half of pain and half of frightened surprise had the poor boy suddenly gone mad or was this vicarious farewell a part of the courtship of devils ford she looked at her little hand which had reddened under the pressure and suddenly felt the flush extending to her cheeks and the roots of her hair this was intolerable  christie  it was her sister emerging from the wood to seek her in another moment she was at her side  we thought you were following said jessie good heavens how you look what has happened  nothing i met mr kearney a moment ago on the trail he is going away andand she stopped furious and flushing  and said jessie with a burst of merriment he told you at last he loved you oh christie     chapter vi   the abrupt departure of george kearney from devils ford excited but little interest in the community and was soon forgotten it was generally attributed to differences between himself and his partners on the question of further outlay of their earnings on mining improvementshe and philip carr alone representing a sanguine minority whose faith in the future of the mine accepted any risks it was alleged by some that he had sold out to his brother it was believed by others that he had simply gone to sacramento to borrow money on his share in order to continue the improvements on his own responsibility the partners themselves were uncommunicative even whiskey dick who since his remarkable social elevation had become less oracular much to his own astonishment contributed nothing to the gossip except a suggestion that as the fiery temper of george kearney brooked no opposition even from his brother it was better they should separate before the estrangement became serious  mr carr did not disguise his annoyance at the loss of his young disciple and firm ally but an unlucky allusion to his previous remarks on kearneys attentions to jessie and a querulous regret that he had permitted a disruption of their social intimacy brought such an ominous and frigid opposition not only from christie but even the frivolous jessie herself that carr sank back in a crushed and terrified silence i only meant to say he stammered after a pause in which he however resumed his aggrieved manner that fairfax seems to come here still and he is not such a particular friend of mine  but she isand has your interest entirely at heart said jessie stoutly and he only comes here to tell us how things are going on at the works  and criticise your father i suppose said mr carr with an attempt at jocularity that did not however disguise an irritated suspiciousness he really seems to have supplanted me as he has poor kearney in your estimation  now father said jessie suddenly seizing him by the shoulders in affected indignation but really to conceal a certain embarrassment that sprang quite as much from her sisters quietly observant eye as her fathers speech you promised to let this ridiculous discussion drop you will make me and christie so nervous that we will not dare to open the door to a visitor until he declares his innocence of any matrimonial intentions you dont want to give color to the gossip that agreement with your views about the improvements is necessary to getting on with us  who dares talk such rubbish said carr reddening is that the kind of gossip that fairfax brings here  hardly when its known that he dont quite agree with you and does come here thats the best denial of the gossip  christie who had of late loftily ignored these discussions waited until her father had taken his departure  then that is the reason why you still see mr munroe after what you said she remarked quietly to jessie  jessie who would have liked to escape with her father was obliged to pause on the threshold of the door with a pretty assumption of blank forgetfulness in her blue eyes and lifted eyebrows  said what when she asked vacantly  whenwhen mr kearney that dayin the woodswent away said christie faintly coloring  oh that day said jessie briskly the day he just gloved your hand with kisses and then fled wildly into the forest to conceal his emotion  the day he behaved very foolishly said christie with reproachful calmness that did not however prevent a suspicion of indignant moisture in her eyeswhen you explained  that it wasnt meant for me interrupted jessie  that it was to you that mr munroes attentions were directed and then we agreed that it was better to prevent any further advances of this kind by avoiding any familiar relations with either of them  yes said jessie i remember but youre not confounding my seeing fairfax occasionally now with that sort of thing he doesnt kiss my hand like anything she added as if in abstract reflection  nor run away either suggested the trodden worm turning  there was an ominous silence  do you know we are nearly out of coffee said jessie choking but moving towards the door with spartanlike calmness  yes and something must be done this very day about the washing said christie with suppressed emotion going towards the opposite entrance  tears stood in each others eyes with this terrible exchange of domestic confidences nevertheless after a moments pause they deliberately turned again and facing each other with frightful calmness left the room by purposeless and deliberate exits other than those they had contemplateda crushing abnegation of self that to some extent relieved their surcharged feelings  meantime the material prosperity of devils ford increased if a prosperity based upon no visible foundation but the confidences and hopes of its inhabitants could be called material few if any stopped to consider that the improvements buildings and business were simply the outlay of capital brought from elsewhere and as yet the settlement or town as it was now called had neither produced nor exported capital of itself equal to half the amount expended it was true that some land was cultivated on the further slope some mills erected and lumber furnished from the inexhaustible forest but the consumers were the inhabitants themselves who paid for their produce in borrowed capital or unlimited credit it was never discovered that while all roads led to devils ford devils ford led to nowhere the difficulties overcome in getting things into the settlement were never surmounted for getting things out of it the lumber was practically valueless for export to other settlements across the mountain roads which were equally rich in timber the theory so enthusiastically held by the original locators that devils ford was a vast sink that had through ages exhausted and absorbed the trickling wealth of the adjacent hills and valleys was suffering an ironical corroboration  one morning it was known that work was stopped at the devils ford ditchtemporarily only it was alleged and many of the old workmen simply had their labor for the present transferred to excavating the river banks and the collection of vast heaps of pay gravel specimens from these mounds taken from different localities and at different levels were sent to san francisco for more rigid assay and analysis it was believed that this would establish the fact of the permanent richness of the drifts and not only justify past expenditure but a renewed outlay of credit and capital the suspension of engineering work gave mr carr an opportunity to visit san francisco on general business of the mine which could not however prevent him from arranging further combinations with capital his two daughters accompanied him it offered an admirable opportunity for a shopping expedition a change of scene and a peaceful solution of their perplexing and anomalous social relations with devils ford in the first flush of gratitude to their father for this opportune holiday something of harmony had been restored to the family circle that had of late been shaken by discord  but their sanguine hopes of enjoyment were not entirely fulfilled both jessie and christie were obliged to confess to a certain disappointment in the aspect of the civilization they were now reentering they at first attributed it to the change in their own habits during the last three months and their having become barbarous and countrified in their seclusion certainly in the matter of dress they were behind the fashions as revealed in montgomery street but when the brief solace afforded them by the modiste and dressmaker was past there seemed little else to be gained they missed at first i fear the chivalrous and loyal devotion that had only amused them at devils ford and were the more inclined i think to distrust the conscious and more civilized gallantry of the better dressed and more carefully presented men they met for it must be admitted that for obvious reasons their criticisms were at first confined to the sex they had been most in contact with they could not help noticing that the men were more eager annoyingly feverish and selfasserting in their superior elegance and external show than their old associates were in their frank unrestrained habits it seemed to them that the five millionaires of devils ford in their radical simplicity and thoroughness were perhaps nearer the type of true gentlemanhood than these citizens who imitated a civilization they were unable yet to reach  the women simply frightened them as being even more than the men demonstrative and excessive in their fine looks their fine dresses their extravagant demand for excitement in less than a week they found themselves regrettingnot the new villa on the slope of devils ford which even in its own bizarre fashion was exceeded by the barbarous ostentation of the villas and private houses around thembut the double cabin under the trees which now seemed to them almost aristocratic in its grave simplicity and abstention in the mysterious forests of masts that thronged the citys quays they recalled the straight shafts of the pines on devils slopes only to miss the sedate repose and infinite calm that used to environ them in the feverish pulsating life of the young metropolis they often stopped oppressed giddy and choking the roar of the streets and thoroughfares was meaningless to them except to revive strange memories of the deep unvarying monotone of the evening wind over their humbler roof on the sierran hillside civic bred and nurtured as they were the recurrence of these sensations perplexed and alarmed them  it seems so perfectly ridiculous said jessie for us to feel as out of place here as that pike county servant girl in sacramento who had never seen a steamboat before do you know i quite had a turn the other day at seeing a man on the stockton wharf in a red shirt with a rifle on his shoulder  and you wanted to go and speak to him said christie with a sad smile  no thats just it i felt awfully hurt and injured that he did not come up and speak to me i wonder if we got any fever or that sort of thing up there it makes one quite superstitious  christie did not reply more than once before she had felt that inexplicable misgiving it had sometimes seemed to her that she had never been quite herself since that memorable night when she had slipped out of their sleepingcabin and stood alone in the gracious and commanding presence of the woods and hills in the solitude of night with the hum of the great city rising below herat times even in theatres or crowded assemblies of men and womenshe forgot herself and again stood in the weird brilliancy of that moonlight night in mute worship at the foot of that slowlyrising mystic altar of piled terraces hanging forests and lifted plateaus that climbed forever to the lonely skies again she felt before her the expanding and opening arms of the protecting woods had they really closed upon her in some pantheistic embrace that made her a part of them had she been baptized in that moonlight as a child of the great forest it was easy to believe in the myths of the poets of an idyllic life under those trees where free from conventional restrictions one loved and was loved if she with her own worldly experience could think of this now why might not george kearney have thought    she stopped and found herself blushing even in the darkness as the thought and blush were the usual sequel of her reflections it is to be feared that they may have been at times the impelling cause  mr carr however made up for his daughters want of sympathy with metropolitan life to their astonishment he not only plunged into the fashionable gayeties and amusements of the town but in dress and manner assumed the role of a leader of society the invariable answer to their halfhumorous comment was the necessities of the mine and the policy of frequenting the company of capitalists to enlist their support and confidence there was something in this so unlike their father that what at any other time they would have hailed as a relief to his habitual abstraction now half alarmed them yet he was not dissipatedhe did not drink nor gamble there certainly did not seem any harm in his frequenting the society of ladies with a gallantry that appeared to be forced and a pleasure that to their critical eyes was certainly apocryphal he did not drag his daughters into the mixed society of that period he did not press upon them the company of those he most frequented and whose accepted position in that little world of fashion was considered equal to their own when jessie strongly objected to the pronounced manners of a certain widow whose actual present wealth and pecuniary influence condoned for a more uncertain prehistoric past mr carr did not urge a further acquaintance as long as youre not thinking of marrying again papa jessie had said finally i dont see the necessity of our knowing her but suppose i were had replied mr carr with affected humor then you certainly wouldnt care for any one like her his daughter had responded triumphantly mr carr smiled and dropped the subject but it is probable that his daughters want of sympathy with his acquaintances did not in the least interfere with his social prestige a gentleman in all his relations and under all circumstances even his cold scientific abstraction was provocative rich men envied his lofty ignorance of the smaller details of moneymaking even while they mistrusted his judgment a man still well preserved and free from weakening vices he was a dangerous rival to younger and faster san francisco in the eyes of the sex who knew how to value a repose they did not themselves possess  suddenly mr carr announced his intention of proceeding to sacramento on further business of the mine leaving his two daughters in the family of a wealthy friend until he should return for them he opposed their ready suggestion to return to devils ford with a new and unnecessary inflexibility he even met their compromise to accompany him to sacramento with equal decision  you will be only in my way he said curtly enjoy yourselves here while you can  thus left to themselves they tried to accept his advice possibly some slight reaction to their previous disappointment may have already set in perhaps they felt any distraction to be a relief to their anxiety about their father they went out more they frequented concerts and parties they accepted with their host and his family an invitation to one of those opulent and barbaric entertainments with which a noted san francisco millionaire distracted his rare moments of reflection in his gorgeous palace on the hills here they could at least be once more in the country they loved albeit of a milder and less heroic type and a little degraded by the overlapping tinsel and scattered spangles of the palace  it was a three days fete the style and choice of amusements left to the guests and an equal and active participation by no means necessary or indispensable consequently when christie and jessie carr proposed a ride through the adjacent canyon on the second morning they had no difficulty in finding horses in the wellfurnished stables of their opulent entertainers nor cavaliers among the other guests who were too happy to find favor in the eyes of the two pretty girls who were supposed to be abnormally fastidious and refined christies escort was a goodnatured young banker shrewd enough to avoid demonstrative attentions and lucky enough to interest her during the ride with his clear and halfhumorous reflections on some of the business speculations of the day if his ideas were occasionally too clever and not always consistent with a high sense of honor she was none the less interested to know the ethics of that world of speculation into which her father had plunged and the more convinced with mingled sense of pride and anxiety that his still dominant gentlemanhood would prevent his coping with it on equal terms nor could she help contrasting the conversation of the sharpwitted man at her side with what she still remembered of the vague touching boyish enthusiasm of the millionaires of devils ford had her escort guessed the result of this contrast he would hardly have been as gratified as he was with the grave attention of her beautiful eyes  the fascination of a gracious day and the leafy solitude of the canyon led them to prolong their ride beyond the proposed limit and it became necessary towards sunset for them to seek some shorter cut home  theres a vaquero in yonder field said christies escort who was riding with her a little in advance of the others and those fellows know every trail that a horse can follow ill ride on intercept him and try my spanish on him if i miss him as hes galloping on you might try your hand on him yourself hell understand your eyes miss carr in any language  as he dashed away to cover his first audacity of compliment christie lifted the eyes thus apostrophized to the opposite field the vaquero who was chasing some cattle was evidently too preoccupied to heed the shouts of her companion and wheeling round suddenly to intercept one of the deviating fugitives permitted christies escort to dash past him before that gentleman could rein in his excited steed this brought the vaquero directly in her path perceiving her he threw his horse back on its haunches to prevent a collision christie rode up to him suddenly uttered a cry and halted for before her sunburnt in cheek and throat darker in the free growth of moustache and curling hair clad in the coarse picturesque finery of his class undisguised only in his boyish beauty sat george kearney  the blood that had forsaken her astonished face rushed as quickly back his eyes which had suddenly sparkled with an electrical glow sank before hers his hand dropped and his cheek flushed with a dark embarrassment  you here mr kearney how strangebut how glad i am to meet you again  she tried to smile her voice trembled and her little hand shook as she extended it to him  he raised his dark eyes quickly and impulsively urged his horse to her side but as if suddenly awakening to the reality of the situation he glanced at her hurriedly down at his barbaric finery and threw a searching look towards her escort  in an instant christie saw the infelicity of her position and its dangers the words of whiskey dick he wouldnt stand that flashed across her mind there was no time to lose the banker had already gained control over his horse and was approaching them all unconscious of the fixed stare with which george was regarding him christie hastily seized the hand which he had allowed to fall at his side and said quickly  will you ride with me a little way mr kearney  he turned the same searching look upon her she met it clearly and steadily he even thought reproachfully  do she said hurriedly i ask it as a favor i want to speak to you jessie and i are here alone father is away you are one of our oldest friends  he hesitated she turned to the astonished young banker who rode up  i have just met an old friend will you please ride back as quickly as you can and tell jessie that mr kearney is here and ask her to join us  she watched her dazed escort still speechless from the spectacle of the fastidious miss carr teteatete with a common mexican vaquero gallop off in the direction of the canyon and then turned to george  now take me home the shortest way as quick as you can  home echoed george  i mean to mr princes house quick before they can come up to us  he mechanically put spurs to his horse she followed they presently struck into a trail that soon diverged again into a disused logging track through the woods  this is the short cut to princes by two miles he said as they entered the woods  as they were still galloping without exchanging a word christie began to slacken her speed george did the same they were safe from intrusion at the present even if the others had found the short cut christie bold and selfreliant a moment ago suddenly found herself growing weak and embarrassed what had she done  she checked her horse suddenly  perhaps we had better wait for them she said timidly  george had not raised his eyes to hers  you said you wanted to hurry home he replied gently passing his hand along his mustangs velvety neck andand you had something to say to me  certainly she answered with a faint laugh im so astonished at meeting you here im quite bewildered you are living here you have forsaken us to buy a ranche she continued looking at him attentively  his brow colored slightly  no im living here but i have bought no ranche im only a hired man on somebody elses ranche to look after the cattle  he saw her beautiful eyes fill with astonishment andsomething else his brow cleared he went on with his old boyish laugh  no miss carr the fact is im dead broke ive lost everything since i saw you last but as i know how to ride and im not afraid of work i manage to keep along  you have lost money inin the mines said christie suddenly  nohe replied quickly evading her eyes my brother has my interest you know ive been foolish on my own account solely you know im rather inclined to that sort of thing but as long as my folly dont affect others i can stand it  but it may affect othersand they may not think of it as folly she stopped short confused by his brightening color and eyes i meanoh mr kearney i want you to be frank with me i know nothing of business but i know there has been trouble about the mine at devils ford tell me honestly has my father anything to do with it if i thought that through any imprudence of his you had sufferedif i believed that you could trace any misfortune of yours to himto usi should never forgive myselfshe stopped and flashed a single look at himi should never forgive you for abandoning us  the look of pain which had at first shown itself in his face which never concealed anything passed and a quick smile followed her feminine anticlimax  miss carr he said with boyish eagerness if any man suggested to me that your father wasnt the brightest and best of his kindtoo wise and clever for the fools about him to understandidid shoot him  confused by his ready and gracious disclaimer of what she had not intended to say there was nothing left for her but to rush upon what she really intended to say with what she felt was shameful precipitation  one word more mr kearney she began looking down but feeling the color come to her face as she spoke when you spoke to me the day you left you must have thought me hard and cruel when i tell you that i thought you were alluding to jessie and some feeling you had for her  for jessie echoed george  you will understand thatthat  that what said george drawing nearer to her  that i was only speaking as she might have spoken had you talked to her of me added christie hurriedly slightly backing her horse away from him  but this was not so easy as george was the better rider and by an imperceptible movement of his wrist and foot had glued his horse to her side he will go now she had thought but he didnt  we must ride on she suggested faintly  no he said with a sudden dropping of his boyish manner and a slight lifting of his head we must ride together no further miss carr i must go back to the work i am hired to do and you must go on with your party whom i hear coming but when we part here you must bid me goodbynot as jessies sisterbut as christiethe onethe only woman that i love or that i ever have loved  he held out his hand with the recollection of their previous parting she tremblingly advanced her own he took it but did not raise it to his lips and it was she who found herself half confusedly retaining his hand in hers until she dropped it with a blush  then is this the reason you give for deserting us as you have deserted devils ford she said coldly  he lifted his eyes to her with a strange smile and said yes wheeled his horse and disappeared in the forest  he had left her thus abruptly once before kissed blushing and indignant he was leaving her now unkissed but white and indignant yet she was so selfpossessed when the party joined her that the singular rencontre and her explanation of the strangers sudden departure excited no further comment only jessie managed to whisper in her ear  i hope you are satisfied now that it wasnt me he meant  not at all said christie coldly     chapter vii   a few days after the girls had returned to san francisco they received a letter from their father his business he wrote would detain him in sacramento some days longer there was no reason why they should return to devils ford in the heat of the summer their host had written to beg him to allow them a more extended visit and if they were enjoying themselves he thought it would be well not to disoblige an old friend he had heard they had a pleasant visit to mr princes place and that a certain young banker had been very attentive to christie  do you know what all this means dear asked jessie who had been watching her sister with an unusually grave face  christie whose thoughts had wandered from the letter replied carelessly  i suppose it means that we are to wait here until father sends for us  it means a good deal more it means that papa has had another reverse it means that the assay has turned out badly for the minethat the further they go from the flat the worse it getsthat all the gold they will probably ever see at devils ford is what they have already found or will find on the flat it means that all devils ford is only a pocket and not a lead she stopped with unexpected tears in her eyes  who told you this asked christie breathlessly  fairfaxmr munroe stammered her sister writes to me as if we already knew ittells me not to be alarmed that it isnt so badand all that  how long has this happened jessie said christie taking her hand with a white but calm face  nearly ever since weve been here i suppose it must be so for he says poor papa is still hopeful of doing something yet  and mr munroe writes to you said christie abstractedly  of course said jessie quickly he feels interested inus  nobody tells me anything said christie  didnt  no said christie bitterly  what on earth did you talk about but people dont confide in you because theyre afraid of you youre so  so what  so gently patronizing and so idontsupposeyoucanhelpit poorthing in your general style said jessie kissing her there i only wish i was like you what do you say if we write to father that well go back to devils ford mr munroe thinks we will be of service there just now if the men are dissatisfied and think were spending money  im afraid mr munroe is hardly a disinterested adviser at least i dont think it would look quite decent for you to fly back without your father at his suggestion said christie coldly he is not the only partner we are spending no money besides we have engaged to go to mr princes again next week  as you like dear said jessie turning away to hide a faint smile  nevertheless when they returned from their visit to mr princes and one or two uneventful rides christie looked grave it was only a few days later that jessie burst upon her one morning  you were saying that nobody ever tells you anything well heres your chance whiskey dick is below  whiskey dick repeated christie what does he want  you love who else you know he always scorns me as not being hightoned and elegant enough for his social confidences he asked for you only  with an uneasy sense of some impending revelation christie descended to the drawingroom as she opened the door a strong flavor of that toilet soap and eau de cologne with which whiskey dick was in the habit of gracefully effacing the traces of dissipation made known his presence in spite of a new suit of clothes whose pristine folds refused to adapt themselves entirely to the contour of his figure he was somewhat subdued by the unexpected elegance of the drawingroom of christies host but a glance at christies sad but gracious face quickly reassured him taking from his hat a threecornered parcel he unfolded a handsome saffrona rose which he gravely presented to her having thus reestablished his position he sank elegantly into a teteatete ottoman finding the position inconvenient to face christie who had seated herself on a chair he transferred himself to the other side of the ottoman and addressed her over its back as from a pulpit  is this really a fortunate accident mr hall or did you try to find us said christie pleasantly  partly promiskuss and partly coincident miss christie one up and tother down said dick lightly work being slack at present at devils ford i reckned id take a pasear down to frisco and dip into the vortex o fashnable society and out again he lightly waved a new handkerchief to illustrate his swallowlike intrusion this yer minglin with the botong is apt to be wearisome ez you and me knows unless combined with experience and judgment so when them boys up there allows that theres a little too much fashnable society and san francisco capital and highfalutin about the future goin on fer square surface mining i sez look yere gentlemen sez i you dont see the pint the pint is to get the poplar eye fixed so to speak on devils ford when a fashnable star rises above the frisco horizonlike miss carrand so to speak dazzles the gineral eye people want to know who she is and when people say thats the accomplished daughter o the accomplished superintendent of the devils ford claimotherwise known as the stareyed goddess o devils fordevery eye is fixed on the mine and capital so to speak tumbles to her and when they sez that the old manexcuse my freedom but thats the way the boys talk of your father meaning no harmthe old man instead o trying to corral rich widdersgrass or otherwiseto spend their money on the big works for the gold that aint there yetshould stay in devils ford and put all his sabe and genius into grindin out the little gold that is there i sez to them that it aint your fathers style his style sez i ez to go in and build them works when theyre done he turns round to capital and sez helook yer sez he thars all the works you want first qualitycost a million thars all the water you want onlimitedcost another million thars all the pay gravel you want in and outer the groundcall it two millions more now my times too vallyble my professhuns too hightoned to work mines i make em hand me over a check for ten millions and call it square and work it for yourself so capital hands over the money and waltzes down to run the mine and you original locators walks round with yer hands in yer pockets atop of your six million profit and you lets capital take the work and the responsibility  preposterous as this seemed from the lips of whiskey dick christie had a haunting suspicion that it was not greatly unlike the theories expounded by the clever young banker who had been her escort she did not interrupt his flow of reminiscent criticism when he paused for breath she said quietly  i met mr george kearney the other day in the country  whiskey dick stopped awkwardly glanced hurriedly at christie and coughed behind his handkerchief  mr kearneyehercertenglyyesermet him you say was heererwell  in health yes but otherwise he has lost everything said christie fixing her eyes on the embarrassed dick  yeserin coursein course continued dick nervously glancing round the apartment as if endeavoring to find an opening to some less abrupt statement of the fact  and actually reduced to take some menial employment added christie still regarding dick with her clear glance  thats itthats just it said dick beaming as he suddenly found his delicate and confidential opportunity thats it miss christie thats just what i was sayin to the boys ez it the square thing sez i jest because george hez happened to hypothecate every dollar he has or expects to hev to put into them works only to please mr carr and just because he dont want to distress that intelligent gentleman by letting him see hes dead brokefor him to go and demean himself and devils ford by rushing away and hiring out as a mexican vaquero on mexican wages look sez i at the disgrace he brings upon a hightoned fashnable girl at whose side hes walked and danced and passed rings and sentiments and bokays in the changes o the cotillion and the mizzourka and wot sez i if some day prancing along in a fashnable cavalcade she all of a suddents comes across him drivin a mexican steer thats what i said to the boys and so you met him miss christie as usual continued dick endeavoring under the appearance of a large social experience to conceal an eager anxiety to know the detailsso you met him and in course you didnt let on yer knew him so to speak natrally or praps you kinder like asked him to fix your saddlegirth and give him a fivedollar pieceeh  christie who had risen and gone to the window suddenly turned a very pale face and shining eyes on dick  mr hall

christie impetuously ive set my heart on going tonightand unless you secure berths early  in coursein course interrupted dick nervously but  but what said christie impatiently  dick hesitated shut the door carefully and looking round the room lightly shook out his handkerchief apparently flicked away an embarrassing suggestion and said with a little laugh  its ridiklous perfectly ridiklous miss christie but not bein in the habit of carryin ready money and havin omitted to cash a draft on wells fargo  co  of course said christie rapidly how forgetful i am pray forgive me mr hall i didnt think

the world that had remained to him after his extravagant purchase of christies saffrona rose one moment in this yer monetary transaction if you like you are at liberty to use my name     chapter viii   as christie and jessie carr looked from the windows of the coach whose dustclogged wheels were slowly dragging them as if reluctant nearer the last stage of their journey to devils ford they were conscious of a change in the landscape which they could not entirely charge upon their changed feelings the few bared open spaces on the upland the long stretch of rocky ridge near the summit so vivid and so velvety during their first journey were now burnt and yellow even the brief openings in the forest were seared as if by a hot iron in the scorching rays of a half years sun the pastoral slopes of the valley below were cloaked in lustreleather the rare watercourses along the road had faded from the waiting eye and ear it seemed as if the long and dry summer had even invaded the closeset ranks of pines and had blown a simoom breath through the densest woods leaving its charred red ashes on every leaf and spray along the tunnelled shade as they leaned out of the window and inhaled the halfdead spices of the evergreens they seemed to have entered the atmosphere of some exhausted passionof some fierce excitement that was even now slowly burning itself out  it was a relief at last to see the straggling houses of devils ford far below come once more into view as they rounded the shoulder of devils spur and began the long descent but as they entered the town a change more ominous and startling than the desiccation of the landscape forced itself upon them the town was still there but where were the inhabitants four months ago they had left the straggling street thronged with busy citizensgroups at every corner and a chaos of merchandise and traders in the open plaza or square beside the presbyterian church now all was changed only a few wayfarers lifted their heads lazily as the coach rattled by crossing the deserted square littered with empty boxes and gliding past empty cabins or vacant shop windows from which not only familiar faces but even the window sashes themselves were gone the great unfinished serpentlike flume crossing the river on gigantic trestles had advanced as far as the town stooping over it like some enormous reptile that had sucked its life blood and was gorged with its prey  whiskey dick who had left the stage on the summit to avail himself of a shorter foot trail to the house that would give him half an hours grace to make preparations met them at the stage office with a buggy a glance at the young girls perhaps convinced him that the graces of elegant worldly conversation were out of place with the revelation he read on their faces perhaps he too was a trifle indisposed the short journey to the house was made in profound silence  the villa had been repainted and decorated and it looked fresher and even to their preoccupied minds appeared more attractive than ever thoughtful hands had taken care of the vines and rosebushes on the trellises waterthat precious element in devils fordhad not been spared in keeping green through the long drought the plants which the girls had so tenderly nurtured it was the one oasis in which the summer still lingered and yet a singular sense of loss came over the girls as they once more crossed its threshold it seemed no longer their own  ef i was you miss christie id keep close to the house for a day or two untiluntilthings is settled said dick theres a heap o tramps and sich cattle trapsin round praps you wouldnt feel so lonesome if you was nearer townfor instance bout wher you useter live  in the dear old cabin said christie quickly i remember it i wish we were there now  do you really do you said whiskey dick with suddenly twinkling eyes thats like you to say it thats what i allus said continued dick addressing space generally if theres any one ez knows how to come square down to the bottom rock without flinchin its your hightoned fashnable gals but i must meander back to town and let the boys know youre in possession safe and sound its right mean that fairfax and mattingly had to go down to lagrange on some low business yesterday but theyll be back tomorrow so long  left alone the girls began to realize their strange position they had conceived no settled plan the night they left san francisco they had written an earnest letter to their father telling him that on learning the truth about the reverses of devils ford they thought it their duty to return and share them with others without obliging him to prefer the request and with as little worry to him as possible he would find them ready to share his trials and in what must be the scene of their work hereafter  it will bring father back said christie he wont leave us here alone and then together we must come to some understanding with himwith themfor somehow i feel as if this house belonged to us no longer  her surmise was not far wrong when mr carr arrived hurriedly from sacramento the next evening he found the house deserted his daughters were gone there were indications that they had arrived and for some reason suddenly departed the vague fear that had haunted his guilty soul after receiving their letter and during his breathless journey now seemed to be realized he was turning from the empty house whose reproachful solitude frightened him when he was confronted on the threshold by the figure of fairfax munroe  i came to the stage office to meet you he said you must have left the stage at the summit  i did said carr angrily i was anxious to meet my daughters quickly to know the reason of their foolish alarm and to know also who had been frightening them where are they  they are safe in the old cabin beyond that has been put up ready to receive them again said fairfax quietly  but what is the meaning of this why are they not here demanded carr hiding his agitation in a burst of querulous rage  do you ask mr carr said fairfax sadly did you expect them to remain here until the sheriff took possession no one knows better than yourself that the money advanced you on the deeds of this homestead has never been repaid  carr staggered but recovered himself with feeble violence  since you know so much of my affairs how do you know that this claim will ever be pressed for payment how do you know it is not the advance of aafriend  because i have seen the woman who advanced it said fairfax hopelessly she was here to look at the property before your daughters came  well said carr nervously  well you force me to tell you something i should like to forget you force me to anticipate a disclosure i expected to make to you only when i came to ask permission to woo your daughter jessie and when i tell you what it is you will understand that i have no right to criticise your conduct i am only explaining my own  go on said carr impatiently  when i first came to this country there was a woman i loved passionately she treated me as women of her kind only treat men like me she ruined me and left me that was four years ago i love your daughter mr carr but she has never heard it from my lips i would not woo her until i had told you all i have tried to do it ere this and failed perhaps i should not now but  but what said carr furiously speak out  but this look said fairfax producing from his pocket the packet of letters jessie had found perhaps you know the handwriting  what do you mean gasped carr  that womanmy mistressis the woman who advanced you money and who claims this house   the interview and whatever came of it remained a secret with the two men when mr carr accepted the hospitality of the old cabin again it was understood that he had sacrificed the new house and its furniture to some of the more pressing debts of the mine and the act went far to restore his waning popularity but a more genuine feeling of relief was experienced by devils ford when it was rumored that fairfax munroe had asked for the hand of jessie carr and that some promise contingent upon the equitable adjustment of the affairs of the mine had been given by mr carr to the superstitious mind of devils ford and its few remaining locators this new partnership seemed to promise that unity of interest and stability of fortune that devils ford had lacked but nothing could be done until the rainy season had fairly set in until the longlookedfor element that was to magically separate the gold from the dross in those dull mounds of dust and gravel had come of its own free will and in its own appointed channels independent of the feeble auxiliaries that had hopelessly riven the rocks on the hillside or hung incomplete and unfinished in lofty scaffoldings above the settlement  the rainy season came early at first in gathered mists on the higher peaks that were lifted in the morning sun only to show a fresher field of dazzling white below in white clouds that at first seemed to be mere drifts blown across from those fresh snowfields and obscuring the clear blue above in faroff murmurs in the hollow hills and gulches in nearer tinkling melody and baby prattling in the leaves it came with bright flashes of sunlight by day with deep monotonous shadow at night with the onset of heavy winds the roar of turbulent woods the tumultuous tossing of leafy arms and with what seemed the silent dissolution of the whole landscape in days of steady and uninterrupted downfall it came extravagantly for every canyon had grown into a torrent every gulch a waterspout every watercourse a river and all pouring into the north fork that rushing past the settlement seemed to threaten it with lifted crest and flying mane it came dangerously for one night the river leaping the feeble barrier of devils ford swept away houses and banks scattered with unconscious irony the laboriously collected heaps of gravel left for hydraulic machinery and spread out a vast and silent lake across the submerged flat  in the hurry and confusion of that night the girls had thrown open their cabin to the escaping miners who hurried along the slope that was now the bank of the river suddenly christie felt her arm grasped and she was halfled halfdragged into the inner room her father stood before her  where is george kearney he asked tremulously  george kearney echoed christie for a moment believing the excitement had turned her fathers brain you know he is not here he is in san francisco  he is herei tell you said carr impatiently he has been here ever since the high water trying to save the flume and reservoir  georgehere christie could only gasp  yes he passed here a few moments ago to see if you were all safe and he has gone on towards the flume but what he is trying to do is madness if you see him implore him to do no more let him abandon the accursed flume to its fate it has worked already too much woe upon us all why should it carry his brave and youthful soul down with it  the words were still ringing in her ears when he suddenly passed away with the hurrying crowd scarcely knowing what she did she ran out vaguely intent only on one thought seeking only the one face lately so dear in recollection that she felt she would die if she never saw it again perplexed by confused voices in the woods she lost track of the crowd until the voices suddenly were raised in one loud outcry followed by the crashing of timber the splashing of water a silence and then a dull continuous roar she ran vaguely on in the direction of the reservoir with her fathers injunction still in her mind until a terrible idea displaced it and she turned at right angles suddenly and ran towards the slope leading down to the submerged flat she had barely left the shelter of the trees behind her before the roar of water seemed to rise at her very feet she stopped dazed bewildered and horrorstricken on the edge of the slope it was the slope no longer but the bank of the river itself  even in the gray light of early morning and with inexperienced eyes she saw all too clearly now the trestlework had given way the curving mile of flume fallen into the stream and crushed and dammed against the opposite shore had absolutely turned the whole river through the halffinished ditch and partly excavated mine in its way a few rods further on to join the old familiar channel the bank of the river was changed the flat had become an island between which and the slope where she stood the north fork was rolling its resistless yellow torrent as she gazed spellbound a portion of the slope beneath her suddenly seemed to sink and crumble and was swallowed up in the rushing stream she heard a cry of warning behind her but rooted to the spot by a fearful fascination she heeded it not  again there was a sudden disruption and another part of the slope sank to rise no more but this time she felt herself seized by the waist and dragged back it was her father standing by her side  he was flushed and excited gazing at the water with a strange exultation  do you see it do you know what has happened he asked quickly  the flume has fallen and turned the river said christie hurriedly buthave you seen himis he safe  hewho he answered vacantly  george kearney  he is safe he said impatiently but do you see christie do you know what this means  he pointed with his tremulous hand to the stream before them  it means we are ruined said christie coldly  nothing of the kind it means that the river is doing the work of the flume it is sluicing off the gravel deepening the ditch and altering the slope which was the old bend of the river it will do in ten minutes the work that would take us a year if we can stop it in time or control it we are safe but if we can not it will carry away the bed and deposit with the rest and we are ruined again  with a gesture of impotent fury he dashed away in the direction of an equally excited crowd that on a point of the slope nearer the island were gesticulating and shouting to a second group of men who on the opposite shore were clambering on over the choked debris of the flume that had dammed and diverted the current it was evident that the same idea had occurred to them and they were risking their lives in the attempt to set free the impediments shocked and indignant as christie had been at the degrading absorption of material interests at such a moment the element of danger lifted the labors of these men into heroism and she began to feel a strange exultation as she watched them under the skilful blows of their axes in a few moments the vast body of drift began to disintegrate and then to swing round and move towards the old channel a cheer went up but as suddenly died away again an overlapping fringe of wreckage had caught on the point of the island and arrested the whole mass  the men who had gained the shore with difficulty looked back with a cry of despair but the next moment from among them leaped a figure alert buoyant invincible and axe in hand once more essayed the passage springing from timber to timber he at last reached the point of obstruction a few strokes of the axe were sufficient to clear it but at the first stroke it was apparent that the striker was also losing his hold upon the shore and that he must inevitably be carried away with the tossing debris but this consideration did not seem to affect him the last blow was struck and as the freed timbers rolled on over and over he boldly plunged into the flood christie gave a little cryher heart had bounded with him it seemed as if his plunge had splashed the water in her eyes he did not come to the surface until he had passed the point below where her father stood and then struggling feebly as if stunned or disabled by a blow it seemed to her that he was trying to approach the side of the river where she was would he do it could she help him she was alone he was hidden from the view of the men on the point and no succor could come from them there was a fringe of alder nearly opposite their cabin that almost overhung the stream she ran to it clutched it with a frantic hand and leaning over the boiling water uttered for the first time his name  george  as if called to the surface by the magic of her voice he rose a few yards from her in midcurrent and turned his fading eyes towards the bank in another moment he would have been swept beyond her reach but with a supreme effort he turned on one side the current striking him sideways threw him towards the bank and she caught him by his sleeve for an instant it seemed as if she would be dragged down with him for one dangerous moment she did not care and almost yielded to the spell but as the rush of water pressed him against the bank she recovered herself and managed to lift him beyond its reach and then she sat down halffainting with his white face and damp curls upon her breast  george darling speak to me only one word tell me have i saved you  his eyes opened a faint twinkle of the old days came to thema boyish smile played upon his lips  for yourselfor jessie  she looked around her with a little frightened air they were alone there was but one way of sealing those mischievous lips and she found it   thats what i allus said gentlemen lazily remarked whiskey dick a few weeks later leaning back against the bar with his glass in his hand george sez i it aint what you say to a fashnable hightoned young lady its what you does ez makes or breaks you and thats what i sez ginrally o things in the ford it aint what carr and you boys allows to do its the ginral average o things ez is done that gives tone to the hull and hez brought this yer new luck to you all
