on the gate  slape said mulvaney is a shuparfluous necessity this gyardll shtay lively till relieved he himself was stripped to the waist learoyd on the next bedstead was dripping from the skinful of water which ortheris clad only in white trousers had just sluiced over his shoulders and a fourth private was muttering uneasily as he dozed openmouthed in the glare of the great guardlantern the heat under the bricked archway was terrifying  the worrst night that iver i remimber eyah is all hell loose this tide said mulvaney a puff of burning wind lashed through the wicketgate like a wave of the sea and ortheris swore  are ye more heasy jock he said to learoyd put yer ead between your legs itll go orf in a minute  ah dont care ah would not care but ma heart is plaayin tivvytivvy on ma ribs

gawd you if it was you wot would we do  kape quiet little man said mulvaney putting him aside but very gently tis not me nor will ut be me whoile dinah shadds here i was but showin something  learoyd bowed on his bedstead groaned and the gentlemanranker sighed in his sleep ortheris took mulvaneys tendered pouch and we three smoked gravely for a space while the dustdevils danced on the glacis and scoured the redhot plain  pop said ortheris wiping his forehead  dont tantalise wid talkin av dhrink or ill shtuff you into your own breechblock anfire you off grunted mulvaney  ortheris chuckled and from a niche in the veranda produced six bottles of gingerade  where did ye get ut ye machiavel said mulvaney tis no bazar pop  ow do hi know wot the orfcers drink answered ortheris arst the messman

despair had once fallen upon ortheris that weary weary afternoon in the banks of the khemi river and how it had been exorcised by the skilful magician mulvaney  talk terence i said or we shall have learoyd slinging loose and hell be worse than ortheris was talk hell answer to your voice  almost before ortheris had deftly thrown all the rifles of the guard on mulvaneys bedstead the irishmans

amara broke the pitiless day  footnotes  1      now first of the foemen of boh da thone     was captain oneil of the black tyrone             the ballad of boh da thone   illustration     the drums of the fore and aft   in the army list they still stand as the fore and fit princess hohenzollernsigmaringenauspachs merthyrtydfilshire own royal loyal light infantry regimental district 329a but the army through all its barracks and canteens knows them now as the fore and aft they may in time do something that shall make their new title honourable but at present they are bitterly ashamed and the man who calls them fore and aft does so at the risk of the head which is on his shoulders  two words breathed into the stables of a certain cavalry regiment will bring the men out into the streets with belts and mops and bad language but a whisper of fore and aft will bring out this regiment with rifles  their one excuse is that they came again and did their best to finish the job in style but for a time all their world knows that they were openly beaten whipped dumbcowed shaking and afraid the men know it their officers know it the horse guards know it and when the next war comes the enemy will know it also there are two or three regiments of the line that have a black mark against their names which they will then wipe out and it will be excessively inconvenient for the troops upon whom they do their wiping  the courage of the british soldier is officially supposed to be above proof and as a general rule it is so the exceptions are decently shovelled out of sight only to be referred to in the freshest of unguarded talk that occasionally swamps a messtable at midnight then one hears strange and horrible stories of men not following their officers of orders being given by those who had no right to give them and of disgrace that but for the standing luck of the british army might have ended in brilliant disaster these are unpleasant stories to listen to and the messes tell them under their breath sitting by the big wood fires and the young officer bows his head and thinks to himself please god his men shall never behave unhandily  the british soldier is not altogether to be blamed for occasional lapses but this verdict he should not know a moderately intelligent general will waste six months in mastering the craft of the particular war that he may be waging a colonel may utterly misunderstand the capacity of his regiment for three months after it has taken the field and even a company commander may err and be deceived as to the temper and temperament of his own handful wherefore the soldier and the soldier of today more particularly should not be blamed for falling back he should be shot or hanged afterwardsto encourage the others but he should not be vilified in newspapers for that is want of tact and waste of space  he has let us say been in the service of the empress for perhaps four years he will leave in another two years he has no inherited morals and four years are not sufficient to drive toughness into his fibre or to teach him how holy a thing is his regiment he wants to drink he wants to enjoy himselfin india he wants to save moneyand he does not in the least like getting hurt he has received just sufficient education to make him understand half the purport of the orders he receives and to speculate on the nature of clean incised and shattering wounds thus if he is told to deploy under fire preparatory to an attack he knows that he runs a very great risk of being killed while he is deploying and suspects that he is being thrown away to gain ten minutes time he may either deploy with desperate swiftness or he may shuffle or bunch or break according to the discipline under which he has lain for four years  armed with imperfect knowledge cursed with the rudiments of an imagination hampered by the intense selfishness of the lower classes and unsupported by any regimental associations this young man is suddenly introduced to an enemy who in eastern lands is always ugly generally tall and hairy and frequently noisy if he looks to the right and the left and sees old soldiersmen of twelve years service who he knows know what they are abouttaking a charge rush or demonstration without embarrassment he is consoled and applies his shoulder to the butt of his rifle with a stout heart his peace is the greater if he hears a senior who has taught him his soldiering and broken his head on occasion whispering theyll shout and carry on like this for five minutes then theyll rush in and then weve got em by the short hairs  but on the other hand if he sees only men of his own term of service turning white and playing with their triggers and saying what the hells up now while the company commanders are sweating into their swordhilts and shouting frontrank fix bayonets steady theresteady sight for three hundredno for five lie down all steady frontrank kneel and so forth he becomes unhappy and grows acutely miserable when he hears a comrade turn over with the rattle of fireirons falling into the fender and the grunt of a poleaxed ox if he can be moved about a little and allowed to watch the effect of his own fire on the enemy he feels merrier and may be then worked up to the blind passion of fighting which is contrary to general belief controlled by a chilly devil and shakes men like ague if he is not moved about and begins to feel cold at the pit of the stomach and in that crisis is badly mauled and hears orders that were never given he will break and he will break badly and of all things under the light of the sun there is nothing more terrible than a broken british regiment when the worst comes to the worst and the panic is really epidemic the men must be een let go and the company commanders had better escape to the enemy and stay there for safetys sake if they can be made to come again they are not pleasant men to meet because they will not break twice  about thirty years from this date when we have succeeded in halfeducating everything that wears trousers our army will be a beautifully unreliable machine it will know too much and it will do too little later still when all men are at the mental level of the officer of today it will sweep the earth speaking roughly you must employ either blackguards or gentlemen or best of all blackguards commanded by gentlemen to do butchers work with efficiency and despatch the ideal soldier should of course think for himselfthe pocketbook says so unfortunately to attain this virtue he has to pass through the phase of thinking of himself and that is misdirected genius a blackguard may be slow to think for himself but he is genuinely anxious to kill and a little punishment teaches him how to guard his own skin and perforate anothers a powerfully prayerful highland regiment officered by rank presbyterians is perhaps one degree more terrible in action than a hardbitten thousand of irresponsible irish ruffians led by most improper young unbelievers but these things prove the rulewhich is that the midway men are not to be trusted alone they have ideas about the value of life and an upbringing that has not taught them to go on and take the chances they are carefully unprovided with a backing of comrades who have been shot over and until that backing is reintroduced as a great many regimental commanders intend it shall be they are more liable to disgrace themselves than the size of the empire or the dignity of the army allows their officers are as good as good can be because their training begins early and god has arranged that a cleanrun youth of the british middle classes shall in the matter of backbone brains and bowels surpass all other youths for this reason a child of eighteen will stand up doing nothing with a tin sword in his hand and joy in his heart until he is dropped if he dies he dies like a gentleman if he lives he writes home that he has been potted sniped chipped or cut over and sits down to besiege government for a woundgratuity until the next little war breaks out when he perjures himself before a medical board blarneys his colonel burns incense round his adjutant and is allowed to go to the front once more  which homily brings me directly to a brace of the most finished little fiends that ever banged drum or tootled fife in the band of a british regiment they ended their sinful career by open and flagrant mutiny and were shot for it their names were jakin and lewpiggy lewand they were bold bad drummerboys both of them frequently birched by the drummajor of the fore and aft  jakin was a stunted child of fourteen and lew was about the same age when not looked after they smoked and drank they swore habitually after the manner of the barrackroom which is coldswearing and comes from between clinched teeth and they fought religiously once a week jakin had sprung from some london gutter and may or may not have passed through dr barnardos hands ere he arrived at the dignity of drummerboy lew could remember nothing except the regiment and the delight of listening to the band from his earliest years he hid somewhere in his grimy little soul a genuine love for music and was most mistakenly furnished with the head of a cherub insomuch that beautiful ladies who watched the regiment in church were wont to speak of him as a darling they never heard his vitriolic comments on their manners and morals as he walked back to barracks with the band and matured fresh causes of offence against jakin  the other drummerboys hated both lads on account of their illogical conduct jakin might be pounding lew or lew might be rubbing jakins head in the dirt but any attempt at aggression on the part of an outsider was met by the combined forces of lew and jakin and the consequences were painful the boys were the ishmaels of the corps but wealthy ishmaels for they sold battles in alternate weeks for the sport of the barracks when they were not pitted against other boys and thus amassed money  on this particular day there was dissension in the camp they had just been convicted afresh of smoking which is bad for little boys who use plugtobacco and lews contention was that jakin had stunk so orrid bad from keepin the pipe in pocket that he and he alone was responsible for the birching they were both tingling under  i tell you i id the pipe back o barracks said jakin pacifically  youre a bloomin liar said lew without heat  youre a bloomin little barstard said jakin strong in the knowledge that his own ancestry was unknown  now there is one word in the extended vocabulary of barrackroom abuse that cannot pass without comment you may call a man a thief and risk nothing you may even call him a coward without finding more than a boot whiz past your ear but you must not call a man a bastard unless you are prepared to prove it on his front teeth  you might ha kep that till i wasnt so sore said lew sorrowfully dodging round jakins guard  ill make you sorer said jakin genially and got home on lews alabaster forehead all would have gone well and this story as the books say would never have been written had not his evil fate prompted the bazarsergeants son a long employless man of fiveandtwenty to put in an appearance after the first round he was eternally in need of money and knew that the boys had silver  fighting again said he ill report you to my father and hell report you to the coloursergeant  whats that to you said jakin with an unpleasant dilation of the nostrils  oh nothing to me youll get into trouble and youve been up too often to afford that  what the hell do you know about what weve done asked lew the seraph you arent in the army you lousy cadging civilian  he closed in on the mans left flank  jes cause you find two gentlemen settlin their diffrences with their fistes you stick in your ugly nose where you arent wanted run ome to your arfcaste slut of a maor well give you whatfor said jakin  the man attempted reprisals by knocking the boys heads together the scheme would have succeeded had not jakin punched him vehemently in the stomach or had lew refrained from kicking his shins they fought together bleeding and breathless for half an hour and after heavy punishment triumphantly pulled down their opponent as terriers pull down a jackal  now gasped jakin ill give you whatfor he proceeded to pound the mans features while lew stamped on the outlying portions of his anatomy chivalry is not a strong point in the composition of the average drummerboy he fights as do his betters to make his mark  ghastly was the ruin that escaped and awful was the wrath of the bazarsergeant awful too was the scene in orderlyroom when the two reprobates appeared to answer the charge of halfmurdering a civilian the bazarsergeant thirsted for a criminal action and his son lied the boys stood to attention while the black clouds of evidence accumulated      illustration hey what are you going to argue with me     said the colonelp 35  you little devils are more trouble than the rest of the regiment put together said the colonel angrily one might as well admonish thistledown and i cant well put you in cells or under stoppages you must be birched again  beg y pardon sir cant we say nothin in our own defence sir shrilled jakin  hey what are you going to argue with me said the colonel  no sir said lew but if a man come to you sir and said he was going to report you sir for aving a bit of a turnup with a friend sir an wanted to get money out o you sir  the orderlyroom exploded in a roar of laughter well said the colonel  that was what that measly jarnwar there did sir and ed a done it sir if we adnt prevented im we didnt it im much sir e adnt no manner o right to interfere with us sir i dont mind bein birched by the drummajor sir nor yet reported by any corpral but imbut i dont think its fair sir for a civilian to come an talk over a man in the army  a second shout of laughter shook the orderlyroom but the colonel was grave  what sort of characters have these boys he asked of the regimental sergeantmajor  accordin to the bandmaster sir returned that revered officialthe only soul in the regiment whom the boys fearedthey do everything but lie sir  is it like wed go for that man for fun sir said lew pointing to the plaintiff  oh admonishedadmonished said the colonel testily and when the boys had gone he read the bazarsergeants son a lecture on the sin of unprofitable meddling and gave orders that the bandmaster should keep the drums in better discipline  if either of you comes to practice again with so much as a scratch on your two ugly little faces thundered the bandmaster ill tell the drummajor to take the skin off your backs understand that you young devils  then he repented of his speech for just the length of time that lew looking like a seraph in red worsted embellishments took the place of one of the trumpetsin hospitaland rendered the echo of a battlepiece lew certainly was a musician and had often in his more exalted moments expressed a yearning to master every instrument of the band  theres nothing to prevent your becoming a bandmaster lew said the bandmaster who had composed waltzes of his own and worked day and night in the interests of the band  what did he say demanded jakin after practice  said i might be a bloomin bandmaster an be asked in to ave a glass o sherrywine on messnights  ho said you might be a bloomin noncombatant did e thats just about wot e would say when ive put in my boys serviceits a bloomin shame that doesnt count for pensionill take on as a privit then ill be a lance in a yearknowin what i know about the ins an outs o things in three years ill be a bloomin sergeant i wont marry then not i ill old on and learn the orfcers ways an apply for exchange into a regment that doesnt know all about me then ill be a bloomin orfcer then ill ask you to ave a glass o sherrywine mister lew an youll bloomin well ave to stay in the hantyroom while the messsergeant brings it to your dirty ands  spose im going to be a bandmaster not i quite ill be a orfcer too theres nothin like takin to a thing an stickin to it the schoolmaster says the regment dont go ome for another seven years ill be a lance then or near to  thus the boys discussed their futures and conducted themselves piously for a week that is to say lew started a flirtation with the coloursergeants daughter aged thirteennot as he explained to jakin with any intention o matrimony but by way o keepin my and in and the blackhaired cris delighan enjoyed that flirtation more than previous ones and the other drummerboys raged furiously together and jakin preached sermons on the dangers of bein tangled along o petticoats  but neither love nor virtue would have held lew long in the paths of propriety had not the rumour gone abroad that the regiment was to be sent on active service to take part in a war which for the sake of brevity we will call the war of the lost tribes  the barracks had the rumour almost before the messroom and of all the nine hundred men in barracks not ten had seen a shot fired in anger the colonel had twenty years ago assisted at a frontier expedition one of the majors had seen service at the cape a confirmed deserter in e company had helped to clear streets in ireland but that was all the regiment had been put by for many years the overwhelming mass of its rank and file had from three to four years service the noncommissioned officers were under thirty years old and men and sergeants alike had forgotten to speak of the stories written in brief upon the coloursthe new colours that had been formally blessed by an archbishop in england ere the regiment came away  they wanted to go to the frontthey were enthusiastically anxious to gobut they had no knowledge of what war meant and there was none to tell them they were an educated regiment the percentage of schoolcertificates in their ranks was high and most of the men could do more than read and write they had been recruited in loyal observance of the territorial idea but they themselves had no notion of that idea they were made up of drafts from an overpopulated manufacturing district the system had put flesh and muscle upon their small bones but it could not put heart into the sons of those who for generations had done overmuch work for overscanty pay had sweated in dryingrooms stooped over looms coughed among whitelead and shivered on limebarges the men had found food and rest in the army and now they were going to fight niggerspeople who ran away if you shook a stick at them wherefore they cheered lustily when the rumour ran and the shrewd clerkly noncommissioned officers speculated on the chances of batta and of saving their pay at headquarters men said the fore and fit have never been under fire within the last generation let us therefore break them in easily by setting them to guard lines of communication and this would have been done but for the fact that british regiments were wantedbadly wantedat the front and there were doubtful native regiments that could fill the minor duties brigade em with two strong regiments said headquarters they may be knocked about a bit though theyll learn their business before they come through nothing like a nightalarm and a little cutting up of stragglers to make a regiment smart in the field wait till theyve had halfadozen sentries throats cut  the colonel wrote with delight that the temper of his men was excellent that the regiment was all that could be wished and as sound as a bell the majors smiled with a sober joy and the subalterns waltzed in pairs down the messroom after dinner and nearly shot themselves at revolverpractice but there was consternation in the hearts of jakin and lew what was to be done with the drums would the band go to the front how many of the drums would accompany the regiment  they took counsel together sitting in a tree and smoking  its more than a bloomin tossup theyll leave us beind at the depot with the women youll like that said jakin sarcastically  cause o cris y mean wots a woman or a ole bloomin depot o women longside o the chanst of fieldservice you know im as keen on goin as you said lew  wish i was a bloomin bugler said jakin sadly theyll take tom kidd along that i can plaster a wall with an like as not they wont take us  then lets go an make tom kidd so bloomin sick e cant bugle no more you old is ands an ill kick him said lew wriggling on the branch  that aint no good neither we aint the sort o characters to presoom on our reptationstheyre bad if they leave the band at the depot we dont go and no error there if they take the band we may get cast for medical unfitness are you medical fit piggy said jakin digging lew in the ribs with force  yus said lew with an oath the doctor says your earts weak through smokin on an empty stummick throw a chest an ill try yer  jakin threw out his chest which lew smote with all his might jakin turned very pale gasped crowed screwed up his eyes and saidthats all right  youll do said lew ive eard o men dyin when you it em fair on the breastbone  dont bring us no nearer goin though said jakin do you know where were ordered  gawd knows an e wont split on a pal somewheres up to the front to kill paythanshairy big beggars that turn you inside out if they get old o you they say their women are goodlooking too  any loot asked the abandoned jakin  not a bloomin anna they say unless you dig up the ground an see what the niggers ave id theyre a poor lot jakin stood upright on the branch and gazed across the plain  lew said he theres the colonel coming colonels a good old beggar lets go an talk to im  lew nearly fell out of the tree at the audacity of the suggestion like jakin he feared not god neither regarded he man but there are limits even to the audacity of drummerboy and to speak to a colonel was  but jakin had slid down the trunk and doubled in the direction of the colonel that officer was walking wrapped in thought and visions of a cbyes even a kcb for had he not at command one of the best regiments of the linethe fore and fit and he was aware of two small boys charging down upon him once before it had been solemnly reported to him that the drums were in a state of mutiny jakin and lew being the ringleaders this looked like an organised conspiracy  the boys halted at twenty yards walked to the regulation four paces and saluted together each as wellsetup as a ramrod and little taller  the colonel was in a genial mood the boys appeared very forlorn and unprotected on the desolate plain and one of them was handsome  well said the colonel recognising them are you going to pull me down in the open im sure i never interfere with you even thoughhe sniffed suspiciouslyyou have been smoking  it was time to strike while the iron was hot their hearts beat tumultuously  beg y pardon sir began jakin the regments ordered on active service sir  so i believe said the colonel courteously  is the band goin sir said both together then without pause were goin sir aint we  you said the colonel stepping back the more fully to take in the two small figures you youd die in the first march  no we wouldnt sir we can march with the regment anywheresprade an anywhere else said jakin  if tom kidd goes ell shut up like a claspknife said lew tom as veryclose veins in both is legs sir  very how much  veryclose veins sir thats why they swells after long prade sir if e can go we can go sir  again the colonel looked at them long and intently  yes the band is going he said as gravely as though he had been addressing a brother officer have you any parents either of you two  no sir rejoicingly from lew and jakin were both orphans sir theres no one to be considered of on our account sir  you poor little sprats and you want to go up to the front with the regiment do you why  ive wore the queens uniform for two years said jakin its very ard sir that a man dont get no recompense for doin of is dooty sir  anan if i dont go sir interrupted lew the bandmaster e says ell catch an make a blooa blessed musician o me sir before ive seen any service sir  the colonel made no answer for a long time then he said quietly if youre passed by the doctor i daresay you can go i shouldnt smoke if i were you  the boys saluted and disappeared the colonel walked home and told the story to his wife who nearly cried over it the colonel was well pleased if that was the temper of the children what would not the men do  jakin and lew entered the boys barrackroom with great stateliness and refused to hold any conversation with their comrades for at least ten minutes then bursting with pride jakin drawled ive bin intervooin the colonel good old beggar is the colonel says i to im colonel says i let me go to the front along o the regmentto the front you shall go says e an i only wish there was more like you among the dirty little devils that bang the bloomin drums kidd if you throw your courtrements at me for tellin you the truth to your own advantage your legsll swell  none the less there was a battleroyal in the barrackroom for the boys were consumed with envy and hate and neither jakin nor lew behaved in conciliatory wise  im goin out to say adoo to my girl said lew to cap the climax dont none o you touch my kit because its wanted for active service me bein specially invited to go by the colonel  he strolled forth and whistled in the clump of trees at the back of the married quarters till cris came to him and the preliminary kisses being given and taken lew began to explain the situation  im goin to the front with the regment he said valiantly  piggy youre a little liar said cris but her heart misgave her for lew was not in the habit of lying  liar yourself cris said lew slipping an arm round her im goin when the regment marches out youll see me with em all galliant and gay give us another kiss cris on the strength of it  if youd ony astayed at the depotwhere you ought to ha binyou could get as many of em asas you dam please whimpered cris putting up her mouth  its ard cris i grant you its ard but whats a man to do if id astayed at the depot you wouldnt think anything of me  like as not but id ave you with me piggy an all the thinkin in the world isnt like kissin  an all the kissin in the world isnt like avin a medal to wear on the front o your coat  you wont get no medal  oh yus i shall though me an jakin are the only actingdrummers thatll be took along all the rest is full men an well get our medals with them  they might ha taken anybody but you piggy youll get killedyoure so venturesome stay with me piggy darlin down at the depot an ill love you true for ever  aint you goin to do that now cris you said you was  o course i am but th others more comfortable wait till youve growed a bit piggy you arent no taller than me now      illustration cris slid an arm round his neckp 47  ive bin in the army for two years an im not goin to get out of a chanst o seein service an dont you try to make me do so ill come back cris an when i take on as a man ill marry youmarry you when im a lance  promise piggy  lew reflected on the future as arranged by jakin a short time previously but criss mouth was very near to his own  i promise

air into it cris an ill keep it in my pocket so longs im alive  then cris wept anew and the interview ended  public feeling among the drummerboys rose to fever pitch and the lives of jakin and lew became unenviable not only had they been permitted to enlist two years before the regulation boys agefourteenbut by virtue it seemed of their extreme youth they were allowed to go to the frontwhich thing had not happened to actingdrummers within the knowledge of boy the band which was to accompany the regiment had been cut down to the regulation twenty men the surplus returning to the ranks jakin and lew were attached to the band as supernumeraries though they would much have preferred being company buglers  dont matter much said jakin after the medical inspection be thankful that were lowed to go at all the doctor e said that if we could stand what we took from the bazarsergeants son wed stand pretty nigh anything  which we will said lew looking tenderly at the ragged and illmade housewife that cris had given him with a lock of her hair worked into a sprawling l upon the cover  it was the best i could she sobbed i wouldnt let mother nor the sergeants tailor elp me keep it always piggy an remember i love you true  they marched to the railway station nine hundred and sixty strong and every soul in cantonments turned out to see them go the drummers gnashed their teeth at jakin and lew marching with the band the married women wept upon the platform and the regiment cheered its noble self black in the face  a nice level lot said the colonel to the secondincommand as they watched the first four companies entraining  fit to do anything said the secondincommand enthusiastically but it seems to me theyre a thought too young and tender for the work in hand its bitter cold up at the front now  theyre sound enough said the colonel we must take our chance of sick casualties  so they went northward ever northward past droves and droves of camels armies of camp followers and legions of laden mules the throng thickening day by day till with a shriek the train pulled up at a hopelessly congested junction where six lines of temporary track accommodated six fortywaggon trains where whistles blew babus sweated and commissariat officers swore from dawn till far into the night amid the winddriven chaff of the fodderbales and the lowing of a thousand steers  hurry upyoure badly wanted at the front was the message that greeted the fore and aft and the occupants of the red cross carriages told the same tale  tisnt so much the bloomin fightin gasped a headbound trooper of hussars to a knot of admiring fore and afts tisnt so much the bloomin fightin though theres enough o that its the bloomin food an the bloomin climate frost all night cept when it hails and biling sun all day and the water stinks fit to knock you down i got my ead chipped like a egg ive got pneumonia too an my guts is all out o order taint no bloomin picnic in those parts i can tell you  wot are the niggers like demanded a private  theres some prisoners in that train yonder go an look at em theyre the aristocracy o the country the common folk are a dashed sight uglier if you want to know what they fight with reach under my seat an pull out the long knife thats there  they dragged out and beheld for the first time the grim bonehandled triangular afghan knife it was almost as long as lew  thats the thing to jint ye said the trooper feebly it can take off a mans arm at the shoulder as easy as slicing butter i halved the beggar that used that un but theres more of his likes up above they dont understand thrustin but theyre devils to slice  the men strolled across the tracks to inspect the afghan prisoners they were unlike any niggers that the fore and aft had ever metthese huge blackhaired scowling sons of the beniisrael as the men stared the afghans spat freely and muttered one to another with lowered eyes  my eyes wot awful swine said jakin who was in the rear of the procession say old man how you got puckrowed eh kiswasti you wasnt hanged for your ugly face hey  the tallest of the company turned his legirons clanking at the movement and stared at the boy see he cried to his fellows in pushto they send children against us what a people and what fools      illustration the men strolled across the tracks to inspect     the afghan prisonersp 50  hya said jakin nodding his head cheerily you go downcountry khana get peenikapanee getlive like a bloomin raja ke marfik thats a better bandobust than baynit get it in your innards goodbye ole man take care o your beautiful figuread an try to look kushy  the men laughed and fell in for their first march when they began to realise that a soldiers life was not all beer and skittles they were much impressed with the size and bestial ferocity of the niggers whom they had now learned to call paythans and more with the exceeding discomfort of their own surroundings twenty old soldiers in the corps would have taught them how to make themselves moderately snug at night but they had no old soldiers and as the troops on the line of march said they lived like pigs they learned the heartbreaking cussedness of campkitchens and camels and the depravity of an ep tent and a witherwrung mule they studied animalculæ in water and developed a few cases of dysentery in their study  at the end of their third march they were disagreeably surprised by the arrival in their camp of a hammered iron slug which fired from a steady rest at seven hundred yards flicked out the brains of a private seated by the fire this robbed them of their peace for a night and was the beginning of a longrange fire carefully calculated to that end in the daytime they saw nothing except an unpleasant puff of smoke from a crag above the line of march at night there were distant spurts of flame and occasional casualties which set the whole camp blazing into the gloom and occasionally into opposite tents then they swore vehemently and vowed that this was magnificent but not war  indeed it was not the regiment could not halt for reprisals against the sharpshooters of the countryside its duty was to go forward and make connection with the scotch and gurkha troops with which it was brigaded the afghans knew this and knew too after their first tentative shots that they were dealing with a raw regiment thereafter they devoted themselves to the task of keeping the fore and aft on the strain not for anything would they have taken equal liberties with a seasoned corpswith the wicked little gurkhas whose delight it was to lie out in the open on a dark night and stalk their stalkerswith the terrible big men dressed in womens clothes who could be heard praying to their god in the nightwatches and whose peace of mind no amount of sniping could shakeor with those vile sikhs who marched so ostentatiously unprepared and who dealt out such grim reward to those who tried to profit by that unpreparedness this white regiment was differentquite different it slept like a hog and like a hog charged in every direction when it was roused its sentries walked with a footfall that could be heard for a quarter of a mile would fire at anything that movedeven a driven donkeyand when they had once fired could be scientifically rushed and laid out a horror and an offence against the morning sun then there were campfollowers who straggled and could be cut up without fear their shrieks would disturb the white boys and the loss of their services would inconvenience them sorely  thus at every march the hidden enemy became bolder and the regiment writhed and twisted under attacks it could not avenge the crowning triumph was a sudden nightrush ending in the cutting of many tentropes the collapse of the sodden canvas and a glorious knifing of the men who struggled and kicked below it was a great deed neatly carried out and it shook the already shaken nerves of the fore and aft all the courage that they had been required to exercise up to this point was the two oclock in the morning courage and so far they had only succeeded in shooting their comrades and losing their sleep  sullen discontented cold savage sick with their uniforms dulled and unclean the fore and aft joined their brigade  i hear you had a tough time of it coming up said the brigadier but when he saw the hospitalsheets his face fell  this is bad said he to himself theyre as rotten as sheep and aloud to the colonelim afraid we cant spare you just yet we want all we have else i should have given you ten days to recover in  the colonel winced on my honour sir he returned there is not the least necessity to think of sparing us my men have been rather mauled and upset without a fair return they only want to go in somewhere where they can see whats before them  cant say i think much of the fore and fit said the brigadier in confidence to his brigademajor theyve lost all their soldiering and by the trim of them might have marched through the country from the other side a more faggedout set of men i never put eyes on  oh theyll improve as the work goes on the parade gloss has been rubbed off a little but theyll put on field polish before long said the brigademajor theyve been mauled and they dont quite understand it  they did not all the hitting was on one side and it was cruelly hard hitting with accessories that made them sick there was also the real sickness that laid hold of a strong man and dragged him howling to the grave worst of all their officers knew just as little of the country as the men themselves and looked as if they did the fore and aft were in a thoroughly unsatisfactory condition but they believed that all would be well if they could once get a fair goin at the enemy potshots up and down the valleys were unsatisfactory and the bayonet never seemed to get a chance perhaps it was as well for a longlimbed afghan with a knife had a reach of eight feet and could carry away lead that would disable three englishmen  the fore and fit would like some riflepractice at the enemyall seven hundred rifles blazing together that wish showed the mood of the men  the gurkhas walked into their camp and in broken barrackroom english strove to fraternise with them offered them pipes of tobacco and stood them treat at the canteen but the fore and aft not knowing much of the nature of the gurkhas treated them as they would treat any other niggers and the little men in green trotted back to their firm friends the highlanders and with many grins confided to them that dam white regiment no dam use sulkyugh dirtyugh hya any tot for johnny whereat the highlanders smote the gurkhas as to the head and told them not to vilify a british regiment and the gurkhas grinned cavernously for the highlanders were their elder brothers and entitled to the privileges of kinship the common soldier who touches a gurkha is more than likely to have his head sliced open  three days later the brigadier arranged a battle according to the rules of war and the peculiarity of the afghan temperament the enemy were massing in inconvenient strength among the hills and the moving of many green standards warned him that the tribes were up in aid of the afghan regular troops a squadron and a half of bengal lancers represented the available cavalry and two screwguns borrowed from a column thirty miles away the artillery at the generals disposal  if they stand as ive a very strong notion that they will i fancy we shall see an infantry fight that will be worth watching said the brigadier well do it in style each regiment shall be played into action by its band and well hold the cavalry in reserve  for all the reserve somebody asked  for all the reserve because were going to crumple them up said the brigadier who was an extraordinary brigadier and did not believe in the value of a reserve when dealing with asiatics indeed when you come to think of it had the british army consistently waited for reserves in all its little affairs the boundaries of our empire would have stopped at brighton beach  that battle was to be a glorious battle  the three regiments debouching from three separate gorges after duly crowning the heights above were to converge from the centre left and right upon what we will call the afghan army then stationed towards the lower extremity of a flatbottomed valley thus it will be seen that three sides of the valley practically belonged to the english while the fourth was strictly afghan property in the event of defeat the afghans had the rocky hills to fly to where the fire from the guerilla tribes in aid would cover their retreat in the event of victory these same tribes would rush down and lend their weight to the rout of the british  the screwguns were to shell the head of each afghan rush that was made in close formation and the cavalry held in reserve in the right valley were to gently stimulate the breakup which would follow on the combined attack the brigadier sitting upon a rock overlooking the valley would watch the battle unrolled at his feet the fore and aft would debouch from the central gorge the gurkhas from the left and the highlanders from the right for the reason that the left flank of the enemy seemed as though it required the most hammering it was not every day that an afghan force would take ground in the open and the brigadier was resolved to make the most of it  if we only had a few more men he said plaintively we could surround the creatures and crumple em up thoroughly as it is im afraid we can only cut them up as they run its a great pity  the fore and aft had enjoyed unbroken peace for five days and were beginning in spite of dysentery to recover their nerve but they were not happy for they did not know the work in hand and had they known would not have known how to do it throughout those five days in which old soldiers might have taught them the craft of the game they discussed together their misadventures in the pasthow such an one was alive at dawn and dead ere the dusk and with what shrieks and struggles such another had given up his soul under the afghan knife death was a new and horrible thing to the sons of mechanics who were used to die decently of zymotic disease and their careful conservation in barracks had done nothing to make them look upon it with less dread  very early in the dawn the bugles began to blow and the fore and aft filled with a misguided enthusiasm turned out without waiting for a cup of coffee and a biscuit and were rewarded by being kept under arms in the cold while the other regiments leisurely prepared for the fray all the world knows that it is ill taking the breeks off a highlander it is much iller to try to make him stir unless he is convinced of the necessity for haste  the fore and aft waited leaning upon their rifles and listening to the protests of their empty stomachs the colonel did his best to remedy the default of lining as soon as it was borne in upon him that the affair would not begin at once and so well did he succeed that the coffee was just ready whenthe men moved off their band leading even then there had been a mistake in time and the fore and aft came out into the valley ten minutes before the proper hour their band wheeled to the right after reaching the open and retired behind a little rocky knoll still playing while the regiment went past  it was not a pleasant sight that opened on the uninstructed view for the lower end of the valley appeared to be filled by an army in positionreal and actual regiments attired in red coats andof this there was no doubtfiring martinihenry bullets which cut up the ground a hundred yards in front of the leading company over that pockmarked ground the regiment had to pass and it opened the ball with a general and profound courtesy to the piping pickets ducking in perfect time as though it had been brazed on a rod being halfcapable of thinking for itself it fired a volley by the simple process of pitching its rifle into its shoulder and pulling the trigger the bullets may have accounted for some of the watchers on the hillside but they certainly did not affect the mass of enemy in front while the noise of the rifles drowned any orders that might have been given  good god said the brigadier sitting on the rock high above all that regiment has spoilt the whole show hurry up the others and let the screwguns get off  but the screwguns in working round the heights had stumbled upon a wasps nest of a small mud fort which they incontinently shelled at eight hundred yards to the huge discomfort of the occupants who were unaccustomed to weapons of such devilish precision  the fore and aft continued to go forward but with shortened stride where were the other regiments and why did these niggers use martinis they took open order instinctively lying down and firing at random rushing a few paces forward and lying down again according to the regulations once in this formation each man felt himself desperately alone and edged in towards his fellow for comforts sake  then the crack of his neighbours rifle at his ear led him to fire as rapidly as he couldagain for the sake of the comfort of the noise the reward was not long delayed five volleys plunged the files in banked smoke impenetrable to the eye and the bullets began to take ground twenty or thirty yards in front of the firers as the weight of the bayonet dragged down and to the right arms wearied with holding the kick of the leaping martini the company commanders peered helplessly through the smoke the more nervous mechanically trying to fan it away with their helmets  high and to the left bawled a captain till he was hoarse no good cease firing and let it drift away a bit  three and four times the bugles shrieked the order and when it was obeyed the fore and aft looked that their foe should be lying before them in mown swaths of men a light wind drove the smoke to leeward and showed the enemy still in position and apparently unaffected a quarter of a ton of lead had been buried a furlong in front of them as the ragged earth attested  that was not demoralising to the afghans who have not european nerves they were waiting for the mad riot to die down and were firing quietly into the heart of the smoke a private of the fore and aft spun up his company shrieking with agony another was kicking the earth and gasping and a third ripped through the lower intestines by a jagged bullet was calling aloud on his comrades to put him out of his pain these were the casualties and they were not soothing to hear or see the smoke cleared to a dull haze  then the foe began to shout with a great shouting and a massa black massdetached itself from the main body and rolled over the ground at horrid speed it was composed of perhaps three hundred men who would shout and fire and slash if the rush of their fifty comrades who were determined to die carried home the fifty were ghazis halfmaddened with drugs and wholly mad with religious fanaticism when they rushed the british fire ceased and in the lull the order was given to close ranks and meet them with the bayonet  any one who knew the business could have told the fore and aft that the only way of dealing with a ghazi rush is by volleys at long ranges because a man who means to die who desires to die who will gain heaven by dying must in nine cases out of ten kill a man who has a lingering prejudice in favour of life where they should have closed and gone forward the fore and aft opened out and skirmished and where they should have opened out and fired they closed and waited  a man dragged from his blankets half awake and unfed is never in a pleasant frame of mind nor does his happiness increase when he watches the whites of the eyes of three hundred sixfoot fiends upon whose beards the foam is lying upon whose tongues is a roar of wrath and in whose hands are yardlong knives  the fore and aft heard the gurkha bugles bringing that regiment forward at the double while the neighing of the highland pipes came from the left they strove to stay where they were though the bayonets wavered down the line like the oars of a ragged boat then they felt body to body the amazing physical strength of their foes a shriek of pain ended the rush and the knives fell amid scenes not to be told the men clubbed together and smote blindlyas often as not at their own fellows their front crumpled like paper and the fifty ghazis passed on their backers now drunk with success fighting as madly as they  then the rearranks were bidden to close up and the subalterns dashed into the stewalone for the rearrank had heard the clamour in front the yells and the howls of pain and had seen the dark stale blood that makes afraid they were not going to stay it was the rushing of the camps over again let their officers go to hell if they chose they would get away from the knives  come on shrieked the subalterns and their men cursing them drew back each closing into his neighbour and wheeling round  charteris and devlin subalterns of the last company faced their death alone in the belief that their men would follow  youve killed me you cowards sobbed devlin and dropped cut from the shoulderstrap to the centre of the chest and a fresh detachment of his men retreating always retreating trampled him under foot as they made for the pass whence they had emerged      i kissed her in the kitchen and i kissed her in the hall                   childun childun follow me     oh golly said the cook is he gwine to kiss us all                   hallahallahallahallelujah  the gurkhas were pouring through the left gorge and over the heights at the double to the invitation of their regimental quickstep the black rocks were crowned with dark green spiders as the bugles gave tongue jubilantly      in the morning in the morning by the bright light     when gabriel blows his trumpet in the morning  the gurkha rearcompanies tripped and blundered over loose stones the frontfiles halted for a moment to take stock of the valley and to settle stray bootlaces then a happy little sigh of contentment soughed down the ranks and it was as though the land smiled for behold there below was the enemy and it was to meet them that the gurkhas had doubled so hastily there was much enemy there would be amusement the little men hitched their kukris well to hand and gaped expectantly at their officers as terriers grin ere the stone is cast for them to fetch the gurkhas ground sloped downward to the valley and they enjoyed a fair view of the proceedings they sat upon the boulders to watch for their officers were not going to waste their wind in assisting to repulse a ghazi rush more than half a mile away let the white men look to their own front  hi yi said the subadarmajor who was sweating profusely dam fools yonder stand closeorder this is no time for closeorder it is the time for volleys ugh  horrified amused and indignant the gurkhas beheld the retirement of the fore and aft with a running chorus of oaths and commentaries  they run the white men run colonel sahib may we also do a little running murmured runbir thappa the senior jemadar  but the colonel would have none of it let the beggars be cut up a little said he wrathfully serves em right theyll be prodded into facing round in a minute he looked through his fieldglasses and caught the glint of an officers sword  beating em with the flatdamned conscripts how the ghazis are walking into them said he  the fore and aft heading back bore with them their officers the narrowness of the pass forced the mob into solid formation and the rearrank delivered some sort of a wavering volley the ghazis drew off for they did not know what reserves the gorge might hide moreover it was never wise to chase white men too far they returned as wolves return to cover satisfied with the slaughter that they had done and only stopping to slash at the wounded on the ground a quarter of a mile had the fore and aft retreated and now jammed in the pass was quivering with pain shaken and demoralised with fear while the officers maddened beyond control smote the men with the hilts and the flats of their swords  get back get back you cowardsyou women right about facecolumn of companies formyou hounds shouted the colonel and the subalterns swore aloud but the regiment wanted to goto go anywhere out of the range of those merciless knives it swayed to and fro irresolutely with shouts and outcries while from the right the gurkhas dropped volley after volley of cripplestopper snider bullets at long range into the mob of the ghazis returning to their own troops  the fore and aft band though protected from direct fire by the rocky knoll under which it had sat down fled at the first rush jakin and lew would have fled also but their short legs left them fifty yards in the rear and by the time the band had mixed with the regiment they were painfully aware that they would have to close in alone and unsupported  get back to that rock gasped jakin they wont see us there  and they returned to the scattered instruments of the band their hearts nearly bursting their ribs  heres a nice show for us said jakin throwing himself full length on the ground a bloomin fine show for british infantry oh the devils theyve gone an left us alone here wotll we do  lew took possession of a castoff water bottle which naturally was full of canteen rum and drank till he coughed again  drink said he shortly theyll come back in a minute or twoyou see  jakin drank but there was no sign of the regiments return they could hear a dull clamour from the head of the valley of retreat and saw the ghazis slink back quickening their pace as the gurkhas fired at them  were all thats left of the band an well be cut up as sure as death said jakin  ill die game then said lew thickly fumbling with his tiny drummers sword the drink was working on his brain as it was on jakins  old on i know something better than fightin said jakin stung by the splendour of a sudden thought due chiefly to rum tip our bloomin cowards yonder the word to come back the paythan beggars are well away come on lew we wont get hurt take the fife and give me the drum the old step for all your bloomin guts are worth theres a few of our men coming back now stand up ye drunken little defaulter by your rightquick march  he slipped the drumsling over his shoulder thrust the fife into lews hand and the two boys marched out of the cover of the rock into the open making a hideous hash of the first bars of the british grenadiers  as jakin had said a few of the fore and aft were coming back sullenly and shamefacedly under the stimulus of blows and abuse their red coats shone at the head of the valley and behind them were wavering bayonets but between this shattered line and the enemy who with afghan suspicion feared that the hasty retreat meant an ambush and had not moved therefore lay half a mile of level ground dotted only by the wounded      illustration the tune settled into full swing and the boys     kept shoulder to shoulderp 69  the tune settled into full swing and the boys kept shoulder to shoulder jakin banging the drum as one possessed the one fife made a thin and pitiful squeaking but the tune carried far even to the gurkhas  come on you dogs muttered jakin to himself are we to play for hever lew was staring straight in front of him and marching more stiffly than ever he had done on parade  and in bitter mockery of the distant mob the old tune of the old line shrilled and rattled      some talk of alexander       and some of hercules     of hector and lysander       and such great names as these  there was a faroff clapping of hands from the gurkhas and a roar from the highlanders in the distance but never a shot was fired by british or afghan the two little red dots moved forward in the open parallel to the enemys front      but of all the worlds great heroes       theres none that can compare     with a towrowrowrowrowrow       to the british grenadier  the men of the fore and aft were gathering thick at the entrance to the plain the brigadier on the heights far above was speechless with rage still no movement from the enemy the day stayed to watch the children  jakin halted and beat the long roll of the assembly while the fife squealed despairingly  right about face hold up lew youre drunk said jakin they wheeled and marched back      those heroes of antiquity       neer saw a cannonball     nor knew the force o powder  here they come said jakin go on lew      to scare their foes withal  the fore and aft were pouring out of the valley what officers had said to men in that time of shame and humiliation will never be known for neither officers nor men speak of it now  they are coming anew shouted a priest among the afghans do not kill the boys take them alive and they shall be of our faith  but the first volley had been fired and lew dropped on his face jakin stood for a minute spun round and collapsed as the fore and aft came forward the curses of their officers in their ears and in their hearts the shame of open shame  half the men had seen the drummers die and they made no sign they did not even shout they doubled out straight across the plain in open order and they did not fire  this said the colonel of gurkhas softly is the real attack as it should have been delivered come on my children  ululululu squealed the gurkhas and came down with a joyful clicking of kukristhose vicious gurkha knives  on the right there was no rush the highlanders cannily commending their souls to god for it matters as much to a dead man whether he has been shot in a border scuffle or at waterloo opened out and fired according to their custom that is to say without heat and without intervals while the screwguns having disposed of the impertinent mud fort aforementioned dropped shell after shell into the clusters round the flickering green standards on the heights  charrging is an unfortunate necessity murmured the coloursergeant of the right company of the highlanders it makes the men sweer so but i am thinkin that it will come to a charrge if these black devils stand much longer stewarrt man youre firing into the eye of the sun and hell not take any harm for government ammuneetion a foot lower and a great deal slower what are the english doing theyre very quiet there in the centre running again  the english were not running they were hacking and hewing and stabbing for though one white man is seldom physically a match for an afghan in a sheepskin or wadded coat yet through the pressure of many white men behind and a certain thirst for revenge in his heart he becomes capable of doing much with both ends of his rifle the fore and aft held their fire till one bullet could drive through five or six men and the front of the afghan force gave on the volley they then selected their men and slew them with deep gasps and short hacking coughs and groanings of leather belts against strained bodies and realised for the first time that an afghan attacked is far less formidable than an afghan attacking which fact old soldiers might have told them  but they had no old soldiers in their ranks  the gurkhas stall at the bazar was the noisiest for the men were engagedto a nasty noise as of beef being cut on the blockwith the kukri which they preferred to the bayonet well knowing how the afghan hates the halfmoon blade  as the afghans wavered the green standards on the mountain moved down to assist them in a last rally this was unwise the lancers chafing in the right gorge had thrice despatched their only subaltern as galloper to report on the progress of affairs on the third occasion he returned with a bulletgraze on his knee swearing strange oaths in hindustani and saying that all things were ready so that squadron swung round the right of the highlanders with a wicked whistling of wind in the pennons of its lances and fell upon the remnant just when according to all the rules of war it should have waited for the foe to show more signs of wavering  but it was a dainty charge deftly delivered and it ended by the cavalry finding itself at the head of the pass by which the afghans intended to retreat and down the track that the lances had made streamed two companies of the highlanders which was never intended by the brigadier the new development was successful it detached the enemy from his base as a sponge is torn from a rock and left him ringed about with fire in that pitiless plain and as a sponge is chased round the bathtub by the hand of the bather so were the afghans chased till they broke into little detachments much more difficult to dispose of than large masses  see quoth the brigadier everything has come as i arranged weve cut their base and now well bucket em to pieces  a direct hammering was all that the brigadier had dared to hope for considering the size of the force at his disposal but men who stand or fall by the errors of their opponents may be forgiven for turning chance into design the bucketing went forward merrily the afghan forces were upon the runthe run of wearied wolves who snarl and bite over their shoulders the red lances dipped by twos and threes and with a shriek up rose the lancebutt like a spar on a stormy sea as the trooper cantering forward cleared his point the lancers kept between their prey and the steep hills for all who could were trying to escape from the valley of death the highlanders gave the fugitives two hundred yards law and then brought them down gasping and choking ere they could reach the protection of the boulders above the gurkhas followed suit but the fore and aft were killing on their own account for they had penned a mass of men between their bayonets and a wall of rock and the flash of the rifles was lighting the wadded coats  we cannot hold them captain sahib panted a ressaidar of lancers let us try the carbine the lance is good but it wastes time  they tried the carbine and still the enemy melted awayfled up the hills by hundreds when there were only twenty bullets to stop them on the heights the screwguns ceased firingthey had run out of ammunitionand the brigadier groaned for the musketry fire could not sufficiently smash the retreat long before the last volleys were fired the doolies were out in force looking for the wounded the battle was over and but for want of fresh troops the afghans would have been wiped off the earth as it was they counted their dead by hundreds and nowhere were the dead thicker than in the track of the fore and aft  but the regiment did not cheer with the highlanders nor did they dance uncouth dances with the gurkhas among the dead they looked under their brows at the colonel as they leaned upon their rifles and panted  get back to camp you havent you disgraced yourself enough for one day go and look to the wounded its all youre fit for said the colonel yet for the past hour the fore and aft had been doing all that mortal commander could expect they had lost heavily because they did not know how to set about their business with proper skill but they had borne themselves gallantly and this was their reward  a young and sprightly coloursergeant who had begun to imagine himself a hero offered his waterbottle to a highlander whose tongue was black with thirst i drink with no cowards answered the youngster huskily and turning to a gurkha said hya johnny drink water got it the gurkha grinned and passed his bottle the fore and aft said no word  they went back to camp when the field of strife had been a little mopped up and made presentable and the brigadier who saw himself a knight in three months was the only soul who was complimentary to them the colonel was heartbroken and the officers were savage and sullen  well said the brigadier they are young troops of course and it was not unnatural that they should retire in disorder for a bit  oh my only aunt maria murmured a junior staff officer retire in disorder it was a bally run  but they came again as we all know cooed the brigadier the colonels ashywhite face before him and they behaved as well as could possibly be expected behaved beautifully indeed i was watching them its not a matter to take to heart colonel as some german general said of his men they wanted to be shooted over a little that was all to himself he saidnow theyre blooded i can give em responsible work its as well that they got what they did teach em more than halfadozen rifle flirtations that willlaterrun alone and bite poor old colonel though  all that afternoon the heliograph winked and flickered on the hills striving to tell the good news to a mountain forty miles away and in the evening there arrived dusty sweating and sore a misguided correspondent who had gone out to assist at a trumpery villageburning and who had read off the message from afar cursing his luck the while  lets have the details somehowas full as ever you can please its the first time ive ever been left this campaign said the correspondent to the brigadier and the brigadier nothing loath told him how an army of communication had been crumpled up destroyed and all but annihilated by the craft strategy wisdom and foresight of the brigadier  but some say and among these be the gurkhas who watched on the hillside that that battle was won by jakin and lew whose little bodies were borne up just in time to fit two gaps at the head of the big ditchgrave for the dead under the heights of jagai  illustration  illustration     the man who was      the earth gave up her dead that tide       into our camp he came     and said his say and went his way       and left our hearts aflame      keep tallyon the gunbutt score       the vengeance we must take     when god shall bring full reckoning       for our dead comrades sake                          ballad  let it be clearly understood that the russian is a delightful person till he tucks in his shirt as an oriental he is charming it is only when he insists upon being treated as the most easterly of western peoples instead of the most westerly of easterns that he becomes a racial anomaly extremely difficult to handle the host never knows which side of his nature is going to turn up next  dirkovitch was a russiana russian of the russianswho appeared to get his bread by serving the czar as an officer in a cossack regiment and corresponding for a russian newspaper with a name that was never twice alike he was a handsome young oriental fond of wandering through unexplored portions of the earth and he arrived in india from nowhere in particular at least no living man could ascertain whether it was by way of balkh badakshan chitral beluchistan or nepaul or anywhere else the indian government being in an unusually affable mood gave orders that he was to be civilly treated and shown everything that was to be seen so he drifted talking bad english and worse french from one city to another till he foregathered with her majestys white hussars in the city of peshawur which stands at the mouth of that narrow swordcut in the hills that men call the khyber pass he was undoubtedly an officer and he was decorated after the manner of the russians with little enamelled crosses and he could talk and though this has nothing to do with his merits he had been given up as a hopeless task or cask by the black tyrone who individually and collectively with hot whisky and honey mulled brandy and mixed spirits of every kind had striven in all hospitality to make him drunk and when the black tyrone who are exclusively irish fail to disturb the peace of head of a foreignerthat foreigner is certain to be a superior man  the white hussars were as conscientious in choosing their wine as in charging the enemy all that they possessed including some wondrous brandy was placed at the absolute disposition of dirkovitch and he enjoyed himself hugelyeven more than among the black tyrones  but he remained distressingly european through it all the white hussars were my dear true friends fellowsoldiers glorious and brothers inseparable he would unburden himself by the hour on the glorious future that awaited the combined arms of england and russia when their hearts and their territories should run side by side and the great mission of civilising asia should begin that was unsatisfactory because asia is not going to be civilised after the methods of the west there is too much asia and she is too old you cannot reform a lady of many lovers and asia has been insatiable in her flirtations aforetime she will never attend sunday school or learn to vote save with swords for tickets  dirkovitch knew this as well as any one else but it suited him to talk specialcorrespondently and to make himself as genial as he could now and then he volunteered a little a very little information about his own sotnia of cossacks left apparently to look after themselves somewhere at the back of beyond he had done rough work in central asia and had seen rather more helpyourself fighting than most men of his years but he was careful never to betray his superiority and more than careful to praise on all occasions the appearance drill uniform and organisation of her majestys white hussars and indeed they were a regiment to be admired when lady durgan widow of the late sir john durgan arrived in their station and after a short time had been proposed to by every single man at mess she put the public sentiment very neatly when she explained that they were all so nice that unless she could marry them all including the colonel and some majors already married she was not going to content herself with one hussar wherefore she wedded a little man in a rifle regiment being by nature contradictious and the white hussars were going to wear crape on their arms but compromised by attending the wedding in full force and lining the aisle with unutterable reproach she had jilted them allfrom bassetholmer the senior captain to little mildred the junior subaltern who could have given her four thousand a year and a title  the only person who did not share the general regard for the white hussars were a few thousand gentlemen of jewish extraction who lived across the border and answered to the name of paythan they had once met the regiment officially and for something less than twenty minutes but the interview which was complicated with many casualties had filled them with prejudice they even called the white hussars children of the devil and sons of persons whom it would be perfectly impossible to meet in decent society yet they were not above making their aversion fill their moneybelts the regiment possessed carbinesbeautiful martinihenri carbines that would lop a bullet into an enemys camp at one thousand yards and were even handier than the long rifle therefore they were coveted all along the border and since demand inevitably breeds supply they were supplied at the risk of life and limb for exactly their weight in coined silverseven and onehalf pounds weight of rupees or sixteen pounds sterling reckoning the rupee at par they were stolen at night by snakyhaired thieves who crawled on their stomachs under the nose of the sentries they disappeared mysteriously from locked armracks and in the hot weather when all the barrack doors and windows were open they vanished like puffs of their own smoke the border people desired them for family vendettas and contingencies but in the long cold nights of the northern indian winter they were stolen most extensively the traffic of murder was liveliest among the hills at that season and prices ruled high the regimental guards were first doubled and then trebled a trooper does not much care if he loses a weapongovernment must make it goodbut he deeply resents the loss of his sleep the regiment grew very angry and one riflethief bears the visible marks of their anger upon him to this hour that incident stopped the burglaries for a time and the guards were reduced accordingly and the regiment devoted itself to polo with unexpected results for it beat by two goals to one that very terrible polo corps the lushkar light horse though the latter had four ponies apiece for a short hours fight as well as a native officer who played like a lambent flame across the ground  they gave a dinner to celebrate the event the lushkar team came and dirkovitch came in the fullest full uniform of a cossack officer which is as full as a dressinggown and was introduced to the lushkars and opened his eyes as he regarded they were lighter men than the hussars and they carried themselves with the swing that is the peculiar right of the punjab frontier force and all irregular horse like everything else in the service it has to be learnt but unlike many things it is never forgotten and remains on the body till death  the great beamroofed messroom of the white hussars was a sight to be remembered all the mess plate was out on the long tablethe same table that had served up the bodies of five officers after a forgotten fight long and long agothe dingy battered standards faced the door of entrance clumps of winterroses lay between the silver candlesticks and the portraits of eminent officers deceased looked down on their successors from between the heads of sambhur nilghai markhor and pride of all the mess two grinning snowleopards that had cost bassetholmer four months leave that he might have spent in england instead of on the road to thibet and the daily risk of his life by ledge snowslide and grassy slope  the servants in spotless white muslin and the crest of their regiments on the brow of their turbans waited behind their masters who were clad in the scarlet and gold of the white hussars and the cream and silver of the lushkar light horse dirkovitchs dull green uniform was the only dark spot at the board but his big onyx eyes made up for it he was fraternising effusively with the captain of the lushkar team who was wondering how many of dirkovitchs cossacks his own dark wiry downcountrymen could account for in a fair charge but one does not speak of these things openly      illustration rung ho hira singhp 85  the talk rose higher and higher and the regimental band played between the courses as is the immemorial custom till all tongues ceased for a moment with the removal of the dinnerslips and the first toast of obligation when an officer rising said mr vice the queen and little mildred from the bottom of the table answered the queen god bless her and the big spurs clanked as the big men heaved themselves up and drank the queen upon whose pay they were falsely supposed to settle their messbills that sacrament of the mess never grows old and never ceases to bring a lump into the throat of the listener wherever he be by sea or by land dirkovitch rose with his brothers glorious but he could not understand no one but an officer can tell what the toast means and the bulk have more sentiment than comprehension immediately after the little silence that follows on the ceremony there entered the native officer who had played for the lushkar team he could not of course eat with the mess but he came in at dessert all six feet of him with the blue and silver turban atop and the big black boots below the mess rose joyously as he thrust forward the hilt of his sabre in token of fealty for the colonel of the white hussars to touch and dropped in a vacant chair amid shouts of rung ho hira singh which being translated means go in and win did i whack you over the knee old man ressaidar sahib what the devil made you play that kicking pig of a pony in the last ten minutes shabash ressaidar sahib then the voice of the colonel the health of ressaidar hira singh  after the shouting had died away hira singh rose to reply for he was the cadet of a royal house the son of a kings son and knew what was due on these occasions thus he spoke in the vernacularcolonel sahib and officers of this regiment much honour have you done me this will i remember we came down from afar to play you but we were beaten no fault of yours ressaidar sahib played on our own ground y know your ponies were cramped from the railway dont apologise therefore perhaps we will come again if it be so ordained hear hear hear indeed bravo hsh then we will play you afresh happy to meet you till there are left no feet upon our ponies thus far for sport he dropped one hand on his swordhilt and his eye wandered to dirkovitch lolling back in his chair but if by the will of god there arises any other game which is not the polo game then be assured colonel sahib and officers that we will play it out side by side though they again his eye sought dirkovitch though they i say have fifty ponies to our one horse and with a deepmouthed rung ho that sounded like a musketbutt on flagstones he sat down amid leaping glasses  dirkovitch who had devoted himself steadily to the brandythe terrible brandy aforementioneddid not understand nor did the expurgated translations offered to him at all convey the point decidedly hira singhs was the speech of the evening and the clamour might have continued to the dawn had it not been broken by the noise of a shot without that sent every man feeling at his defenceless left side then there was a scuffle and a yell of pain  carbinestealing again said the adjutant calmly sinking back in his chair this comes of reducing the guards i hope the sentries have killed him  the feet of armed men pounded on the veranda flags and it was as though something was being dragged  why dont they put him in the cells till the morning said the colonel testily see if theyve damaged him sergeant  the messsergeant fled out into the darkness and returned with two troopers and a corporal all very much perplexed  caught a man stealin carbines sir said the corporal leastways e was crawlin towards the barricks sir past the main road sentries an the sentry e sez sir  the limp heap of rags upheld by the three men groaned never was seen so destitute and demoralised an afghan he was turbanless shoeless caked with dirt and all but dead with rough handling hira singh started slightly at the sound of the mans pain dirkovitch took another glass of brandy  what does the sentry say said the colonel  sez e speaks english sir said the corporal  so you brought him into mess instead of handing him over to the sergeant if he spoke all the tongues of the pentecost youve no business  again the bundle groaned and muttered little mildred had risen from his place to inspect he jumped back as though he had been shot  perhaps it would be better sir to send the men away said he to the colonel for he was a much privileged subaltern he put his arms round the ragbound horror as he spoke and dropped him into a chair it may not have been explained that the littleness of mildred lay in his being six feet four and big in proportion the corporal seeing that an officer was disposed to look after the capture and that the colonels eye was beginning to blaze promptly removed himself and his men the mess was left alone with the carbinethief who laid his head on the table and wept bitterly hopelessly and inconsolably as little children weep  hira singh leapt to his feet colonel sahib said he that man is no afghan for they weep ai ai nor is he of hindustan for they weep oh ho he weeps after the fashion of the white men who say ow ow  now where the dickens did you get that knowledge hira singh said the captain of the lushkar team  hear him said hira singh simply pointing at the crumpled figure that wept as though it would never cease  he said my god said little mildred i heard him say it  the colonel and the messroom looked at the man in silence it is a horrible thing to hear a man cry a woman can sob from the top of her palate or her lips or anywhere else but a man must cry from his diaphragm and it rends him to pieces  poor devil said the colonel coughing tremendously we ought to send him to hospital hes been manhandled  now the adjutant loved his carbines they were to him as his grandchildren the men standing in the first place he grunted rebelliously i can understand an afghan stealing because hes built that way but i cant understand his crying that makes it worse  the brandy must have affected dirkovitch for he lay back in his chair and stared at the ceiling there was nothing special in the ceiling beyond a shadow as of a huge black coffin owing to some peculiarity in the construction of the messroom this shadow was always thrown when the candles were lighted it never disturbed the digestion of the white hussars they were in fact rather proud of it  is he going to cry all night said the colonel or are we supposed to sit up with little mildreds guest until he feels better  the man in the chair threw up his head and stared at the mess oh my god he said and every soul in the mess rose to his feet then the lushkar captain did a deed for which he ought to have been given the victoria crossdistinguished gallantry in a fight against overwhelming curiosity he picked up his team with his eyes as the hostess picks up the ladies at the opportune moment and pausing only by the colonels chair to say this isnt our affair you know sir led them into the veranda and the gardens hira singh was the last to go and he looked at dirkovitch but dirkovitch had departed into a brandyparadise of his own his lips moved without sound and he was studying the coffin on the ceiling  whitewhite all over said bassetholmer the adjutant what a pernicious renegade he must be i wonder where he came from  the colonel shook the man gently by the arm and who are you said he  there was no answer the man stared round the messroom and smiled in the colonels face little mildred who was always more of a woman than a man till boot and saddle was sounded repeated the question in a voice that would have drawn confidences from a geyser the man only smiled dirkovitch at the far end of the table slid gently from his chair to the floor no son of adam in this present imperfect world can mix the hussars champagne with the hussars brandy by five and eight glasses of each without remembering the pit whence he was digged and descending thither the band began to play the tune with which the white hussars from the date of their formation have concluded all their functions they would sooner be disbanded than abandon that tune it is a part of their system the man straightened himself in his chair and drummed on the table with his fingers      illustration he found the springp 91  i dont see why we should entertain lunatics said the colonel call a guard and send him off to the cells well look into the business in the morning give him a glass of wine first though  little mildred filled a sherryglass with the brandy and thrust it over to the man he drank and the tune rose louder and he straightened himself yet more then he put out his longtaloned hands to a piece of plate opposite and fingered it lovingly there was a mystery connected with that piece of plate in the shape of a spring which converted what was a sevenbranched candlestick three springs on each side and one in the middle into a sort of wheelspoke candelabrum he found the spring pressed it and laughed weakly he rose from his chair and inspected a picture on the wall then moved on to another picture the mess watching him without a word when he came to the mantelpiece he shook his head and seemed distressed a piece of plate representing a mounted hussar in full uniform caught his eye he pointed to it and then to the mantelpiece with inquiry in his eyes  what is itoh what is it said little mildred then as a mother might speak to a child that is a horse yes a horse  very slowly came the answer in a thick passionless gutturalyes ihave seen butwhere is the horse  you could have heard the hearts of the mess beating as the men drew back to give the stranger full room in his wanderings there was no question of calling the guard  again he spokevery slowly where is our horse  there is but one horse in the white hussars and his portrait hangs outside the door of the messroom he is the piebald drumhorse the king of the regimental band that served the regiment for sevenandthirty years and in the end was shot for old age half the mess tore the thing down from its place and thrust it into the mans hands he placed it above the mantelpiece it clattered on the ledge as his poor hands dropped it and he staggered towards the bottom of the table falling into mildreds chair then all the men spoke to one another something after this fashion the drumhorse hasnt hung over the mantelpiece since 67 how does he know mildred go and speak to him again colonel what are you going to do oh dry up and give the poor devil a chance to pull himself together it isnt possible anyhow the mans a lunatic  little mildred stood at the colonels side talking in his ear will you be good enough to take your seats please gentlemen he said and the mess dropped into the chairs only dirkovitchs seat next to little mildreds was blank and little mildred himself had found hira singhs place the wideeyed messsergeant filled the glasses in dead silence once more the colonel rose but his hand shook and the port spilled on the table as he looked straight at the man in little mildreds chair and said hoarsely mr vice the queen there was a little pause but the man sprung to his feet and answered without hesitation the queen god bless her and as he emptied the thin glass he snapped the shank between his fingers  long and long ago when the empress of india was a young woman and there were no unclean ideals in the land it was the custom of a few messes to drink the queens toast in broken glass to the vast delight of the messcontractors the custom is now dead because there is nothing to break anything for except now and again the word of a government and that has been broken already  that settles it said the colonel with a gasp hes not a sergeant what in the world is he  the entire mess echoed the word and the volley of questions would have scared any man it was no wonder that the ragged filthy invader could only smile and shake his head  from under the table calm and smiling rose dirkovitch who had been roused from healthful slumber by feet upon his body by the side of the man he rose and the man shrieked and grovelled it was a horrible sight coming so swiftly upon the pride and glory of the toast that had brought the strayed wits together  dirkovitch made no offer to raise him but little mildred heaved him up in an instant it is not good that a gentleman who can answer to the queens toast should lie at the feet of a subaltern of cossacks  the hasty action tore the wretchs upper clothing nearly to the waist and his body was seamed with dry black scars there is only one weapon in the world that cuts in parallel lines and it is neither the cane nor the cat dirkovitch saw the marks and the pupils of his eyes dilated also his face changed he said something that sounded like shto ve takete and the man fawning answered chetyre      illustration it is not good that a gentleman who can answer     to the queens toast should lie at the feet of a subaltern of     cossacksp 94  whats that said everybody together  his number that is number four you know dirkovitch spoke very thickly  what has a queens officer to do with a qualified number said the colonel and an unpleasant growl ran round the table  how can i tell said the affable oriental with a sweet smile he is ahow you have itescaperunaway from over there he nodded towards the darkness of the night  speak to him if hell answer you and speak to him gently said little mildred settling the man in a chair it seemed most improper to all present that dirkovitch should sip brandy as he talked in purring spitting russian to the creature who answered so feebly and with such evident dread but since dirkovitch appeared to understand no one said a word all breathed heavily leaning forward in the long gaps of the conversation the next time that they have no engagements on hand the white hussars intend to go to st petersburg in a body to learn russian  he does not know how many years ago said dirkovitch facing the mess but he says it was very long ago in the war i think that there was an accident he says he was of this glorious and distinguished regiment in the war  the rolls the rolls holmer get the rolls said little mildred and the adjutant dashed off bareheaded to the orderlyroom where the musterrolls of the regiment were kept he returned just in time to hear dirkovitch conclude therefore my dear friends i am most sorry to say there was an accident which would have been reparable if he had apologised to that our colonel which he had insulted  then followed another growl which the colonel tried to beat down the mess was in no mood just then to weigh insults to russian colonels  he does not remember but i think that there was an accident and so he was not exchanged among the prisoners but he was sent to another placehow do you saythe country so he says he came here he does not know how he came eh he was at chepanythe man caught the word nodded and shiveredat zhigansk and irkutsk i cannot understand how he escaped he says too that he was in the forests for many years but how many years he has forgottenthat with many things it was an accident done because he did not apologise to that our colonel ah  instead of echoing dirkovitchs sigh of regret it is sad to record that the white hussars livelily exhibited unchristian delight and other emotions hardly restrained by their sense of hospitality holmer flung the frayed and yellow regimental rolls on the table and the men flung themselves at these  steady fiftysixfiftyfivefiftyfour said holmer here we are lieutenant austin limmason missing that was before sebastopol what an infernal shame insulted one of their colonels and was quietly shipped off thirty years of his life wiped out  but he never apologised said hed see him damned first chorussed the mess  poor chap i suppose he never had the chance afterwards how did he come here said the colonel  the dingy heap in the chair could give no answer  do you know who you are  it laughed weakly  do you know that you are limmasonlieutenant limmason of the white hussars  swiftly as a shot came the answer in a slightly surprised tone yes im limmason of course the light died out in his eyes and the man collapsed watching every motion of dirkovitch with terror a flight from siberia may fix a few elementary facts in the mind but it does not seem to lead to continuity of thought the man could not explain how like a homing pigeon he had found his way to his own old mess again of what he had suffered or seen he knew nothing he cringed before dirkovitch as instinctively as he had pressed the spring of the candlestick sought the picture of the drumhorse and answered to the toast of the queen the rest was a blank that the dreaded russian tongue could only in part remove his head bowed on his breast and he giggled and cowered alternately  the devil that lived in the brandy prompted dirkovitch at this extremely inopportune moment to make a speech he rose swaying slightly gripped the tableedge while his eyes glowed like opals and began  fellowsoldiers glorioustrue friends and hospitables it was an accident and deplorablemost deplorable here he smiled sweetly all round the mess but you will think of this little little thing so little is it not the czar posh i slap my fingersi snap my fingers at him do i believe in him no but in us slav who has done nothing him i believe seventyhow muchmillions peoples that have done nothingnot one thing posh napoleon was an episode he banged a hand on the table hear you old peoples we have done nothing in the worldout here all our work is to do and it shall be done old peoples get away he waved his hand imperiously and pointed to the man you see him he is no good to see he was just one littleoh so littleaccident that no one remembered now he is that so will you be brother soldiers so braveso will you be but you will never come back you will all go where he is gone orhe pointed to the great coffinshadow on the ceiling and muttering seventy millionsget away you old peoples fell asleep  sweet and to the point said little mildred whats the use of getting wroth lets make this poor devil comfortable  but that was a matter suddenly and swiftly taken from the loving hands of the white hussars the lieutenant had returned only to go away again three days later when the wail of the dead march and the tramp of the squadrons told the wondering station who saw no gap in the messtable that an officer of the regiment had resigned his newfound commission  and dirkovitch bland supple and always genial went away too by a night train little mildred and another man saw him off for he was the guest of the mess and even had he smitten the colonel with the open hand the law of that mess allowed no relaxation of hospitality  goodbye dirkovitch and a pleasant journey said little mildred  au revoir said the russian  indeed but we thought you were going home  yes but i will come again my dear friends is that road shut he pointed to where the north star burned over the khyber pass  by jove i forgot of course happy to meet you old man any time you like got everything you want cheroots ice bedding thats all right well au revoir dirkovitch  um said the other man as the taillights of the train grew small ofalltheunmitigated  little mildred answered nothing but watched the north star and hummed a selection from a recent simla burlesque that had much delighted the white hussars it ran      im sorry for mister bluebeard     im sorry to cause him pain     but a terrible spree theres sure to be     when he comes back again  illustration  illustration     the courting of dinah shadd      what did the colonels lady think       nobody never knew     somebody asked the sergeants wife       an she told em true     when you git to a man in the case       theyre like a row o pins     for the colonels lady an judy ogrady       are sisters under their skins                     barrack room ballad   all day i had followed at the heels of a pursuing army engaged on one of the finest battles that ever camp of exercise beheld thirty thousand troops had by the wisdom of the government of india been turned loose over a few thousand square miles of country to practise in peace what they would never attempt in war consequently cavalry charged unshaken infantry at the trot infantry captured artillery by frontal attacks delivered in line of quarter columns and mounted infantry skirmished up to the wheels of an armoured train which carried nothing more deadly than a twentyfive pounder armstrong two nordenfeldts and a few score volunteers all cased in threeeighthsinch boilerplate yet it was a very lifelike camp operations did not cease at sundown nobody knew the country and nobody spared man or horse there was unending cavalry scouting and almost unending forced work over broken ground the army of the south had finally pierced the centre of the army of the north and was pouring through the gap hotfoot to capture a city of strategic importance its front extended fanwise the sticks being represented by regiments strung out along the line of route backwards to the divisional transport columns and all the lumber that trails behind an army on the move on its right the broken left of the army of the north was flying in mass chased by the southern horse and hammered by the southern guns till these had been pushed far beyond the limits of their last support then the flying sat down to rest while the elated commandant of the pursuing force telegraphed that he held all in check and observation  unluckily he did not observe that three miles to his right flank a flying column of northern horse with a detachment of gurkhas and british troops had been pushed round as fast as the failing light allowed to cut across the entire rear of the southern army to break as it were all the ribs of the fan where they converged by striking at the transport reserve ammunition and artillery supplies their instructions were to go in avoiding the few scouts who might not have been drawn off by the pursuit and create sufficient excitement to impress the southern army with the wisdom of guarding their own flank and rear before they captured cities it was a pretty manoeuvre neatly carried out  speaking for the second division of the southern army our first intimation of the attack was at twilight when the artillery were labouring in deep sand most of the escort were trying to help them out and the main body of the infantry had gone on a noahs ark of elephants camels and the mixed menagerie of an indian transport train bubbled and squealed behind the guns when there appeared from nowhere in particular british infantry to the extent of three companies who sprang to the heads of the gunhorses and brought all to a standstill amid oaths and cheers  hows that umpire said the major commanding the attack and with one voice the drivers and limber gunners answered hout while the colonel of artillery sputtered  all your scouts are charging our main body said the major your flanks are unprotected for two miles i think weve broken the back of this division and listenthere go the gurkhas  a weak fire broke from the rearguard more than a mile away and was answered by cheerful howlings the gurkhas who should have swung clear of the second division had stepped on its tail in the dark but drawing off hastened to reach the next line of attack which lay almost parallel to us five or six miles away  our column swayed and surged irresolutelythree batteries the divisional ammunition reserve the baggage and a section of the hospital and bearer corps the commandant ruefully promised to report himself cut up to the nearest umpire and commending his cavalry and all other cavalry to the special care of eblis toiled on to resume touch with the rest of the division  well bivouac here tonight said the major i have a notion that the gurkhas will get caught they may want us to reform on stand easy till the transport gets away  a hand caught my beasts bridle and led him out of the choking dust a larger hand deftly canted me out of the saddle and two of the hugest hands in the world received me sliding pleasant is the lot of the special correspondent who falls into such hands as those of privates mulvaney ortheris and learoyd  an thats all right said the irishman calmly we thought wed find you somewheres here by is there anything av yours in the transport orthrisll fetch ut out  ortheris did fetch ut out from under the trunk of an elephant in the shape of a servant and an animal both laden with medical comforts the little mans eyes sparkled  if the brutil an licentious soldiery av these parts gets sight av the

protect you sorr beer sausage bread soft an thats a curosity soup in a tin whisky by the smell av ut an fowls mother av moses but ye take the field like a confectioner tis scandlus  eres a orficer said ortheris significantly when the sergents done lushin the privit may clean the pot  i bundled several things into mulvaneys haversack before the majors hand fell on my shoulder and he said tenderly requisitioned for the queens service wolseley was quite wrong about special correspondents they are the soldiers best friends come and take potluck with us tonight  and so it happened amid laughter and shoutings that my wellconsidered commissariat melted away to reappear later at the messtable which was a waterproof sheet spread on the ground the flying column had taken three days rations with it and there be few things nastier than government rationsespecially when government is experimenting with german toys erbswurst tinned beef of surpassing tinniness compressed vegetables and meatbiscuits may be nourishing but what thomas atkins needs is bulk in his inside the major assisted by his brother officers purchased goats for the camp and so made the experiment of no effect long before the fatigueparty sent to collect brushwood had returned the men were settled down by their valises kettles and pots had appeared from the surrounding country and were dangling over fires as the kid and the compressed vegetable bubbled together there rose a cheerful clinking of messtins outrageous demands for a little more stuffin with that there liverwing and gust on gust of chaff as pointed as a bayonet and as delicate as a gunbutt  the boys are in a good temper said the major theyll be singing presently well a night like this is enough to keep them happy  over our heads burned the wonderful indian stars which are not all pricked in on one plane but preserving an orderly perspective draw the eye through the velvet darkness of the void up to the barred doors of heaven itself the earth was a gray shadow more unreal than the sky we could hear her breathing lightly in the pauses between the howling of the jackals the movement of the wind in the tamarisks and the fitful mutter of musketryfire leagues away to the left a native woman from some unseen hut began to sing the mailtrain thundered past on its way to delhi and a roosting crow cawed drowsily then there was a beltloosening silence about the fires and the even breathing of the crowded earth took up the story  the men full fed turned to tobacco and songtheir officers with them the subaltern is happy who can win the approval of the musical critics in his regiment and is honoured among the more intricate stepdancers by him as by him who plays cricket cleverly thomas atkins will stand in time of need when he will let a better officer go on alone the ruined tombs of forgotten mussulman saints heard the ballad of agra town the buffalo battery marching to kabul the long long indian day the place where the punkahcoolie died and that crashing chorus which announces      youths daring spirit manhoods fire       firm hand and eagle eye     must he acquire who would aspire       to see the gray boar die  today of all those jovial thieves who appropriated my commissariat and lay and laughed round that waterproof sheet not one remains they went to camps that were not of exercise and battles without empires burmah the soudan and the frontierfever and fighttook them in their time  i drifted across to the mens fires in search of mulvaney whom i found strategically greasing his feet by the blaze there is nothing particularly lovely in the sight of a private thus engaged after a long days march but when you reflect on the exact proportion of the might majesty dominion and power of the british empire which stands on those feet you take an interest in the proceedings  theres a blister bad luck to ut on the heel said mulvaney i cant touch ut prick ut out little man  ortheris took out his housewife eased the trouble with a needle stabbed mulvaney in the calf with the same weapon and was swiftly kicked into the fire  ive bruk the best av my toes over you ye grinnin child av disruption said mulvaney sitting crosslegged and nursing his feet then seeing me oh uts you sorr be welkim an take that maraudin scutts place jock hold him down on the cindhers for a bit  but ortheris escaped and went elsewhere as i took possession of the hollow he had scraped for himself and lined with his greatcoat learoyd on the other side of the fire grinned affably and in a minute fell fast asleep  theres the height av politeness for you said mulvaney lighting his pipe with a flaming branch but jocks eaten half a box av your sardines at wan gulp an i think the tin too whats the best wid you sorr

lucky man  he dropped his head and stared into the fire fingering his moustache the while from the far side of the bivouac the voice of corbetnolan senior subaltern of b company uplifted itself in an ancient and much appreciated song of sentiment the men moaning melodiously behind him      the north wind blew coldly she drooped from that hour     my own little kathleen my sweet little kathleen     kathleen my kathleen kathleen omoore  with fortyfive os in the last word even at that distance you might have cut the soft south irish accent with a shovel  for all we take we must pay but the price

today     the man that hasnt got a horse       must steal one straight away                                  be reverent men remember       this is a gottes haus     du conrad cut along der aisle       and schenck der whisky aus                hans breitmanns ride to church   once upon a time very far from england there lived three men who loved each other so greatly that neither man nor woman could come between them they were in no sense refined nor to be admitted to the outerdoor mats of decent folk because they happened to be private soldiers in her majestys army and private soldiers of our service have small time for selfculture their duty is to keep themselves and their accoutrements specklessly clean to refrain from getting drunk more often than is necessary to obey their superiors and to pray for a war all these things my friends accomplished and of their own motion threw in some fightingwork for which the army regulations did not call their fate sent them to serve in india which is not a golden country though poets have sung otherwise there men die with great swiftness and those who live suffer many and curious things i do not think that my friends concerned themselves much with the social or political aspects of the east they attended a not unimportant war on the northern frontier another one on our western boundary and a third in upper burma then their regiment sat still to recruit and the boundless monotony of cantonment life was their portion they were drilled morning and evening on the same dusty paradeground they wandered up and down the same stretch of dusty white road attended the same church and the same grogshop and slept in the same limewashed barn of a barrack for two long years there was mulvaney the father in the craft who had served with various regiments from bermuda to halifax old in war scarred reckless resourceful and in his pious hours an unequalled soldier to him turned for help and comfort six and a half feet of slowmoving heavyfooted yorkshireman born on the wolds bred in the dales and educated chiefly among the carriers carts at the back of york railwaystation his name was learoyd and his chief virtue an unmitigated patience which helped him to win fights how ortheris a foxterrier of a cockney ever came to be one of the trio is a mystery which even today i cannot explain there was always three av us mulvaney used to say an by the grace av god so long as our service lasts three av us theyll always be tis betther so  they desired no companionship beyond their own and it was evil for any man of the regiment who attempted dispute with them physical argument was out of the question as regarded mulvaney and the yorkshireman and assault on ortheris meant a combined attack from these twaina business which no five men were anxious to have on their hands therefore they flourished sharing their drinks their tobacco and their money good luck and evil battle and the chances of death life and the chances of happiness from calicut in southern to peshawur in northern india  through no merit of my own it was my good fortune to be in a measure admitted to their friendshipfrankly by mulvaney from the beginning sullenly and with reluctance by learoyd and suspiciously by ortheris who held to it that no man not in the army could fraternise with a redcoat like to like said he im a bloomin sodgerhes a bloomin civilian taint naturalthats all  but that was not all they thawed progressively and in the thawing told me more of their lives and adventures than i am ever likely to write  omitting all else this tale begins with the lamentable thirst that was at the beginning of first causes never was such a thirstmulvaney told me so they kicked against their compulsory virtue but the attempt was only successful in the case of ortheris he whose talents were many went forth into the highways and stole a dog from a civilianvidelicet some one he knew not who not in the army now that civilian was but newly connected by marriage with the colonel of the regiment and outcry was made from quarters least anticipated by ortheris and in the end he was forced lest a worse thing should happen to dispose at ridiculously unremunerative rates of as promising a small terrier as ever graced one end of a leading string the purchasemoney was barely sufficient for one small outbreak which led him to the guardroom he escaped however with nothing worse than a severe reprimand and a few hours of punishment drill not for nothing had he acquired the reputation of being the best soldier of his inches in the regiment mulvaney had taught personal cleanliness and efficiency as the first articles of his companions creed a dhirty man he was used to say in the speech of his kind goes to clink for a weakness in the knees an is coortmartialled for a pair av socks missin but a clane man such as is an ornament to his servicea man whose buttons are gold whose coat is wax upon him an whose coutrements are widout a speckthat man may spakin in reason do fwhat he likes an dhrink from day to divil thats the pride av bein dacint  we sat together upon a day in the shade of a ravine far from the barracks where a watercourse used to run in rainy weather behind us was the scrub jungle in which jackals peacocks the gray wolves of the northwestern provinces and occasionally a tiger estrayed from central india were supposed to dwell in front lay the cantonment glaring white under a glaring sun and on either side ran the broad road that led to delhi  it was the scrub that suggested to my mind the wisdom of mulvaney taking a days leave and going upon a shootingtour the peacock is a holy bird throughout india and he who slays one is in danger of being mobbed by the nearest villagers but on the last occasion that mulvaney had gone forth he had contrived without in the least offending local religious susceptibilities to return with six beautiful peacock skins which he sold to profit it seemed just possible then  but fwhat manner av use is ut to me goin out widout a dhrink the grounds powdherdhry underfoot an ut gets unto the throat fit to kill wailed mulvaney looking at me reproachfully an a peacock is not a bird you can catch the tail av onless ye run can a man run on watheran junglewather too  ortheris had considered the question in all its bearings he spoke chewing his pipestem meditatively the while      go forth return in glory     to clusiums royal ome     an round these bloomin temples ang     the bloomin shields o rome  you better go you aint like to shoot yourselfnot while theres a chanst of liquor me an learoydll stay at ome an keep shopcase o anythin turnin up but you go out with a gaspipe gun an ketch the little peacockses or somethin you kin get one days leave easy as winkin go along an get it an get peacockses or somethin  jock said mulvaney turning to learoyd who was half asleep under the shadow of the bank he roused slowly  sitha mulvaney go said he  and mulvaney went cursing his allies with irish fluency and barrackroom point  take note said he when he had won his holiday and appeared dressed in his roughest clothes with the only other regimental fowlingpiece in his hand take note jock an you orthris i am goin in the face av my own willall for to please you i misdoubt anythin will come av permiscuous huntin afther peacockses in a desolit lan an i know that i will lie down an die wid thirrrst me catch peacockses for you ye lazy scuttsan be sacrificed by the peasanthryugh  he waved a huge paw and went away  at twilight long before the appointed hour he returned emptyhanded much begrimed with dirt  peacockses queried ortheris from the safe rest of a barrackroom table whereon he was smoking crosslegged learoyd fast asleep on a bench  jock said mulvaney without answering as he stirred up the sleeper jock can ye fight will ye fight  very slowly the meaning of the words communicated itself to the halfroused man he understoodand againwhat might these things mean mulvaney was shaking him savagely meantime the men in the room howled with delight there was war in the confederacy at lastwar and the breaking of bonds  barrackroom etiquette is stringent on the direct challenge must follow the direct reply this is more binding than the ties of tried friendship once again mulvaney repeated the question learoyd answered by the only means in his power and so swiftly that the irishman had barely time to avoid the blow the laughter around increased learoyd looked bewilderedly at his friendhimself as greatly bewildered ortheris dropped from the table because his world was falling  come outside said mulvaney and as the occupants of the barrackroom prepared joyously to follow he turned and said furiously there will be no fight this nightonless any wan av you is wishful to assist the man that does follows on  no man moved the three passed out into the moonlight learoyd fumbling with the buttons of his coat the paradeground was deserted except for the scurrying jackals mulvaneys impetuous rush carried his companions far into the open ere learoyd attempted to turn round and continue the discussion  be still now twas my fault for beginnin things in the middle av an end jock i should ha comminst wid an explanation but jock dear on your sowl are ye fit think you for the finest fight that iver wasbetther than fightin me considher before ye answer  more than ever puzzled learoyd turned round two or three times felt an arm kicked tentatively and answered ahm fit he was accustomed to fight blindly at the bidding of the superior mind  they sat them down the men looking on from afar and mulvaney untangled himself in mighty words  followin your fools scheme i wint out into the thrackless desert beyond the barricks an there i met a pious hindu dhriving a bullockkyart i tuk ut for granted he wud be delighted for to convoy me a piece an i jumped in  you long lazy blackhaired swine

honust for the sake av the whisky he gave me  but wotll we do with the bloomin article when weve got it them palanquins are as big as ouses an uncommon ard to sell as mcleary said when ye stole the sentrybox from the curragh  whos goin to do t fightin said learoyd and ortheris subsided the three returned to barracks without a word mulvaneys last argument clinched the matter this palanquin was property vendible and to be attained in the simplest and least embarrassing fashion it would eventually become beer great was mulvaney  next afternoon a procession of three formed itself and disappeared into the scrub in the direction of the new railway line learoyd alone was without care for mulvaney dived darkly into the future and little ortheris feared the unknown what befell at that interview in the lonely payshed by the side of the halfbuilt embankment only a few hundred coolies know and their tale is a confusing one running thus  we were at work three men in red coats came they saw the sahibdearsley sahib they made oration and noticeably the small man among the redcoats dearsley sahib also made oration and used many very strong words upon this talk they departed together to an open space and there the fat man in the red coat fought with dearsley sahib after the custom of white menwith his hands making no noise and never at all pulling dearsley sahibs hair such of us as were not afraid beheld these things for just so long a time as a man needs to cook the midday meal the small man in the red coat had possessed himself of dearsley sahibs watch no he did not steal that watch he held it in his hand and at certain seasons made outcry and the twain ceased their combat which was like the combat of young bulls in spring both men were soon all red but dearsley sahib was much more red than the other seeing this and fearing for his lifebecause we greatly loved himsome fifty of us made shift to rush upon the redcoats but a certain manvery black as to the hair and in no way to be confused with the small man or the fat man who foughtthat man we affirm ran upon us and of us he embraced some ten or fifty in both arms and beat our heads together so that our livers turned to water and we ran away it is not good to interfere in the fightings of white men after that dearsley sahib fell and did not rise these men jumped upon his stomach and despoiled him of all his money and attempted to fire the payshed and departed is it true that dearsley sahib makes no complaint of these latter things having been done we were senseless with fear and do not at all remember there was no palanquin near the payshed what do we know about palanquins is it true that dearsley sahib does not return to this place on account of his sickness for ten days this is the fault of those bad men in the red coats who should be severely punished for dearsley sahib is both our father and mother and we love him much yet if dearsley sahib does not return to this place at all we will speak the truth there was a palanquin for the upkeep of which we were forced to pay ninetenths of our monthly wage on such mulctings dearsley sahib allowed us to make obeisance to him before the palanquin what could we do we were poor men he took a full half of our wages will the government repay us those moneys those three men in red coats bore the palanquin upon their shoulders and departed all the money that dearsley sahib had taken from us was in the cushions of that palanquin therefore they stole it thousands of rupees were thereall our money it was our bankbox to fill which we cheerfully contributed to dearsley sahib threesevenths of our monthly wage why does the white man look upon us with the eye of disfavour before god there was a palanquin and now there is no palanquin and if they send the police here to make inquisition we can only say that there never has been any palanquin why should a palanquin be near these works we are poor men and we know nothing  such is the simplest version of the simplest story connected with the descent upon dearsley from the lips of the coolies i received it dearsley himself was in no condition to say anything and mulvaney preserved a massive silence broken only by the occasional licking of the lips he had seen a fight so gorgeous that even his power of speech was taken from him i respected that reserve until three days after the affair i discovered in a disused stable in my quarters a palanquin of unchastened splendourevidently in past days the litter of a queen the pole whereby it swung between the shoulders of the bearers was rich with the painted papiermaché of cashmere the shoulderpads were of yellow silk the panels of the litter itself were ablaze with the loves of all the gods and goddesses of the hindu pantheonlacquer on cedar the cedar sliding doors were fitted with hasps of translucent jaipur enamel and ran in grooves shod with silver the cushions were of brocaded delhi silk and the curtains which once hid any glimpse of the beauty of the kings palace were stiff with gold closer investigation showed that the entire fabric was everywhere rubbed and discoloured by time and wear but even thus it was sufficiently gorgeous to deserve housing on the threshold of a royal zenana i found no fault with it except that it was in my stable then trying to lift it by the silvershod shoulderpole i laughed the road from dearsleys payshed to the cantonment was a narrow and uneven one and traversed by three very inexperienced palanquinbearers one of whom was sorely battered about the head must have been a path of torment still i did not quite recognise the right of the three musketeers to turn me into a fence for stolen property      illustration nine rouns they were even matched an at the     tenthp 157  im askin you to warehouse ut said mulvaney when he was brought to consider the question theres no steal in ut dearsley tould us we cud have ut if we fought jock foughtan oh sorr when the throuble was at uts finest an jock was bleedin like a stuck pig an little orthris was shquealin on one leg chewin big bites out av dearsleys watch i wud ha given my place at the fight to have had you see wan round he tuk jock as i suspicioned he would an jock was deceptive nine rouns they were even matched an at the tenth about that palanquin now theres not the least throuble in the world or we wud not ha brought ut here you will ondherstand that the queengod bless herdoes not reckon for a privit soldier to kape elephints an palanquins an sich in barricks afther we had dhragged ut down from dearsleys through that cruel scrub that near broke orthriss heart we set ut in the ravine for a night an a thief av a porcupine an a civetcat av a jackal roosted in ut as well we knew in the mornin i put ut to you sorr is an elegint palanquin fit for the princess the natural abidin place av all the vermin in cantonmints we brought ut to you afther dhark and put ut in your shtable do not let your conscience prick think av the rejoicin men in the payshed yonderlookin at dearsley wid his head tied up in a towelan well knowin that they can dhraw their pay ivry month widout stoppages for riffles indirectly sorr you have rescued from an onprincipled son av a nighthawk the peasanthry av a numerous village an besides will i let that sedanchair rot on our hands not i tis not every day a piece av pure joolry comes into the market theres not a king widin these forty mileshe waved his hand round the dusty horizonnot a king wud not be glad to buy ut some day mesilf whin i have leisure ill take ut up along the road an dishpose av ut  how said i for i knew the man was capable of anything  get into ut av coorse and keep wan eye open through the curtains whin i see a likely man av the native persuasion i will descind blushin from my canopy and say buy a palanquin ye black scutt i will have to hire four men to carry me first though and thats impossible till next payday  curiously enough learoyd who had fought for the prize and in the winning secured the highest pleasure life had to offer him was altogether disposed to undervalue it while ortheris openly said it would be better to break the thing up dearsley he argued might be a manysided man capable despite his magnificent fighting qualities of setting in motion the machinery of the civil lawa thing much abhorred by the soldier under any circumstances their fun had come and passed the next payday was close at hand when there would be beer for all wherefore longer conserve the painted palanquin  a firstclass rifleshot an a good little man av your inches you are said mulvaney but you niver had a head worth a softboiled egg tis me has to lie awake av nights schamin an plottin for the three av us orthris me son tis no matther av a few gallons av beerno nor twenty gallonsbut tubs an vats an firkins in that sedanchair who ut was an what ut was an how ut got there we do not know but i know in my bones that you an me an jock wid his sprained thumb will get a fortune thereby lave me alone an let me think  meantime the palanquin stayed in my stall the key of which was in mulvaneys hands  payday came and with it beer it was not in experience to hope that mulvaney dried by four weeks drought would avoid excess next morning he and the palanquin had disappeared he had taken the precaution of getting three days leave to see a friend on the railway and the colonel well knowing that the seasonal outburst was near and hoping it would spend its force beyond the limits of his jurisdiction cheerfully gave him all he demanded at this point mulvaneys history as recorded in the messroom stopped  ortheris carried it not much further no e wasnt drunk said the little man loyally the liquor was no more than feelin its way round inside of im but e went an filled that ole bloomin palanquin with bottles fore e went off es gone an ired six men to carry im an i ad to elp im into is nupshal couch cause e wouldnt ear reason es gone off in is shirt an trousies swearin tremenjusgone down the road in the palanquin wavin is legs out o windy  yes said i but where  now you arx me a question e said e was goin to sell that palanquin but from observations what happened when i was stuffin im through the door i fancy es gone to the new embankment to mock at dearsley soon as jocks off duty im goin there to see if es safenot mulvaney but tother man my saints but i pity im as elps terence out o the palanquin when es once fair drunk  hell come back without harm i said  corse e will ony question is whatll e be doin on the road killing dearsley like as not e shouldnt a gone without jock or me  reinforced by learoyd ortheris sought the foreman of the cooliegang dearsleys head was still embellished with towels mulvaney drunk or sober would have struck no man in that condition and dearsley indignantly denied that he would have taken advantage of the intoxicated brave  i had my pick o you two he explained to learoyd and you got my palanquinnot before id made my profit on it whyd i do harm when everythings settled your man did come heredrunk as davys sow on a frosty nightcame apurpose to mock mestuck his head out of the door an called me a crucified hodman i made him drunker an sent him along but i never touched him  to these things learoyd slow to perceive the evidences of sincerity answered only if owt comes to mulvaaney long o you ill gripple you clouts or no clouts on your ugly head an ill draw t throat twistyways man see there now  the embassy removed itself and dearsley the battered laughed alone over his supper that evening  three days passeda fourth and a fifth the week drew to a close and mulvaney did not return he his royal palanquin and his six attendants had vanished into air a very large and very tipsy soldier his feet sticking out of the litter of a reigning princess is not a thing to travel along the ways without comment yet no man of all the country round had seen any such wonder he was and he was not and learoyd suggested the immediate smashment of dearsley as a sacrifice to his ghost ortheris insisted that all was well and in the light of past experience his hopes seemed reasonable  when mulvaney goes up the road said he es like to go a very long ways up specially when es so blue drunk as e is now but what gits me is is not bein eard of pullin wool off the niggers somewheres about that dont look good the drink must ha died out in im by this unless es broke a bank an thenwhy dont e come back e didnt ought to ha gone off without us  even ortheriss heart sank at the end of the seventh day for half the regiment were out scouring the countryside and learoyd had been forced to fight two men who hinted openly that mulvaney had deserted to do him justice the colonel laughed at the notion even when it was put forward by his muchtrusted adjutant  mulvaney would as soon think of deserting as you would said he no hes either fallen into a mischief among the villagersand yet that isnt likely for hed blarney himself out of the pit or else he is engaged on urgent private affairssome stupendous devilment that we shall hear of at mess after it has been the round of the barrackrooms the worst of it is that i shall have to give him twentyeight days confinement at least for being absent without leave just when i most want him to lick the new batch of recruits into shape i never knew a man who could put a polish on young soldiers as quickly as mulvaney can how does he do it  with blarney and the buckleend of a belt sir said the adjutant he is worth a couple of noncommissioned officers when we are dealing with an irish draft and the london lads seem to adore him the worst of it is that if he goes to the cells the other two are neither to hold nor to bind till he comes out again i believe ortheris preaches mutiny on those occasions and i know that the mere presence of learoyd mourning for mulvaney kills all the cheerfulness of his room the sergeants tell me that he allows no man to laugh when he feels unhappy they are a queer gang  for all that i wish we had a few more of them i like a wellconducted regiment but these pastyfaced shiftyeyed mealymouthed young slouchers from the depot worry me sometimes with their offensive virtue they dont seem to have backbone enough to do anything but play cards and prowl round the married quarters i believe id forgive that old villain on the spot if he turned up with any sort of explanation that i could in decency accept  not likely to be much difficulty about that sir said the adjutant mulvaneys explanations are only one degree less wonderful than his performances they say that when he was in the black tyrone before he came to us he was discovered on the banks of the liffey trying to sell his colonels charger to a donegal dealer as a perfect ladys hack shackbolt commanded the tyrone then  shackbolt must have had apoplexy at the thought of his ramping warhorses answering to that description he used to buy unbacked devils and tame them on some pet theory of starvation what did mulvaney say  that he was a member of the society for the prevention of cruelty to animals anxious to sell the poor baste where he would get something to fill out his dimples shackbolt laughed but i fancy that was why mulvaney exchanged to ours  i wish he were back said the colonel for i like him and believe he likes me  that evening to cheer our souls learoyd ortheris and i went into the waste to smoke out a porcupine all the dogs attended but even their clamourand they began to discuss the shortcomings of porcupines before they left cantonmentscould not take us out of ourselves a large low moon turned the tops of the plumegrass to silver and the stunted camelthorn bushes and sour tamarisks into the likenesses of trooping devils the smell of the sun had not left the earth and little aimless winds blowing across the rosegardens to the southward brought the scent of dried roses and water our fire once started and the dogs craftily disposed to wait the dash of the porcupine we climbed to the top of a rainscarred hillock of earth and looked across the scrub seamed with cattle paths white with the long grass and dotted with spots of level pondbottom where the snipe would gather in winter  this said ortheris with a sigh as he took in the unkempt desolation of it all this is sanguinary this is unusually sanguinary sort o mad country like a grate when the fires put out by the sun he shaded his eyes against the moonlight an theres a loony dancin in the middle of it all quite right id dance too if i wasnt so downheart  there pranced a portent in the face of the moona huge and ragged spirit of the waste that flapped its wings from afar it had risen out of the earth it was coming towards us and its outline was never twice the same the toga tablecloth or dressinggown whatever the creature wore took a hundred shapes once it stopped on a neighbouring mound and flung all its legs and arms

wallow and as a bull bellows so he after a short minute at gaze gave tongue to the stars  mulvaaney mulvaaney ahoo  oh then it was that we yelled and the figure dipped into the hollow till with a crash of rending grass the lost one strode up to the light of the fire and disappeared to the waist in a wave of joyous dogs then learoyd and ortheris gave greeting bass and falsetto together both swallowing a lump in the throat      illustration there pranced a portent in the face of the     moonp 166  you damned fool said they and severally pounded him with their fists  go easy he answered wrapping a huge arm round each i would have you to know that i am a god to be treated as suchtho by my faith i fancy ive got to go to the guardroom just like a privit soldier  the latter part of the sentence destroyed the suspicions raised by the former any one would have been justified in regarding mulvaney as mad he was hatless and shoeless and his shirt and trousers were dropping off him but he wore one wondrous garmenta gigantic cloak that fell from collarbone to heelof pale pink silk wrought all over in cunningest needlework of hands long since dead with the loves of the hindu gods the monstrous figures leaped in and out of the light of the fire as he settled the folds round him  ortheris handled the stuff respectfully for a moment while i was trying to remember where i had seen it before then he screamed what ave you done with the palanquin youre wearin the linin  i am said the irishman an by the same token the broidery is scrapin my hide off ive lived in this sumpshus counterpane for four days me son i begin to ondherstand why the naygur is no use widout me boots an me trousies like an openwork stocking on a gyurls leg at a dance i begin to feel like a naygurmanall fearful an timoreous give me a pipe an ill tell on  he lit a pipe resumed his grip of his two friends and rocked to and fro in a gale of laughter  mulvaney said ortheris sternly taint no time for laughin youve given jock an me more trouble than youre worth you ave been absent without leave an youll go into cells for that an you ave come back disgustinly dressed an most improper in the linin o that bloomin palanquin instid of which you laugh an we thought you was dead all the time  bhoys said the culprit still shaking gently whin ive done my tale you may cry if you like an little orthris here can thrample my inside out ha done an listen my performinces have been stupenjus my luck has been the blessed luck av the british armyan theres no betther than that i went out dhrunk an dhrinkin in the palanquin and i have come back a pink god did any of you go to dearsley afther my time was up he was at the bottom of ut all  ah said so murmured learoyd tomorrow ahll smash t face in upon his heead  ye will not dearsleys a jool av a man afther ortheris had put me into the palanquin an the six bearermen were gruntin down the road i tuk thought to mock dearsley for that fight so i tould thim go to the embankmint and there bein most amazin full i shtuck my head out av the concern an passed compliments wid dearsley i must ha miscalled him outrageous for whin i am that way the power av the tongue comes on me i can bare remimber tellin him that his mouth opened endways like the mouth av a skate which was thrue afther learoyd had handled ut an i clear remimber his takin no manner nor matter av offence but givin me a big dhrink of beer twas the beer did the thrick for i crawled back into the palanquin steppin on me right ear wid me left foot an thin i slept like the dead wanst i half roused an begad the noise in my head was tremenjusroarin and rattlin an poundin such as was quite new to me mother av mercy thinks i phwat a concertina i will have on my shoulders whin i wake an wid that i curls mysilf up to sleep before ut should get hould on me bhoys that noise was not dhrink twas the rattle av a thrain  there followed an impressive pause  yes he had put me on a thrainput me palanquin an all an six black assassins av his own coolies that was in his nefarious confidence on the flat av a ballastthruck and we were rowlin an bowlin along to benares glory be that i did not wake up thin an introjuce mysilf to the coolies as i was sayin i slept for the betther part av a day an a night but remimber you that that man dearsley had packed me off on wan av his materialthrains to benares all for to make me overstay my leave an get me into the cells  the explanation was an eminently rational one benares lay at least ten hours by rail from the cantonments and nothing in the world could have saved mulvaney from arrest as a deserter had he appeared there in the apparel of his orgies dearsley had not forgotten to take revenge learoyd drawing back a little began to play soft blows over selected portions of mulvaneys body his thoughts were away on the embankment and they meditated evil for dearsley mulvaney continued  whin i was full awake the palanquin was set down in a street i suspicioned for i cud hear people passin an talkin but i knew well i was far from home there is a queer smell upon our cantonmentsa smell av dried earth and brickkilns wid whiffs av cavalry stablelitter this place smelt marigold flowers an bad water an wanst somethin alive came an blew heavy with his muzzle at the chink av the shutter its in a village i am thinks i to mysilf an the parochial buffalo is investigatin the palanquin but anyways i had no desire to move only lie still whin youre in foreign parts an the standin luck av the british army will carry ye through that is an epigram i made ut  thin a lot av whishperin divils surrounded the palanquin take ut up sez wan man but wholl pay us sez another the maharanees minister av coorse sez the man oho sez i to mysilf im a quane in me own right wid a minister to pay me expenses ill be an emperor if i lie still long enough but this is no village ive found i lay quiet but i gummed me right eye to a crack av the shutters an i saw that the whole street was crammed wid palanquins an horses an a sprinklin av naked priests all yellow powder an tigers tails but i may tell you orthris an you learoyd that av all the palanquins ours was the most imperial an magnificent now a palanquin means a native lady all the world over except whin a soldier av the quane happens to be takin a ride women an priests sez i your fathers son is in the right pew this time terence there will be proceedins six black divils in pink muslin tuk up the palanquin an oh but the rowlin an the rockin made me sick thin we got fair jammed among the palanquinsnot more than fifty av theman we grated an bumped like queenstown potatosmacks in a runnin tide i cud hear the women gigglin and squirkin in their palanquins but mine was the royal equipage they made way for ut an begad the pink muslin men o mine were howlin room for the maharanee av gokralseetarun do you know aught av the lady sorr  yes said i she is a very estimable old queen of the central indian states and they say she is fat how on earth could she go to benares without all the city knowing her palanquin  twas the eternal foolishness av the naygurman they saw the palanquin lying loneful an forlornsome an the beauty av ut after dearsleys men had dhropped ut and gone away an they gave ut the best name that occurred to thim quite right too for aught we know the ould lady was thravellin incoglike me im glad to hear shes fat i was no light weight mysilf an my men were mortial anxious to dhrop me under a great big archway promiscuously ornamented wid the most improper carvins an cuttins i iver saw begad they made me blushlike alike a maharanee  the temple of prithidevi i murmured remembering the monstrous horrors of that sculptured archway at benares  pretty devilskins savin your presence sorr there was nothin pretty about ut except me twas all half dhark an whin the coolies left they shut a big black gate behind av us an half a company av fat yellow priests began pullyhaulin the palanquins into a dharker place yeta big stone hall full av pillars an gods an incense an all manner av similar thruck the gate disconcerted me for i perceived i wud have to go forward to get out my retreat bein cut off by the same token a good priest makes a bad palanquincoolie begad they nearly turned me inside out draggin the palanquin to the temple now the disposishin av the forces inside was this way the maharanee av gokralseetarunthat was melay by the favour av providence on the far left flank behind the dhark av a pillar carved with elephints heads the remainder av the palanquins was in a big half circle facing in to the biggest fattest an most amazin shegod that iver i dreamed av her head ran up into the black above us an her feet stuck out in the light av a little fire av melted butter that a priest was feedin out av a butterdish thin a man began to sing an play on somethin back in the dhark an twas a queer song ut made my hair lift on the back av my neck thin the doors av all the palanquins slid back an the women bundled out i saw what ill niver see again twas more glorious than thransformations at a pantomime for they was in pink an blue an silver an red an grass green wid dimonds an imralds an great red rubies all over thim but that was the least part av the glory o bhoys they were more lovely than the like av any loveliness in hiven ay their little bare feet were better than the white hands av a lords lady an their mouths were like puckered roses an their eyes were bigger an dharker than the eyes av any livin women ive seen ye may laugh but im speakin truth i niver saw the like an niver i will again  seeing that in all probability you were watching the wives and daughters of most of the kings of india the chances are that you wont i said for it was dawning on me that mulvaney had stumbled upon a big queens praying at benares  i niver will he said mournfully that sight doesnt come twist to any man it made me ashamed to watch a fat priest knocked at my door i didnt think hed have the insolince to disturb the maharanee av gokralseetarun so i lay still the old cows asleep sez he to another let her be sez that twill be long before she has a calf i might ha known before he spoke that all a woman prays for in injiaan for matter o that in england toois childher that made me more sorry id come me bein as you well know a childless man  he was silent for a moment thinking of his little son dead many years ago  they prayed an the butterfires blazed up an the incense turned everything blue an between that an the fires the women looked as tho they were all ablaze an twinklin they took hold av the shegods knees they cried out an they threw themselves about an that worldwithoutendamen music was dhrivin thim mad mother av hiven how they cried an the ould shegod grinnin above thim all so scornful the dhrink was dyin out in me fast an i was thinkin harder than the thoughts wud go through my headthinkin how to get out an all manner of nonsense as well the women were rockin in rows their dimond belts clickin an the tears runnin out betune their hands an the lights were goin lower an dharker thin there was a blaze like lightnin from the roof an that showed me the inside av the palanquin an at the end where my foot was stood the livin spit an image o mysilf worked on the linin this man here ut was  he hunted in the folds of his pink cloak ran a hand under one and thrust into the firelight a footlong embroidered presentment of the great god krishna playing on a flute the heavy jowl the staring eye and the blueblack moustache of the god made up a faroff resemblance to mulvaney  the blaze was gone in a wink but the whole schame came to me thin i believe i was mad too i slid the offshutter open an rowled out into the dhark behind the elephinthead pillar tucked up my trousies to my knees slipped off my boots an tuk a general hould av all the pink linin av the palanquin glory be ut ripped out like a womans dhriss when you tread on ut at a sergeants ball an a bottle came with ut i tuk the bottle an the next minut i was out av the dhark av the pillar the pink linin wrapped round me most graceful the music thunderin like kettledrums an a could draft blowin round my bare legs by this hand that did ut i was krishna tootlin on the flutethe god that the rigmental chaplain talks about a sweet sight i must ha looked i knew my eyes were big and my face was waxwhite an at the worst i must ha looked like a ghost but they took me for the livin god the music stopped and the women were dead dumb an i crooked my legs like a shepherd on a china basin an i did the ghostwaggle with my feet as i had done ut at the rigmental theatre many times an i slid acrost the width av that temple in front av the shegod tootlin on the beer bottle  wot did you toot demanded ortheris the practical      illustration i was krishna tootlin on the flutep 176  me oh mulvaney sprang up suiting the action to the word and sliding gravely in front of us a dilapidated but imposing deity in the half light i sang      only say     youll be mrs brallaghan     dont say nay     charmin judy callaghan  i didnt know me own voice when i sang an oh twas pitiful to see the women the darlins were down on their faces whin i passed the last wan i cud see her poor little fingers workin one in another as if she wanted to touch my feet so i dhrew the tail av this pink overcoat over her head for the greater honour an i slid into the dhark on the other side av the temple and fetched up in the arms av a big fat priest all i wanted was to get away clear so i tuk him by his greasy throat an shut the speech out av him out sez i which way ye fat heathenoh sez he man sez i white man soldier man common soldier man where in the name av confusion is the back door the women in the temple were still on their faces an a young priest was holdin out his arms above their heads  this way sez my fat friend duckin behind a big bullgod an divin into a passage thin i remimbered that i must ha made the miraculous reputation av that temple for the next fifty years not so fast i sez an i held out both my hands wid a wink that ould thief smiled like a father i tuk him by the back av the neck in case he should be wishful to put a knife into me unbeknowst an i ran him up an down the passage twice to collect his sensibilities

railway fare im far from my home an ive done you a service bhoys tis a good thing to be a priest the ould man niver throubled himself to dhraw from a bank as i will prove to you subsequint he philandered all round the slack av his clothes an began dribblin tenrupee notes old gold mohurs and rupees into my hand till i could hould no more  you lie said ortheris youre mad or sunstrook a native dont give coin unless you cut it out o im taint nature  then my lie an my sunstroke is concealed under that lump av sod yonder retorted mulvaney unruffled nodding across the scrub an theres a dale more in nature than your squidgy little legs have iver taken you to orthris me son four hundred an thirtyfour rupees by my reckonin an a big fat gold necklace that i took from him as a remimbrancer was our share in that business  an e give it you for love said ortheris  we were alone in that passage maybe i was a trifle too pressin but considher fwhat i had done for the good av the temple and the iverlastin joy av those women twas cheap at the price i wud ha taken more if i cud ha found ut i turned the ould man upside down at the last but he was milked dhry thin he opened a door in another passage an i found mysilf up to my knees in benares riverwater an bad smellin ut is more by token i had come out on the riverline close to the burnin ghat and contagious to a cracklin corpse this was in the heart av the night for i had been four hours in the temple there was a crowd av boats tied up so i tuk wan an wint across the river thin i came home acrost country lyin up by day  how on earth did you manage i said  how did sir frederick roberts get from cabul to candahar he marched an he niver tould how near he was to breakin down thats why he is fwhat he is an now mulvaney yawned portentously now i will go an give myself up for absince widout leave its eightantwenty days an the rough end of the colonels tongue in orderlyroom any way you look at ut but tis cheap at the price  mulvaney said i softly if there happens to be any sort of excuse that the colonel can in any way accept i have a notion that youll get nothing more than the dressingdown the new recruits are in and  not a word more sorr is ut excuses the old man wants tis not my way but he shall have thim ill tell him i was engaged in financial operations connected wid a church and he flapped his way

moonlight we could hear the refrain      bang upon the big drum bash upon the cymbals     as we go marchin along boys oh     for although in this campaign     theres no whisky nor champagne     well keep our spirits goin with a song boys  therewith he surrendered himself to the joyful and almost weeping guard and was made much of by his fellows but to the colonel he said that he had been smitten with sunstroke and had lain insensible on a villagers cot for untold hours and between laughter and goodwill the affair was smoothed over so that he could next day teach the new recruits how to fear

mulvaney had and attached serious importance to it while ortheris babbled with his head on his arms mulvaney whispered to me  hes always tuk this way whin hes been checked overmuch by the childher they make sarjints nowadays that an havin nothin to do i cant make ut out anyways  well what does it matter let him talk himself through  ortheris began singing a parody of the ramrod corps full of cheerful allusions to battle murder and sudden death he looked out across the river as he sang and his face was quite strange to me mulvaney caught me by the elbow to ensure attention  matther it

mulvaneys anxiety he seemed to be trying to coax ortheris out of the fit for he shouted down the bank where the boy was lying  listen now you wid the pore pink toes an the glasseyes did you shwim the irriwaddy at night behin me as a bhoy shud or were you hidin under a bed as you was at ahmid kheyl  this was at once a gross insult and a direct lie and mulvaney meant it to bring on a fight but ortheris seemed shut up in some sort of trance he answered slowly without a sign of irritation in the same cadenced voice as he had used for his firingparty orders  hi swum the irriwaddy in the night

regment and mulvaney wired together theres the widder sittin at ome with a gold crownd on er ead and ere am hi stanley orthris the widders property a rottin fool  his voice rose at the end of the sentence and he wound up with a sixshot anglovernacular oath mulvaney said nothing but looked at me as if he expected that i could bring peace to poor ortheriss troubled brain  i remembered once at rawal pindi having seen a man nearly mad with drink sobered by being made a fool of some regiments may know what i mean i hoped that we might slake off ortheris in the same way though he was perfectly sober so i said  whats the use of grousing there and speaking against the widow  i didnt said ortheris selp me gawd i never said a word agin er an i wouldntnot if i was to desert this minute  here was my opening well you meant to anyhow whats the use of crackingon for nothing would you slip it now if you got the chance  ony try me said ortheris jumping to his feet as if he had been stung  mulvaney jumped too fwhat are you going to do said he  help ortheris down to bombay or karachi whichever he likes you can report that he separated from you before tiffin and left his gun on the bank here  im to report thatam i said mulvaney slowly very well if orthris manes to desert now and will desert now an you sorr who have been a frind to me an to him will help him to ut i terence mulvaney on my oath which ive never bruk yet will report as you say but here he stepped up to ortheris and shook the stock of the fowlingpiece in his faceyour fistes help you stanley orthris if ever i come across you agin  i dont care said ortheris im sick o this dorgs life give me a chanst dont play with me le me go  strip said i and change with me and then ill tell you what to do  i hoped that the absurdity of this would check ortheris but he had kicked off his ammunitionboots and got rid of his tunic almost before i had loosed my shirtcollar mulvaney gripped me by the arm  the fits on him the fits workin on him still by my honour and sowl we shall be accessiry to a desartion yet only twentyeight days as you say sorr or fiftysix but think o the shamethe black shame to him an me i had never seen mulvaney so excited  but ortheris was quite calm and as soon as he had exchanged clothes with me and i stood up a private of the line he said shortly now come on what nex dye mean fair what must i do to get out o this ere ahell  i told him that if he would wait for two or three hours near the river i would ride into the station and come back with one hundred rupees he would with that money in his pocket walk to the nearest sidestation on the line about five miles away and would there take a firstclass ticket for karachi knowing that he had no money on him when he went out shooting his regiment would not immediately wire to the seaports but would hunt for him in the native villages near the river further no one would think of seeking a deserter in a firstclass carriage at karachi he was to buy white clothes and ship if he could on a cargosteamer  here he broke in if i helped him to karachi he would arrange all the rest then i ordered him to wait where he was until it was dark enough for me to ride into the station without my dress being noticed now god in his wisdom has made the heart of the british soldier who is very often an unlicked ruffian as soft as the heart of a little child in order that he may believe in and follow his officers into tight and nasty places he does not so readily come to believe in a civilian but when he does he believes implicitly and like a dog i had had the honour of the friendship of private ortheris at intervals for more than three years and we had dealt with each other as man by man consequently he considered that all my words were true and not spoken lightly  mulvaney and i left him in the high grass near the riverbank and went away still keeping to the high grass towards my horse the shirt scratched me horribly      illustration we set off at the double and found him plunging     about wildly through the grassp 201  we waited nearly two hours for the dusk to fall and allow me to ride off we spoke of ortheris in whispers and strained our ears to catch any sound from the spot where we had left him but we heard nothing except the wind in the plumegrass  ive bruk his head said mulvaney earnestly time an agin ive nearly kilt him wid the belt an yet i cant knock thim fits out av his soft head no an hes not soft for hes reasonable an likely by natur fwhat is ut is ut his breedin which is nothin or his edukashin which he niver got you that think ye know things answer me that  but i found no answer i was wondering how long ortheris in the bank of the river would hold out and whether i should be forced to help him to desert as i had given my word  just as the dusk shut down and with a very heavy heart i was beginning to saddle up my horse we heard wild shouts from the river  the devils had departed from private stanley ortheris no 22639 b company the loneliness the dusk and the waiting had driven them out as i had hoped we set off at the double and found him plunging about wildly through the grass with his coat offmy coat off i mean he was calling for us like a madman  when we reached him he was dripping with perspiration and trembling like a startled horse we had great difficulty in soothing him he complained that he was in civilian kit and wanted to tear my clothes off his body i ordered him to strip and we made a second exchange as quickly as possible  the rasp of his own grayback shirt and the squeak of his boots seemed to bring him to himself he put his hands before his eyes and said  wot was it i aint mad i aint sunstrook an ive bin an gone an said an bin an gone an done wot ave i bin an done  fwhat have you done said mulvaney youve dishgraced yourselfthough thats no matter youve dishgraced b compny an worst av all youve dishgraced me me that taught you how for to walk abroad like a manwhin you was a dhirty little fishbacked little whimperin little recruity as you are now stanley orthris  ortheris said nothing for a while then he unslung his belt heavy with the badges of halfadozen regiments that his own had lain with and handed it over to mulvaney  im too little for to mill you mulvaney said he an youve strook me before but you can take an cut me in two with this ere if you like  mulvaney turned to me  lave me to talk to him sorr said mulvaney  i left and on my way home thought a good deal over ortheris in particular and my friend private thomas atkins whom i love
