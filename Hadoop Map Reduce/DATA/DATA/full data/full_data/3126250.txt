3126250	the rover boys on treasure isle  or the strange cruise of the steam yacht  by  edward stratemeyer  1909        introduction  my dear boys this is a complete tale in itself but forms the thirteenth volume of the rover boys series for young americans  this line of books was started some ten years ago with the publication of the first three volumes the rover boys at school   the rover boys on the ocean and the rover boys in the jungle at that time i thought to end the series with a fourth volume provided the readers wanted another but with the publication of the rover boys out west came a cry for more and so i added on the great lakes in the mountains in camp on land and sea on the river on the plains in southern waters and on the farm where we last left our friends  for a number of years tom dick and sam have attended a military academy but now their school days at putnam hall are at an end and we find them getting ready to go to college but before leaving home for the higher seat of learning they take a remarkable cruise on a steam yacht searching for an island upon which it is said a large treasure is hidden they are accompanied on this trip by their father and a number of friends and have several adventures somewhat out of the ordinary and also a good bit of fun for there is bound to be fun when tom rover is around they lose themselves and lose their yacht and once some of them come pretty close to losing their lives but in the endwell the story will tell the rest  i cannot close without again thanking my many friends for all the nice things they have said about the rover boys stories and the putnam hall stories i trust the present volume will fulfill every fair expectation  affectionately and sincerely yours edward stratemeyer     contents       i

sam rover as he crossed the depot platform on the run where is tom  he went ahead to get two good seats for us answered dick rover he looked around the crowd that had gathered to take the train hi there songbird this way come in this car hans  say arent you fellows coming aboard came a voice from the nearest car and a curlytopped head with a pair of laughing eyes appeared folks crowding in to beat the band come on in if you want seats  well be in directly answered sam and followed his brother dick to the car steps here there was quite a jam and the rover boys had all they could do to get into the car followed by half a dozen of their school chums but tom rover had managed to keep seats for all and they sat in a bunch much to their satisfaction then the train rolled out of the station and the journey homeward was begun  the term at putnam hall military academy was at an end and the school days of the three rover boys at that institution were now a thing of the past each had graduated with honors yet all were a trifle sad to think that there would be no going back to a place where they had made so many friends  its almost like giving up your home dick had said several times while at the actual parting sam had had to do his best to keep back the tears which welled up in his eyes even funloving tom had stopped a good deal of his whistling and had looked unusually sober  well never have such good times as weve had at putnam hall sam had said but he was mistaken as later events proved  the three rover boys did not wish to part from their many school chums yet they were more than anxious to get home and for this there was a very good reason their father had told them that he had a very important communication to make to them one regarding how the summer was to be spent so far no arrangements had been made for the vacation and the brothers were anxious to know what was in the wind as tom expressed it  maybe we are to prepare for college said dick  perhaps we are to go on another trip to africa added sam  or start on a hunt for the north pole put in tom that would be just the thing for this hot weather  i can tell you one thing went on dick whatever father has on his mind is of a serious nature it is no mere outing for pleasure  i know that answered sam i could see it by the look on his face  well well know all about it by this time tomorrow said tom i hope it is some tripi love to travel and his brothers nodded their heads in approval  to those who have read any of the twelve previous volumes in this rover boys series the three brothers will need no special introduction for the benefit of new readers allow me to state that dick was the oldest funloving tom next and sam the youngest they were the sons of anderson rover a widower and rich mine owner the father was a great traveler and for years the boys had made their home with their uncle randolph rover and their aunt martha on a farm called valley brook in the heart of new york state  from the farm and while their father was in africa the boys had been sent to putnam hall as related in the first volume of this series entitled the rover boys at school at the hall they made a score of friends and several enemies some of which will be introduced later a term at school was followed by a trip on the ocean and then one into the jungles of the dark continent in search of mr rover who had mysteriously disappeared then the rover boys went out west and to the great lakes and later spent a fine time hunting in the mountains they likewise spent some time in camp with their fellow cadets and during the summer vacation took a long trip on land and sea then they returned home and during another vacation sailed down the ohio river in a houseboat spent some time on the plains took an unexpected trip to southern waters and then came back to the farm  on getting back home as related in the twelfth volume of this series called the rover boys on the farm the boys had imagined that adventures for them were a thing of the past they were willing to take it easy but this was not to be some bad men including a sharper named sid merrick were responsible for the theft of some freight from the local railroad and merrick by a slick trick obtained possession of some traction company bonds belonging to randolph rover the rover boys managed to locate the freight thieves but sid merrick got away from them dropping a pocketbook containing the traction company bonds in his flight this was at a time when dick tom and sam had returned to putnam hall for their final term at that institution at the hall they had made a bitter enemy of a big stocky bully named tad sobber and of another lad named nick pell tad sobber to get even with the rovers for a fancied injury sent to the latter a box containing a live poisonous snake the snake got away and hid in nick pells desk and nick was bitten and for some time it was feared that he might die he exposed tad sobber and fearing arrest the bully ran away from the hall later much to their surprise the rover boys learned that the bully was a ward and nephew of sid merrick and when the sharper disappeared tad sobber went with him  they are certainly a bad pair said dick but how bad the rovers were still to find out  with the boys on the train were john powell better known as songbird because he had a habit of reciting newly made doggerell which he called poetry hans mueller a german youth who frequently got his english badly twisted fred garrison who had graduated with the rovers and some others  dick you havent told me yet what you intended to do this summer remarked fred garrison as the train rolled on  because i dont know fred answered the elder rover my father has something in store but i dont know what it is  cant you guess  no  i wish we could take another trip like that on the houseboatit was certainly a dandy  the best ever put in tom even if we did have trouble with lew flapp dan baxter and some others  speaking of dan baxter puts me in mind of something came from songbird powell it has just leaked out that tad sobber sent a note to captain putnam in which tad blamed some of the cadets for his troubles and said he was going to get square some day  did he mention any names questioned sam  yes  mine  yesand dicks and toms too  it is just like sobberto blame his troubles on somebody else remarked dick  i am not afraid of him declared tom he had better keep his distance unless he wants to get the worst of it we used to put up with a whole lot from dan baxter before he reformedi am not going to put up with as much from sobber  tad certainly went off in bad company said sam his uncle ought to be in prison this minute  have the authorities heard anything of merrick asked songbird  not a thing  i dink me dot feller has skipped to europe alretty vouchsafed hans mueller he vould peen afraid to stay py der united states in yah and the german boy shook his head wisely  personally i never want to set eyes on sobber again said dick with a shrug of his broad shoulders the idea of introducing that deadly snake into the school was the limit why half a dozen of us might have been bitten instead of only poor pell  maybe he did it only for a joke said larry colby another of the cadets  if he did it was carrying a joke altogether too farendangering one or more human lives i dont believe in that sort of fun  nor do i came from several  if he is in europe with his uncle perhaps ill meet him there said larry colby i am going to france and italy with my uncle and cousin wish some of you fellows were going along he added wistfully  i am going to the maine woods said a lad named george granberry you can never guess who is going there too  who  william philander tubbs and mr strong  what our own dude going to camp in the wilderness cried tom oh if i was only along wouldnt i give him some surprises  ill have some fun dont forget that replied george with a grin but as mr strong is going to be along of course ill have to be a little careful  dear mr strong murmured sam with a sigh what a fine teacher he is and how i hate to give him up  i envy your having him along said dick  at that moment the train rolled into a station and larry and some of the others got off  we leave you at the next station said songbird to the rovers when you find out what you are going to do this summer write and let me know  i certainly shall answered dick  the three rover boys soon after found themselves alone they had to make a change of cars and some time later rolled into the station at oak run  home again shouted tom as he alighted on the depot platform  yes and there is uncle randolph waiting for us added dick as he hurried forward to meet his relative how do you do uncle he cried  i am well richard answered randolph rover and then he shook hands with all three boys youreryour father he began and hesitated  father what of him asked tom in quick alarm for he saw that his uncle was much disturbed  isnt he with you  why no answered the three in a chorus  he started for home last night added dick  took the train after the one you and aunt martha took  but he didnt come home said randolph rover  didnt come home  no  didnt he send any word questioned sam  none that i received  he said he was going straight home would telephone from lockville for the carriage to meet the last train said tom this is mighty queer  it was queer and for the moment the rover boys and their uncle stared blankly at one another  something is wrong declared dick presently and i am going to make it my business to find out at once what it is     chapter ii  an important telegram   dick rover would not have been so much disturbed by his fathers disappearance had it not been for one thing which was that mr rover on leaving the closing exercises at putnam hall had declared that he would take the last train home that night this train got into oak run at one oclock in the morning when the station was closed and the platform usually deserted  let us ask around and see if anybody was here when the train came in suggested tom  they first appealed to mr ricks the station master an old and crabbed individual who disliked the boys for the jokes they had played on him in times past he shook his head at once  dont keep the station open that long he grunted i was home an in bed an i dont know anything about your father  was anybody around the station that you know of went on dick  no  did any telegram come in for our family  if it did i reckon jackson would send it over or telephone  let us ask jackson and make sure said sam and led the way to the telegraph office the telegraph receiver was ticking away at a lively rate and jackson who had charge of the office was taking down a message on a blank  hullo cried the telegrapher as he finished and looked up here is a message for mr randolph rover hot off the wire it wont take long to deliver it and he handed it over its paid for he added but youll have to sign for it and mr rover did so  eagerly all the rovers read the communication which ran as follows  am following man i want to catch if possible may be away from home several days or a week very important to see mantrip this summer depends upon it  anderson rover  wonder who the man can be mused dick after reading the message twice  he has something to do with this matter father was going to tell us about returned sam its certainly a mystery  well this relieves our anxiety said randolph rover so long as i know nothing has happened your father can stay away as long as he pleases  but i am dying to know what it is all about burst out tom who was always impatient to get at the bottom of things uncle randolph do you know what father has in mind to do this summer  he talks about taking a sea trip but where to i dont know  and he wants us to go along queried the youngest rover  i believe so samuel  hurrah id like a sea trip first rate  yes but mr rover lowered his voice he doesnt want anybody to know where to its some kind of a secretvery important i imagine something to do with a gold mine or something of the sort he did not give me any particulars  he said he was going to let us know about it when we got home from the hall said dick i hope he catches his man  wonder who it can be came from tom  nobody could answer that question and in a thoughtful mood the three rover boys followed their uncle to the carriage and got in then the team was touched up and away they whirled out of the village across swift river and in the direction of valley brook farm  it was a beautiful day in june and never had the country looked finer as they swept along the well kept road dick drew a deep breath of satisfaction  this air makes a fellow feel new all over he declared  i suppose you are going to plant and grow some wonderful things this summer uncle randolph said tom his uncle had studied scientific farming for years but had never made any tremendous success of it in fact his experiments usually cost him considerably more than they brought in  welleri am trying my hand this year on some mexican melons said to be very fine thomas was the reply  mexican melons said the funloving tom innocently that puts me in mind when i was over to albany last i saw a pumpkin in a restaurant window eight feet high and at least ten feet across  is it possible ejaculated randolph rover gazing at his nephew incredulously  sure thing the pumpkin looked to be good too they had a lot of pumpkin pies set around it just for an advertisement  thomas did you measure that pumpkin  no why should i  then how do you know it was eight feet high and ten feet across  why uncle randolph i didnt say the pumpkin was eight feet high and ten feet across i said i saw it in a restaurant window eight feet high and ten feet across and tom drew down the corners of his mouth soberly  tom thats the worst ever cried sam  you ought to be made to walk home for that added dick  thomas thomas you are as bad as ever said mr rover with a sigh but i might have been on my guard i know there are no pumpkins of that size  uncle randolph youll have to forgive me said tom putting his hand affectionately on his relatives shoulder i really couldnt help iti am just bubbling over to think that school days are over and i wont have to do any studying for several months to come  i fancy well have to tie you down to keep you out of mischief  you wont have to tie me down if i go on a sea trip with dad  havent you had sea trips enough with being cast away in the middle of the pacific and being wrecked in the gulf of mexico it seems to me every time you and the others leave home something serious happens to you  true but we always come back right side up with care and all charges paid answered the funloving rover airily  they soon made a turn in the road which brought them in sight of the big farmhouse nestling comfortably in a group of stately trees as they turned into the lane their aunt martha came to the front piazza and waved her hand down in the roadway stood jack ness the hired man grinning broadly and behind mrs rover stood alexander pop the colored helper his mouth open from ear to ear at once tom began to sing  home again home again safe from putnam hall  and then he made a flying leap from the carriage rushed up the steps and gave his aunt such a hug as made her gasp for breath  oh tom you bear do let up she cried now theres a kiss for you and theres another how do you do sam and how are you dick and she kissed them also i am glad you are back at last she turned to her husband what of anderson did you hear anything  yes he will be back in a few days  ise jess too pleased fo anything to see yo boys back heah came from aleck pop its dun been mighty lonely since yo went away  dont worry aleck well cheer you up answered tom  oh i know dat massa tom yoll turn dis place upside down in two days suah  why aleck you know id never do anything so rash answered tom meekly  going to uncover some more freight thieves asked jack ness as he took charge of the team and started for the barn  i think dem boys had bettah cotch some of dem chicken thieves put in aleck pop yo dont seem to git holt ob dem nohow  oh never you mind about the chicken thieves grumbled jack ness  has somebody been stealing chickens again asked dick remembering that they had suffered several times from such depradations  yes da has took two chickens las wednesday foah on saturday an two on monday jack he laid fo em wid a shotgun but he didnt cotch nobody  ill catch them yet see if i dont said the hired man  perhaps a fox is doing it suggested sam if so we ought to go on a fox hunt that would suit me first rate  no fox in this answered jack ness i see the footprints of two mentramps i reckon if i catch sight of em ill fill em full of shot and then have em locked up     chapter iii  fun on the farm   two days passed and the boys felt once more at home on the farm the strain of the recent examinations and the closing exercises at school had gone and as sam declared they were once more themselves and ready for anything that might turn up  in those two days came another telegram from mr rover sent from philadelphia in which he stated that he had caught his man but had lost him again he added that he would be home probably on the following sunday this message came in on monday so the boys knew they would have to wait nearly a week before seeing their parent  i am just dying to know what it is all about said tom and the others said practically the same  tom could not keep down his propensities for joking and nearly drove sarah the cook to distraction by putting some barn mice in the bread box in the pantry and by pouring ink over some small stones and then adding them to the coal she was using in the kitchen range he also took a piece of old rubber bicycle tire and trimmed it up to resemble a snake and put it in jack ness bed in the barn thereby nearly scaring the hired man into a fit ness ran out of the room in his night dress and raised such a yell that he aroused everybody in the house he got his shotgun and blazed away at the supposed snake thereby ruining a blanket two sheets and filling the mattress with shot when he found out how he had been hoaxed he was the most foolish looking man to be imagined  you just wait master tom ill get square he said  who said i put a snake in your bed demanded tom i never did such a thing in my life  no but you put that old rubber in and i know it grumbled the hired man and then went back to bed  tom also had his little joke on aleck pop one evening he saw the colored man dressing up to go out and learned that he was going to call on a colored widow living at dexters corners a nearby village  we cant allow this said the funloving rover to his younger brother the next thing you know aleck will be getting married and leaving us  what do you think of doing asked sam  come on and ill show you  now aleck was rather a good looking and well formed darkey and he was proud of his shape he had a fine black coat with trousers to match and a gorgeous colored vest this suit tom was certain he would wear when calling on the widow  when in ithaca on his way home the funloving rover had purchased an imitation rabbit made of thin rubber this rabbit had a small rubber hose attached and by blowing into the hose the rabbit could be blown up to life size or larger  leading the way to alecks room tom got out the colored mans coat and placed the rubber rabbit in the middle of the back between the cloth and the lining it was put in flat and the hose was allowed to dangle down under the lining to within an inch of the split of the coat tails and at this point tom put a hole in the lining so he could get at the end of the hose with ease  it was not long before aleck came in to dress it was late and he was in a hurry for he knew he had a rival a man named jim johnson and he did not want johnson to get to the widows home ahead of him he washed up and donned his clothing with rapidity and never noticed that anything was wrong with the coat  now sam you fix his necktie for him whispered tom who with his younger brother was lying in wait outside the house tell him it doesnt set just straight  sam understood and as soon as aleck appeared he sauntered up side by side with tom  hullo aleck going to see your best girl he said pleasantly  ise gwine to make a little call dats all  hes after the widow taylor put in tom he knows shes got ten thousand or so in the bank  massa tom you dun quit yo foolin expostulated aleck  if you are going to make a society call you want your necktie on straight said sam its a fine tie but its no good the way you have it tied here let me fix it and he pulled the tie loose  i did hab a lot ob trubble wid dat tie agreed the colored man  its too far around went on sam and gave the tie a jerk first one way and another then he began to tie it shoving aleck again as he did so  in the meantime tom had gotten behind the colored man and was blowing up the rubber rabbit as the rubber expanded alecks coat went up with it until it looked as if the man was humpbacked then tom fastened the hose so the wind could not get out of it next the youth brought out a bit of chalk and in big letters wrote on the black coat as follows  i have got to hump to catch the widow  now your tie is something like declared sam after a wink from tom it outshines everything i ever saw  ise got to be a going answered aleck much obliged  now aleck hump yourself and youll get the widow sure along with her fourteen children  she aint got but two children returned the colored man and hurried away his appearance with the hump on his back and the sign caused both the rovers to burst out laughing  come on ive got to see the end of this said tom and led the way by a side path to the widow taylors cottage this was a short cut but aleck would not take it because of the briar bushes and the dust as the boys were in their knockaround suits they did not mind this  the widows cottage was a tumbled down affair on a side street of dexters corners a stovepipe stuck out of a back window and the front door lacked the lower hinge in the front yard the weeds were several feet high  i dont see why aleck wants to come and see such a person as this observed sam she may be pretty as colored widows go but she is certainly lazy and shiftless  yes and she has more than two children and i know it why once i came past here and i saw her with at least seven or eight  when the boys came up they saw several colored children hurrying away from the house as they did this the widow came to the door and called after them  now arabella go to the cemetery jest as i tole yo an stay thar  i aint gwine to stay long answered arabella  you stay an hour or two answered the widow to morrow ill give yo money fer lolly pops  what is she sending the children to the cemetery for asked tom in a whisper  maybe to keep em quiet answered sam with a grin  must be wanting to keep them out of alecks way  at that moment the figure of a tall lanky colored man came down a side street the man entered the widows cottage and received a warm welcome  glad to see you mistah thomas hopes yo is feelin fine this ebenin said the widow graciously  ise come fo to make yo an offah said mr thomas yo said yo would mahrry me soon as i had a job well ise got de job now  is it a steady job  yes at de stone quarry dribin a stone wagon  how much yo gits a week peter  twelve dollahs was the proud answer  den i closes wid you said the widow and allowed the suitor to embrace her  just then aleck came in sight as he saw the couple through the open door he straightened up  maybe yo didnt look fo me around mrs taylor he said stiffly  oh yes i did mistah pop she said sweetly but yo seei dat is she stopped short wots dat she cried  wot  dat hump on yo back  aint no hump on my back answered aleck  suah da is  hes got a sign on too put in peter thomas look wot it reads i hab got to hump to cotch de widow hah hah hah dots a good one  yo neednt hump yoself to cotch me cried the widow wrathfully ise engaged to mistah thomas and she smiled on the individual in question  crestfallen and bewildered aleck felt of his back and took off his coat he squeezed the rubber rabbit so hard that it exploded with a bang scaring himself and the others  dats a trick on me roared the rovers man and tore the rabbit from his coat dem boys did dat  i cant see yo to night or any udder night mistah pop said the widow ise engaged to mistah thomas  den good night growled aleck and turning on his heel he started for home  tom and sam saw that he was angry yet they had to roar at the scene presented they wondered what aleck would say when he got back to the farm  we have got to square ourselves said tom  how are you going to do it  oh well do it somehow  they took the short cut but so did aleck and consequently all three soon met  yo played dat joke yo cant go fo to deny it cried the colored man  we are not going to deny it aleck said tom but it was no joke we did it for your good  huh  we certainly did put in sam why aleck we cant bear to think of your getting married and leaving us  huh  we want you to stay with us said tom besides that widow has a lot of children and is after your money  she aint got but two chillen she had moah but she dun told me all but two was in de seminary  the seminary queried tom then a light broke in on him you mean the cemetery  persacklyde place da puts de dead folks  well they are in the cemetery right enoughbut they are a long way from being dead  wot yo mean tom  we saw her send five of them away this eveningshe told em to go to the cemetery and stay there awhile  wot yo is fooling dis chile  it is absolutely true said sam i am quite sure she has seven children  huh if dats de case dat thomas nigger can hab her grumbled aleck and walked on but i aint takin yo word fo dis he added cautiously ise gwine to make a few investigations to morrow  do soand youll thank us from the bottom of your heart answered tom and there the subject was dropped it may be added here that later on aleck discovered that the widow had ten children and was head over heels in debt and he was more than glad that the boys had played the trick on him and that the other colored man had gained mrs taylors hand     chapter iv  a midnight search   that night was destined to be an eventful one on the rover farm arriving home sam and tom told of the fun they had had and dick laughed heartily then all three of the boys went to bed  about midnight came a loud shouting from the barn followed by the report of a shotgun this was followed by a shriek from sarah the cook who was afraid that burglars had come to murder her  whats that questioned dick as he hopped out of bed  thats jack ness gun answered tom something must be wrong at the barn  chicken thieves againill bet a new hat said sam by this time randolph rover and his wife were up and were lighting a lamp without waiting for them the boys slipped on some clothing and their shoes and ran downstairs dick took with him a pistol and each of the others a baseball bat  boys boys be careful shouted their uncle after them  all right returned dick readily  he was the first outside but sam and tom were close upon his heels he heard jack ness running to the edge of a cornfield shouting lustily then came another report of the shotgun  what is it jack shouted dick who are you shooting at  im after two men was the hired mans reply they jest run into the cornfield  chicken thieves queried tom  i guess soanyway they was prowlin around the hen house an the barn i called an asked em what they wanted and they ran for dear lifeso i knew they was up to no good  they certainly must have been chicken thieves or worse was sams comment really this is getting to be too much he added we ought to catch them and have them locked up  im willing to go after them answered tom readily  did you get a good look at the rascals asked dick  not very good answered jack ness  they werent boys were they  nothey were menboth tall and heavy fellows  did you ever see them before asked tom not that i can remember  while they were talking the party of four had run down to the edge of the cornfield this spot was really a peach orchard but the trees were still so small that the ground was being utilized that season for corn planted in rows between the trees the corn was not yet full grown but it was high enough to conceal a man lying flat or crouching down  the sky was filled with stars and the old moon was beginning to show over the hills beyond the valley so it was fairly light across the field the boys kept their eyes on the corn and the peach trees but failed to discover any persons moving among them  my shotgun is emptymaybe i had better go back and load up said the hired man  yes do it but hurry up answered dick ill stay here on guard with the pistol  the hired man ran off toward the barn hardly had he disappeared when sam gave a short cry and pointed into the field with his hand  i saw somebody raise up just now and look around he said he is out of sight now  where came from dick and tom quickly over yonder by the twisted peach tree  ill investigate said dick you can come along if you want to keep your eyes open for both men we dont want either to get away if we can help it  the three lads spread out in something of a semi circle and advanced slowly into the field keeping their eyes and ears on the alert for anything out of the ordinary thus they covered fifty yards when tom found himself near one of the largest of the peach trees as he passed this a form arose quickly from under a bough caught him by the waist and threw him forcibly to the ground  hi yelled tom let up and then he made a clutch for his assailant catching him by the foot but the man broke away and went crashing through the corn calling on shelley to follow him  the yell from tom attracted the attention of dick and sam and they turned to learn what had happened to their brother as they did this a second man leaped up from the corn in front of them and started to run in the direction of the river  stop called out dick stop or ill fire on you and then he discharged his pistol into the air as a warning the man promptly dodged behind a row of peach trees but kept on running as hard as ever  the rover boys were now thoroughly aroused and all three started in pursuit of the two men they saw the fellows leave the field and hurry down a lane leading to swift river  i believe they are going to the river maybe they have a boat said tom  i shouldnt wonder answered dick  i wish they would take to a boat said sam we could follow them easilyin dan baileys boat  hi where are you came a shout from behind and they saw jack ness returning your uncle and aunt want you to be carefulthey are afraid those villains will shoot you  well be careful answered tom but we are going to capture them if it can be done he added sturdily  the hired man had reloaded the shotgun and also brought some additional ammunition with him he was nervous and the boys could readily see that he did not relish continuing the pursuit  we cant do nothin in the dark he grumbled let us wait till morning  no i am going after them now answered dick decidedly  so am i added sam and tom  they were going forward as rapidly as the semi darkness would permit the ground was more or less uncertain and once the youngest rover went into a mud hole splashing the mud up into jack ness face  hi stop that spluttered the hired man want to put my eye out  excuse me jack i didnt see the hole answered sam  it aint safe to walk here in the darksomebody might break a leg  if you want to go back you can do so put in dick give tom the shotgun  oherim goin if you be answered jack ness he was ashamed to let them know how much of a coward he really was  it was quite a distance to swift river which at this point ran among a number of stately willows as the boys gained the waters edge they saw a boat putting out not a hundred feet away  there they are cried dick  stop yelled tom stop unless you want to be shot  well do a little shooting ourselves if you are not careful came back in a harsh voice  take care take care cried jack ness in terror and ran to hide behind a handy tree  the two men in the boat were putting down the stream with all speed the current always strong soon carried them around a bend and out of sight  it must be confessed that the boys were in a quandary they did not wish to give up the chase yet they realized that the escaping men might be desperate characters and ready to put up a hard fight if cornered  jack i think you had better run over to the ditwold house and tell them what is up said dick after a moments thought tell ike and joe we are going to follow in dan baileys boat the ditwolds were neighboring farmers and ike and joe were strong young men ever ready to lend a hand in time of trouble  all right answered the hired man and set off first however turning his firearm over to tom  the three rover boys were well acquainted with the river and had had more than one adventure on its swiftly flowing waters as my old readers know they skirted a number of the willows and came to a small creek where they found dan baileys craft tied to a stake but there were no oars and they gazed at one another in dismay  we might have known it said dick in disgust he always takes the oars up to the barn with him  the barn was a good distance off and none of the boys relished running that far for oars more than this they felt that by the time the oars were brought the other craft would be out of sight and hearing and thus the trail of the midnight prowlers would be lost  here is a bit of board said sam searching around let us use that for a paddle the current will carry us almost as swiftly as if we were rowing the main thing will be to keep out of the way of the rocks  i wish those chaps would run on the rocks and smash their boat to bits grumbled tom who had gotten a stone in his loose shoe and was consequently limping  the boys shoved the rowboat from the creek to the river and leaped in dick being the largest and strongest took the board and using it as a sweep sent the craft well out where the current could catch it down the stream went the boat with sam in the middle and tom in the stern there was no rudder so they had to depend entirely upon dick who stood up near the bow peering ahead for rocks of which the river boasted a great number  those fellows must know this river remarked sam as he started to lace his shoes there being nothing else just then to do  they ought toif they are the fellows who visited our henhouse before answered tom dick can you see them  no but i know they must be ahead  perhaps they went ashorejust to fool us  they couldnt get ashore here very wellit is too rocky you know that as well as i do listen  they listened but the only sound that broke the stillness was the distant roar of humpback falls where sam had once had such a thrilling adventure as related in the rover boys at school even now so long afterward it made the youngest rover shiver to think of that happening  a minute later the boat came clear of the tree shadows and the boys saw a long stretch ahead of them shimmering like silver in the moonbeams sam looking in the direction of the opposite shore made out a rowboat moving thither  there they are he cried  at once dick essayed to turn their own craft in that direction but with only a bit of a board for a paddle and with the current tearing along wildly this was not easy the rowboat was turned partly but then scraped some rocks and they were in dire peril of upsetting  i see where they are going cried tom to the old henderson mill  well have to land below that point said his oldest brother if i try to get in there with only this board ill hit the rocks sure  they are taking chances even with oars was sams comment see they have struck some rocks  he was right and the rovers saw the boat ahead spin around and the two men leap to their feet in alarm but then the craft steadied itself and a moment later shot into the shadows of the trees beside the old flour mill  it was not until five minutes later that dick was able to guide their own rowboat to the shore upon which the mill was located they hit several rocks but at last came in where there was a sandy stretch all leaped out and the craft was hauled up to a point out of the currents reach  now to get back to the mill as soon as possible and corner those fellows if we can said tom and without delay the three rover boys started through the woods in the direction of the spot where the two men had landed     chapter v  at the old mill   the henderson mill was now largely so only in name so far back as the rover boys could remember it had been a tenantless structure going slowly to decay the water wheel was gone and so were the grinding stones and the roof and sides were full of holes henderson the owner had years ago fallen heir to a fortune and had moved away leaving the building at the mercy of the tramps who frequently stopped there  it was no easy matter to climb around or over the rocks which lay between the boys and the old mill and the darkness under the thick trees was intense they felt their way along slowly and tom was careful to carry the shotgun with the barrel pointed downward that there might be no accident  more than likely those fellows have been putting up at the old mill said dick  theyll leave nowif they think we are coming answered sam  let us keep quiet put in tom if they hear us talking they will surely skip out  after that but little was said foot by foot they drew closer to the dilapidated structure until it loomed up dimly before them then dick motioned for the others to halt  with bated breath the boys listened at first they heard little but the rushing of the water over the rocks then came a sudden cracking of a rotten floor board followed by an exclamation  confound the luck ive put my foot through the floor again growled a mans voice shelley why dont you light the lantern do you want me to break my neck  if i light the lantern the rovers may come here was the answer from the man called shelley  oh they went down the river i saw them  they may have turned in nearby  some more words followed but spoken so low that the boys could not understand them they heard a faint creaking of the flooring of the old mill but that was all  they are there thats certain whispered dick but i dont see how we are going to capture them in this darkness  i wish we had a lantern said the youngest rover  we wouldnt dare to light it sam answered tom let us crawl up close to the building maybe we can find out something more about the men they may be some good for nothing fellows from the village  as there seemed nothing else to do this advice was followed and soon the boys were at one of the broken out windows of the mill they listened and looked inside but saw and heard nothing  they are not here whispered sam disappointedly  they are not far off answered his big brother confidently  look came from tom a light  he pointed through the window to the flooring inside from between the loose boards shone several streaks of light as the boys gazed the light vanished and all was as dark as before  they are in the lower room the one where the water wheel used to be whispered tom maybe that is where they have been hanging out  come after mebut dont make any noise said dick cautiously if they have gone into the second room down there maybe we can make them prisoners  thats the idea cried sam just the thing  hush sam or youll spoil all  scarcely daring to breathe now that they knew the strange men were so close the three rover boys walked to the open doorway of the old mill and went inside dick led the way and crossed to where an enclosed stairs ran to the floor below on tiptoes he went down not trusting a step until he was sure of his footing it was well he did this for two of the steps were entirely rotted away and he had to warn his brothers otherwise one or another might have had a fall  standing in the wheel room of the old mill the boys saw another streak of light coming from the room which dick had suggested the door to this was closed a bolt on the inner side holding it in place there was another bolt on the outside which dick remembered having seen on a previous visit  we can lock them in if we wish he whispered  do it answered his brothers promptly  the bolt was large and old fashioned and dick had considerable trouble in moving it into its socket it made a rasping sound but this was not noticed by the two men who were conversing earnestly  well we made a mess of it growled the man called shelley  so we did but i didnt think that hired man would wake up neither of us made a bit of noise he must be a light sleeper  i only hope they think we were after chickens cuffer if they knew the truth the man named shelley broke off with a coarse laugh  well we got chickens the other night didnt we and now the man called cuffer laughed also but say this is getting serious he went on presently merrick expects us to do this job for him and do it quick and he wont like it at all when he finds out how we have missed it  we cant do the impossible those rovers are too wide awake for us  they certainly were too wide awake for merrick in that traction company bond matter he was a chump not to sell those bonds as soon as he got hold of them  he didnt darehe was afraid the market was being watched  what does he want of those papers anyway  i dont know exactly but you know what he saidthere would be a small fortune in it for us if we got em he says hes got some papers or a map i guess it isbut he wants these papers too he didnt dare show himself around hereyou know the reason why  surethose rovers would recognize him even if he tried to disguise himself  dick tom and sam listened to this conversation with keenest interest and amazement these men had mentioned the name of sid merrick the rascal who had in the past tried so hard to harm them and who had up to the present time escaped the clutches of the law evidently they were in league with merrick and under his directions  we must capture those fellows by all means whispered tom excitedly if we do maybe we can find out where merrick is  yes and tad sobber too added sam who had not forgotten the poisonous snake episode at putnam hall  they werent after chickensthat was only a blind said dick they want to get something from the housesome papers that merrick wants  they must be valuable said sam  father has all sorts of valuable papers went on tom bonds deeds to mining properties and such but i thought he had the most of those in a safe deposit vault in the city  so he has answered dick maybe these fellows would be fooled even if they got into uncle randolphs house theylisten  shelley and cuffer had begun to talk again they mentioned a tramp steamer called the josephine and shelley said she was now in port being repaired then the conversation drifted to sporting matters and cuffer told how he had lost a hundred dollars on a prize fight  thats why im here he added and i want some money the next time i see sid merrick  he wont give us any unless we said shelley and the boys did not hear the end of the sentence for the speaker tried the door as he spoke throwing the inner bolt back of course with the outer bolt in place the door refused to budge the boys drew back and tom raised the shotgun and dick his pistol  the door is caught cried shelley and pushed on it as hard as he could  what exclaimed cuffer and leaped forward he too tried to move the barrier this is a trick somebody has bolted the door on the outside  was there a bolt there  yes a heavy one too  then somebody has trapped us  open that door sang out cuffer before his companion could stop him  we are not going to open that door answered dick in an equally loud voice we have got you fast and we intend to keep you so  who are you  i am dick rover and my two brothers are with me we are well armed and well shoot if you try to break that door down  caught cried shelley in a rage and then uttered several exclamations under his breath  what are you going to do asked cuffer after a moment of silence  hold you prisoners until we can get help and then turn you over to the officers of the law  we havent done anything wrong  that remains to be seen  you havent any right to lock us in here  then we take the right answered tom grimly  let us smash the door down came in a low tone from inside the room  if you try it well surely fire said dick and cocked his pistol so the men might hear the click tom did the same with the shotgun  see here you let us out and well make it all right with you remarked shelley after another pause we are not the bad fellows you take us to be we were only going to play a joke thats all  i suppose you think sid merricks doings are a joke too said sam before he had time to think twice  ha what do you know of merrick ejaculated cuffer they must have been listening to our talk he added in a low tone to his companion  yes and if so we are in a bad box answered shelley id give a good deal to be out of here just now  talk to them while i take a look around continued cuffer struck by a sudden idea  shelley did as told pleading with the three rovers to let him go and offering to pay fifty dollars for his liberty he talked in a loud tone to cover up what noise his companion might make the boys listened but refused to open the door until some sort of help should arrive or until morning came  sam you go outside and see if jack and the ditwolds are anywhere around said dick and the youngest rover departed immediately  presently tom and dick heard cuffer give a cry of pain  youve stepped on my sore toe howled the man phew how it hurts  the two men talked about the hurt toe for several minutes then their voices suddenly ceased tom and dick strained their ears but could hear absolutely nothing  they must be up to some trick whispered the eldest rover hi you what are you doing he called out  there was no answer and the silence was just as ominous as before the light in the inner room had gone out  what are you doing repeated dick and ran close to the door to listen nothing but absolute silence followed  what to do next the two boys did not know they waited for fully five minutesthen five more presently they heard sam coming back  i yelled for jack and the others but i got no answer said he what are the men doing  we dont know answered tom we are afraid they are up to some trick  a trick repeated sam then he gave a gasp the roomisnt there a back door leading out to the shed  i dont know answered dick  ill run and see  sam was gone less than two minutes when they heard a cry and then he pounded on the door they had so carefully guarded  there is a back door and it is wide open the men have gone was his dismaying announcement     chapter vi  the story of a treasure   it was a disheartening discovery but the three rover boys did not stop to think it over throwing open the bolted door tom and dick joined sam and in the darkness made their way to the rear of the room in which they had held cuffer and shelley prisoners in a minute more they were outside under the trees at the rear of the old mill  which way did they go  tom asked the question but nobody could answer it the moon had now gone under some clouds and it was so dark they could scarcely see ten feet in any direction  perhaps they took to the river again suggested sam  it is not likely answered his big brother but we can take a look  they ran around to where the men had landed their boat was still in its place tied to a tree  listen cried sam somebodys shouting and there is a light  it is jack ness said tom  the boys set up an answering shout and soon a boat came up to the shore it contained the hired man and the two ditwolds they had a lantern with them and also an old fashioned single barrel shotgun  the situation was quickly explained and then the party of six began a systematic search of the woods and the various roads in the vicinity of hendersons mill this search lasted until morning but nothing came of it  we may as well give up said dick at last they have gotten away and that is all there is to it  the boys were completely tired out when they got home their uncle and aunt were much worried over their prolonged absence and overjoyed to see them return unharmed  i was so afraid one of you might get shot or something said mrs rover some of those chickens thieves are desperate characters  those men were more than chicken thieves answered dick and he told his uncle and aunt of the conversation overheard at the old mill  it is a great pity that they got away said randolph rover  what do you imagine they are after uncle randolph questioned sam  i do not know excepting it may be some mining stocks or a deed to some property perhaps your father will be able to explain it when he gets back  the authorities were notified but they failed to apprehend the men it was learned that the boat they had used had been stolen from a point near oak run and the craft was returned to its owner that they had used the old mill for a stopping place was evidenced by the remains of numerous meals found there the boys made a careful search of the premises but brought nothing to light which was of use to them  i wish father was homeor we knew how to reach him by telephone or with a telegram remarked dick  well we cant reach him so well have to be patient until he returns answered sam by the way i wonder if his going away had anything to do with what those men were up to  it might be so returned dick slowly both happenings are queer to say the least  i wish i knew what father has in mind to do came from tom i hope we take some kind of a trip i dont want to stick on the farm all summer  with nothing to do the next two days passed slowly the boys went fishing and swimming and they also did some shooting at a target which they set up behind the barn and whiled away some time at boxing and in gymnastic exercises dick also spent an hour in penning a long letter to dora stanhope who as my old readers are well aware was his dearest girl friend dora and her mother lived not far from putnam hall and dick and his brothers had become acquainted with her and her two cousins nellie and grace laning when they had first gone to school the rover boys had on several occasions saved mrs stanhope from serious trouble and for this the widow was very grateful she and her daughter had gone with them on the houseboat trip down the ohio and the mississippi and mrs laning and nellie and grace had likewise accompanied the party it may be added here that tom and sam thought nellie and grace two of the nicest girls in the whole world which indeed they were  on saturday morning the boys were contemplating a bicycle ride when sam who chanced to look toward the road set up a shout  here comes father  all gazed in the direction and saw mr rover coming toward them in a rig he had hired at the depot they ran to meet their parent and were soon shaking him by the hand they saw that he looked travel worn and tired  i have been on the go ever since i left putnam hall said anderson rover it was a most unexpected trip i will tell you all about it as soon as i have rested a bit and had something to eat  we have something to tell too answered dick but that can keep until later  inside of an hour mr rover had been served with a good hot breakfast and then he declared that he felt like a new man he invited the whole family into the sitting room for a conference of importance  i told you lads i had something on my mind he said i did not want to speak of it while at the graduation exercises at the school because there was too much going on now i am going to tell you everything and also tell you what i propose to do but first i want to listen to what you have to tell me  it did not take the three boys long to relate the particulars of the pursuit of cuffer and shelley and of what they had overheard at the old mill anderson rover listened with close attention and did not seem surprised when they mentioned sid merricks name  that fits in to a certain degree with what i have to tell you he said when they had finished  it is a strange story and the only way for me to do so that it will be perfectly clear to you is to tell it from the beginning  well were willing enough to listen said dick with a smile  weve been on pins and needles ever since you said you had something important to tell added tom grinning  well to start this concerns mrs stanhope more than it concerns ourselves began the father  what ejaculated dick he had not expected anything of this sort  i knew you would be surprised dick and youll be more surprised when i get through  are the lanings in this questioned sam thinking of grace  they are in a certain senseor will be if everything turns out successfully when mr stanhope died he left most of his property to mrs stanhope and dorathe majority to dorabut a small share was left to the lanings they being so closely related and such good friends  but what is it all about asked tom impatiently  as i said before i must start at the beginning or perhaps you wont understand at all as you know mr stanhope died some years ago he was interested in various business enterprises including a number of vessels which carried freight between the united states and the west indies one of his partners in the freight carrying business was a man named robertson and another was a silas merrick  merrick cried sam  yes and this silas merrick was an older brother to sid merrick the rascal who stole the bonds and whom you heard mentioned by cuffer and shelley let me say here that silas merrick is dead and when he died he left all his property to his brother sidney and his sister the sister is dead too and her property so i understand went to her son tad sobber  this is getting deep said tom his sunny face growing wrinkled  it will soon get deeper tom during the time that the firm of stanhope robertson  merrick were carrying freight from the west indies there was a fierce revolution in central america some families of high rank were forced to flee among them a nobleman named parmonelli who left home carrying with him gold and diamonds worth many thousands of dollars he managed to get on board one of the vessels owned by mr stanhopes firm and mr stanhope was on the ship at the same time the vessel was followed by revolutionists who were no better than pirates and after a fierce fight the revolutionists shot parmonelli and carried off his fortune  this is certainly getting deep murmured sam  parmonelli was not killed at once but died two days after being shot down he was very bitter against the revolutionists and said they had no right to take his fortune from himthat it was his and did not belong to the state as mr stanhope had befriended him to the last he made a will leaving the fortune to mr stanhope if the same could be recovered  and how much was it questioned dick  i cannot say exactly the will mentions six bags of gold and one bag of precious stones all packed in several chests  its queer i never heard of this from dora said dick she told me about the other money her father left  mr stanhope kept the matter to himself and at his death told only mr laning foras you knowmrs stanhope was then in delicate health and it was deemed very unwise to excite her  but what about the fortunewas it recovered asked tom  no  then the money has long since been spent cried sam in dismay  no sam the money and the jewels to the best of my belief have never been touched when the revolutionists carried them off they said they were going straight back to central america with them instead however they landed on an island of the west indies and there started to divide the fortune this caused a bitter fight in which several of the party were killed and wounded then it was decided to hide the money and jewels in a cave on the island and make a division later a place was selected and the gold and jewels placed under heavy rocks in a small cave after that the party sailed away when they got home much to their surprise and dismay they found their country in the hands once more of the government they were captured and all but two were sentenced to be shot as traitors the two were sent to prison and they were released less than a year ago one was a spaniard named doranez and the other a spanish american sailor named camel but usually called bahama jack because he has spent nearly all his life among the bahama islands  did those two men go after the treasure when they got out of prison asked sam  they wanted to but were poor and had forgotten the exact location of the island where the treasure was hidden bahama jack was a happy go lucky sort of a sailor and he came to this country and worked for a while on a lumber schooner running from florida to boston doranez also came to this country but where he kept himself at first i do not know  go on dad this is getting exciting broke in tom as his parent paused in his recital  not long ago mrs stanhope came to me for advice concerning this matter mr laning had told her everything and she wanted to know if it would be worth while to organize an expedition to hunt for the treasure i said i would look into the matter and ask her to give me what papers mr stanhope had left in reference to the affair i started to hunt up bahama jack and doranez after a good deal of work i found the former and had several long talks with him  did you get any news from him asked dick  a little he does not remember exactly where the island was located but told much about its general appearance and what other islands were in that vicinity but he also told me something else which worried me a good deal it was that sid merrick as the heir of silas merrick was also after the treasure     chapter vii  in which something is missing   sid merrick after the treasure cried dick  yes he wants it both for himself and for his nephew tad sobber he claims that the revolutionists took it from a ship belonging in part to his brother and consequently he has as much right to it as has mrs stanhope  but that isnt so is it asked sam  no the treasure if it is found belongs to mr stanhopes estate absolutelythat is to mrs stanhope dora and the lanings the fact that silas merrick had an interest in the ship at the time of the stealing of the wealth cuts no figure at all  what is sid merrick doing asked tom  he has been working in secret looking for bahama jack and the spaniard doranez i found out that he had one talk with bahama jack but the sailor did not like merrick and told him very little then i started to find doranezhe is the man i have been after during the past week i found him and he promised to work with me if i would pay him for his trouble but yesterday he sent me a note stating he had changed his mind and was going to spain to look up some of his relatives so he is probably out of it from now on  maybe he is going to look for the treasure on his own account suggested randolph rover  he cannot do that very well for he has little or no money  and what do you propose to do fathergo on a hunt for the treasure asked dick  yes from what papers i have on hand and the information gotten from bahama jack i think we stand a fair chance of locating that island and of finding the cave where the treasure is secreted of course there is a good deal of guess work about it but i am convinced the thing is worth trying  and how are you going at it came from tom  a friend of mine in philadelphia a mr dale has a steam yacht which he is not going to use this summer as he is going to europe i have determined to charter that yacht and go on a cruise among the west indies it will be a fine outing for the summer even if we dont locate treasure isle as mr stanhope called the spot  and youll take us along asked tom quickly  if you want to go  if we want to go does a duck want to swim or a dog want to scratch fleas of course we want to go  such a trip will suit me to a t said sam and i hope with all my heart we locate that treasure he added earnestly  of course youll take this bahama jack along said dick  yes and i have promised him a big reward if the treasure is recovered answered his father  who else will be in the party  at this question anderson rovers eyes began to sparkle  i was going to keep it a secret but perhaps i had better tell you the steam yacht is a large one and can readily accommodate fifteen or twenty passengers i have decided to ask mrs stanhope to go and bring dora and will also ask the lanings then they will know exactly what is being done to recover the treasure in addition if you want to take some of your chums with you as you did on that houseboat trip  hurrah just the thing burst out sam let us take fred garrison by all means  yes and songbird powell and hans mueller added tom they will help to make things lively  can they go questioned dick  we can telegraph and find out answered tom ill telegraph this afternoon he added always ready to do things on the rush we ought to get an answer to night or to morrow morning  when do you want to start on the trip asked dick  as soon as the party can be made up and the steam yacht can be gotten in readiness i have already instructed the captain to provision her for the trip  then she has a captain and a crew  oh yes she carries ten men including an engineer and his assistant  that is certainly fine said dick and he smiled as he thought of what a nice trip they would have with dora stanhope on board dick was not moonstruck but he had a manly regard for dora that did him credit  after that anderson rover gave them many more details regarding the treasure and his talks with bahama jack and of what he hoped to accomplish he had a fair idea of the latitude and longitude of treasure isle which he had been told was of coral formation covered with palms and shaped somewhat like a horseshoe  bahama jack says the treasure cave is about in the center of the inner curve of the island but that you cannot sail close to it on account of the numerous reefs you have to land on the island in a small boat and that is why very few ships stop there natives of that vicinity occasionally go there for fruit and for birds but there is no regular village on the island  if the island is shaped like a horseshoe we ought not to have great difficulty in locating it said dick  the trouble is you cannot see the formation very well from the sea dick if one were in a balloon it would be different you must remember that there are many hundreds of islands scattered in that part of our globe  lets take a balloon along suggested tom then we could go up and take a look around  you couldnt look far enough tom and if you tried to sail in the balloon youd probably drop into the ocean and be drowned no well have to do our searching from the steam yacht but i have several maps and drawings which i think will aid us  the things cuffer and shelley were after cried dick  perhaps if they are in league with sid merrick merrick of course would like to get all the information possible  id like to look at the maps and drawings  so would i added sam and tom the idea of going on a treasure hunt filled them with great interest  the maps and drawings i have are only copies went on anderson rover the originals are in mrs stanhopes possession  mr rover turned to his brother you have them randolf will you please get them  i have them queried randolph rover in perplexity as my old readers know he was at times somewhat absent minded  why yes dont you remember my giving them to you they were in a large yellow envelope i think you placed them away with your traction company bonds  whyerso i did stammered randolph rover but ieri dont quite remember what i did with them he scratched his head ill go and get my tin box  he left the sitting room and after being gone fully ten minutes returned with a flat tin box in which he kept some papers of value  the envelope doesnt seem to be here he said turning over the contents of the box  dont you remember it asked his brother anxiously  oh yes i remember it very well now i saw it only a couple of days before i went to carwell with my bonds  did you take that tin box to carwell asked tom  yes  was the envelope in it then  ieri really dont know thomas you see i was much upset thinking my bonds were no good perhaps the yellow envelope was in the box under the bonds  and did sid merrick have hold of the box demanded anderson rover  he may have had the box was on a side table and he walked around the room and over to it several times  then unless you have the envelope now sid merrick stole it said anderson rover somewhat bitterly  this announcement filled randolph rover with increased anxiety and as a result he looked over all his private papers and ransacked his safe and his desk from end to end but the precious yellow envelope and its contents were not brought to light  merrick must have gotten hold of that envelope at the time he stole the bonds said dick maybe that is what made him trace up this story of the treasure  that may be true dick answered his parent  randolph rover was greatly distressed over the disappearance of the maps and drawings and upbraided himself roundly for not having been more careful  now that they are in this merricks hands he may make use of them he said dolefully  undoubtedly he will answered anderson rover  if he has those papers and maps why did he send cuffer and shelley here asked tom  most likely he thought he could get additional information  it seems to me the best thing we can do is to get after that treasure without delay said dick if we dont merrick may form some kind of a party locate the island and steal the gold and jewels from under our very noses  oh such things are not done in a day dick said his father with a faint smile but i agree with you the quicker we get after the treasure the better  after that a discussion lasting well after the dinner hour followed and was only ended when mrs rover fairly drove them into the dining room for the midday repast it was resolved that the party to go in search of the treasure should be made up of anderson rover and his three sons mrs stanhope and dora the lannings and also fred garrison songbird powell and hans mueller during the afternoon a number of telegrams and letters were written and the boys send these off before nightfall  aleck pop was very much interested in such conversation as he had overheard and as he had accompanied the boys to the jungles of africa and on the houseboat trip he was very anxious to be a member of the present party  i dont see how yo young genmen is gwine to get along widout me he said to sam dont yo think you kin squeeze me aboadh somehow  arent you afraid youd get seasick aleck asked sam  i aint afraid ob muffin if only yoll take me along answered the darkey earnestly  i suppose the steam yacht has its cook  dat might be massa sam but didnt i cook all right on dot houseboat  you certainly did  might be as how i could gab dot cook on de yacht seem pints as to wot yo young genmen like aint dot so  perhaps aleck if you wish ill speak to father about it  tank yo werry much massa sam  but you must promise one thing put tom who was listening to the talk  wot is dat  you wont run off and marry the widow taylor when you get back  huh ise done wid dat trash snorted aleck she kin mahrry dat thomas an welcome i dont want her or her chillun neither  all right then aleck well see what we can do for you said tom and sam said the same in the end it was agreed that aleck should accompany the party as a general helper and this pleased the colored man very much it was a lucky thing for the boys that aleck went along as certain later events proved     chapter viii  the rover boys in new york   the more the rover boys talked about the treasure hunt the more enthusiastic they became until as tom expressed it they were simply boiling over with enthusiasm  it will be a grand thing for the stanhopes and the lanings if we do locate that treasure said sam mr laning has some money but i know hed like more so he wouldnt have to farm quite so hard  and dick wants to get all he can for dora im certain of that said tom with a merry glance at his elder brother  how about you getting the laning share for nellies benefit retorted dick his face growing red i reckon the boot is as long as the shoe  as the rovers had plenty of money it was an easy matter to arrange for the expenses of the trip mrs stanhope wanted to pay a share but anderson rover said she had better wait until the treasure was found  inside of three days word was received from all those who had been asked to participate in the search mr laning said that he could not leave his farm very well but that his wife and two daughters would go mrs stanhope and dora said they would pack immediately fred garrison was visiting hans mueller and the two sent a telegram as follows  you couldnt hold us back if you tried where shall we meet you  thats like fred said dick i am awfully glad he is to be with us and glad hans will come too  the last telegram to come in was from songbird powell the reply of the wouldbe poet of putnam hall was characteristic  tell me where and ill be there on the run for lots of fun  if that isnt songbird exclaimed sam laughing as he read the telegram had to talk in rhyme even over the telegraph wire  it was finally decided that the whole party should meet in philadelphia about the fourth of july which was now less than a week off they should go directly to the steam yacht and the voyage was to begin as soon as all arrangements were completed  i wish to stop off at new york for a day said anderson rover if you boys want to go with me you may do so  that will suit me answered dick and his brothers said the same  it had been agreed that no outsiders should be told of the treasure hunt so nothing was mentioned but a summer trip on a steam yacht the day the rovers and aleck pop left the farm was a clear one and all were in the best of spirits the colored man drove to the depot with jack ness and the trunks and dress suit cases and all of the others went in the carryall randolph rover driving and mrs rover giving the boys final instructions about taking care of themselves  i shall miss you very much she said with tears in her eyes her lively nephews were as dear to her as if they were her own sons  youd better go along aunt martha said dick  wed like it first rate added sam  it might help us to keep out of mischief came from tom with a bright smile  no ill stay at home with your uncle boys but do take care of yourselves and come home safe  oh there will be no danger in this trip said dick but he was mistakenthere was to be great peril and of an unusual kind if the treasure hunters could have seen what was before them they would not have started off in such a confident frame of mind  the train was a little late but presently it rolled into the station and the trunks and other baggage were hoisted aboard then came the final embraces and the boys climbed up the steps followed by their father and aleck  hurrah we are off at last cried tom and waved his cap enthusiastically the others did the same and then the train started and oak run quickly faded from sight as the boys settled down in their seats a lad came from another car and moved swiftly toward them  songbird by all thats lucky cried dick and caught the other by the hand  i thought youd be on this train answered songbird powell i got your wire last night that you would stop off at new york i am going to stop tooto see an uncle of mine on a little business  then youll travel with us to philadelphia queried sam  sure  good tom was just saying hed like some of the others along  when i got your invitation i danced a jig of delight went on songbird i just couldnt help it then i sat down and wrote  a piece of poetry about it thirty five stanzas long finished tom  no tom there are only six verses you see i couldnt help iti was so chuck full of enthusiasm the poem begins like this  twas a peaceful summer night when all the stars were shining bright there came a rap on our house door which made me leap from bed to floor to me had come a telegram from my old chums dick tom and sam asking if i had a notion to sail with them upon the ocean to skim along on waters blue  and then and there get seasick too finished tom dont forget to put in about the seasickness songbirdit always goes with a voyage you know  seasick snorted the wouldbe poet who ever heard of seasickness in a poem the next line is this  and see so many sights quite new to rest in quiet day by day and watch the fishes at their play  thats the first verse the second begins  save it songbird until were on the yacht interrupted sam well have more time to listen then  all right answered the wouldbe poet cheerfully i want to fix up some of the lines anyhow ive got harm to rhyme with storm and it doesnt quite suit me  never minda storm often does great harm said dick you can easily fix it up by throwing out both words you know  after that the talk drifted around to the matter of the treasure hunt and songbird was given some of the details in which he became much interested he declared that he thought the trip on the steam yacht would be even more interesting than the one on the houseboat had been  were after something definite this trip he said weve got something to look forward to specially if that sid merrick starts a rival hunt  we want to get ahead of merrick answered dick we want to locate treasure isle and get the gold and jewels before he knows what we are up to  whats the name of the steam yacht  the rainbow  thats a good name for a rainbow is a sign of good promise was songbirds comment  the party had to make one change of cars and had their dinner on the train they arrived at the grand central depot at half past two oclock and the rovers went to a nearby hotel taking aleck with them while songbird hurried off to transact his business with his uncle  mr rover had to meet some men who were interested in his mining ventures in the far west and so after accommodations had been obtained he hurried off leaving the boys to their own devices  let us take a stroll down broadway suggested sam to whom the sights of this busy thoroughfare were always interesting  the others were willing and they passed through forty second street to broadway and then turned southward the street was filled with wagons trucks and trolley cars and the sidewalk appeared to overflow with folks as sam said at one point a man was giving some sort of an exhibition in a store window and here the crowd was so great they had to walk out into the gutter to get past  i can tell you one thing remarked dick there is after all but one new york and no other city is like it  the boys walked slowly as far as union square and then sat down on one of the park benches to rest nearly all the benches were filled with people and in idle curiosity dick began to scan the various types of men present from bright brisk clerks to fat and unshaved bummers too lazy to work  hullo  dick uttered the exclamation so abruptly that sam and tom were startled  what do you see queried both  look there  they gazed in the direction dick pointed out and on a distant bench saw a youth of about toms age but heavier set talking to a man who wore a rusty suit of brown and a peculiarly shaped slouch hat  why thats tad sobber cried tom  so it is added sam who is that fellow with him  i dont know although his figure looks somewhat familiar to me answered dick  what can tad be doing in new york questioned tom do you suppose he is down here with sid merrick  perhaps  lets go over and see what he has to say for himself suggested sam maybe hell run away when he sees us  all of the boys were curious to know what the former bully of putnam hall might have to say for himself and they strode over to the bench upon which sobber and the man in brown were sitting they came up behind the pair  i cant give you any money cuffer they heard tad sobber say youll have to wait till my uncle sid gets here  when will he get to new york  to morrow  that fellow is cuffer the man who ran away from us at the old mill cried dick  let us catch him and hand him over to the police returned tom  in his excitement he talked rather loudly and this attracted the attention of cuffer and tad sobber  the rovers cried sobber leaping to his feet in consternation how did they get down to new york  who did you say questioned cuffer and then looking at the three youths his face blanched we must get away from here and be quick about it  he started to run and dick and sam went after him the chase led to the lower end of the little park and then cuffer crossed fourteenth street and amid the crowd bound homeward for the day pushed his way in the direction of the third avenue elevated railroad station  in the meantime tad sobber started to run in another direction but before he had taken a dozen steps tom was on him and had him by the arm  stop sobber he said shortly  i wont you let me go tom rover  ill not let you go answered tom firmly and if you dont stand still ill call a policeman and have you arrested     chapter ix  a chase on the bowery   toms threat to have tad sobber arrested caused the former bully of the school to pause and turn pale  youeryou dont mean that he faltered you cant have me arrested  well see about that sobber  i havent done anything wrong  then why did you run away from putnam hall  i had a right to leave captain putnam wasnt treating me fairly  you ran away on account of that snake affairyou cant deny it  humph  that snake nearly killed nick pell he isnt over it yet altogether  bah it wasnt the snake made nick sick he wasnt feeling well some days before the snake bit him  it was the snake and nothing else put him in bed answered tom warmly and that is not all you are in league with your uncle who robbed my uncle of those traction company bonds  ieri dont know anything about that matter answered sobber hastily  well i know all about it you were with your uncle when he got away from us and when he dropped the pocketbook containing the bonds  did you get the bonds back asked sobber with sudden interest it may be added here that sid merrick had gone back long after the chase to look for the pocketbook but of course had been unable to get any trace of it  we did  my uncle didnt steal them your uncle put them in his hands to sell went on tad sobber with sudden boldness it is all a cooked up story about his running away with them and its a cooked up story about his having anything to do with those freight thieves my uncle is an honest man  i know all about the freight affair for i overheard him talking to some of the other thieves answered tom where is your uncle now  do you think id be fool enough to tell you  perhaps you mightif i had you locked up  my uncle is a good long way from new york  i heard you tell that man your uncle would be in the city tomorrow  i didnt say any such thing burst out sobber but his manner showed that he was very much disturbed  you did say it where are you stopping  nowherei only got in a few hours ago  did you come here to meet cuffer  what do you know about cuffer  i know your uncle hired him and a man named shelley to visit our farm and get some things belonging to my father  why youre crazy my uncle hardly knows cufferand i never heard of a man named shelley  i am not crazy and you know i am speaking the truth answered tom calmly now you tell me where your uncle is or ill have you arrested  youll not arrest me exclaimed tad sobber and with a sudden movement he twisted himself free from toms grasp you follow me and youll get the worst of it he added and darted across the park at top speed  tom made after the bully but as luck would have it a nurse girl with a baby carriage got between them and before tom could clear himself of the carriage sobber was a good distance away he turned to the eastward down a side street where a large building was in the course of erection he looked back and then skipped into the unfinished building  he shant catch me he muttered to himself and ran to the rear of the building amid piles of bricks and concrete blocks a number of workmen were present but nobody noticed him  reaching the building tom peered inside but saw nothing of the bully he was about to go in when a warning cry reached him from overhead  get back there unless you want to be hurt  tom looked up and saw a workman in the act of throwing down a mass of rubbish broken bricks sticks and old mortar he leaped back and the stuff descended in front of him and raised a cloud of dust  what do you want here young man demanded the superintendent of the building as he came forward  i am after a boy who just ran in here  nobody here that i saw  he just came in  we dont allow skylarking around here you make yourself scarce and the superintendent waved tom away  i want to have that fellow arrestedthat is why he ran away from me  oh thats a different thing go find him if you can  the superintendent stepped aside and tom entered the building but the delay had cost him dear for in the meanwhile tad sobber had made good his escape by running back to the next street tom looked around for over quarter of an hour and then gave up the chase  its too bad but it cant be helped he mused i may as well go back to the park and wait for dick and sam i hope they caught that cuffer  while tom was talking to sobber the other rover boys had followed cuffer to the elevated railroad station a train was just coming in and cuffer bounded up the steps two at a time with the boys not far behind  stop that man cried dick to the crowd coming from the train but before anybody would or could act cuffer had slipped past the man at the ticket box and was trying to board one of the cars dick essayed to follow but the ticket box guard stopped him  not to fast young fellow wheres your ticket  i must catch that manhe is wanted by the police answered dick  thats an old dodge but it dont work with me see you go back and get a ticket said the gateman firmly  but hell get away from me pleaded the eldest rover  if he does its not my fault you cant pass here without a ticket  by this time the train was almost ready to start but sam had procured tickets and he rushed up  there are two tickets he cried come on dick and he sprinted for the train  the guard was closing the platform gate but they managed to squeeze through the train was crowded with people going home from their days work and in the jam they could see nothing of cuffer  but he is on board said dick  i know it returned his brother and we must find him quick you go to the front and ill go to the rear if you locate him tell the trainman you want him arrested at the next station  without another word the brothers separated and each tried to work his way to an end of the train which was composed of five cars this was by no means easy for the crowd was in no humor to be jostled or have its toes stepped upon  look where you are going cried one stout man to sam stop pushing me and then as the youngest rover dodged out of his way he ran his ear into the big feather on a young lady clerks immense hat the girl glared at him and murmured something under her breath which was far from complimentary by the time he had reached the front end of the car half a dozen passengers were his enemies  dick had gone to the rear and as he entered the last car he saw cuffer crouching down in a seat near the door the train was stopping at another station and quick as a flash the fellow arose in the seat shot between dick and a man with several bundles and forced his way out on the platform dick tried to follow but was caught fast by several men  here dont be acting in such a rowdy fashion cried one man in great irritation  you knocked my bundle from my hand added another its a shame the way some roughs act on these trains the authorities ought to have them arrested he went on in a loud voice  whats the trouble in there demanded a policeman who was on the station platform in the crowd  this young fellow is too fresh explained the man who had dropped his bundle  i want to get off thats all said dick  well you behave yourself growled the guardian of the peace and dick was glad enough to get away with this reprimand he saw cuffer running for the stairs and made after him as rapidly as the density of the crowd permitted  when dick gained the street once more the train bearing sam was again on its way downtown cuffer was about a block away running past cooper institute in the direction of the bowery  i may as well keep up the chase and try to run him down thought dick but he wished his brother was with him  at this time of day the bowery always a busy thoroughfare was swarming with people and the numerous barkers for the clothing stores photograph establishments and the like were doing their best to make trade come to them as dick hurried past one clothing establishment a short stocky jew stepped in front of him  vont you step inside young chentleman i sell you some gloding cheap as dirt  i dont want any clothing answered dick briefly  i vos mof next veek und i sell you a suit for next to nodding persisted the clothing dealer  i dont want to buy anything said dick and tried to push past the man the fellow caught him by the arm  if you vill only look at dose peautiful suits vot i haf for twelf dollar  the jew got no further for with a strong push dick sent him staggering among the dummies in front of his store he tried to recover his balance but could not and over he went bringing down two of the dummies on top of him  serves you right flung back dick as he ran on the next time youll know enough to leave me alone  isaac moses sthop dot young mans bawled the clothing dealer as he scrambled to his feet he has ruined two peautiful dummies mit fine suits on sthop him  not to day muttered dick and dodged into the crowd then seeing that cuffer had crossed the street he did the same and continued the pursuit on that side  but to follow anybody long in a crowd on the bowery is not easy and after six blocks had been passed dick came to a halt on a corner in bewilderment he had seen cuffer last on that corner but where the rascal had gone was a question  want a paper asked an urchin close by evening papers  say kid did you see a man run past here just now asked dick  sure i did  where did he go  wot will yer give me if i tell yer asked the newsboy shrewdly  five cents  all right hand over de nickel  here it is and dick showed the money in his hand now where was it  he went in de sunrise hotel down dare i watched him run in  what kind of a hat did he have on  a soft hat wid a big knock in one side  and you are sure he went in that hotel  cross me heart mister i watched him cos he was out o breath an i knowed he was up to somtin  here is your money answered dick and passed the nickel over then he walked to the hotel and paused on the sidewalk to look the place over before entering     chapter x  dick becomes a prisoner   the sunrise hotel had seen better days it was a five story brick building blackened by age and had numerous small windows down in front of which ran an iron fire escape the lower floor was used as a drinking place to one side of which ran a narrow stairs leading to an office and a parlor above  looking in over the short doors of the drinking place dick saw that cuffer was not there he rightly surmised that the fellow had gone upstairs to a room he was occupying  perhaps that fellow shelley is with him mused dick if so id like to collar them both  several men were coming and going and nobody paid particular attention to the youth until he gained the dingy office where two men were smoking and talking over the merits of some race horses  what can i do for you asked one of the men abruptly as dick looked around  is a man named cuffer stopping here  the hotel clerk shook his head  perhaps i have the name wrong i mean a man who came in a minute or two agofellow with a soft hat knocked in on the side  oh that chap yes hes hereroom eighteen next floor and the clerk pointed up the stairs for the hotel had no elevator  dick walked up the stairs slowly revolving in his mind what he should do if he met cuffer face to face if he had the man arrested it might lead to legal complications and the voyage in search of treasure isle might be delayed it would be hard to prove that the rascal had done any actual wrong  reaching the upper hallway dick looked at the dingy numbers on the still more dingy doors eighteen proved to be at the rear where it was so dark he could scarcely see  as the youth approached the door he heard a murmur of voices in the room beyond he listened and made out cuffer speaking and then he recognized the voice of shelley  and so i dusted out before i had a chance to get any money from sobber cuffer was saying  well did the rovers catch the young fellow questioned shelley  that i dont know if he didnt know enough to run away he is a fool  you say one of the rovers followed you from the train  yes but i gave him the slip as soon as i reached the bowery answered cuffer with a chuckle  well what are we to do next asked shelley after a pause  there is nothing to do but to wait until tomorrow when merrick arrives  have you any faith in this treasure hunt of his  i have so long as he pays the bills i wouldnt put a cent of my own money in it  has he got enough money to see the thing through  so he says he met the captain of that tramp vessel somewhere and got him interested in the hunt by promising him a share of the find he says as soon as he can get hold of a spaniard who knows the exact location of the island hell set sail  and take the spaniard along  of course the spaniard was one of the chaps who originally took the treasure to the island  well where do we come in  he wants us along because he is afraid the fellows on the vessel will make a fight for the gold and jewels when they are found some of those sailors are pretty bloodthirsty you know he says he is going to take at least four strong men whom he can trust  dick listened with keen interest to this talk which revealed a great deal sid merrick had made an arrangement to go on a voyage after the treasure how soon he would start there was no telling but probably as quickly as he could get ready more than this he expected to have with him the spaniard doranez the fellow who had said he was going to spain to visit his relatives more than likely merrick and doranez were in league with each other and would do all in their power to keep the treasure out of the hands of the rightful owners  if only tom and sam were here thought dick or if only tom has captured tad sobber this is getting lively to say the least  the men were now speaking in a lower tone and he put his ear to the keyhole to catch what they might say then of a sudden the door opened and he found himself confronted by shelley  thought i heard somebody in the hall cried that individual and grabbed dick by the arm  let go answered the youth and tried to break away but cuffer came to shelleys assistance and between them the two men dragged the boy into the room and shut the door after him dick struggled vigorously even when in the apartment until cuffer caught up an empty water pitcher and flourished it over his head  make another move and ill knock you senseless with this he exclaimed and the look on his face showed he meant what he said seeing his captors were too powerful for him dick subsided and was forced into a chair in a corner  been listening to all our talk i suppose said cuffer uglily he was angry to think that dick had been able to follow him after all  i have was the youths bold reply he felt nothing was to be gained by beating around the bush  its a nice business to be in  it is better than the business you are in  i dont think so  i do you fellows are in league with sid merrick and you know what sort he is  see here interrupted shelley now we have him in here what are we going to do with him  you are going to let me out said dick  perhaps we are said cuffer and gave shelley a significant look  let us see if hes got any papers with him suggested shelley and returned the look given to him by his companion  the look meant that they would go through dicks pockets and rob him the men were thorough rascals and if the youth had anything worth taking they meant to have it  you keep out of my pockets cried dick and started to rise from the chair in which he was sitting instantly both men grabbed him and while cuffer held him tightly from the rear shelley caught up a towel and gagged him then a bed sheet was used to tie dick inside of a closet in a corner of the room  listen i think somebody is coming cried cuffer in sudden alarm  keep the boy quiet answered shelley and ran to the hall door just as a knock sounded upon it  whats the racket up here demanded the voice of the hotel clerk  oh we were only trying a vaudeville turn answered shelley coolly we have an engagement for next week  well stop that noise and dont break any of the furniture or youll pay for it growled the clerk and went away it chanced that actors occasionally stopped at the hotel and practised their parts shelley knew of this hence the excuse he gave for the noise made in rendering dick a prisoner  as soon as the clerk had retired cuffer and shelley both paid their attention to dick and with great rapidity they went through his pockets stripping him of his watch and chain and twenty four dollars and a quarter in money they also took a small diamond scarf pin and a ring set with a valuable ruby in one pocket cuffer found several letters and he likewise appropriated these  not such a bad haul was the thiefs comment  of course dick did not submit willingly but with a gag in his mouth and his hands and feet tied tightly he could do but little as soon as the men had taken his things from him they shut the closet door upon him and locked it a few minutes later all became quiet showing that they had left the room  the closet was small and stuffy and in this warm weather made dick perspire freely but without waiting to make certain that the men were really gone he commenced to work upon his bonds and the gag in his mouth  it was no light task and it was a good quarter of an hour before he got one hand loose  then he freed his other hand and undid the troublesome gag which had all but smothered him and then unfastened his feet  he was still a prisoner in the closet the door of which was an old fashioned one and thick but by bracing his feet against the back wall dick got a firm hold and soon his shoulder on the barrier caused it to bend and creak then the lock gave way and the door flew open with a bang  a glance around the room showed that the men had flown and for good for two valises which had stood in a corner were missing  dick leaped to the hall door only to find it locked from the outside  they must have gone that way he reasoned after a look out of the window and then he rapped on the door loudly  it was several minutes before anybody answered his summons then an ignorant looking chambermaid appeared  phot does yez want she demanded in a strong irish brogue  i am locked in let me out answered dick  after some fumbling the chambermaid found her key and unlocked the door she gazed at dick in some surprise for she saw that he was excited  sure i didnt know yez had that room she said  did you see the two men who had this room demanded the youth  i did not  they robbed me and ran away  saints preserve us robbed ye of phat  of everything i had sure you didnt see em  not since this marnin  well they must have just gone out said dick and ran down the stairs and to the office here he found the place deserted the clerk having gone down to the dining room for his supper and nobody else being on duty the clerk listened to his story with small interest and shrugged his shoulders  dont see what i can do he said we aint responsible for our guests you had better go and see the police i hope you catch them for such rascals give hotels bad reputations  do you know the men at all  no never set eyes on em until a couple of days ago then they came in hired that room and came and went to suit themselves one was named brown and the other smithat least thats the names on the register  those were fake names then you wont help me to catch them  i dont see what i can do answered the clerk calmly we are not to blame for this you can see that for yourself  dick could see and after a few words more he left the hotel feeling very depressed in spirits he spent an hour in looking up and down the bowery for cuffer and shelley but without success then as it was getting late he returned to the hotel at which he and the rest of his family were putting up     chapter xi  aboard the steam yacht   mr rover as well as tom and sam had come in and all were anxious to hear what dick might have to report they were filled with amazement at the story of the robbery  i thought id wait about telling the police until i had heard what you had to say said dick to his father  i am afraid in a big city like new york it wont do much good to tell the police answered anderson rover however we can report it to morrow but i think cuffer and shelley will keep in the shade until they see sid merrick and have a chance to get away and in this surmise mr rover was correct the matter was reported to the police and that was the end of it so far as the authorities went for they failed to apprehend the evildoers  mr rover was much worried when he learned that merrick had fallen in with a captain of a tramp vessel who was ready to go on a hunt for the treasure and he was still more worried when dick told him of the letters which had been abstracted from his coat pocket by the thieves among them was one from mrs stanhope mentioning the treasure hunt and how she would be on hand at philadelphia to board the steam yacht with dora and the lanings  if cuffer and shelley turn that letter over to merrick it will give him some idea of our proposed trip said mr rover and more than likely he will strain every nerve to get ahead of us  his vessel may not be able to sail as fast as our steam yacht said tom  that is true tom but he may get down among the west indies before we can locate treasure isle and then hell have as good a chance as ourselves moreover if he should land on the isle at the time we did   thered be a hot time thats sure said the funloving boy with a grin  do you think theyd fight asked sam  yes if they saw a chance of getting the best of us answered his father  i wish i had caught tad sobber came from tom regretfully  that might have done some good but i doubt it said anderson rover from what i have learned of this sid merrick he is a man bound to do as he sees fit regardless of those around him when the freight thieves were captured he managed to get away and hell try to get away even if we catch tad cuffer and shelley  i guess he is a worse man than arnold baxter was was dicks comment he referred to an old enemy of the rovers who had now reformed  much worse than either mr baxter or his son dan ever were answered mr rover if caught in a corner i think this merrick would be capable of any wicked thing  what do you advise asked tom  we will go to philadelphia as soon as possible and get the steam yacht ready for the trip the best way to foil merrick and his crowd is to find the isle get possession of the treasure and get away before they know what we are doing answered anderson rover  on the following day the party was rejoined by songbird and then all journeyed to philadelphia taking aleck pop with them they found the rainbow tied up to a dock along the delaware river and went aboard the master of the craft captain barforth was on hand to greet them and he speedily made them feel at home the captain was a big good natured man of about forty and the boys knew they would like him the moment they saw him  well this is certainly a swell boat said sam after an inspection and as clean as a whistle  puts me in mind of the deserted steam yacht we boarded in the gulf of mexico answered dick referring to a happening which has been related in detail in the rover boys in southern waters  wonder if well have as many adventures as we did on that boat mused dick those were hot times eh  well not lack for adventures if we come into contact with merrick and his gang answered songbird who had been told all the details of the adventures in new york  there were six single and four double staterooms aboard the steam yacht so the rovers and their friends were not crowded for accommodations since even a single room contained two berths an upper and a lower each room was done in white and gold giving it a truly aristocratic appearance there was a good deal of brass and nickel plated work and the metal shone like a mirror  i declare its most too good to use said sam when on a tour of inspection this craft must have cost a sight of money  it did answered his father but the owner is a millionaire so he can well afford it  the boys were as much interested in the machinery as in anything and they visited the engine room and became acquainted with frank norton the head engineer they learned that the engine was of the most modern type and that the rainbow in spite of her breadth of beam she was rather wide could make twenty to twenty six knots an hour in an ordinary sea  and weve got a licence to go where we please added the head engineer proudly  now that they were aboard the steam yacht the rover boys were anxious to be sailing but they were also anxious to greet their friends and they awaited the arrival of the others with interest fred garrison and hans mueller came in together the following noon hans lugging a dress suit case that was as big almost as a dog house  here we are again sang out fred dropping his baggage and shaking hands all around i declare its like when we went on the houseboat trip  maybe i tont vos glad to drop dot leetle drunk alretty said hans indicating his baggage he vos veigh most a don i dink  why didnt you let an expressman bring it asked dick  not much declared the german youth shaking his head vigorously vonce i haf a pox mid a new hat in him und i say to a poy carry dot und i gif you den cents vell he is carrying dot yet i dink for i tont see dot hat no more nefer  well you wont have to carry any more baggage for a long while to come said mr rover with a smile and then had aleck take the things below when hans saw the elegant staterooms and the main saloon of the steam yacht with its beautiful mirrors and rich carvings his eyes bulged out like saucers  mine cracious he gasped vos dis der poat we sail in udder vos dis a poat pelonging to mr vanderfellow or some of dose udder millionaires  this is the boat said tom with a wink at the others of course its rather plain hans but maybe youll get used to it  blain vy dom  there are only six kinds of baths aboard cold hot soda milk mustard and cream de fizz but if you want any other kind all youve got to do is to ask the ships carpenter about it  six kinds of paths vy i tont vos  and then at meals the cook serves only five kinds of dessert pie fruit iced cabbage vinegar sherbit and hot lardalumpabus of course i know you dont like pie and fruit and things like that but youll fall dead in love with the lardalumpabus went on the funloving rover  vot is dot lardapusalump ennahow queried hans scratching his head gravely i tont remember him  why its a compote with frizzled gizzardinus and pollylolly its delicious served with cream and saltbut you want lots of salt hans lots of salt  maybe i try him i tont know answered the german youth gravely and then even tom had to turn away to keep from roaring in hans face  the rover boys went to the depot to meet the train which was to bring in the stanhopes and the lanings there was a little delay but it was soon over and they were shaking hands warmly all around  it seems so delightful to go off on another trip said dora to dick i know i am going to enjoy it very much  and i know i am going to enjoy it toowith you along answered dick with a smile which spoke volumes  mother is quite excitedthinking she is going on a treasure hunt went on dora but i think a few days rest on shipboard will quiet her nerves  i hope for your sake dora our hunt proves successful added dick gallantly  i have always wanted to go to the west indies said nellie lanning to tom i want to pick some ripe bananas and cocoanuts right from the trees  yes and ripe oranges put in grace wont it be jolly she added turning to sam  too jolly for anything murmured sam and then he gave graces arm a little squeeze and led her through the crowd to where a carriage was in waiting  there were trunks to be looked after but the checks for these were turned over to aleck and the colored man saw to it that all the baggage was properly transferred to the steam yacht  it was with not a little pride that the boys took the stanhopes and the lanings aboard the rainbow for although they did not own the elegant craft it was something to even have her under charter mr rover met the newcomers at the gangplank and made them welcome  oh but isnt this just too lovely for anything cried dora as she surveyed the double stateroom assigned to her and her mother and look at the fine bunch of roses on the stand she looked at dick this is some of your doings isnt it  yes  thank you very much but you must have one and the girl promptly pinned one of the largest in his buttonhole  this is more than comfortable said mrs stanhope with a sigh of satisfaction and then she sank down in an easy chair to rest for the long journey from cedarville had greatly fatigued her  in the meantime the other boys had taken the lanings to another double stateroom equally luxurious here a vase held a big bunch of carnations the gift of tom and sam combined nellie and grace and their mother were much pleased and said so  tom i could almost hug you for this cried nellie in a low voice  well nobody is stopping you he added promptly  all right i willon your next birthday cried nellie not to be caught but really im a thousand times obliged to you  this is like a room in a fairies palace exclaimed grace i know when i go to sleep ill dream of fairies and rainbows and pots of gold  the gold we want to unearth broke in sam just dream where that is located and then tell us of it  oh youll be sure to find that  how do you know  oh you never fail in anything and grace gave him a sunny smile  i dont know about that grace this is going to be no easy task  oh i know that sam but youll win in the end i know you will  i trust we dofor your sake as much as for the others you know if it is found a good share of the treasure goes to your mother  yes and that will be awfully nice  maybe if you get all that money you wont notice poor me  poor you why youll have a great deal more than well have anyway you are rich already  well if you get the money you wont forget me will you persisted sam  what a queer boy you are sam forget you well just try me with the money and see she added and gave him one of her warmest smiles then she danced off to look at the rest of the steam yacht and the youngest rover followed her     chapter xii  something about firecrackers   all was in readiness for departure but one thing and that was the most important of all bahama bill had not put in an appearance and was not expected until the evening of the fourth of july  we shall have to remain over the fourth after all said anderson rover but i imagine that will suit you boys for you can stay in the city and have some fun  it did suit all the young folks and they immediately planned a fine automobile tour for the afternoon hiring two autos large enough to accommodate all of the girls and boys the morning was spent in and around the yacht where tom and some of the others amused themselves by shooting off their pistols and some firecrackers tom had purchased some things for the fourth the day previous and he had one package which he was careful to keep out of sight  i am going to have a barrel of fun with the girls he said to his brothers but dont tell anybody about it  what is it asked his younger brother  wait and see  it had been arranged that the whole party should have an early lunch so that they might start on the automobile ride by one oclock aleck was in charge of the dining room of the yacht and he had spread himself in trimming it with red white and blue streamers and small flags  oh how lovely cried dora as she came in and sat down i declare aleck you deserve a great deal of credit and she gave the colored man a smile which pleased him immensely  where is tom asked mr rover after all the others were seated  i tont know answered hans tidnt he know ve vos to eat a leetle early to tay  hes coming answered sam  just then tom came into the dining room holding something in his hand covered with a long paper bag from under the bag smoke was curling  in honor of the fourth of july cried the funloving rover and placed the object upright in the center of the long table then he took off the bag with a flourish there was revealed a big cannon cracker fully a foot and a half high and several inches in diameter the fuse was spluttering away at a great rate  tom yelled mr rover in alarm throw that thing out  well be blown to pieces yelled fred  thats too big to shoot off indoors added songbird preparing to run  ve peen knocked to bieces groaned hans and slid under the table out of sight  the ladies shrieked and so did the girls mrs stanhope looked ready to faint but tom whispered hastily into her ear and she recovered mr rover wanted to throw the cannon cracker through a window but tom held him back  the long fuse continued to splutter and all watched it as if fascinated and the girls put their hands to their ears in anticipation of a fearful explosion then came a tiny flash a strange clicking and off flew the top of the cannon cracker sending a shower of confetti of various colors in all directions  oh shrieked the girls and then everybody but hans set up a laugh the german youth looked suspiciously out from under the table  vots der madderdid he go off he questioned  yes he did hans answered grace it was nothing but a cracker full of colored paper instead of powder  is dot so hans got up and looked around vell i neffer looks like ve got a colored snowstorm alretty hey and this caused a roar it certainly did look like a colored snowstorm for the confetti was everywhere on the table on their heads and over their clothing now it was over everybody was highly amused even mrs stanhope laughing heartily as for aleck he roared so loudly he could be heard a block up the docks  dats jess like massa tom he cried i suspicioned hed be up to someting afo de day was up yo cant keep him down no mo dan yo kin keep a jack rabbit from hoppin no sah  it certainly looked like the real thing was mr rovers comment had it been  id never have brought it in here finished tom im sorry if i frightened anybody he added looking at mrs stanhope and mrs laning  well forgive you tom answered mrs stanhope and mrs laning said she would provided he wouldnt scare them again that holiday  after that the confetti on the table was cleared away and they ate their lunch amid a constant cracking of jokes and bright sayings songbird woke up and recited some verses he said he had composed the night before while lying awake in his berth some of these ran in this fashion  this is the day i love the best the day the small boy knows no rest the day when all our banners soar the day when all our cannons roar the day when all are free from care and shouts and music fill the air  good for songbird cried sam  go on please came from the girls and the poet of putnam hall continued  i love this land of liberty from mountains down to flowing sea i love its cities and its plains its valleys and its rocky chains im glad to know that we are free and so forever may we be  hurrah songbird you ought to have that put to music cried dick  maybe i will some day answered the wouldbe poet modestly  i dink i make some boetry up too remarked hans after several minutes of serious thought on his part chust you listen vonce and he began  dis is der day ven crackers bust und fill der air mid bowder tust und ven you shoots your bistol off you make a smokes vot makes you cough a rocket goes up in der sky der sthick vos hit you in der eye  three cheers for hans shouted tom clapping the german lad on the back for real first class a no 1 first chop poetry that cant be beat and then as the others screamed with laughter tom went on  a little boy a can of powder a scratch a flash hes gone to chowder  oh tom what horrible poetry cried nellie as she shivered  well i couldnt help it he said i had to say something oror bust perhaps this will suit you better and he continued  a little boy a great big gun a father yelling on the run the trigger falls there is a roar the father halts the dangers oer  tom youre positively the worst boy ever said nellie but the way she spoke told she meant just the opposite  i tell you vot ve vos do tom suggested hans ve vos form a boetry association alretty hey songpirt can be der bresident  what will you be secretary asked fred  no i vos peen treasurer answered hans  hans wants the money put in dick  dots it answered the german youth calmly ven dem udder fellers makes up pad verses i vos fine dem a tollar und ven i gits enough tollars i skip me to canada or mexigo hey and he said this so comically everybody had to laugh  the automobiles had been ordered down to the dock and were already in waiting each was in charge of a chauffeur and soon the boys and girls went ashore and piled in dick and dora sam and grace and fred got in the first turnout and the others in the second  now do not go too far said mrs stanhope and be sure and keep on roads that are safe  and do not stay out later than ten oclock this evening added mrs laning  oh well be back safe and sound and on time cried dick so dont worry about us  those are both powerful machines was mr rovers comment be careful that you dont exceed the speed limits or you may be arrested  providing they catch us answered tom with a grin  it had been decided that they should go out into the country by the way of germantown and soon they were bowling along in fine fashion over the smooth city pavement here and there they met crowds shooting off pistols and firecrackers  it is good we havent horses said sam this racket might cause them to run away  that is where the automobilist has the advantage over a horse driver sam answered his big brother but i must say some of the young fellows on the street are rather careless  scarcely had dick spoken when the big machine rounded a corner and speeded through a crowd of what were evidently factory hands they were shooting off pistols and firecrackers and raised a great din then one ugly looking young fellow lighted a firecracker and sent it toward the automobile it landed directly in doras lap  oh screamed dora and tried to draw away  as quick as a flash dick leaned forward and caught up the firecracker as he threw it out of the automobile it exploded close by  do that again and ill come back at you shouted the elder rover and shook his fist at the fellow in the street  dick did it hurt you asked dora anxiously  oh it burst my little finger a trifle thats all was the reply the finger smarted quite some but dick did not want to show it  we ought to go back and punch his head was sams comment  wonder if theyll try that game on the other auto said fred as he arose to look back  he saw the street rough throw a lighted firecracker at the other machine it landed on the floor of the tonneau but like a flash tom was after it the funloving rover held it up took aim and sent it straight at the fellow who had first launched it bang went the firecracker right close to the roughs left ear he set up a howl of pain for he had been burnt enough to make it smart well  there hes paid back said fred and then the two automobiles passed on leaving the roughs in the distance     chapter xiii  a wild automobile ride   this is glorious  it certainly could not be finer dick  some day dora i am going to take you for a long ride went on dick i mean some day after we get home with that treasure he added in a lower tone so that the chauffeur might not hear  thats a long time off dick  perhaps not so long  and what are you going to do after this hunt is over  go to college i guess it is not yet fully decided for we dont know what college to go to  i hope dora broke off short  what dora  oh i was just thinking mamma thinks that i might go to college if i went it would be nice if we went to two places that were near each other  nice it would be the best ever cried dick enthusiastically  they were running along a country road a good many miles from philadelphia all the noise of the city had been left behind and it was as calm and peaceful as one would wish the second machine was only a short distance behind the first and each was making not less than thirty miles per hour  do you know some day i am going to make a regular tour in an auto remarked sam i am sure a fellow could have lots of fun  you can have this machine any time you want to said the chauffeur who had taken greatly to the party  well remember answered dick indifferently he did not particularly fancy the fellow for he was rather familiar and his breath smelt of liquor twice he had talked of stopping at road houses but dick had told him to go on fearful that he might drink too much  a hill was before the automobiles but both machines climbed it without an effort from the top of the hill a fine view was to be obtained and here a hotel had been located and this displayed a sign which interested the boys and girls very much  ice cream soda water root beer best candy  let us stop for some ice cream suggested songbird and he yelled to those in the automobile ahead  all of the girls loved ice cream so despite dicks anxiety over his chauffeur a stop was made and the boys and girls filed into the hotel for the treat dick lingered behind to speak to both of the machine drivers for he saw that the second man was of the same thirsty type as the other  do you smoke he asked  sure was the reply from both  then here is a quarter with which you can buy some cigars and please remember no drinking he added significantly  cant a fellow have a drink if he wants it demanded the chauffeur of the first car  not while you have my party out was dicks reply  well a fellow gets thirsty driving a car in this dust grumbled the second chauffeur  if you are thirsty there is plenty of water handy and root beer and soda water too i meant liquor when i spoke  oh well keep straight enough dont you worry said the first chauffeur and then both of them turned away to a side entrance of the hotel  dick was much worried but he did not let the rest see it he joined the crowd in the ice cream pavillion attached to the hotel and there they spent an hour eating ice cream water ices and cake then some of the lads went off and got several boxes of bonbons and chocolates to take along on the rest of the trip  when they went out to the two automobiles the chauffeurs were missing a man was trimming a hedge nearby and dick asked him if he had seen the pair  must be over to the barroom said the gardener that hellig loves his liquor and snall likes a glass too  was hellig the driver of this first car  yes and snall ran the second  just then tom came up having placed nellie in the second car  whats the trouble dick he questioned  i am afraid both our men have gone off to drink this man says they both love their liquor  they do and both of em have been locked up for reckless driving but dont say i told you said the gardener  humph this is serious murmured tom i dont like to trust a chauffeur who drinks  come with me said his brother in a low tone just wait for us he shouted to the others who were now in the two cars  he walked behind the ice cream pavillion tom at his side and then the pair reached a side door connecting with the hotel barroom they looked in and at a small table saw the two chauffeurs drinking liquor from a bottle set before them both were rather noisy and had evidently been imbibing freely  i wont let no boy run me and tell me what i shall take they heard hellig say thickly  ill drink what i please and when i please answered snall let us have another nat  sure  this is the worst ever murmured tom they are in no fit condition to run the cars i wouldnt trust my neck with either of them  and i am not going to trust the lives of the girls in their care answered dick firmly  what are you going to do  i dont know yet but one thing is settled they shant take us back  i think i could run one carif we didnt go too fast suggested tom who had run several machines at various times in his lively career  i could run the other  then let us do it dick those fellows dont own the cars and we didnt hire from them we hired from the owner of the garage i guess we have a right to run them under the circumstances  the two boys walked back to the automobiles all of the others were now anxious to know what was wrong and they had to give the particulars  oh dick you must not let them run the cars cried grace turning pale  id rather have you and tom run them ten times over declared dora  while the party was talking the two chauffeurs came from the hotel and walked unsteadily towards the automobiles their faces were red and their eyes blinked unsteadily  stop called dick when they were some distance away and the gardener and some guests of the hotel gathered around to see what was the matter  what yer want growled hellig thickly  we are going to leave you both here and run the cars ourselves answered dick coldly you are not fit to run them  whats the reason we aint mumbled snall he could hardly speak  youve been drinking too muchthats the reason  humph  we are going to run them machines an dont you forgit it mumbled hellig and lurched forward  dont you ride with those intoxicated fellows said one of the hotel guests  we dont intend to answered dick all ready tom he called out  yes  then go ahead ill catch up to you  hi you stop screamed snall as one of the automobiles began to move off down the road but tom paid no attention to him  running swiftly dick reached the other car and hopped up to the chauffeurs seat he had watched the driver operate the car and knew exactly what to do he soon had the engine running and then he threw in the speed clutch just as hellig lurched up  you mustnt ran away with that machine he roared  keep away cried sam and leaning out of the car he gave the chauffeur a shove that sent him flat on his back in the dust of the road then the car moved off as those in the automobile looked back they saw hellig arise and shake his fist after them and snall waved his arms wildly  well hear from them again i suppose said sam  and theyll hear from me answered dick and the fellow who sent them out to run the cars for us will hear from me too he added  tom was quite a distance ahead but they soon caught up to his car by this time they were out of sight and hearing of the hotel and going down the other side of the hill they had come up  if you wish you can take the lead said the funloving rover to his older brother i dont know a thing about these roads  well have to trust to luck and the signboards returned dick  it will be all right if only you dont get on some road that is impassible put in fred  and get stuck thirty miles from nowhere added songbird  you stick to dem roads vot haf stones on de got said hans wisely tont you vos drust der car to der tirt roads no  i shall follow hans advice and stick to the good roads said dick i think the signboards will help us to get back to philadelphia sooner or later  they sped down the hill and there found the road turned to the left and crossed a small stream then they reached a corner with several signboards  hurrah thats the way to philly cried sam  but it doesnt say how many miles protested grace  never mind we are bound to get there before dark and that is all we care came from nellie  in the exhilaration of running the cars dick and tom soon forgot about the trouble with the chauffeurs it was great sport and as soon as dick got the hang of it as he said he let the speed out notch by notch his car ran a trifle more easily than did the other and before long he was a good half mile ahead of that run by tom those in the rear shouted for him to slow down but the wind prevented him from hearing their calls  this is something like isnt it said dick to dora who was beside him  oh it is splendid she replied enthusiastically i feel as if i could go on riding forever  an auto certainly beats a team all to bits if the road is good  they passed up another hill and then through a patch of woods then they made a sharp turn and the car began to descend over a road that was filled with loose stones  say dick youd better slow up cautioned sam as the machine gave a quick lurch over a stone this road isnt as smooth as it was  i know it  i saw a road to our right said grace perhaps we should have taken that  there was no time to say more for the automobile was jouncing over the stones in too lively a manner alarmed dick who had already shut off the power applied the brake but he was not used to this and he jammed it fast so it did not altogether prevent the car from advancing  oh we must stop screamed dora a moment later look ahead  dick did so and his heart gave a leap of fear below them the stony road was narrow and on one side was a rocky gully and on the other some thick bushes in the roadway was a farmer with a large farm wagon filled with lime should they hit the turnout below somebody would surely be hurt and perhaps killed     chapter xiv  what a roman candle did   it was a time for quick action and it was a lucky thing that dick rover had been in perilous positions before and knew enough not to lose his presence of mind as the others in the automobile arose to leap out he called to them  sit down dont jump ill look out for things  then even as he spoke dick turned the steering wheel and sent the big machine crashing into the bushes to one side of the roadway he chose a spot that was comparatively level and in five seconds they came to a halt just in front of half a dozen trees  we must take care of toms machine cried sam and leaped over the back of the automobile the machine had cut down the bushes so the path was clear and he ran with might and main to the roadway at the top of the hill was the second car coming along at a good speed  stop stop he yelled frantically and waved his arms in the air  tom saw the movement and knew at once something was wrong he threw off the power and applied the emergency brake and the automobile just passed sam and no more  whats the matter came from everyone in the second car  thats whats the matter answered sam pointing to the foot of the rocky hill that wagonwell i declare  the youngest rover stared and well he might for the farmers turnout with the load of lime had disappeared from view the farmer had turned into a field at the bottom of the hill just as dick turned his car into the bushes  i dont see anything said nellie and then sam had to explain and point out the situation of the first car  i guess i can get down the hill well enough said tom but this appears to be a poor road we ought to try to find something better  all those in the second car got out and walked to that which was stalled in the bushes they found dick and fred walking around the machine trying to learn if any damage had been done  we might have kept right on said sam and explained why  well we are here and now comes the problem of getting back on the road said the eldest rover i dont think i can back very well in here  better make a turn on the down grade suggested sam we can cut down some of the big bushes that are in the way and fill up some of the holes with stones  it was decided to do this and all of the boys took off their coats and went to work soon they had a fairly clear path and after backing away a few feet from the trees dick turned downward in a semi circle and got out once more on the road this time he was mindful to use the brake with care and consequently he gained the bottom of the stony hill without further mishap and the second machine came after him  there is that farmer said songbird why not ask him about the roads  i will said dick and stalked into the field  this aint no good road to philadelphia said the farmer when questioned better go back up the hill and take the road on the right  we cant get back very well  then you had better go along this road and take the first turn to the left and after that the next turn to the right youll have about three miles o poor roads but then youll be all right but the distance to the city is six miles longer  there was no help for it and they went on over dirt roads which were anything but good they had to go slowly and tom kept the second car far to the rear to escape the thick dust sent up by the leading machine  this isnt so fine declared dick with a grimace at dora i am sorry we took that false turn at the top of the hill  oh well have to take the bitter with the sweet answered the girl lightly  i shant mind it if you dont dora  dont worry dick i am not minding it a bit i am only glad we got rid of that intoxicated chauffeur he might have gotten us into far more trouble than this  inside of an hour they found themselves on a good stone road and reached a signboard put up by the automobile association telling the exact distance to philadelphia this set them at ease mentally and they started off at a speed of twenty miles an hour tom wanted to let her out as he put it but nellie demurred and so he kept to the rear as before  but some day i am going to have a machine of my own said he and it is going to do some speeding i can tell you that  yah and der first dings you know dom you vos ub a dree odder you sphlit a rock insides owid warned hans ven i ride so fast like dot i valk i pet you  it was dark long before the city was reached and they had to stop to light the lamps and they also had to fix the batteries of the second car fred who was getting hungry suggested they stop somewhere for something to eat but the girls demurred  wait until the ride is ended said dora then we can take our time over supper  as night came on they saw fireworks displayed here and there and enjoyed the sights greatly  ive got some fireworks on the yacht said tom i reckon ill be rather late setting them off  while they were yet three miles from the river they stopped at a drug store and there dick telephoned to the owner of the machines explaining matters and asking the man to send down to the dock for the cars  hes pretty angry said dick as he leaped into the automobile again he says we had no right to run off with the cars  well he had no right to send us off with those awful chauffeurs answered dora  oh im not afraid of anything hell do answered dick  nevertheless he was a bit anxious as he reached the dock and he lost no time in sending the girls to the yacht with songbird and he asked his chum to send mr rover ashore  a minute later a light runabout spun up and a tall thin man with a sour face leaped out and strode up to the two machines  who hired these machines i want to know he demanded i did answered dick boldly are you the manager of the garage  i am and i want to know by what right youve been running the cars without the regular drivers  we wanted to get back to the city and the chauffeurs were in no condition to bring us back put in tom  what have you to do with it young man  i drove one car and my brother here drove the other we didnt hurt the machines and you ought to be glad we brought them back in good condition  humph you hadnt any license to run them  we took the liberty of doing so said dick if you want to get angry about it ill get angry myself you had no right to place those cars in the hands of unreliable men you risked our lives by so doing  those men are reliable enough one of them telephoned to me you had run away with the autos  the folks at the dardell hotel will tell you how reliable they were i warned them not to drink but they did and they were in no condition to run any automobile  i dont allow just anybody to run my machines stormed the man they are expensive pieces of property  well they are not worth as much as our necks not by a good deal said tom  dont you get impudent young fellow  he is not impudent said dick your machines are all rightwe didnt hurt them in the least but i can tell you one thing he proceeded earnestly we dont propose to pay for the hire of the chauffeurs  thats the talk broke in fred pay him for the use of the cars only  youll pay the whole bill growled the automobile owner  not a cent more than the hire of the two cars said tom  the man began to storm and threatened to have them locked up for running the cars without a license but in the end he accepted the money dick offered him  maybe you havent heard the end of this he muttered  if you make trouble perhaps ill do the same answered dick and then he and the others went aboard the yacht where a late supper awaited them mr rover had heard of the unreliable chauffeurs and he was even more indignant than his sons  i dont think that owner will show himself again he said if he does ill take care of him the man was never heard of and that ended the affair  we had a splendid time anyway declared grace and the other girls agreed with her  tom had not forgotten about his fireworks and after supper he invited the crowd to the deck and gave them quite an exhibition  here hans you can set off this roman candle he said presently show the ladies how nicely you can do it but take off your coat and roll up your shirt sleeve before you begin he added with a dig into sams ribs which meant watch for fun  quite innocently the german lad took off his coat and rolled his shirt sleeve up over his elbow then he took the big roman candle and lit it  now swing it around lively cried tom and hans began to describe little circles with the roman candle soon the sparks began to pour forth and not a few came down on the bare wrist and forearm  ouch ouch yelled hans dancing around ach du meine zeit say somepody sthop dot i vos purn mineselluf ub alretty  swing it around quicker cried dick  turn it in the shape of a figure eight suggested fred  loop the loop with it came from sam  around and around went the roman candle and then bang out shot a ball hitting one of the masts of the steam yacht then bang went another ball hitting the top of the cabin  hold it up straighter hans said songbird dont shoot somebody  if i hold him ub i burn mineselluf worser groaned the german youth here you dake him sam i got enough  no no hans i wont deprive you of the pleasure of shooting it off answered the youngest rover and skipped out of the way  one after another the balls red white and blue poured from the roman candle it was a pretty sight but hans aim was more than bad and one hit the bow and another the stern while a third whizzed past dicks ear in the meantime hans was hopping around like a madman trying to keep the sparks from his skin  throw it overboard cried mr rover who was enjoying the fun but who was afraid somebody might get a fire ball in the face  only a few more balls left said tom hans try to hit the top of the mast dont point it downward  the german youth was too excited to listen to the advice he continued to dance around bang went another ball and entered the cabin of the steam yacht bang came the final one and that too disappeared into the interior of the craft then the roman candle went out and hans breathed a sigh of relief  i vos glat dot is ofer he said no more firevorks for me not on your kollarbuttons no  i hope they didnt do any damage in the cabin began mrs stanhope anxiously when there came a cry from aleck pop  stop dat fire from comin down yelled the colored man de hull cabins in a blaze     chapter xv  the sailing of the steam yacht   the announcement made by aleck pop filled all on board the steam yacht with consternation and while hans still nursed his arm and wrist the other boys with anderson rover and captain barforth rushed down the companionway  a glance showed them what was the matter one of the balls of fire had struck a curtain and ignited the flimsy material the fire was now dropping down on some fireworks tom had left on a chair just as they entered a pinwheel lying flat began to fizz sending a shower of sparks across the other pieces  quick out with that stuff cried anderson rover and sent the pinwheel flying into a corner with his hand then he stepped on it putting out the fire  in the meantime dick and sam pulled down the burning curtain and stamped on that the others scattered the fireworks and saw to it that not a spark remained in the cabin  a close call murmured captain barforth when the excitement was over it is lucky we got down here so soon  i was thinkin de hull ship was gwine ter bust up said aleck with a shiver dis chile knows jess how quick fireworks kin go off i see a big combustication of dem one summer in a hotel where i was waiting da had to call de fire department to put dem out an da shot out moah dan a dozen winders too  we had a similar trouble when the yacht club had a celebration said the captain a japanese lantern dropped on some rockets and set them off the rockets flew in all directions and one struck a deck hand in the arm and he had to go to the hospital to be treated we have had a lucky escape  the accident put a damper on more celebrating and tom was requested to store away what remained of the fireworks little did he dream of how useful those fireworks were to become in the future  early on the following morning bahama bill presented himself the boys had been told how he looked yet they had all they could do to keep from smiling when he presented himself he was a short thickset man with broad shoulders and legs which were very much bowed he wore his reddish hair long and also sported a thick beard he had a squint in one eye which as sam said gave him the appearance of looking continually over his shoulder when he talked his voice was an alternate squeak and rumble  well of all the odd fellows i ever met he is the limit was toms comment why hed do for a comic valentine  i almost had to laugh in his face said sam even now i cant look at him without grinning  hes a character was dicks opinion youll never get tired with that chap around and in this surmise he was correct for bahama bill was as full of sea yarns as some fish are full of bones and he was willing to talk as long as anybody would listen to him  very much pleased to know ye all said he with a profound bow to the ladies aint seen such a nice crowd since i sailed on the mary elizabeth up the coast o maine jest fourteen years ago at that time we had on board captain riggers wife his mother in law his two sisters his brothers wife his aunt and  never mind the rigger family just now camel interrupted mr rover what i want to know is are you ready to sail  aye aye that i am and i dont care if its a for two months or two years once when i sailed on the sunflower the captain said wed be out a month and we struck a storm and drifted almost over to the coast a africy the water ran low and  well if you are ready to sail well start without further delay interrupted anderson rover and gave the necessary orders to captain barforth  good bye to home cried dick and took off his cap when we return may we have the treasure safely stowed away in the hold or the cabin  so say we all of us sang out tom  steam was already up and a cloud of smoke was pouring from the funnel of the steam yacht the lines were cast off and a few minutes later the vessel was on her voyage down the delaware river to the bay  you are sure we have everything necessary for this trip asked mr rover of the captain  yes mr rover i even brought along some picks and shovels answered the master of the steam yacht and smiled faintly he had little faith in the treasure hunt being successful but he thought the trip down among the west indies would be well worth taking  it was a beautiful day with just sufficient breeze blowing to cool the july air while they were steaming down the river the girls and ladies and some of the boys sat on the forward deck taking in the various sights which presented themselves there were numerous tugs and sailing craft and now and then a big tramp steamer or regular liner for philadelphia has a large commerce with the entire world  it hardly seems possible that the treasure hunt has really begun said dora to dick  well it wont actually begin until we are down about where treasure isle is located was the reply we have quite a few days sailing before that time comes  i hope it remains clear dick  i am afraid it wont dora there are always more or less storms among the west indies  i have heard they sometimes have terrible hurricanes came from grace i read of one hurricane which flooded some small islands completely  grace is trying to scare us cried nellie  well islands have been swept by hurricanes said sam coming to the rescue of his dearest girl friend but let us hope we escape all heavy storms  a steam yacht is not as bad off as a sailing vessel said dick if necessary we can run away from a heavy storm in a high wind its a sailing ship that catches it  by nightfall they had passed out of delaware bay into the atlantic ocean and then the course was changed to almost due south as soon as they got out on the long swells the rainbow commenced to toss and pitch considerably  now you can sing a life on the ocean wave cried dick to songbird how does this suit you  elegant was the reply and then the wouldbe poet began to warble  i love the rolling ocean with all its strange commotion and all the washing wavelets that hit us on the side i love to hear the dashing of the waves and see the splashing of the foam that chums around us as on we glide  gee christopher cried sam say songbird that rhyme is enough to make one dizzy  i dink dot boetry vos make me tizzy already came from hans as he sat down on a nearby chair his face growing suddenly pale  hullo hans is sick cried tom hans i thought you had better sea legs than that  i vosnt sick at all dom only vell der ship looks like be vos going to dake a summersaults already kvick  youre seasick said sam better go to your stateroom and lie down  i tont vos going to get seasick protested the german youth  think of hansy getting seasick cried fred thats the best yet and he laughed heartily shall i hold your head for you he asked with a grin  i guess it vos der fireworks yesterday done him said hans weakly and staggered off to the cabin  thats kind of rough to twit him fred remarked dick  oh i only meant it in fun  maybe youll get seasick yourself  not much if i do i have a remedy in my trunk that i brought from home  youd better give the remedy to hans  i will  fred went below and got the bottle of medicine from his dress suit case as he did this his own head began to swim around much to his alarm  here hans is a dose for you he said entering the stateroom where the german youth was rolling around on the berth  vot ist it for groaned the sufferer  seasickness  den gif it to me kvick gif me apout two quarts  it says take a tablespoonful said fred reading the label with difficulty here you are  he administered the medicine which hans took without a murmur although it was very bitter then he tried to take a dose himself but his stomach suddenly went back on him and he let the bottle fall with a crash to the floor  oh my you vos lose all dot goot medicine cried hans in alarm  ii know it groaned fred and ieri need it so much  vot you seasick too ha ha dots vot you gits for boking fun at me yah and hans smiled in spite of his anguish  it was certainly poetic justice that fred should get seasick and that the malady should affect him far more seriously than it did hans the medicine given to the german lad made him feel better in less than an hour while poor fred suffered until noon of the next day none of the other boys were affected the ladies and the girls felt rather dizzy and mrs stanhope had to lie down until the next forenoon but by the evening of the next day all were around as before and then seasickness became a thing of the past  cant tell nuthin about that seasickness said bahama bill to tom after hearing how ill fred was i remember onct i took a voyage to rio in south america we had a capn as had sailed the sea for forty years an a mate who had been across the ocean sixteen times well sir sure as im here we struck some thick weather with the johnny jackson tumblin an tossin good and the capn an the mate took seasick an was sick near the hull trip then the second mate got down an the bosun an then the cook an  the cabin boy suggested tom  no we didnt have any cabin boy next  maybe the second fireman caught it  no this was a bark an we didnt have no second fireman nor fust neither next  maybe the cat or dont cats get seasick  the cat why mate  i see some cats get sick but that may not be seasick even though you can see the sickness went on tom soberly  i dont know as we had a cat on board but as i was sayin next  oh i know what you are driving at bill next the steersman got down with the mumps then you took the shingles and another sailor got lumbago while the third mate had to crawl around with a boil on his foot as large as a cabbage i heard about that affairread about it in the last monthly number of the gasmans gazettehow the ship had to sail itself for four weeks and how the wind blew it right into port and how not even a shoestring was lost overboard it was really wonderful and i am thankful you reminded me of it and then tom walked off leaving bahama bill staring after him in dumb amazement the old tar realized dimly that for once he had met his match at yarn spinning and it was several days before he attempted to tell any more of his outrageous stories     chapter xvi  a row on shipboard   do you know i think we are going on the wildest kind of a goose chase said tom the next day to his two brothers  why questioned sam  because we are depending in large part on what bahama bill has to tell hes the worst yarn spinner i ever ran across  its true that he is a yam spinner said dick but behind it all father says he tells a pretty straight story of how the treasure was stolen and secreted on treasure isle  i want to see the island and the treasure too before ill believe one quarter of what that sailor says replied tom  well well soon know the truth of the matter came from sam if this good weather continues we ought to get to where we are going inside of ten days of course if we are held up by fogs or storms it will take longer  the boys and the girls too for the matter of that were greatly interested in the elegant steam yacht and they took great pleasure in visiting every part of the vessel from bow to stem captain barforth did all in his power to make all on board the rainbow feel at home and whenever the boys visited the engine room they were met with a smile from frank norton  but if they had friends on board there were also some persons they did not like the first mate whose name was asa carey was a silent man who rarely had a pleasant word for anybody he hated to have young folks around and it was a mystery to the rovers why he should occupy a position on a pleasure craft  he ought to be on a freight steamer was dicks commentsome boat where he wouldnt meet anybody but those working under him i cant understand how the captain can bear him for his first assistant  the owner of the steam yacht hired him answered mr rover i believe the captain does not like him any more than we do but the mate does his duty faithfully so the captain cannot find fault  another individual the boys did not like was bill bossermann the assistant engineer bossermann was a burly german with the blackest of hair and a heavy black beard and beady black eyes he had a coarse voice and manners that put one in mind of a bull hans tried to get friendly with him but soon gave it up  he vos von of dem fellers vot knows it all explained hans to his chums he makes some of dem vot you call himbolitical talks yah he dinks eferypotty should be so goot like eferypotty else und chust so rich too  must be an anarchist said tom he looks the part  norton told me he was a firstclass engineer said dick but when i asked him if he was a good fellow he merely shrugged his shoulders in answer  one day the first mate was in command the captain having gone below to study his charts and work out the ships position tom had brought a baseball to the deck and was having a catch with sam the boys enjoyed the fun for quite a while and did not notice the mate near them  can you throw it up over that rope asked sam pointing to a stay over his head  sure thing cried tom  look out you dont throw it overboard  ill take care answered the funloving rover and launched the baseball high into the air just then the steam yacht gave a lurch the ball hit the mainmast and down it bounced squarely upon asa careys head knocking the mates cap over his eyes and sending him staggering backwards  hi hi you young rascals roared the mate what do you mean by such conduct  excuse me replied tom humbly i didnt mean to hit you it was an accident  i think you did it on purpose you young villain  it was an accident mr careyand ill thank you not to call me a rascal and a villain went on tom rather warmly  ill call you what i please  no you wont  yes i will i am in command here and i wont have you throwing baseballs at me  i just told you it was an accident if the yacht hadnt rolled just as i threw the ball it would not have hit you  bah i know boys and you especially you love to play tricks on everybody but you cant play tricks on me and as the mate spoke he stopped picked up the rolling ball and put it in his pocket  are you going to keep that ball demanded sam  i am  it is our ball  see here mr carey we didnt mean to hit you and we were only amusing ourselves catching said tom we have hired this yacht and we have a right to do as we please on board so long as we dont interfere with the running of the vessel i want you to give us our ball back and tom stepped up and looked the mate squarely in the eyes  what you dare to dictate to me roared the mate and raised his hand as if to strike tom he thought the youth would retreat in fear but tom never budged  i am not trying to dictate but i have rights as well as you i want that ball  you cant have it  if you dont give it to me i shall report the matter to captain barforth  at this threat the mate glared at tom as if he wanted to eat the boy up  if i give you the ball youll be throwing it at me again he growled  i didnt throw it at you but as for catching on the decki shall ask the captain if that is not allowable i am quite sure it is so long as we do no damage  going to sneak behind the captain for protection eh sneered asa carey he did not like the outlook for that very morning he had had some words with the commander of the steam yacht and had gotten the worst of it  i want that ball  the mate glared at tom for a moment and then threw the ball to him  all right take your old ball he muttered but you be mighty careful how you use it after this or youll get into trouble and with this the mate walked away  are you going to speak to the captain asked sam in a low tone  tom thought for a moment  perhaps it will be better to let it go sam i dont want to stir up any more rows than are necessary but after this i am going to keep my eye on that fellow  but if the lads did not mention it to the captain they told their brother and their chums of it and a long discussion followed  i noticed that the mate and the assistant engineer are quite thick observed fred it seems they were friends before they came aboard  and they are two of a kind remarked dick i feel free to say i do not like than at all  it was growing warmer and for the next few days the girls and the boys were content to take it easy under the awnings which had been spread over a portion of the deck once the lads amused themselves by fishing with a net and bait but were not very successful in the evening they usually sang or played games and often songbird would favor them with some of his poetry for the most of the time mrs stanhope and mrs laning did fancywork  captain says there is a storm coming up announced sam one evening  oh dear i hope it doesnt get very rough cried mrs stanhope i detest a heavy storm at sea  well mamma well have to expect some storms said dora  oh i shant mind if it doesnt thunder and lightning and blow too much  but this storm was not of the thunder and lightning variety nor did it blow to any extent it grew damp and foggy and then a mist came down over the ocean shutting out the view upon every side at once the engine of the steam yacht was slowed down and a double lookout was stationed at the bow while the whistle was blown at regular intervals  this isnt so pleasant remarked songbird as he and dick tramped along the deck in their raincoats ugh what a nasty night it is  no poetry about this is there songbird returned dick grimly  hardly said the poet yet a few minutes later he began softly  a dreadful fog came out of the sea and made it as misty as it could be the deck was wet the air was damp  it was bad enough to give you a cramp finished up tom who had come up beautiful weather for drying clothes or taking pictures he went on by the way i havent used my new camera yet i must get it out as soon as the sun shines again  and i must get out my camera said songbird i have a five by seven and i hope to take some very nice pictures when we get down among the islands  how do ye like this sea fog asked a voice at the boys rear and bahama bill appeared wrapped in an oilskin jacket it puts me in mind of a fog i onct struck off the coast o lower californy we was in it fer four days an it was so thick ye could cut it with a cheese knife why sir one day it got so thick the sailors went to the bow an caught it in their hands jess like that he made a grab at the air the captain had his little daughter aboard an the gal went out on deck an got lost an we had to feel around in that fog nearly an hour afore we found her an then sure as im a standin here she was next to drowned an had to be treated jess like she had been under water  how long ago was that asked tom poking the other boys in the ribs  seven years ago this very summer  i thought so bill for that very summer i was at fort nosuch in lower california i remember that fog well one of the walls of the fort had fallen down and the commander was afraid the desperadoes were going to attack him so he had the soldiers go out gather in the fog and build another wall with it it made a fine defence in fact it was simply out of sight concluded the funloving rover  say you began bahama bill youeryousay i cant say another word i cant the idee o building a wall o fog why say  what the old tar wanted to say or wanted them to say will never be known for at that instant came a loud cry from the bow almost immediately came a crash and the rainbow quivered and backed then came another crash and the old sailor and the boys were hurled flat on the deck     chapter xvii  a mishap in the fog   we have struck another vessel  we are sinking  how far are we from land  these and other cries rang out through the heavy fog as the two crashes came followed a few seconds later by a third  captain barforth had left the steam yacht in charge of the first mate and was on the companionway going below with two bounds he was on deck and running toward the bow at top speed  what was it have we a hole in the bow he questioned of the frightened lookouts who had been sent spinning across the slippery deck  couldnt make out captainit was something black said one lookout black and square like  i think it was a bit of old wreckage said the other anyway it wasnt another vessel and it was too dark for a lumber raft  is it out of sight  it was and though all strained their eyes they could not make out what had been struck nor did they ever find out  from the deck the captain made his way below followed by mr rover who was anxious to learn the extent of the injuries in the meantime the ladies and girls had joined the boys on the deck and the latter began to get out the life preservers  the most excited man on board was asa carey and without waiting for orders from the captain he ordered two of the small boats gotten ready to swing overboard then he ran down to his stateroom to get some of his possessions  is we gwine to de bottom questioned aleck as he appeared clad in a pair of slippers and a blanket  i dont know answered fred i hope not  the boys had all they could do to keep the girls quiet and grace was on the point of becoming hysterical which was not to be wondered at considering the tremendous excitement  we cannot be so very far from one of the islands said dick and if the worst comes to the worst we ought to be able to make shore in the small boats  are there enough boats asked mrs laning  yes the steam yacht is well equipped with them  the engine of the vessel had been stopped and the steam yacht lay like a log on the rolling waves the shocks had caused some of the lights to go out leaving the passengers in semi darkness  oh dick do you think well go down whispered dora as she clung to his arm  let us hope not dora he answered and caught her closer ill stick to you no matter what comes  yes yes i want you to do that and stick to mamma too  i will but i dont think well go down just yet he went on after a long pause we seem to be standing still thats all  they waited and as they did so he held her trembling hands tightly in his own in that minute of extreme peril they realized how very much they were to one another  at last after what seemed to be hours but was in reality less than five minutes anderson rover appeared  there is no immediate danger said he we must have struck some sort of wreckage or lumber float there is a small hole in the bow just above the water line and several of the seams have been opened captain barforth is having the hole closed up and has started up the donkey pump to keep the water low in the hold he says he thinks we can make one of the nearby ports without great trouble  this news removed the tension under which all were suffering and a little later the ladies and the girls retired to the cabin and aleck stole back to his sleeping quarters the boys went forward to inspect the damage done but in the darkness could see little  it was an accident such as might happen to any vessel said the captain later the lookouts were evidently not to blame there are many derelicts and bits of lumber rafts scattered throughout these waters and consequently traveling at night or in a fog is always more or less dangerous  we shall have to put up somewhere for repairs not so questioned anderson rover  it would be best mr rover of course we might be able to patch things ourselves but unless you are in a great hurry i advise going into port and having it done it will have to be done sooner or later anyway  where do you advise putting in  captain barforth thought for a moment  i think we had better run over to nassau which is less than sixty miles from here nassau as perhaps you know is the capital city of the bahamas and has quite some shipping and well stand a good chance there of getting the right shipscarpenters to do the work  after some talk it was decided to steer for nassau and the course of the rainbow was changed accordingly they now ran with even greater caution than before and a strong searchlight was turned on at the bow the surplus power from the engine being used for that purpose  as my young readers may know nassau is located on new providence island about two hundred miles east of the lower coast of florida it is under british rule and contains about fifteen thousand inhabitants it is more or less of a health resort and is visited by many tourists consequently there are several good hotels and many means of spending a few days there profitably  the run to nassau was made without further mishaps and immediately on arriving the steam yacht was placed in the hands of some builders who promised to make the needed repairs without delay the entire crew remained on board as did aleck pop but the rovers and their friends put up at a leading hotel for the time being  after the run on shipboard from philadelphia to the bahamas the ladies and girls were glad enough to set foot again on land after one day of quietness at the hotel the party went out carriage riding and of course the boys went along they saw not a few unusual sights and were glad they had their cameras with them  well have a dandy lot of pictures by the time we get home said sam  there is one picture i want more than any other said tom  one of nellie i suppose and sam winked  oh ive got that already answered the funloving rover unabashed  whats that you want asked songbird  a picture of that treasure cave with us loading the treasure on the yacht  now you are talking tom cried his older brother we all want that i am sorry we have been delayed here  how long vos ve going to sthay here questioned hans  the repairs will take the best part of a week so the ship builders said  aint you afraid dot sid merrick got ahead of you  i dont know he may be on his way now or he may not have started yet from new york  oh i hope we dont meet merrick or sobber either cried dora  on the outskirts of the town was a fine flower garden where roses of unusual beauty were grown one day the girls and ladies visited this and dick and songbird went along in the meantime tom and sam walked down to the docks to see how the repairs to the rainbow were progressing and also to look at the vessels going out and coming in  a vessel is due from new york said tom i heard them talking about it at the hotel  let us see if there is anybody on board we know answered his brother  they walked to the spot where the people were to come in and there learned that the steamer had sent its passengers ashore an hour before a few were at the dock taking care of some baggage which had been detained by the custom house officials  well i never exclaimed tom if there isnt peter slade what can he be doing here  peter slade had once been a pupil at putnam hall he had been something of a bully although not as bad as tad sobber the boys had often played tricks on him and once peter had gotten so angry he had left the school and never come back  let us go and speak to him said sam  maybe he wont speak sam he was awful angry at us when he left the hall  if he doesnt want to speak he can do the other thing said the youngest rover perhaps hell be glad to meet somebody in this out of the way place  they walked over to where peter slade stood and both spoke at once the other lad was startled at first and then he scowled  humph you down here he said shortly  yes answered tom pleasantly enough did you just get in on the steamer  i dont know as that is any of your business tom rover  it isnt and if you dont want to speak civilly slade you havent got to speak at all said tom and started to move away followed by his brother  say did you meet tad sobber and his un and then peter slade stopped short in some confusion  did we meet who demanded tom wheeling around in some astonishment  never mind growled peter slade  were they on the steamer asked sam  im not saying anything about it  look here slade if they were on the steamer we want to know it came from tom  really and the former bully of the hall put as much of a sneer as possible into the word  we do and you have got to tell us  i dont see why  you will if you are honest said sam you know as well as i do that tad sobbers uncle is a rascal and ought to be in prison  tad says it isnt sothat his uncle didnt take those bonds that they were placed in his care to be sold at a profit if possible  when did tad tell you that  only a couple of days agoi mean he told me and thats enough  then he told you while you were on the steamer put in tom  yes if you must know peter slades face took on a cunning look i guess mr merrick and tad will trim you good and proper soon  what do you mean by that  oh i know a thing or two  did they tell you what had brought them down here  maybe they did  who was with them  you had better ask them  where are they  thats for you to find out  see here slade this is no way to talk went on tom earnestly if you know anything about sid merrick and his plans you had better tell us about them if you dont i shall take it for granted that you are in league with that rascal and act accordingly  yes and that may mean arrest for you added sam  peter slade was a coward at heart and these suggestive words made him turn pale  i am not in league with them he cried hastily i met them on the steamer by accident tad told me he and his uncle were going to get the best of you but how he didnt say  who was with them come out with it  a spaniard named doranez  doranez cried both the rover boys and looked suggestively at each other  yes do you know him  we know of him answered tom slowly where did they go  i dont know exactly  dont you know at all  they were going to look for some tramp steamer that was to be here if they found her they were going to sail at once to some other island answered peter slade     chapter xviii  the new deck hand   having said so much peter slade seemed more inclined to talk one reason being that he wanted to get at the bottom of the mystery which had brought tad sobber and his uncle to that part of the globe tad had hinted of great wealth and of getting the best of the rovers and some other people but had not gone into any details  peter said he had come to nassau to join his mother who was stopping there for her health his father was coming on later and then the family was going across the ocean  i know there is something up between your crowd and the merrick crowd said the youth you are both after something aint you  yes answered tom  what  i cant tell you that slade its something quite valuable though  well i guess sobbers uncle will get ahead of you  perhaps so what is the name of the tramp steamer he is looking for  the josephine  was she to be here  they hoped she would be  were they going to hire her asked sam  i suppose so  then merrick had money  yes he had some and that spaniard had some too  a little more conversation followed and then the rover boys asked slade where he was going to stop and said they might see him later  this is mighty interesting remarked tom as he and his brother hurried to their hotel we must tell father of this without delay  but mr rover could not be found until that evening when the party came back from the visit to the flower gardens he listened with deep interest to what was said and then went off on a hunt for sid merrick and the tramp steamer josephine without delay  nothing was discovered that night but a little before noon of the day following they learned that a tramp steamer had appeared in the harbor taken several persons on board and then steamed away again  can you tell me the name of that craft asked anderson rover of the man who gave him this information  she was the josephine sir of charleston captain sackwell  was she loaded  i think not sir  how many persons got aboard  five or six  one of them a young fellow  yes sir and one was a fellow who was very dark  mr rover knew that doranez was very dark and he rightfully surmised that the party had been made up of merrick tad doranez cuffer and shelley  this is certainly a serious turn of affairs said he to his sons while we have been losing time in philadelphia and elsewhere sid merrick has gone to work gotten somebody to let him have this tramp steamer and now in company with doranez is off to locate treasure isle and the treasure it looks to me as if it might be a race between us after all  yes and the worst of it is that we are laid up for repairs said dick with almost a groan in his voice  how long must we remain here asked sam cant they hurry the job somehow  let us offer em more money to hurry suggested tom  the suggestion to offer more money was carried out and the ship builders promised to have the rainbow fit for sailing by the following afternoon the paint on the new work would not be dry but that would not matter  on the morning of the day they were to sail a man applied to captain barforth for a position he said he had been a fireman on an ocean liner but had lost three fingers in some machinery and been discharged  i am hard up he pleaded ill work for almost anything  the captain was kind hearted and as the rainbow could use another deck hand he told the man to bring his luggage aboard which the fellow did the newcomers name was walt wingate and he did his best to make friends with everybody on board he had a low musical voice and was frequently whistling popular airs  hes an odd one said dick after noticing the new deck hand several times he seems real nice and yet  you dont like him finished sam  thats it sam  neither do i and i cant tell why  well he hasnt anything to do with us if hes a good man im glad the captain gave him a job its tough luck to lose your fingers especially if you must work for a living  by five oclock the steam yacht had left the harbor of nassau and was standing out to sea once more the course was again southward around the western extremity of cuba during the following days they passed numerous islands and keys as they are called but generally at such a distance that the shores could be seen but faintly  to make sure of what he was doing anderson rover held several consultations with captain barforth and bahama bill was closely questioned regarding the location of treasure isle the old tar stuck to the story he had told so often and went over numerous maps with the commander of the steam yacht  he has the location pretty well fixed in his head unless the whole thing is a fairy tale was captain barforths comment  while one of these talks was going on dick who was on deck chanced to go below in a hurry as he passed down the companionway he encountered walt wingate who had been listening at the cabin doorway  hullo what do you want demanded dick for the mans face had a guilty look on it  whyermy handkerchief blew down here and i came down to get it answered the new deck hand and pointed to the cloth in question sticking out of his pocket  is that all  thats all sir answered wingate and touching his cap he slouched off then he turned back sorry if i disturbed anybody he added  oh i suppose it is all right returned dick but he was by no means satisfied although he could not tell exactly why there was something about the new deck hand that did not ring true at first he thought to speak to his parent about the occurrence but then concluded not to worry his father  knowing that it was now a race between the rainbow and the josephine for treasure isle captain barforth crowded on all steam the course of the steam yacht was fairly well laid out but it contained many turns and twists due to the many keyslocated in these waters  we dont want to run on any hidden reef said the master of the vessel if we do we may go down or be laid up for a long while for repairs these waters are fairly well charted but there is still a great deal to be learned about them from time to time they have had earthquakes down here and volcano eruptions and the bottom is constantly shifting  on the second night out from nassau sam for some reason could not sleep he tumbled and tossed in his berth for two hours and then feeling that some fresh air might do him good dressed in part and went on deck  it was not a very clear night and but few stars shone in the firmament in the darkness the lad walked first to one side of the steam yacht and then to the other then he strolled toward the bow to have a little chat with the lookout  as he walked along the side of the cabin he became aware of a figure leaning over the rail gazing far down into the sea by the mans general form he made the fellow out to be walt wingate the deck hand had hold of something although what it was sam could not tell  at first the youngest rover was going to call to the man and ask him what he was doing but he remained silent and stepped into the shadow of the cabin as wingate left the rail and crossed to the other side of the yacht from under some coils of rope the deck hand brought forth something lifted it over the rail and dropped it gently into the sea then he leaned far over the rail as before and this lasted two or three minutes  he is certainly up to something out of the ordinary thought sam i wonder if he is fishing if he is it seems to me it is a queer way to go at it  as wingate left the rail he walked directly to where the boy stood when he discovered sam he started back as if confronted by a ghost  oherdidnt know anybody was up he stammered  it was so hot in my stateroom i couldnt sleep answered sam i came out to get the air  its almost as hot on deck as it is anywhere said the deck hand and his tone had little of cordiality in it  i think ill go forward and try it there  yes its a little breezier at the bow sir by the way did you ersee me trying to catch some of those firefish just now  i saw you doing something i didnt see what  i thought i might get one but they are all gone now answered wingate and slouched off whistling in that peculiar manner of his  sam walked slowly to the bow as he did this wingate turned to look at him in a speculative way  wonder if the young fool saw what i was up to he muttered if he did id better go slow i dont want to get caught they might treat me pretty roughly  the watch on deck was changed and wingate went below asa carey was in command of the yacht and he too wanted to know why sam was up at such a late hour the boy told him but said nothing to the mate of wingates strange actions  when sam turned in dick wanted to know if he was sick  no only restless dick he replied by the way i saw something strange he continued and he related the occurrence  we must look into this sam it may mean nothing and it may mean a great deal was the eldest rover boys comment  the boys did not go on deck until after breakfast then they walked to the starboard rail and stopped at the spot where sam had first discovered the deck hand  i dont see anything said dick gazing over the rail perhaps he was fishing after all he may have thoughthullo  what is it dick  some kind of a line down herea wire fastened to a hook  can you reach it  hardly i might if youll hold my legs so i dont go overboard  hadnt we better tell captain barforth of this first the wire may belong there  i dont know what for but we can tell the captain here he comes now  good morning boys said the master of the steam yacht pleasantly what can you see over there  something we think unusual said sam please take a look and tell us what it is  captain barforth did as requested  that wire has no business there he declared i dont know how it came there  i can tell you how it got there and i guess youll find something like it on the other side answered sam and told what he had seen wingate do during the night  humph ill investigate this muttered the captain and went off for a boathook when he returned he caught the hook into the loop of the wire and tried to bring the end of the strand to the deck he was unable to do it alone and had to get the boys to aid him then all three ran the wire around a brace and gradually hauled it aboard at the end was an iron chain fastened into several loops and also the anchor to one of the rowboats     chapter xix  treasure isle at last   so this is the work of that new deck hand eh cried captain barforth grimly a fine piece of business to be in i must say  let us see what is on the other side suggested dick  this was done and they brought up another wire to the end of which were attached two small anchors and some pieces of scrap steel from the tool room  he put those overboard for drag anchors explained the master of the steam yacht he did it to delay the rainbow  yes and that was done so the josephine could get ahead of us added dick  in that case he must be in league with sid merrick came from sam  perhaps he met merrick at nassau and was hired for this work said dick  that is possible dick ill have the truth out of him if i have to put him in irons and on bread and water to do it added captain barforth  he at once sent for walt wingate the deck hand who went after the man came back five minutes later to report that the fellow could not be located  he must be found cried captain barforth he cant skulk out of this  a search was instituted in which all of the boys mr rover and aleck joined but though the steam yacht was searched from stem to stern the missing deck hand was not located some of the men even went down into the hold but with no success  do you think he jumped overboard asked fred  he might but it would be a foolish thing to do answered the captain we are at least ten miles from any island  he may have had a small boat said songbird  no the small boats are all here he is on this vessel but where is the question  to stimulate them in their search the captain offered a reward of ten dollars to any one of his crew who should bring wingate to light but this brought no success and for a very good reason as we shall learn later  how much the drags had hampered the progress of the rainbow there was no telling but freed of them the steam yacht made good time all of the machinery was carefully inspected including the propeller to which some wire was found twisted but this had thus far done no damage and was easily pulled out  he is certainly in league with merrick and his crowd said anderson rover and that being so we must be on constant guard against him  the ladies and the girls were much alarmed to think that such a character as wingate might be roaming around the vessel in secret and at night they locked every stateroom door with care the boys and mr rover were also on the alert and some of them slept with loaded pistols near at hand had wingate shown himself unexpectedly he might have met with a warm reception  that fellers disappearance puts me in mind o something that happened aboard the nancy belden bound from the congo to new york jest eight years ago this summer said bahama bill who had searched as hard as anybody for the missing man we had on board a lot o wild animals fer a circus man an amongst em was an orang outang big an fierce i can tell you well this orang outang got out o his cage one night an in the mornin he couldnt be found we hunted an hunted an the next night nobody wanted to go to sleep fer fear hed wake up dead the capn had his family aboard and the wife she was most scart stiff an wouldnt hardly leave her room  and did you find the orang outang asked songbird with interest  we did an we didnt the fifth night after he was missing we heard a fearful noise right in a cage wot had a lion in it we run to the place with shootin irons an spears and capstan bars thinkin the lion was loose when we got there we found the orang outang had twisted one o the bars o the cage loose an got inside and disturbed mr lions best nap mr lion didnt like it an he gets up and in about two minutes he makes mince meat o the orang outang when we got there all we see was bits o skin an the feet an head o the orang outang yes sir we was glad he was goneespecially the capn wife but the circus men was mad to lose sech a valerable beast concluded bahama bill  that was a pretty good one was toms comment too good to be spoiled and at this remark the others laughed  vell its someding like ven dot snake got loose py putnam hall was hans comment dot vingate vos noddings put a snake hey  you hit it that time hans answered dirk a snake and of the worst kind  according to bahama bills reckoning they were now less than two days sailing from treasure isle and all on board who were in the secret were filled with expectancy so far nothing had been seen of the josephine and they wondered if the tramp steamer was ahead of them or if they had passed her in the darkness  of course she may have come by a different route said captain barforth while we passed to the east and south of some of the little islands she may have gone to the north and west of them one route would be about as good as the other  that night it grew foggy and as a consequence they had to slow down which filled the boys with vexation for as tom declared they wanted to find that island and the treasure right away  well youll have to be patient said nellie  arent you anxious nellie he asked  oh yes tom but i dont want to see anybody hurt or the yacht sunk  twenty four hours later the fog rolled away and on the following morning captain barforth announced they were in the locality where treasure isle was supposed to be located the boys stationed themselves in various parts of the steam yacht and dick and tom went aloft with a good pair of marine glasses  i see an island cried tom half an hour later  this announcement thrilled all on board but an hour later it was discovered that the island was only a small affair and bahama bill promptly said it was not that for which they were seeking  come aloft and look through the glass said dick to the old tar and bahama bill readily accepted the invitation thus two hours more went by and the course of the steam yacht was changed to a wide circle  more land cried dick presently what do you make of that he asked and handed the marine glasses to bahama bill  the old tar looked through the glasses for a long time and then put them down with much satisfaction  thats the place or ill forfeit a months wages he said  is it treasure isle burst out tom  yes  hurrah shouted tom running down the ratlines to the deck weve found the island he shouted hurrah  where asked half a dozen at once  over in that direction you cant see it with the naked eye but its there just the same hurrah and in his high spirits tom did a few steps of a fancy jig  without delay the bow of the steam yacht was pointed in the direction of the land that had been discovered and after awhile all made it out a mere speck on the blue water but as they approached the speck grew larger and larger and they saw it was a beautiful tropical isle with waving palms reaching down almost to the waters edge  we cant land on this side announced bahama bill the sea is too dangerous here well have to sail around to the south shore and lay to beyond the reef and then take small boats to the inside of the horseshoe  again the course of the rainbow was changed and they skirted the eastern shore of the island which was truly shaped like a horseshoe with the opening on the south side to the north the east and the west were smaller islands and reefs sticking out like horseshoe nails as sam said sailing was dangerous here and they had to go slow and make frequent soundings so that they did not reach the south side of treasure isle until almost nightfall  the same old place murmured bahama bill  an we anchored right out here when we took that treasure ashore i remember it as well if it was yesterday and he nodded over and over again  and where is the cave from here asked mr rover who was as anxious as anybody to locate the treasure  you cant see it because its behind the trees an rocks replied the tar  the reef beyond the horseshoe was a dangerous one with the sea dashing up many feet over it there was only one break less than thirty feet wide so gaining entrance to the harbor would be no easy matter in a rowboat we had better wait until morning before we go ashore said captain barforth even if we land well be able to do little in the darkness  oh dont wait pleaded tom  why cant some of us go ashore put in sam who was as impatient as his brother  id like to go myself added dick even if i had to stay ashore all night remember the josephine is on the way here and the sooner some of us get to land and locate that cave the better  the josephine isnt here yet said fred  no but she may put in an appear at any time answered tom i believe in taking time by the forelock as the saying is  the matter was talked over for a few minutes and then it was decided to let tom dick and sam go ashore in company with two sailors who would then bring the rowboat back to the steam yacht the boys were to take blankets and some provisions with them and spend the night on the island  i dont think youll find the cave without bahama bills aid said mr rover but it will do no harm to look around if this isle is like the rest of the west indies there will be little on it to hurt you there are few wild animals down here and no savages outside of some negroes who occasionally go on a spree and cut loose  the rowboat was soon ready and the boys embarked with the best wishes of those left behind hans wanted to go very much but was told he must wait until morning bahama bill said he would rather sleep on shipboard any time than on shore  a bunk for me were his words its better than under the trees or bushes once i was ashore sleepin an a big snake crawled over my legs i thought some cannibals were trying to tie me fast and jumped up when i see the snake i run about three miles without stopping a bunk fer me every time yes sir  it was exciting to bring the rowboat through the passage of the reef and once the boys thought they were going to ship a good deal of water but the two men who were rowing knew their business and brought them into the horseshoe harbor without mishap they helped the lads to land on a small sandy strip close to some palms and then started back to the steam yacht  treasure isle at last cried dick when they were left alone so far our quest has been successful now to locate the cave and unearth that treasure  and may it prove to be worth all that has been said of it added sam     chapter xx  the boys make a discovery   the boys had landed at a spot that was particularly inviting in appearance and they stopped for several minutes to take in the natural beauty surrounding them there were tall and stately palms backed up by other trees trailing vines of great length and numerous gorgeous flowers a sweet scent filled the air and from the woods in the center of the isle came the song of tropical birds  what a fine camping place murmured sam a fellow could spend several weeks here and have lots of fun bathing and boating and hunting birds and fishing and his brothers agreed with him  yet the beauty of treasure isle was soon forgotten in their anxiety to locate the cave they had a general idea that it was in the center of the horseshoe curve and that center was quite a distance from where they had been brought ashore  the best we can do is to tramp along the waters edge said dick then when we reach the center we can go inland  we havent over an hour replied his youngest brother by that time it will be too dark to do much more and well have to find some suitable place to camp for the night  oh we can camp anywhere cried tom its good enoughjust for one night  they began to trudge along the edge of the horseshoe curve over smooth sand but this did not last and presently they came to a muddy flat and went down to their ankles dick was ahead and he cried to the others  stop its not fit to walk here  why its like a bog declared sam after testing it  well have to go inland a distance said tom come on and he turned back and struck out for the palms and bushes beyond  it was then that the rover boys began to realize what was before them scarcely had they penetrated the interior for fifty yards when they found themselves in a perfect network of trailing vines then after having pulled and cut their way through for fifty yards more they came to a spot that was rocky and covered with a tangle of thorny bushes  wow ejaculated tom after scratching his hand and his leg this is something prime i must confess  what i call hunting a treasure with a vengeance added dick dryly  i move we go back came from sam we seem to be stuck in more ways than one  perhaps it is better traveling just beyond declared dick i am not going to turn back just yet anyway  he took the lead breaking down the thorny bushes as best he could and sam and tom followed closely in his footsteps it was rather dark among the bushes and almost before the three knew it they had fallen headlong into a hollow  well i never  this is coming down in a hurry  is this the treasure cave  such were the exclamations of the three lads as they picked themselves up out of the dirt which fortunately for them was soft and yielding nobody had been hurt for which they were thankful  the hollow was about fifty feet in diameter and half that depth in the center on the opposite side were more bushes and rocks and then a thicket of tall trees of a variety that was strange to them  this is what i call hard work observed tom as they began to fight their way along again i dont know but what we would have done as well to have waited until morning  dont croak tom said sam  oh i am not croaking but this is no fun let me tell you that  all of the boys were panting from their exertions and soon they had to call a halt to get their breath it was now growing dark rapidly for in the tropics there is little of what we know as twilight  we certainly cant do much more in this darkness said dick at last i must confess i thought walking in the direction of the cave would be an easy matter  well whats to do next questioned sam gazing around in perplexity  this was no easy question to answer as if by magic darkness had settled all around them shutting out the sight of objects less than a hundred yards away to go forward was all but impossible and whether or not they could get back to where they had come from was a serious problem  if we cant get back well have to camp right here said dick  but they did not want to stay in such a thicket and so they pushed on a little further until they reached a slight rise of ground then dick who was in advance as before uttered a cry of surprise  a trail i wonder where it leads to  he was right a well defined trail or footpath lay before them running between the brushwood and palms and around the rocks it did not look as if it had been used lately but it was tolerably clear of any growth  this was something the rover boys had not counted on for bahama bill had never spoken of any trail in his descriptions of the isle they gazed at the path with curiosity tom was the first to speak  shall we follow it he asked  might as well answered sam its better than scratching yourself and tearing your clothing in those thorn bushes  the boys took to the trail and passed along for a distance of quarter of a mile or more it wound in and out around the rocks and trees and had evidently been made by some natives bringing out wild fruits and the like from the forest  it doesnt seem to be leading us to anywhere was dicks comment i dont know whether to go on or not  nevertheless they kept on until they came to a sharp turn around a series of rocks as they moved ahead they suddenly saw a glare of light cross the rocks and then disappear  what was that asked sam somewhat startled  a light answered dick  i know but where did it come from  it was like the flash of a bicycle gas lamp said tom  there are no bicycles on this trail said dick  i know that too dick but it was like that kind of a lamp  just then the flash of light reappeared and now they saw it came from a point on the trail ahead of them they listened intently and heard somebody approaching  several men are coming whispered dick  not from our yacht said tom  i dont think so  can they be from the josephine asked sam  that remains to be seen  if they are from the josephine what shall we do  i think the best thing we can do is to keep out of sight and watch them  but they may locate the cave and take the treasure away said tom  we have got to run that risk unless we want to fight them  oh if only we could get our crowd here to help us murmured sam  we may be mistaken and they may be strangers to us come let us hide  losing no time the three rover boys stepped into the bushes beside the trail as they did so the other party came closer and the lads saw that they carried not only an acetylene gas lamp but also a ships lantern and several other things the party was made up of sid merrick tad sobber cuffer and shelley  its mighty rough walking here they heard tad sobber complain ive got a thorn right through my shoe wait till i pull it out will you and he came to a halt not over ten yards from where the rover boys were hidden  you didnt have to come tad said his uncle somewhat harshly i told you to suit yourself  oh i want to see that treasure cave as well as you do answered sobber  id like to know if this is the right trail or not came from shelley you ought to have brought that spaniard along to make sure  doranez is no good growled sid merrick who was by no means in the best of humor he likes his bottle too well if he would only keep sober it would be different  why dont you take his liquor from him asked cuffer id do it quick enough if i was running this thing  he says he wont tell us a thing more if we cut off his grog he is getting mighty ugly  maybe he wants to sell out to those rovers suggested shelley  he wouldnt dare to do thati know too much about him answered sid merrick no its because he wants too big a share of the treasure  do you suppose the fellows on the steam yacht have landed here yet asked tad as he prepared to go on  i dont know they are laying to outside of the reef i reckon they dont know anything of the landing on the other side of the island answered his uncle come on we havent any time to waste if we want to head them off i didnt dream theyd get here so quickly  i guess that fellow wingate was no good came from cuffer he didnt delay the steam yacht in the least  maybe he got caught at his funny work suggested shelley hitting the nail directly on the head as the reader already knows  casting the light of the acetylene gas lamp ahead of them the party from the josephine moved on directly past the spot where the rovers were in hiding the boys hardly dared to breathe for fear of discovery they stood stock still until the others were all but out of sight  this is interesting murmured tom they must have landed on the other side of the island  yes and merrick hired that walt wingate to play us foul cried sam what shall we do next dick he continued anxiously they act as if they expect to get that treasure to night  i dont know what to do exactly answered dick but one thing is certainwe must follow them up and prevent their getting hold of that treasure if we possibly can     chapter xxi  scaring off the enemy   it was easy enough for dick to say they must follow up their enemies and prevent sid merrick and his party from gaining possession of the treasure but how all this was to be accomplished was another matter  in the first place the other party numbered four as against their three more than this those from the josephine were heavily armed while the rovers had brought with them nothing but a single pistol its well enough to talk whispered sam after sid merrick and his crowd had passed on but if we tackle them in the open the chances are well get the worst of it  we may get a chance at them in some other way answered dick we have this advantage we know where they are and they dont know we are on the isle  with cautious steps they stole after the merrick party keeping them in sight by the waving rays of the lamp and lantern ahead as they danced over the rocks and among the trees and bushes they kept about a hundred feet to the rear  ive got a plan said tom as the party ahead came to a halt to make sure of the trail cant we cut in somewhere and get ahead of them and then scare them back  lets try it exclaimed sam i am sure if we play ghosts or something like that well scare tad sobber out of his wits  its a risky thing to do mused the eldest rover we might get caught at it  nevertheless he was rather in favor of the plan and when the merrick party stopped again for cuffer to take a stone out of his shoe they cut into the woods and pushed forward with all speed it was hard work but they were in deadly earnest and did not let the vines and brushwood deter them  now the question is how are we to scare them said dick after they had regained the trail well in advance of sid merrick and his followers  let us play ghosts said sam  we might black up and play niggers on the warpath with big clubs suggested tom  and get shot down interrupted dick no i think the ghosts idea is as good as anything quick take off your coats and tie your handkerchiefs over your faces  the boys had on light colored outing shirts and these with the handkerchiefs over their faces made them look quite ghostlike in the gloom under the trees  now when the time comes groan said tom ghosts always groan you know  and let us order them back added sam  but be sure to do it in very ghostlike tones warned dick if our voices sound a bit natural theyll get suspicious at once if they come for us or shoot at us drop behind the rocks and run into the woods  it must be confessed that the boys were doubtful of the success of their ruse yet they felt they must do something to hold the treasure seeking party in check at least until morning with the coming of daylight they could signal to the rainbow and with the aid of those on the steam yacht probably rout the enemy  the rover boys advanced along the trail until they reached a spot they deemed favorable for their purpose then dick gave his brothers a few more directions  presently they saw the rays of the gas lamp and the lantern in the distance at once tom set up a deep groaning and sam and dick joined in  whats that asked shelley who was the first to hear the sounds  sounds like somebody in distress answered sid merrick  thought you said there was nobody on this island came from cuffer  didnt think there was maybe its some native who  look look screamed tad sobber and pointed ahead with his hand whats that  whats what asked the men in concert  therethat thing bobbing up and down over the rocks and tad sobber trembled as he spoke this lonely walk through the darkness of the forest had somewhat unnerved him  thats strange muttered merrick its groaning  its a ghost screamed tad and shrank back as did cuffer and shelley  a ghost repeated sid merrick nonsense there are no such things as ghosts  it cercertainly looks like aa ghost faltered cuffer  it is a ghost said tad his teeth beginning to chatter ii cacan hear it grogroan come on bababack and he began to retreat  back with you came in solemn tones back with you  no white man must come here said a second voice this is sacred ground  he who sets foot here dies came from a third voice this is the burial place of the great hupa hupa back if you value your life and then followed a jabbering nobody could understand and white arms were waved wildly in the air  this warning was too much for tad sobber and without further ado he took to his heels and retreated down the trail whence he had come cuffer followed him and shelley also retreated several yards  stop you fools cried sid merrick those are no ghosts i tell you its a trick of some kind  ii dont know about that answered shelley dont you think it would be better to come here in the daylight weerwe cant find that cave in the dark anyway  yes we canand i am going to do it too was merricks answer that is a trick i tell you he raised his voice who are you he called out answer me truthfully or ill fire on you  this threat alarmed the rover boys for they saw that merrick was in earnest  i guess our cake is dough muttered tom  wait i think i can scare him back yet said dick let me do the talking  i say who are you repeated merrick you neednt pretend to be ghosts for i dont believe in them  we are the owners of this isle answered dick in the heaviest tone he could assume we are ten strong and we order you to go back to your ship at once  the owners of this isle  yes  i dont believe it  you can do as you please about that but if you come a yard further well fire at you  humph then you are armed  we are and we know how to shoot too  what brought you here at such a time as this  we have a special reason for being here as you may learn by to morrow  do you know anything of a treasure on this island went on sid merrick curiously  we know something of it yes it belongs to the stanhope estate provided it can be found  it doesnt belong to the stanhopes at allit belongs to me cried merrick  in a day or two the stanhopes are coming here to take possession went on dick they will bring with them a number of their friends and uncover the treasure which is now hidden in a secret place as i and my brothers and cousins own this isle we are to have our share of what is uncovered now we warn you again to go away we are ten to your four and we are all armed with shotguns and pistols and we have the drop on you  good for you dick pile it on whispered tom then he pulled sam by the arm come on let us appear from behind another rocktheyll think we are two more of the brothers or cousins  you wont dare to shoot us blustered merrick but his voice had a trace of uncertainty in it  wont we answered dick there is a warning for you and raising the pistol he carried he sent a shot over the heads of the other party  they are shooting at us well all be killed yelled tad sobber who had come back during the conversation and again he and cuffer took to their heels  mind the warning called out dick and dropped almost out of sight behind a rock at that same moment tom and sam appeared from behind a rock far to the left  mind that warning they cried remember we are ten to four  there are two more of em cried shelley  confound the luck what sort of a game is this anyway said sid merrick much chagrined  well it is more than we expected answered shelley i for one dont care to risk being shot down i reckon they have the bulge on us if there really are ten of em  ive seen but five the three ahead and the two over yonder  there are two more answered shelley and pointed to another rock to which sam and tom had just crawled that makes seven  go back i tell you warned dick well give you just two minutes in which to make up your mind if you dont go back well start to shoot  come on back cried tad from a safe distance dont let them shoot you uncle sid  well go back to our ship called out sid merrick but remember this thing isnt settled yet  if you have any differences with the stanbopes you can settle with the folks on the steam yacht which has just arrived answered dick not knowing what else to say  the party under sid merrick began to retreat and dick tom and sam watched them with interest until the lights faded in the distance then tom did a jig in his delight  that was easier than i expected he said  even if we didnt scare them playing ghost added sam i wonder if they really thought we were ten in number  well they thought we were seven anyway answered dick it was a clever ruse you two played  what to do next the rover boys did not know it was impossible for any of them to calculate how far they were from the spot where they had landed or to determine the best way of getting back to foreshow bay as they had named the locality  if we move around very much in this darkness we may become hopelessly lost in the forest said dick  maybe we had better stay right where we are until morning suggested his youngest brother  im agreeable to anything were toms words  if we stay here we want to remain on guard said dick merrick may take it into his head to come back  an hour later found the three rover boys encamped in a small opening to one side of the forest trail they made beds for themselves of some soft brushwood and it was decided that one should remain on guard while the other two slept  each can take three hours of guard duty said dick that will see us through the night nicely and so it was arranged     chapter xxii  prisoners in the forest   dick was the first to go on guard and during the initial hour of his vigil practically nothing came to disturb him he heard the occasional cry of the nightbirds and the booming of the surf on the reefs and the shore of the isle and saw numerous fireflies flit to and fro and that was all  i dont believe theyll come back he murmured to himself like as not they are afraid to advance on the trail and also afraid to trust themselves to this jungle in the darkness  dick had found some wild fruit growing close at hand and he began to sample this but it was bitter and he feared to eat much thinking it might make him sick then to keep awake for he felt sleepy because of his long tramp he took out his knife and began to cut his initials on a stately palm growing beside the temporary camp  dick had just finished one letter and was starting the next when of a sudden he found himself caught from behind his arms were pinned to his side his pistol wrenched from his grasp and a hand that was not overly clean was clapped over his mouth  not a sound rover if you know when you are well off said a voice into his ear  despite this warning the lad would have yelled to his brothers but he found this impossible he had been attacked by merrick and shelley and cuffer stood nearby ready with a stick to crack him over the head should he show fight the attack had come in the dark the gas lamp and the lantern having been extinguished when the party from the josephine drew close  merrick had prepared himself for his nefarious work and in a twinkling he had dicks hands bound behind him and had a gag placed in the youths mouth then he had the lad bound fast to a nearby tree  in the meantime tom and sam were sleeping soundly the two brothers lay each with a hand close to the other and with caution merrick and his party tied the two hands together then they tied the lads feet so that they could not run  whats the meaning of this cried tom struggling to rise as did sam  it means you are prisoners cried tad sobber who had had small part in the operations but who was ready to do all the crowing possible  prisoners gasped sam where is dick he added  also a prisoner said tad with a chuckle you thought you had fooled us nicely but i guess we have turned the tables on you  i suspected you rovers said sid merrick  really answered tom sarcastically you acted it  see here dont you get funny young man please remember you are in our power  and well do some shooting if we have to added tad bombastically  tad i guess i can do the talking for this crowd said his uncle  you were afraid of the ghosts tad said sam you must have run about a mile and the youngest rover grinned in spite of the predicament he was in  you shut up i roared tad sobber and exhibited some of the brutality that had made him so hated at putnam hall by raising his foot and kicking sam in the side  stop cried the youngest rover in pain what a brute you are  leave my brother alone came from tom  a fine coward you are to kick him when he is a prisoner you wouldnt dare to try it if he was free  i wouldnt eh i want you to understand im not afraid of anybody blustered tad i am  tad be quiet cried his uncle i am fully capable of managing this affair dont kick him again  yes but look here uncle sid they  i will take care of things cried sid merrick and so sharply that his nephew at once subsided but on the sly he shook his fist at both tom and sam  maybe we had better make sure that nobody else is around suggested shelley who had been merricks best aide in the capture  all right look around if you want to was merricks reply i am pretty certain these boys are alone herealthough more persons from the steam yacht may be ashore  they looked around but of course found nobody else then dick tom and sam were tied in a row to three trees which were handy merrick took possession of their single weapon  i dont want you to hurt yourselves with it he said grimly  merrick this is a high handed proceeding said dick when the gag was removed from his mouth  no more so than was your statement of owning the isle was the answer  what are you going to do with us  nothing  i must say i dont understand you  what should i do with you i dont enjoy your company i am here solely to get that treasure as you must know i am going after that and leave you where you are  bound to these trees  certainly  supposing we cant get loose remonstrated tom we may starve to death  that will be your lookout but i reckon youll get loose sooner or later although weve bound you pretty tight  can i have a drink before you go asked sam who was dry  dont give em a drop uncle sid cried tad they dont deserve it  oh they can have a drink said sid merrick id give a drink even to a dog he added and passed around some water the boys had in a bottle  less than fifteen minutes later the three rover boys found themselves alone in the forest the merrick party had lit their acetylene gas lamp and the lantern and struck out once more along the trail which they supposed would take them to the treasure cave the boys heard them for a short distance and then all became dark and silent around them  well now we are in a pickle and no mistake remarked sam with a long sigh  that ghost business proved a boomerang was toms comment its a pity we didnt dig out for the shore signal to the steam yacht and tell father and the others about what was going on  there is no use crying over spilt milk said dick the first thing to do is to get free  yes and thats real easy sniffed tom i am bound up like a bale of hay to be shipped to the south pole  and the cord on my wrists is cutting right into the flesh said sam  if we were the heroes of a dime novel wed shoo these ropes away in a jiffy went on tom with a grin his brothers could not see but being plain everyday american boys im afraid well have to stay tied up until somebody comes to cut us loose  oh for a faithful dog sighed sam i saw a moving picture once in which a dog came and untied a girl who was fastened to a tree id give as much as five dollars for that dog right now  make it six and a half sam and ill go half answered tom  well this is no joke declared dick almost severely we must get free somehowor theyll get that treasure and be off with it before father and the others have a chance to land weve got to do something  they all agreed they had to do something but what that something was to be was not clear they worked over their bonds until their wrists were cut and bleeding and then gave the task up it was so dark they could see each other but dimly and the darkness and quietness made them anything but lighthearted  supposing some wild beast comes to chew us up said sam presently after a silence that was positively painful  we know there are no big beasts on these islands answered dick dont worry yourself unnecessarily sam weve got troubles enough as it is  the only beasts here are human beasts said tom and their names are merrick sobber cuffer and shelley and he said this so dryly his brothers had to laugh  slowly the night wore away each hour dragging more than that which preceded it two or three times the boys tried again to liberate themselves but fared no better than before indeed dick fared worse for he came close to spraining his left wrist the pain for a while was intense and it was all he could do to keep from crying out  id like to know what time it is said sam when the first streak of dawn began to show among the trees  and id like to know if merrick has found the treasure cave added dick  it will soon be morning came from tom and he was right the rising sun did not penetrate to where they stood but it tipped the tops of the trees with gold and made it light enough for them to see each other quite plainly  the boys were glad that day had come at last for being prisoners in the light was not half as bad as in the dark each looked at the others rather curiously  well we are still here said tom laconically  yes and liable to stay here added sam  i wonder if father is getting ready to land said dick i suppose if he does he will come ashore where we did  yes but that is a good distance from here was sams comment  wonder if it would do us any good to yell said tom  and bring merrick and his gang down on us said his younger brother no thank you  i dont believe they are around said dick i am going to try my lungs and he began to yell with all the power of his vocal organs then tom and sam joined in and they kept this up off and on for fully an hour  i am not only dry but hungry said tom wish i had that lunch we brought along  tad sobber sneaked that away said dick if ever there was a fellow with a heart of stone hes the chap why dan baxter in his worst days wasnt as bad as this young rascal  another hour went by and then dick uttered an exclamation  listen  what did you hear asked his brothers  i thought i heard somebody calling  they strained their ears and from a great distance heard a cry but what it was they could not make out  lets call back said dick  it may do us harm interposed sam  well take the chance said tom and started a loud cry in which all joined they waited patiently for an answer to come back but for several minutes there was absolute silence then to their surprise a pistol shot sounded out  hullo ejaculated dick something is up i wonder what it is     chapter xxiii  what wingate had to tell   after the departure of the rover boys from the steam yacht mr rover and captain barforth held a consultation and it was decided that the search for the treasure cave should begin in earnest at daybreak  i do not think the boys will locate the cave in the coming darkness said anderson rover but still it will do no harm to let them have a try at it  mr rover do you suppose those on board the josephine have landed yet asked fred who was present  there is no telling for certain fred but i should say not since their steamer is nowhere in sight  i hope they do not come for some days said mrs stanhope for if they do and you meet i feel sure there will be serious trouble  after that anderson rover had a long talk with bahama bill and the old tar said he thought he could locate the cave without much trouble  0 course the isle has changed since i was here last said he must have had a hurricane or something like that to wash the beach and rake down some o the trees but i think i can find it as soon as i locate the trail leadin that way you know trails are great things why when i was sailing on the jessie d from the south sea islands we landed on a place where there was a trail running to a volcano we took to it and the first thing we know we went down into that ere volcano about a thousand feet it made my hair stand on end i can tell ye four o us went down an the others had to git ropes an haul us up agin an it took half a day to do it  vos you hurted much asked hans  not a scratch my hearty only it broke my pipe one my brother gave me afore i sailed an one i wouldnt have taken a months pay for concluded bahama bill  an hour later songbird who was on the deck of the steam yacht composing poetry in the darkness of the night saw the old tar coming toward him bahama bill was groaning deeply  whats the matter asked the would be post  oh im a burnin up on my inside answered the old tar and gave a deep groan i want a doctor i do  seeing bahama bill was really sick songbird went to his assistance and called mr rover then captain barforth was consulted and he gave the man some medicine  its queer i took sick so quick said bahama bill an hour later when he felt better  what did you eat and drink asked anderson rover  i ate a tongue sandwichone o them was handed around awhile ago i put it in my bunk room when i got it and ate it on going to bed it made me sick the minit i downed it  i ate one of those sandwiches and it didnt hurt me said fred  yah and i vos eat two of dem put in hans da vos goot doo and he smacked his lips  perhaps you ate something earlier in the day that didnt agree with you said captain barforth and there the talk ended and bahama bill retired once more  less than an hour later came a commotion on the steam yacht two men were evidently fighting and the voice of bahama bill was heard  ive caught ye he bellowed no ye aint goin to git away nuther and then came a crash as some article of furniture was tipped over  a rush was made by mr rover the boys and several others and to the astonishment of all bahama bill was discovered on the deck locked arm in arm with walt wingate who was doing his best to break away  wingate you rascal shouted anderson rover and caught the deck hand by the collar  let me go yelled the fellow and struggled to free himself he held a pistol in one hand and this went off but the bullet merely cut the air then the weapon was taken from him  so you are still on board eh roared captain barforth when he confronted the man what have you to say for yourself  ieri havent done anything wrong was wingates stubborn reply  oh no of course not  he came at me in my sleep cried bahama bill he had something in a little white paper and he was trying to put it into my mouth when i woke up an caught him i think he was going to poison me and he leaped forward and caught the prisoner by the throat  lelet up gasped the deck hand itits all a mis mistake i wasnt going to poipoison anybody  maybe he vos poison does sandwiches doo suggested hans i mean dose dot made bahama pill sick  like as not he did growled the old tar hes a bad one he is and he shook the deck hand as a dog shakes a rat  he is surely in league with sid merrick said anderson rover he faced wait wingate sternly do you dare deny it  at first wingate did deny it but when threatened with severe punishment unless he told the whole truth he confessed  i used to know sid merrick years ago he said he used me for a tool he did when we met at nassau he told me what he wanted done and i agreed to do it for some money he gave me and for more that he promised me  and what did you agree to do asked anderson rover  i agreed to get a job as a deck hand if i could and then on the sly cripple the yacht so she couldnt reach treasure isle as quick as the josephinethe steamer merrick is on then i also promised to make bahama bill sick if possible so he couldnt go ashore and show you where the cave was i wasnt going to poison him the stuff i used was given to me by merrick who bought it at a drug store in nausau he said it would make bahama bill sleepy dopy he called it  did he tell you what the stuff was  no  then it may be poison after all said captain barforth you took a big risk in using it not to say anything about the villainy of using anything  oh jest let me git at him capn came from bahama bill who was being held back by fred and songbird ill show him wot i think o sech a measly scoundrel and he shook his brawny fist at the prisoner  im sorry now i had anything to do with merrick went on walt wingate he always did lead me around by the nose  well he has led many others that way answered anderson rover remembering the freight robbers  i am willing to do anything i can to make matters right went on wingate  0 course you are now youre caught sneered bahama bill  can you tell us if the josephine was coming to this spot asked captain barforth  is this the south side of the isle  yes  well captain sackwell said he knew of a landing place on the north side of treasure isle and he was bound for that spot  the north side cried anderson rover he looked at captain barforth can they have tricked us he asked  i never heard o any landing on that side said bahama bill but then i never visited the place but onct as i told ye afore  did the spaniard doranez know of the landing on the north side questioned songbird  so he told merrick answered wingate he said he was the one to speak of the isle first for he had visited it half a dozen times during his voyages among the west indies  then they may be on the north side of the island now cried fred  after that walt wingate was questioned closely and he told all he knew about merrick and his plans he was very humble and insisted upon it that he had meant to do no more than put bahama bill into a sound sleep  well you are a dangerous character said captain barforth for the present i am going to keep you a prisoner and a few minutes later he had wingate handcuffed and placed under lock and key in a small storeroom the deck hand did not like this but he was thankful to escape a worse fate  anxious to know if the josephine was anywhere in the vicinity of the isle some of those on board the rainbow ascended one of the masts and attempted to look across the land but a hill shut off the view  well have to wait until morning said mr rover and was about to go down to the deck when something attracted his attention it was a strange shaft of light shooting up from along the trees in the center of treasure isle  a searchlight he cried somebody is on shore and it must be merrick with his crowd and this surmise was correct as we already know     chapter xxiv  a missing landmark   the searchlight was watched with interest for fully quarter of an hour it was of course visible only now and then but from the shafts of light seen those on the steam yacht were certain somebody was moving from the north side of the isle to the location of the treasure cave  we ought to head them off if possible declared anderson rover should that be merricks crowd and they meet my sons there will surely be trouble  let us go ashore without delay said songbird who was sorry he had not accompanied the rover boys  thats what i say added fred we can take plenty of lights  i vos not von pit sleepy declared hans i go kvick of you said so mr rofer  if yo go dont forgit aleck pleaded the colored man  you shall go aleck answered mr rover who knew he could depend upon the colored man in any emergency  i hope you find dick and tom and sam said dora it was foolish for them to go off alone  and dont let merrick hurt anybody pleaded nellie  it was quickly decided that the party to go ashore should be composed of mr rover bahama bill aleck and the three boys nearly everybody went armed and the party carried with them a small electric searchlight run by a pocket battery and two oil lanterns they also took with them some provisions and a pick a shovel and a crowbar for bahama bill said there might be some digging to do to get at the treasure  had it not been for the small searchlight it would have been next to impossible to find the opening through the reef during the night but the light was all that was needed and they came through with little more than a shower of spray touching them bahama bill and mr rover rowed the boat and soon brought the craft to a point where they disembarked without difficulty  the boys did not land here said anderson rover after a look along the sandy shore for footprints but they must have come in somewhere around here  lets call for them suggested songbird and this was done but no reply came back  they have started on the hunt for the cave just as i supposed they would said mr rover  den let us git aftah dem directly said aleck i feels like i could tramp all night widout half tryin  tying up the rowboat and shouldering their tools and provisions they set off along the shore of horseshoe bay just as the three rover boys had done bahama bill led the way with mr rover beside him carrying the electric light which gave out fully as much light as did the acetylene gas lamp carried by merrick  here are some footprints cried mr rover after a short distance had been covered  dem was made by our boys cried aleck after a minute examination i know dem shoes fo i has shined em many de time  if they walked in that direction they took the wrong course was bahama bills comment like as not they got turned around among the trees an in the dark  we must locate the party with that strong light we saw from the yacht said mr rover perhaps in doing that well come up to my sons  once on shore the old tar said he remembered the locality well and he did not hesitate in pushing forward across the path taken by the three rover boys and then to a trail which the rovers had missed they had to climb a small hill and here it was that bahama bill showed the first signs of perplexity  queer he muttered coming to a halt and gazing around mighty queer  what is queer questioned anderson rover  this looks changed to me when i was here afore there was a rock yonder an the crowd placed a mark on it fer a guide as i told ye aint no rock there now and he scratched his head as if he was afraid he was not seeing aright  when you were here was a good many years ago said songbird the rock may have tumbled down the hill let us look around  this advice was followed and after a long hunt a rock was found in a hollow it had a peculiar mark cut upon it  thats it cried bahama bill in delight i knew it must be around here somewherebut what made that big rock tumble down  maybe somepody pushed him ofer said hans  four men couldnt budge that rock declared fred  i believe an earthquake must have done it came from anderson rover and suddenly his face grew grave i trust no earthquake has disturbed the treasure cave he added  they pushed on but scarcely had they covered a quarter of a mile when bahama bill called another halt and well he might for the trail they had been following came to an abrupt end in front of a pit several rods in diameter and twenty to thirty feet deep the bottom of the pit was choked up with rocks dead trees and brushwood  what now asked mr rover and his tone betrayed his uneasiness  this wasnt here afore said the old tar briefly he was so stumped he could scarcely speak  you are sure  dead certain  then this isle has undoubtedly been visited by an earthquake within the last few years  thets it mr rover  maybe the trail can be picked up on the other side of the hole came from fred let us walk around  he and some of the others started to do so but soon came to a place where walking became uncertain and dangerous song bird went into one hole up to his waist and poor hans disappeared entirely  hellup hellup roared the german boy bull me owid somepody  aleck was close at hand and reaching down into the hole he got hold of hans hand it was a hard pull but presently anderson rover took hold too and between him and the colored man they got the german youth to the surface hans face and clothing were covered with dust and dirt and he was scratched in several places  i dink i was goin trough to chiny he said you pet my life i vos careful after dis vere i valk yah  the earthquake seems to have left this part of the isle full of pits and holes said mr rover i hope my boys have managed to steer clear of the dangerous places  they soon found they had to turn back and now bahama bill frankly declared that he was all at sea as he put it  every landmark i knew has been swept away he said all i can say is the cave is in that direction and he pointed with his hand but it may be buried out o sight now he added dismally  there was nothing to do but to retrace their steps and this they did as far as they were able  they had covered about half the distance when they saw a shaft of light shoot around the treetops near them  there is that strange light cried songbird  let us find out what it is added fred  they tried to follow the light and in doing this became hopelessly lost in the jungle then one of the boys struck one of the oil lanterns on a rock and smashed it thus doing away with that much of the illumination they carried  we must be careful said anderson rover we are making no progress so far as the treasure is concerned we had better try to find our way back to the shore and try to find my sons and this was agreed to by all  but it was no easy matter to get back to the shore and an hour later found them in a tangle of undergrowth aleck was ahead accompanied by fred and songbird  hark i heah something cried the colored man presently  somebody is calling cried songbird  maybe its dick and the others added fred  they called in return and then they fired off a pistol there was a brief silence and then came the call once more  come on dis way yelled aleck and plunged through the underbrush with the boys following  he continued to call and at last made out the voices of dick tom and sam quite plainly  ise found de boys cried the colored man in delight ise found de boys and he plunged on again until he gained the clearing where the three lads were tied to the trees with his pocketknife he cut their bonds  good for you aleck cried dick i am more than glad to see you  and so am i added sam and tom in a breath  then the others came up and the rover boys had to tell their story to which the members of the second party listened with the keenest of interest     chapter xxv  the trail through the jungle   sid merrick is certainly in deadly earnest was mr rovers comment after the boys had finished their tale he means to get hold of that treasure by hook or by crook and he will stop at nothing to gain his end  we want to go after him and his gang said dick we ought not to lose a minute doing it  can you walk dick  i guess so although being tied up made me rather stiff  i see your wrist is bleeding  yes and i tried pretty hard to free myself  and i tried too added sam but i couldnt budge a single knot  we could not unknot the knots added tom who was bound to have his joke  it was now morning for which all were thankful the lights were put out and the whole party partook of some of the provisions on hand  i believe merrick would have left us to starve said sam he is the greatest rascal i ever knew  the rover boys pointed out the direction sid merrick and his party had taken bahama bill said that trail was new to him and if it led to the treasure cave he did not know it  but ill know the cave as soon as i see itif it is still there he added  well you wont see it if it isnt there said dick grimly that earthquake may have changed the whole face of that portion of the isle  the trail appeared to make a wide sweep to the westward and led them over ground that was unusually rough the trailing vines were everywhere and they had to brush away innumerable spider webs as they progressed once songbird came upon some spiders larger than any he had yet seen and two crawled on his shoulder causing him to yell in fright  whats the matter asked dick  spiders two were just going to bite me but i got rid of em  dont be afraid songbird came from tom why dont you study them and write a poem about them  a poem about spiders ugh and songbirds face showed his disgust  der spider vos a pusy little animal observed hans he sphins his veb und attends strictly to business i dink i make up some boetry apout him and the german boy began  der vos von lettle sphider vot lifed owid in der voot he made himself a leetle veb und said dot it vos goot  hurrah for hans cried tom hes the true poet of spiderdom and then he added hans well crown you poet laureate if you say so  i tont von no crown answered hans complacently i chust so vell vear mine cap alretty  as the party progressed the way become more uncertain and at last they reached the edge of a swamp beyond which was some kind of a canebrake they saw numerous footprints in the soft soil and these led further still to the westward  listen said dick presently and held up his hand  all did as requested and from a distance heard somebody calling to somebody else then came a reply in sid merricks voice  merrick is talking to shelley said dick they have lost the right trail too  hang the luck they heard shelley say  no path at all  none answered sid merrick  there is no path here eitherits a regular jungle came from cuffer who was not far off  im all stuck up with the thorns put in tad sobber i think we were foolish to come to such a spot as this  you can go back if you want to answered his uncle who was evidently out of patience nobody is keeping you  i am not going back alonei couldnt find the way answered tad  then dont growl  i reckon well all have to go back and wait till that spaniard can show us the way said shelley  thats well enough to say shelley but supposing those rovers come here in the meantime  those boys  yes and their father and the others on that steam yacht went on sid merrick earnestly  they cant find the cave any quicker than we canif wingate did as he promised  but if he didnt hes a good deal of a coward and perhaps he didnt have the nerve to dose bahama bill  more talk followed but as the men were now moving in another direction the rovers and their companions made out little more of the conversation  what shall we do confront them asked sam of his parent  not if they are going back to their ship answered mr rover we can watch them and see what they do  at the end of half an hour they saw that the merrick party had started for the north side of the isle they waited in silence until all were well out of hearing  i am glad we are rid of themat least for the time being said anderson rover now we can continue the treasure hunt in peace  but dem fellers will be suah to come back interposed aleck  i know that aleck but they wont come back right away evidently they are returning to their vessel to get that spaniard doranez  id like to have punched merricks head for tying me up growled tom  it will be punishment enough for him if we get the treasure answered mr rover  if we do  you are not ready to give up yet are you tom  oh no but finding that treasure isnt going to be as easy as i thought  we ought to be able to find some trace of the cave pretty soonthe isle is so small if the isle was large it would be a different matter  they decided to advance some of the party skirting the swamp in one direction and some in another it was difficult work and they did not wonder that merrick and his party had given up in disgust occasionally they had to wade in water up to their ankles and then climb through brushwood that was all but impassible they tore their clothing more than once and scratches were numerous  the sun had been shining brightly but now as if to add to their misery it went under some heavy clouds casting a deep gloom over the jungle  we are goin to have a storm said bahama bill an when it comes i reckon it will be a lively one i remember onct when i was on the island o cuby we got a hurricane that come putty nigh to sweepin everything off the place it took one tree up jest whar i was standin an carried it bout half a mile out into the ocean thet tree struck the foremast o a brig at anchor an cut it off clean as a whistle some o the sailors thought the end o the world was comin  they certainly do have some heavy hurricanes down here remarked anderson rover but let us hope well escape all such even though we get a wetting he added as he felt a few drops of rain  soon it was raining steadily and when they reached a spot clear of trees they got soaked to the skin but as it was very warm they did not mind this  its like taking a bath without troubling about undressing said tom and this remark caused a smile  they were now in a bunch once more with bahama bill leading them the old tar was looking sharply ahead and soon he gave a grunt of satisfaction  what is it asked anderson rover eagerly i know where i am now was the reply  and unless that earthquake knocked it skyhigh thet cave ought to be right ahead o us     chapter xxvi  a dismaying discovery   the announcement that the treasure cave must be just ahead of them filled the entire party with renewed energy and regardless of the rain which was now coming down heavily they pushed on behind bahama bill in a close bunch each eager to be the first to behold the sought for spot  there was no longer any trail and they had to pick their way over rough rocks and through brushwood and vines which were thick regardless of the fact that they had little or no rooting places  i guess weve got to earn that treasure if we get it said sam as he paused to get his breath  it certainly looks that way answered dick as he wiped the rain and perspiration from his face i wonder how much further we have to go  that question was answered almost immediately for bahama bill turning the corner of several extra large rocks came to a halt with a grunt of dissatisfaction  well what now questioned anderson rover  its gone  what the cave asked several  yesshes gone swallowed up busted answered the old tar thet air earthquake done it an no error he went on it jest shook thet pile o rock wot made the cave into a heap and theres the heap  bahama bill pointed in front of him where a large quantity of rocks lay in a scattered mass many of them ten and twenty tons in weight at one point was what he said had been the entrance to the cave but this was completely blocked by the stones  vots der madder cant ve get in queried hans with a look of real concern on his honest face  that doesnt look like it answered fred too bad and after coming so far for this treasure too  we must get in there somehow cried dick  why cant we blow up the rocks with dynamite suggested tom  we canbut it will take time said his father he turned to bahama bill about how far into the cave was the treasure placed  oh at least a hundred feet maybe two hundred  anderson rover heaved a deep sigh which was echoed by his sons to get down into that mass of rocks a distance of from one to two hundred feet would surely be a herculean task if not an impossible one and then too there was a question whether or not the treasure had not dropped down through some hole in the bottom of the cave after the earthquake  ill have to think this over said anderson rover after an examination of the rocks well have to try to locate the treasure and then see if we can raise enough dynamite to blow the rocks away more than likely if we undertake the task it will take a long timeperhaps weeks and months  what as long as that cried sam in dismay  well if the treasure is as valuable as reported it will be worth it answered dick  but in the meantime what of sid merrick and his gang asked tom more than likely they will make us seven kinds of trouble and do their best to get the treasure away from us  we shall have to protect ourselves as well at we can said mr rover  after that it rained so hard they were forced to seek shelter under a thick bunch of palms the rain continued for half an hour longer and then the sun came out strongly and the jungle became steaming hot  with bahama bill to guide them they walked around what had been the top of the treasure cave from some landmarks which had not been totally destroyed by the earthquake the old tar felt certain that there could be no mistake and that the treasure must be buried beneath them  but how far down youll have to go to reach it i cant tell he added its like them ile well diggerssometimes they strike ile near the top o the ground an then agin they have to bore putty deep down its my hope ye wont have to roll away moren two or three rocks to git into the hole an put your hands on the boxes with the gold and jewels  if we only had to roll away two or three rocks id be for doing the rolling right now cried tom  id like to see you roll a rock weighing ten or fifteen tons observed songbird youd want about twenty horses to even start it  now that the first disappointment was over the rovers began to consider getting down into the cave from a purely practical point they looked over all the big rocks with care making a note of such as ought to be blasted away and of others that could be removed with the aid of a rope and pulleys  let us see if we cannot gain the shore of the bay in a straight line from here said mr rover after the examination of the ground had come to an end if we can it will make it so much easier to go back and forth from the steam yacht  they had a compass with them and leaving the vicinity of the shattered cave struck out in a direct line for horseshoe bay much to their surprise they found an easy path and came out on the sandy beach almost before they knew it  well i never cried dick if we had known of this before what a lot of trouble we might have saved ourselves  well we know it now answered tom and as we marked the path it will be an easy matter in the future to go back and forth from the cave to the bay  it took them some time to get their boat and it was almost nightfall before they reached the steam yacht it can readily be imagined that the stanhopes and lanings awaited their coming with interest  what success dick cried dora eagerly  not so very much as yet he answered soberly for he hated to disappoint the girl who was so dear to him and then he told her of all that had happened she shuddered when she found he had been a prisoner of sid merrick and his followers  oh dick i am so thankful you escaped she cried with tears in her eyes you must not get into such a situation again why the whole treasure isnt worth it  but i want to get that money and the jewels for you dora  yes but i dont want money and jewels ifif you areare going to get hurt she answered and her deep eyes looked him through and through  ill be careful after thisbut we are going to get the treasure sure thing he added stoutly  i was afraid an earthquake might have played pranks with that cave was captain barforths comment an earthquake can shake down the top of a cave quicker than it can shake down anything else it doesnt take much to do it  the captain said he had a fair quantity of powder on board to be used in the cannon for saluting and signalling if they wanted dynamite however hed have to run over to one of the big islands for it  and then we may have trouble getting it he added wed probably have to buy up the supply of some contractor who happened to have it on hand  i dont like to think of leaving the island while merrick and his crowd are around answered anderson rover  on the following morning mr rover and captain barforth went ashore taking dick tom and sam along the steam yacht was left in charge of asa carey and the mate was told to remain close to the mouth of the reef and to send some of the others ashore armed if there came a signal of distress  we have enemies on this isle said captain barforth and they may try to do us harm  ill watch out answered the mate shortly and then he turned away with a thoughtful look on his sour countenance that there was something on his mind was evident  the small boat was brought ashore at the point where the path led directly to the sunken cave although there was a lively breeze blowing those landing did so without mishap they had with them some tools for digging and also a rock drill and some powder  it will do no harm to blast one or two of the rocks and see what is underneath said anderson rover we may possibly be lucky enough to find some entrance into the cave although i must confess i doubt it  when they got to the vicinity of the shattered cave they found everything as they had left it even a pick tom had forgotten remained undisturbed  evidently the merrick crowd has not yet found its way here said dick  we shall have to be on our guard when we go to blasting answered his parent for the noise may bring that rascal and his gang here in a hurry  and then all set to work with vigor to see if by some means they could not get down under the rocks and to the spot where the precious treasure had been deposited so many years before     chapter xxvii  what happened on the steam yacht   about an hour after the rovers and captain barforth had left the steam yacht dora came from the forward deck looking much disturbed  what is the trouble asked her mother  oh not very much she answered for she did not wish to worry her parent where is fred  i think he is at the stern fishing with hans and john  i want to see them continued dora and hurried off  she found the three chums at the stern they had been fishing for some time and several fish lay on the deck near them  hullo dora want to try your luck asked fred pleasantly ill fix you a lineand fix lines for nellie and grace too if they want them  i want to tell you boys something said the girl in almost a whisper and not noticing what fred had proposed ii am afraid something is going to happen  whats that asked songbird and all three youths looked at dora anxiously  i was just up near the bow of the boat and i overheard mr carey the mate talking to mr bossermann the assistant engineer you know i dont like those men a bit  none of us do said fred  didnt ve haf a quarrel mid both of dem added hans  they were so in earnest that they did not notice me continued dora i was going to walk away when i saw them but then i overheard the name of walt wingate and i turned back to learn what they were saying about that bad man it seems both the mate and the assistant engineer have been talking to wingate and wingate has made them an offer  does wingate want his liberty questioned fred  yes and he wants morehe wants the mate and the assistant engineer to help him to defeat mr rovers plan to get the treasure he told mr carey and mr bossermann that if they would aid him he was sure sid merrick would reward them handsomely  and what did carey and bossermann say to that asked songbird eagerly  they said theyd like to talk it over with sid merrick  the scoundrels vociferated fred talk it over with merrick we ought to put em both in irons  i wanted to hear more but they walked away and i was afraid to follow them continued dora i thought i had better tell you and perhaps youd know what to do i didnt want to worry mother or my aunt  we ought to let captain barforth know of this at once said songbird  chust vot i say said hans der better der quicker  how can you let him know  one of us might row ashore said fred the others ought to stay behind to watch affairs  ill go ashore said songbird promptly  youll have to have one of the sailors row you  i know it i can take hollbrook hes a pretty decent sort of chap and i know he can row well  the fishing lines were wound up and without delay songbird presented himself to asa carey  he and the others had agreed to say nothing to the mate about what dora had over heard  mr carey i wish to go ashore he said can i have hollbrook row me to the beach  go ashore growled the mate i didnt know anybody else was going  well ive just made up my mind to go can hollbrook take me in one of the small boats  why didnt you go when captain barforth went  i didnt think of it then  i dont know that i can spare hollbrook grumbled the mate he was eyeing songbird in a suspicious manner  he doesnt seem to be doing anything just now  say who is running this vessel you or i cried asa carey  captain barforth is running her but she is under charter to mr rover and mr rover told me to use a small boat whenever i pleased answered songbird sharply if you refuse to let me have a boat say so  oh ieri didnt say that stammered the mate if you want to go do so but i dont know if hollbrook can get you through the reef in safety or not  ill risk it said songbird briefly and hurried below to prepare himself for the trip fred and hans met him in his stateroom  i think carey is suspicious said songbird keep an eye on him and if anything goes wrong shoot off the cannon or a gun ill do my best to find mr rover and the captain and bring them back as quickly as possible  in a few minutes songbird and the sailor were over the side of the rainbow hollbrook could pull a long telling stroke and under his guidance the craft soon shot through the opening in the reef and glided safely into the bay  i am glad to put foot on shore said the sailor as he leaped out on the sand  i want you to remain near the boat said songbird i want to see the captain and it is possible we may want to get back to the steam yacht in a hurry  oh all right sir  while i am gone watch the rainbow and if she should steam away any great distance call me  why i thought orders were for us to remain near the reef cried hollbrook  so they were but mr carey is in command now  leaving the sailor on the sand songbird hurried up the path which the rovers and captain barforth had taken earlier in the day he had covered less than half the distance to the shattered cave when he heard a shout from the beach then from the water came the sound of a shotgun  something is wrong already he gasped as he stopped running i wonder what it can be  he hesitated not knowing whether to go forward or back then he set up a yell on his own accord  captain barforth mr rover this way quick he called at the top of his lungs  at first no answer came back but presently he heard toms shrill whistle and then a cry from sam and dick the three rover boys came down the path pell mell and their father and the captain were not far behind them  whats the trouble came simultaneously from dick and tom sam would have asked the question too but he was out of breath  its asa carey answered songbird and then as the others came up he told what dora had overheard  and that shot we heard questioned captain barforth  it told that there was trouble on board but what i dont know  let us get to the shore said dick he was thinking of dora and her mother and the lanings  as quickly as possible they dashed along to the sandy beach hollbrook was still calling for songbird  the yacht is steaming away he announced she is standing to the eastward  captain barforth gave a look and something like a groan escaped him the rainbow was a good mile away from where she had been stationed since reaching treasure isle  can it be possible carey and bossermann are running away with the vessel asked sam  that would be both mutiny and robbery answered the captain i gave orders to carey to leave her where she was unless a heavy blow threatened to send her inthen he was to stand off until the blow was over  do you know what i think came from dick i think he is going to sail around to the other side of the isle probably he has an idea of consulting with sid merrick then if merricks offer suits him he will do all he can to prevent us from getting the treasure  you mean he and bossermann will throw in their fortunes with merrick asked mr rover  yes and as many more on the steam yacht as carey can win over i believe carey is a rascal and bossermann is no better  yes but they are only two against over a dozen said captain barforth  no three for you must remember they have wingate with them put in tom  that is true  cant we get to the yacht somehow asked sam he was thinking of grace and the other girls and wondering what would become of them in case there was a fight on board  no that is out of the question answered mr rover all we can do is to remain on the isle and wait developments if they land we can fight them but not before     chapter xxviii  a new move of the enemy   something is up  it was fred who spoke only a few minutes after songbird and the sailor in charge of the rowboat had left the side of the steam yacht he addressed hans  vot you vos see asked the german youth  look  hans looked and beheld walt wingate on the deck in earnest conversation with the mate the deck hand was not handcuffed as he had been a short while before when tramping the forward deck for air by captain barforths permission  carey must haf daken dem handguffs off said the german youth i tont like dot maype dot vingate make troubles hey  the boys watched and presently saw bossermann come up and join the pair then bossermann went below to the engine room shortly after this the yacht began to get up steam  were moving cried dora as she came to the boys accompanied by nellie and grace oh what does it mean  i dont know answered fred  cant you find out fred asked nellie i am sure the captain said nothing about sailing before he went ashore  ill find outif the mate will tell me answered fred  he walked over to where the mate stood close to the wheelhouse giving directions to the pilot of the rainbow  mr carey where are we bound he asked respectfully  oh just going to take a little sail around to test the engine was the apparent indifferent answer  is the engine out of order  not exactly but i thought it best to test the shaft the assistant engineer thinks it is weak  this was apparently a fair enough answer and fred bowed and walked away then he went down the ladder leading to the engine room he met frank norton coming up there was a look of concern on the head engineers honest face  mr norton is there anything wrong with the engine or the shaft asked fred  nothing the matter why  mr carey said there was and he is taking a cruise around to test themso he says  i dont understand it garrison everything 0k  are you in charge now  no this is my hour off bossermann is in charge by the way i see powell went off after the others  yes and i wish the others were back answered fred he hesitated a moment mr norton i believe you have been with captain barforth a long time and that you and he are old chums  thats right  then i can trust you cant i it is something which concerns captain barforth and this vessel very much  sure you can trust me  without hesitation for he felt sure norton was both honest and reliable fred told his story to the head engineer who nodded many times during the recital  i see it whispered norton i suspected something was wrong carey and bossermann are in some sort of a plot with this wingate who came on board solely to aid that sid merrick i believe carey is going off to meet merrick and see if he can make a deal with him  that is what i think how can we thwart him  better fire that gun as a signal to those on shore first of all then well see what the mate has to say  fred needed no urging and soon he brought up a shotgun from the cabin and discharged itthe signal heard by songbird as we already know scarcely had this been accomplished when asa carey rushed down upon him from the pilot house  hi what did you do that for roared the mate in sudden anger  just for fun answered fred as coolly as he could although his heart beat rapidly  for fun  yes havent i a right to fire a gun if i want to  i reckon that was some sort of a signal for those on shore  and supposing it was what then mr carey fred put the question boldly and looked the mate squarely in the eyes as he spoke  whyerits most unusual there was no need of a signal  i wanted them to know we were moving thats all  humph there was no use of alarming them well be back long before they want to come aboard again  in that case ill have nothing more to say  dont you believe it  im bound to believe it if you say so  dont get impudent young man  i am not impudent and you neednt get impudent either cried fred his anger rising you are in command here but this boat is under charter and just now i represent the man who owns that charter if you have got to cruise around to test the engine and shaft well and good but if you are merely cruising around for the fun of it i say go back to where we came fromnone of us want to do any cruising today  at this plain speech the mate grew purple in the face he raised his hand as if to strike the youth but just then aleck came on deck carrying a pitcher of ice water in his hand  stop dat dont yo go fo to hit dat boy cried the colored man if yo do ill fling dis watah pitcher at yo head  you shut up you rascally nigger shouted the mate you have nothing to say here  ise got someting to say if yo hit massa fred answered aleck and held the water pitcher as if ready to launch it at the mates head  there was a moment of excitement and several crowded around but then the mate waved the crowd away  i shall report this to captain barforth as soon as he comes back he said and turning on his heel he walked off fred went down into the cabin and aleck followed him a few minutes later norton joined the youth and the others who had gathered to talk the matter over  we must be on the watch said the chief engineer i am certain now that carey is up to some game  a long discussion followed but nothing came of it the steam yacht kept on its way and rounded the eastern point of treasure isle then it stood to the north westward  i hope he knows his course said norton to the boys if he doesnt he stands a good chance of running us on some key or reef  if the boys were excited the girls and ladies were more so nobody knew exactly what to do and each minute added to the general anxiety  at last the vessel rounded another point of the isle and came in sight of the sea beyond there in the distance was a steamer at rest on the waves and fred and hans felt certain she must be the josephine  the two vessels were soon close together as the rainbow came up to the other craft walt wingate went to the rail and shouted something through a megaphone which the mate loaned him immediately came back an answering cry but the boys did not catch what was said  this is going pretty far said fred to frank norton dont you think i ought to step in and stop it  the chief engineer shrugged his shoulders  carey is really in command and it might be called mutiny to do anything to stop him  but supposing he allows wingate to go to that other ship  well if wingate goes well be well rid of him  of course that is true but still  fred did not finish for just then asa carey came up  i am going to visit that other steamer he said to the chief engineer i shall take that man wingate along and bossermann is going too you can remain right here until i get back  norton nodded but said nothing the mate looked at fred as if to say more but then apparently changed his mind and hurried away soon a small boat was over the side and this was manned by the mate bossermann wingate and a sailor named ulligan a fellow noted for his laziness and untrustworthiness without delay the small boat set out for the josephine  i dont like this at all said fred those fellows mean mischief as sure as you are born  i dink da vos hatch owid somedings mid dot merrick said hans  perhaps they are plotting to gain possession of this yacht was doras comment they may bring over a crowd to take possession and make us prisoners  if they try any game like that well fight answered fred  dats right cried aleck well fight an fight mighty hard too  if only the rovers were here sighed dora i am sure they would know exactly what to do  they may be having their own troubles on land said mrs stanhope sid merrick is a very bad man and will do all in his power to get that treasure in his possession     chapter xxix  the hunt for the treasure   with the rainbow steaming away from horseshoe bay the rovers and those with them on shore felt that a crisis had been reached if it was true that carey bossermann and wingate contemplated joining sid merrick there was no telling what the enemy might not accomplish next  i have never liked carey observed captain barforth but i did not imagine he would take matters in his own hands in this fashion i did not think he had the backbone  its the thought of the treasure has done it answered anderson rover many a mans head is turned because of gold  those on the shore watched the steam yacht round the eastern point of the isle each heart sank as the vessel disappeared from view  well we can do nothing at present but hope for the best observed the captain we cannot think of chasing them in the rowboats  we might tramp across the isle and see where they go to suggested tom the josephine must be over there somewhere  yes we can do that answered mr rover but it will be a rough journey  i have a better idea came from dick father has his spyglass with him why not ascend that hill back of where the treasure cave is and then get up in the highest tree there a fellow ought to be able to see all around from that height  hurrah just the thing exclaimed sam he did not relish the long tramp through the thorn bushes and tangle of vines  dicks idea was acceptable to all and they set off without further delay they took the path leading to the shattered cave and then mounted the small hill dick had mentioned close to the top stood a large tree  let me go up exclaimed tom who could climb like a cat and he started without delay  look out that you dont break your neck cried his parent  ill be careful answered the funloving youth this just suits me he added enthusiastically  cant i go too asked sam  if you are careful answered mr rover and up went the lad right on the heels of his brother it was rather difficult work getting from limb to limb for some were wide apart but the vines which used the tree as a trellis aided them greatly soon tom was close to the top and sam speedily joined him then each took his turn at looking through the spyglass  i see the rainbow cried tom she is headed for the north side of the isle  yes and yonder is another vessel returned sam as he pointed the glass in the direction that must be the josephine and then the two youths shouted the news to those below  after that the boys watched the progress of the steam yacht with interest keeping those below informed of all that was going on they saw the rainbow draw closer to the other vessel and saw the small boat leave the steam yacht  four men are rowing to the other vessel announced tom we cant make out who they are  they saw the four men board the other vessel and disappear presumably into the cabin then came a wait of over half an hour  this is getting tiresome said tom  you can go below if you want to answered dick who had come up followed by songbird  tom descended to the ground and sam followed him they had just done this when there came a cry from dick  two boats are putting off from that other vessel each of them is filled with men  are they coming ashore or going to my yacht demanded captain barforth  they are heading for the yacht  they intend to capture the rainbow groaned mr rover oh if only we were on board  in his anxiety to see what was being done he climbed the tree and so did the captain then the others came up the tree being large and strong even at the top and capable of holding a good weight  if those rascals try to take my vessel ill have them all hung roared captain barforth and trembled with rage oh if only i was on board and he clenched his fists  look look ejaculated dick who had the spyglass i thinkyes the rainbow is moving  moving came from the others  yes and she is turning away from the other vessel and from those in the rowboats  let me see said the captain and took the spyglass you are right dick the rainbow is running away from them  the news was true the steam yacht was indeed running away from the josephine and from those in the rowboats who had set out to take possession of her it was a time of great excitement  the rowboats are getting close to the rainbow said tom who had taken the glass the yacht doesnt seem to have much steam up  perhaps the fires were banked when carey left suggested the captain maybe they were put out so the vessel couldnt move  the steam yacht was moving slowly and those in the two rowboats were making every effort to catch up to her then the black smoke began to pour from the funnel of the josephine  the other vessel is getting up steam said mr rover she may catch the rainbow even if those in the rowboats do not  closer and closer to the steam yacht drew the two rowboats until it looked as if the rainbow would surely be boarded by the enemy then of a sudden there came a cloud of smoke from the deck of the steam yacht followed by a stream of sparks which went whizzing just over the rowboats then followed more sparks and balls of fire red white and blue  what in the world are they doing murmured captain barforth  they are shooting off something but it is not a gun or a cannon answered mr rover  hurrah i know what it is cried tom good for fred and hans those are my fireworksthose i had left from the fourth of july celebration they are giving them a dose of rockets and roman candles  this news was true and as the rockets and roman candles hit the rowboats and the occupants the latter stopped rowing and then began to back water in confusion soon the rowboats turned back and hastened to the side of the josephine  thats what i call repelling boarders said captain barforth grimly i only hope the fireworks hold out  it is now to be a race between the rainbow and that other craft observed mr rover and he was right inside of fifteen minutes both vessels were headed out to sea and running at about the same rate of speed soon the haze over the water hid both craft from view  well one thing is certain said mr rover our friends are alive to their danger and are going to do their best to get away from the enemy  and another thing is that we are left marooned on this isle said the captain  the party remained in the tree a while longer and then as there seemed nothing else to do they descended to the ground  well we have one thing in our favor was dicks comment sid merrick and his crowd must be on the josephine or they wouldnt chase the rainbow and that being so they cant interrupt our treasure hunt at least for the present  but if they capture our steam yacht how are we to get away from here even if we do uncover the treasure said sam  well get away somehowand make it good and hot for them in the bargain answered tom and his father nodded in approval  with their thoughts on the rainbow and those on board the treasure hunters went back to the vicinity of the shattered cave nobody felt much like working yet to remain idle made the time hang heavily on their hands  there is no use of our going to work in a haphazard fashion were mr rovers words we must first go over the ground carefully and plan out just what is best to do otherwise a good portion of our energies will be wasted  this was sound advice and was followed out they surveyed the whole vicinity with care poking in among the rocks with long sticks and turning over such as were loose and easily moved  this looks as if it was going to be a long winded job was sams comment and he heaved a sigh i thought wed come here march into the cave and put our hands right on the gold and diamonds  dick was a short distance away poking into a hole with a stick the stick was over eight feet long but the end did not appear to touch anything  there is some kind of a hollow below here he said to the others i think we ought to investigate and see how large it is  the others agreed with him and all set to work to pull aside half a dozen rocks which were in the way they had to use all their strength and even then the largest of the stones refused to budge  let us get a small tree and use it for a pry suggested mr rover  they had an ax with them and tom cut down the tree and trimmed it then resting the log on one stone they inserted the end under the big rock and pressed down with all their might  shes coming shouted sam as the big stone commenced to move  yes and look at the opening underneath added dick it must surely be part of the cave  the sight of the big hole made all eager to know if it was really a portion of the shattered cave and they worked on the big rock with renewed energy twice it slipped back on them but then they got a new purchase and over it went and rolled out of the way then all of the treasure hunters got on their hands and knees to gaze down into the hole  it must be part of the cave said mr rover  ill climb down on the rope said tom hurry up i cant wait  you be careful tom or youll get hurt warned his father but it must be confessed he was as eager as his son to learn whether or not they had discovered the treasure cave  tom went down and dick and sam came after him the bottom of the hole was rough on one side was another opening leading to what certainly looked like a cave of considerable extent  drop down the lantern called dick and captain barforth did so with the lantern lit dick crawled into the side opening and his brothers followed  this is certainly a cave said tom but whether it is the right one or not remains to be seen  it must be a part of the original cave tom answered dick because it is in the spot covered by the other but it may not be the part that contained the treasure  they crawled around over the rough rocks and fallen dirt it was a dangerous proceeding for they did not know but what some stones might fall at any moment and crush them  suddenly tom and sam uttered the single exclamation  look  dick looked and then he too gave a cry from under the edge of a rock they saw one end of a heavy wooden chest a part of the side was split away and through the hole they saw a quantity of gold money     chapter xxx  homeward boundconclusion   the treasure  the boys uttered the cry together and it thrilled those at the top of the opening as nothing else could have done  whats that cried mr rover  we have found one of the chests answered dick  and its full of gold pieces added sam and tom in a breath  then this is the treasure cave after all said captain barforth i must say you are in luck  id like to go down and have a look put in songbird eagerly  all wanted to look and in the end they came down one after another by way of the rope the rock on the chest was lifted away and the strong box was dragged forth into the light sure enough it was filled with gold just as bahama bill had said it would be  bahama bill said there were three chests said mr rover after the excitement of finding so much wealth had somewhat subsided do you see anything of the other two  not yetbut they must be somewhere near answered his oldest son  regardless of the danger of falling rocks they commenced to dig around where the chest had been uncovered they soon found a second chest which contained more gold in leather bags and also a quantity of jewelry and precious stones then when they were almost ready to give up work for the day they discovered the third chest smashed flat under two heavy rocks with its contents of gold scattered in all directions  well have to blow up those rocks to get all that gold said sam  dont do that warned captain barforth if you do you may cave in the whole roof and then the gold may be gone forever  it was then decided to bring down the log and pry the rocks away and late as it was this was done and they scooped up the loose golden pieces and put them in their pockets  its a fine lot o money was the comment of hollbrook the sailor wish some o it was mine  you shall be well paid for your work hollbrook answered mr rover only stick by us and help us to get this to safety  oh ill stick by you was the ready answer ive got no use for such scoundrels as carey and bossermann im only livin one life and ill live that honest like god helpin me  night was coming on when they got the treasure to the surface of the ground they hunted around diligently until they were almost certain they had everything of value each was exhausted from his labors but all were happy the rovers were particularly delighted  this will make the lanings and the stanhopes independent for life said dick to his brothers  and they deserve it returned tom wont they be glad when they hear the news  remember one thing said sam we havent got the treasure from the isle yet and we dont know how the rainbow is faring if those on the josephine capture our steam yacht i dont know what we are going to do  well we wont give up the treasure no matter what happens said dick stoutly  mr rover calculated that the treasure was worth more than bahama bill had said roughly estimated it would foot up to over a hundred thousand dollars and this figure did not take in some jewelry of quaint design with precious stones which were new to the treasure hunters  for all we know those stones may be worth another ten thousand or more said dick i can tell you its a great find and no mistake  it was decided to take the treasure down to the shore of horseshoe bay and there bury it directly behind the sandy beach  and well leave everything here as near as possible as we found it said anderson rover then if sid merrick comes he can look for the treasure to his hearts content and he winked at his sons  good cried tom i hope he breaks his back working to move the rocks  night had settled over treasure isle by the time the shore was reached with the treasure which was carried in one of the chests and in several bundles and numerous pockets men and boys were thoroughly fagged out and they sat down under the trees to rest before starting to place their find underground again  we might as well wait till morning said tom i want to have a look at that gold and that jewelry by daylight  we can wait said his father so long as none of our enemies return to this isle we shall be safe  they ate what little provisions were left and washed down the scanty meal with what water was left in the bottles so far they had been unable to find any springs on the isle  i believe the want of fresh water is what keeps the natives away was captain barforths comment and it is probable that his surmise was correct  i see a light cried songbird when they were on the point of retiring it is out on the water  he pointed and soon all made out the lights of a vessel in the distance then as the craft came closer they saw a rocket shoot up in the air followed by a roman candle  its the rainbow shouted dick that must be some sort of signal for us  but where is the josephine asked tom  nobody knew and just then nobody cared captain barforth ran down to the waters edge and prepared to launch one of the small boats  i am going out to my vessel he said hollbrook come along if everything is all right well send two rockets up or fire the cannon twice then you had better bring the treasure on board without delay  this was agreed to and in a moment more the captain and his man were afloat and rowing toward the opening of the reef with all their might those left behind waited anxiously for what might follow  the steam yacht may be in the hands of the enemy said songbird but he was mistaken for quarter of an hour later up went two rockets into the air then the searchlight struck the water and those on shore saw a rowboat put off and head for land  its bahama bill and one of the sailors cried tom a little later and then he raised his voice as the rowboat shot into the bay this way bill this way  soon the rowboat struck the sand and bahama bill leaped out his face was one broad smile  so ye got the treasure after all did ye he cried im powerful glad on it yes sir now well fool that merrick crowd good  but what of them and of their vessel asked anderson rover anxiously  broke down an drifting out on the ocean answered the old tar and then he continued you know how they tried to board usafter carey bossermann that skunk o a wingate an ulligan went to em well fust we kept em off with fireworks and with a shotgun we didnt have much steam up but frank nortonbless his heart worked like a beaver and the boys fred and hans helped him i went to steer an by good luck kept off the rocks an reefs they came after us pell mell an onct or twict we thought sure they had us an all o us got pistols and cutlasses an prepared to fight the ladies an the gals was most scared to death an locked themselves in their staterooms but we put some ile on the fire an putty soon we had steam enough up to bust an then we walked right away from em i reckon the captain o the josephine was mad for he kept on a followin us and onct he got putty close agin but then came some sort o an explosion from the other boat an we see a cloud o steam rushin up from below and somebody jumped overboard then the steam blew away an the engine stopped an we went onan left them away out in the ocean fifteen or twenty miles from here we calkerlated theyd follow us soon as they could make repairs so we came on at full speed to take you on board  is everybody safe asked dick  yes that dutch boy burnt himself agin with a rocket but it aint much an he dont care for he said the rocket hit a chap named sobber in the stomach and keeled him over  good for hans cried sam that will give tad sobber something to remember him by  as quickly as it could be done the treasure was transferred to the two rowboats and the entire party set out for the steam yacht they were careful in going through the opening in the reef for nobody wanted to see either boat swamped and its precious contents lost the passage was made in safety the searchlight aiding them  back again cried dick as he mounted to the deck  oh dick are you safe cried dora rushing to him  yes and we have the treasure he answered proudly  oh how glad i am everybody is safe put in nellie  we are all glad said mrs stanhope the last forty eight hours have been so full of peril  of course everybody has to tell his or her story and for a long time there was a perfect babel of voices fred and hans related how the steam yacht had been rescued from the clutches of the enemy and how frank norton had taken command and prevented anything in the shape of a mutiny the ladies and girls told of how they had been scared and how they had locked themselves up in a stateroom as bahama bill had said then the rover boys had to tell all about the finding of the great treasure  and just to think cried tom it is worth more than we at first supposed and in his glee he hugged both mrs stanhope and mrs laning and then hugged nellie nellie herself was so excited she never even noticed it  in the meantime captain barforth was consulting with the chief engineer and learning some of the particulars of how the mate had acted and how the steam yacht had been chased by the tramp steamer  i trust i did what was proper captain barforth said norton anxiously i tried to use my best judgment from what miss stanhope overheard of the talk between mr carey and that scoundrel of a wingate i felt mr carey was not the proper man to trust  you did exactly right said the captain and what has happened since proves it if carey and bossermann try to kick up any fuss ill tend to them  mr rover was called into the consultation and it was decided to leave the vicinity of treasure isle at once before the josephine should put in an appearance it was a cloudy night so they had to run with care and at reduced speed they kept a constant lookout for the other vessel but failed to sight her  carey and bossermann as well as ulligan will have to remain on board of her said captain barforth mr rover wants to get back to philadelphia as soon as possible with the treasure and she is under his charter if they want to kick up a fuss later why they can do it thats all  homeward bound cried sam enthusiastically  and with the treasure safe on board added tom it seems almost too good to be true  and the enemy left behind put in dick i hope they go back and hunt for the stuff he went on with a grin  his wish was fulfilled as they learned a long time later through one of the sailors composing the crew of the josephine the tramp steamer tried all of the next day to locate the steam yacht and then sid merrick ordered the craft back to treasure isle here merrick tad sobber carey bossermann and several others worked for nearly a week trying to unearth the treasure but of course without success then they had a quarrel with the spaniard doranez who would not keep sober they accused the man of taking them to the wrong place and in the fight that followed three men were seriously wounded then all went aboard the steamer and set sail for cuba the very next day the josephine was caught in a hurricane one of the worst experienced in the west indies for many years it drove the tramp steamer on the rocks and before she could be gotten off several big holes were pounded into her and she went down the sailor who told the story said he got away with four other sailors in a rowboat and after a fearful experience lasting two days was picked up by a steamer bound for havana he did not know what had become of the others on board and was of the opinion that the most of them if not all had been drowned  fortunately for those on the steam yacht the rainbow weathered the hurricane well the craft did a lot of plunging and pitching and the ladies and girls had to keep below but that was all after the hurricane the weather became unusually fine and the trip back to philadelphia proved a pleasant one arriving at the quaker city mr rover had the treasure deposited in a strong box of a local trust company and later it was divided according to the terms of mr stanhopes will this put a goodly sum in the bank for dora and her mother and also large amounts to the credit of mrs laning and nellie and grace the entire expenses of the trip were paid out of the treasure and captain barforth and his men were not forgotten for their services mrs stanhope wanted to reward the boys but not one would listen to this  well you are very kind she said to all of them if at any time you are in trouble come to me i shall not forget you she however insisted upon presenting dick with a new watch and chain and diamond pin to replace those stolen from him by cuffer and shelley  well that winds up the treasure hunt observed tom as the whole party were on their way home now for the next move on the programme  the next move is to go to school once more said dick and he was right as we shall learn in the next volume of this series to be entitled the rover boys at college or the right road and the wrong in that volume we shall meet many of our old friends once more and learn the details of a plot against funloving tom which had a most unlooked for ending we shall also meet dora and her cousins again and see how they acted when their boy friends were in deep trouble  the home coming for the rover boys was full of pleasure uncle randolph and aunt martha were at the depot to meet them and the aunt gave each the warmest kind of a hug and kiss while the uncle shook hands over and over again nor were anderson rover and aleck forgotten  back again and glad of it said tom as he flung his cap into the air the west indies are all right but give me valley brook farm every time  so say we all of us sung out dick and sam and here we will once again bid our friends goodbye
