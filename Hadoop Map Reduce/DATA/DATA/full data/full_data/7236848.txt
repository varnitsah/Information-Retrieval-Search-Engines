7236848	certain noble plays of japan  from the manuscripts of ernest fenollosa  chosen and finished by ezra pound  with an introduction by william butler yeats        introduction   i  in the series of books i edit for my sister i confine myself to those that have i believe some special value to ireland now or in the future i have asked mr pound for these beautiful plays because i think they will help me to explain a certain possibility of the irish dramatic movement i am writing these words with my imagination stirred by a visit to the studio of mr dulac the distinguished illustrator of the arabian nights i saw there the mask and headdress to be worn in a play of mine by the player who will speak the part of cuchulain and who wearing this noble halfgreek halfasiatic face will appear perhaps like an image seen in revery by some orphic worshipper i hope to have attained the distance from life which can make credible strange events elaborate words i have written a little play that can be played in a room for so little money that forty or fifty readers of poetry can pay the price there will be no scenery for three musicians whose seeming sunburned faces will i hope suggest that they have wandered from village to village in some country of our dreams can describe place and weather and at moments action and accompany it all by drum and gong or flute and dulcimer instead of the players working themselves into a violence of passion indecorous in our sittingroom the music the beauty of form and voice all come to climax in pantomimic dance  in fact with the help of these plays translated by ernest fenollosa and finished by ezra pound i have invented a form of drama distinguished indirect and symbolic and having no need of mob or press to pay its wayan aristocratic form when this play and its performance run as smoothly as my skill can make them i shall hope to write another of the same sort and so complete a dramatic celebration of the life of cuchulain planned long ago then having given enough performances for i hope the pleasure of personal friends and a few score people of good taste i shall record all discoveries of method and turn to something else it is an advantage of this noble form that it need absorb no ones life that its few properties can be packed up in a box or hung upon the walls where they will be fine ornaments   ii  and yet this simplification is not mere economy for nearly three centuries invention has been making the human voice and the movements of the body seem always less expressive i have long been puzzled why passages that are moving when read out or spoken during rehearsal seem muffled or dulled during performance i have simplified scenery having the hour glass for instance played now before green curtains now among those admirable ivorycoloured screens invented by gordon craig with every simplification the voice has recovered something of its importance and yet when verse has approached in temper to let us say kubla khan or the ode to the west wind the most typical modern verse i have still felt as if the sound came to me from behind a veil the stage opening the powerful light and shade the number of feet between myself and the players have destroyed intimacy i have found myself thinking of players who needed perhaps but to unroll a mat in some eastern garden nor have i felt this only when i listened to speech but even more when i have watched the movement of a player or heard singing in a play i love all the arts that can still remind me of their origin among the common people and my ears are only comfortable when the singer sings as if mere speech had taken fire when he appears to have passed into song almost imperceptibly i am bored and wretched a limitation i greatly regret when he seems no longer a human being but an invention of science to explain him to myself i say that he has become a wind instrument and sings no longer like active men sailor or camel driver because he has had to compete with an orchestra where the loudest instrument has always survived the human voice can only become louder by becoming less articulate by discovering some new musical sort of roar or scream as poetry can do neither the voice must be freed from this competition and find itself among little instruments only heard at their best perhaps when we are close about them it should be again possible for a few poets to write as all did once not for the printed page but to be sung but movement also has grown less expressive more declamatory less intimate when i called the other day upon a friend i found myself among some dozen people who were watching a group of spanish boys and girls professional dancers dancing some national dance in the midst of a drawingroom doubtless their training had been long laborious and wearisome but now one could not be deceived their movement was full of joy they were among friends and it all seemed but the play of children how powerful it seemed how passionate while an even more miraculous art separated from us by the footlights appeared in the comparison laborious and professional it is well to be close enough to an artist to feel for him a personal liking close enough perhaps to feel that our liking is returned  my play is made possible by a japanese dancer whom i have seen dance in a studio and in a drawingroom and on a very small stage lit by an excellent stagelight in the studio and in the drawingroom alone where the lighting was the light we are most accustomed to did i see him as the tragic image that has stirred my imagination there where no studied lighting no stagepicture made an artificial world he was able as he rose from the floor where he had been sitting crossedlegged or as he threw out an arm to recede from us into some more powerful life because that separation was achieved by human means alone he receded but to inhabit as it were the deeps of the mind one realised anew at every separating strangeness that the measure of all arts greatness can be but in their intimacy   iii  all imaginative art keeps at a distance and this distance once chosen must be firmly held against a pushing world verse ritual music and dance in association with action require that gesture costume facial expression stage arrangement must help in keeping the door our unimaginative arts are content to set a piece of the world as we know it in a place by itself to put their photographs as it were in a plush or a plain frame but the arts which interest me while seeming to separate from the world and us a group of figures images symbols enable us to pass for a few moments into a deep of the mind that had hitherto been too subtle for our habitation as a deep of the mind can only be approached through what is most human most delicate we should distrust bodily distance mechanism and loud noise  it may be well if we go to school in asia for the distance from life in european art has come from little but difficulty with material in half asiatic greece kallimachos could still return to a stylistic management of the falling folds of drapery after the naturalistic drapery of phidias and in egypt the same age that saw the village headman carved in wood for burial in some tomb with so complete a naturalism saw set up in public places statues full of an august formality that implies traditional measurements a philosophic defence the spiritual painting of the 14th century passed on into tintoretto and that of velasquez into modern painting with no sense of loss to weigh against the gain while the painting of japan not having our european moon to churn the wits has understood that no styles that ever delighted noble imaginations have lost their importance and chooses the style according to the subject in literature also we have had the illusion of change and progress the art of shakespeare passing into that of dryden and so into the prose drama by what has seemed when studied in its details unbroken progress had we been greeks and so but halfeuropean an honourable mob would have martyred though in vain the first man who set up a painted scene or who complained that soliloquies were unnatural instead of repeating with a sigh we cannot return to the arts of childhood however beautiful only our lyric poetry has kept its asiatic habit and renewed itself at its own youth putting off perpetually what has been called its progress in a series of violent revolutions  therefore it is natural that i go to asia for a stageconvention for more formal faces for a chorus that has no part in the action and perhaps for those movements of the body copied from the marionette shows of the 14th century a mask will enable me to substitute for the face of some commonplace player or for that face repainted to suit his own vulgar fancy the fine invention of a sculptor and to bring the audience close enough to the play to hear every inflection of the voice a mask never seems but a dirty face and no matter how close you go is still a work of art nor shall we lose by staying the movement of the features for deep feeling is expressed by a movement of the whole body in poetical painting  in sculpture the face seems the nobler for lacking curiosity alert attention all that we sum up under the famous word of the realists vitality it is even possible that being is only possessed completely by the dead and that it is some knowledge of this that makes us gaze with so much emotion upon the face of the sphinx or buddha who can forget the face of chaliapine as the mogul king in prince igor when a mask covering its upper portion made him seem like a phoenix at the end of its thousand wise years awaiting in condescension the burning nest and what did it not gain from that immobility in dignity and in power   iv  realism is created for the common people and was always their peculiar delight and it is the delight today of all those whose minds educated alone by schoolmasters and newspapers are without the memory of beauty and emotional subtlety the occasional humorous realism that so much heightened the emotional effect of elizabethan tragedy cleopatras old man with an asp let us say carrying the tragic crisis by its contrast above the tidemark of corneilles courtly theatre was made at the outset to please the common citizen standing on the rushes of the floor but the great speeches were written by poets who remembered their patrons in the covered galleries the fanatic savonarola was but dead a century and his lamentation in the frenzy of his rhetoric that every prince of the church or state throughout europe was wholly occupied with the fine arts had still its moiety of truth a poetical passage cannot be understood without a rich memory and like the older school of painting appeals to a tradition and that not merely when it speaks of lethes wharf or dido on the wild seabanks but in rhythm in vocabulary for the ear must notice slight variations upon old cadences and customary words all that high breeding of poetical style where there is nothing ostentatious nothing crude no breath of parvenu or journalist  let us press the popular arts on to a more complete realism for that would be their honesty and the commercial arts demoralise by their compromise their incompleteness their idealism without sincerity or elegance their pretence that ignorance can understand beauty in the studio and in the drawingroom we can found a true theatre of beauty poets from the time of keats and blake have derived their descent only through what is least declamatory least popular in the art of shakespeare and in such a theatre they will find their habitual audience and keep their freedom europe is very old and has seen many arts run through the circle and has learned the fruit of every flower and known what this fruit sends up and it is now time to copy the east and live deliberately   v    ye shall not while ye tarry with me taste   from unrinsed barrel the diluted wine   of a low vineyard or a plant illpruned   but such as anciently the aegean isles   poured in libation at their solemn feasts   and the same goblets shall ye grasp embost   with no vile figures of loose languid boors   but such as gods have lived with and have led  the noh theatre of japan became popular at the close of the 14th century gathering into itself dances performed at shinto shrines in honour of spirits and gods or by young nobles at the court and much old lyric poetry and receiving its philosophy and its final shape perhaps from priests of a contemplative school of buddhism a small daimio or feudal lord of the ancient capital nara a contemporary of chaucers was the author or perhaps only the stagemanager of many plays he brought them to the court of the shogun at kioto from that on the shogun and his court were as busy with dramatic poetry as the mikado and his with lyric when for the first time hamlet was being played in london noh was made a necessary part of official ceremonies at kioto and young nobles and princes forbidden to attend the popular theatre in japan as elsewhere a place of mimicry and naturalism were encouraged to witness and to perform in spectacles where speech music song and dance created an image of nobility and strange beauty when the modern revolution came noh after a brief unpopularity was played for the first time in certain ceremonious public theatres and 1897 a battleship was named takasago after one of its most famous plays some of the old noble families are today very poor their men it may be but servants and labourers but they still frequent these theatres accomplishment the word noh means and it is their accomplishment and that of a few cultured people who understand the literary and mythological allusions and the ancient lyrics quoted in speech or chorus their discipline a part of their breeding the players themselves unlike the despised players of the popular theatre have passed on proudly from father to son an elaborate art and even now a player will publish his family tree to prove his skill one player wrote in 1906 in a business circulari am quoting from mr pounds redaction of the notes of fenollosathat after thirty generations of nobles a woman of his house dreamed that a mask was carried to her from heaven and soon after she bore a son who became a player and the father of players his family he declared still possessed a letter from a 15th century mikado conferring upon them a theatre curtain white below and purple above  there were five families of these players and forbidden before the revolution to perform in public they had received grants of land or salaries from the state the white and purple curtain was no doubt to hang upon a wall behind the players or over their entrance door for the noh stage is a platform surrounded upon three sides by the audience no naturalistic effect is sought the players wear masks and found their movements upon those of puppets the most famous of all japanese dramatists composed entirely for puppets a swift or a slow movement and a long or a short stillness and then another movement they sing as much as they speak and there is a chorus which describes the scene and interprets their thought and never becomes as in the greek theatre a part of the action at the climax instead of the disordered passion of nature there is a dance a series of positions  movements which may represent a battle or a marriage or the pain of a ghost in the buddhist purgatory i have lately studied certain of these dances with japanese players and i notice that their ideal of beauty unlike that of greece and like that of pictures from japan and china makes them pause at moments of muscular tension the interest is not in the human form but in the rhythm to which it moves and the triumph of their art is to express the rhythm in its intensity there are few swaying movements of arms or body such as make the beauty of our dancing they move from the hip keeping constantly the upper part of their body still and seem to associate with every gesture or pose some definite thought they cross the stage with a sliding movement and one gets the impression not of undulation but of continuous straight lines  the print room of the british museum is now closed as a wareconomy so i can only write from memory of theatrical colourprints where a ship is represented by a mere skeleton of willows or osiers painted green or a fruit tree by a bush in a pot and where actors have tied on their masks with ribbons that are gathered into a bunch behind the head it is a childs game become the most noble poetry and there is no observation of life because the poet would set before us all those things which we feel and imagine in silence  mr ezra pound has found among the fenollosa manuscripts a story traditional among japanese players a young man was following a stately old woman through the streets of a japanese town and presently she turned to him and spoke why do you follow me because you are so interesting that is not so i am too old to be interesting but he wished he told her to become a player of old women on the noh stage if he would become famous as a noh player she said he must not observe life nor put on an old voice and stint the music of his voice he must know how to suggest an old woman and yet find it all in the heart   vi  in the plays themselves i discover a beauty or a subtlety that i can trace perhaps to their threefold origin the lovesorrows the love of father and daughter of mother and son of boy and girl may owe their nobility to a courtly life but he to whom the adventures happen a traveller commonly from some distant place is most often a buddhist priest and the occasional intellectual subtlety is perhaps buddhist the adventure itself is often the meeting with ghost god or goddess at some holy place or muchlegended tomb and god goddess or ghost reminds me at times of our own irish legends and beliefs which once it may be differed little from those of the shinto worshipper  the feathermantle for whose lack the moon goddess or should we call her fairy cannot return to the sky is the red cap whose theft can keep our fairies of the sea upon dry land and the ghostlovers in nishikigi remind me of the aran boy and girl who in lady gregorys story come to the priest after death to be married these japanese poets too feel for tomb and wood the emotion the sense of awe that our gaelic speaking country people will some times show when you speak to them of castle hackett or of some holy well and that is why perhaps it pleases them to begin so many plays by a traveller asking his way with many questions a convention agreeable to me for when i first began to write poetical plays for an irish theatre i had to put away an ambition of helping to bring again to certain places their old sanctity or their romance i could lay the scene of a play on bailes strand but i found no pause in the hurried action for descriptions of strand or sea or the great yew tree that once stood there and i could not in the kings threshold find room before i began the ancient story to call up the shallow river and the few trees and rocky fields of modern gort but in the nishikigi the tale of the lovers would lose its pathos if we did not see that forgotten tomb where the hiding fox lives among the orchids and the chrysanthemum flowers the men who created this convention were more like ourselves than were the greeks and romans more like us even than are shakespeare and corneille their emotion was selfconscious and reminiscent always associating itself with pictures and poems they measured all that time had taken or would take away and found their delight in remembering celebrated lovers in the scenery pale passion loves they travelled seeking for the strange and for the picturesque i go about with my heart set upon no particular place no more than a cloud i wonder now would the sea be that way or the little place kefu that they say is stuck down against it when a traveller asks his way of girls upon the roadside he is directed to find it by certain pine trees which he will recognise because many people have drawn them  i wonder am i fanciful in discovering in the plays themselves few examples have as yet been translated and i may be misled by accident or the idiosyncrasy of some poet a playing upon a single metaphor as deliberate as the echoing rhythm of line in chinese and japanese painting in the nishikigi the ghost of the girllover carries the cloth she went on weaving out of grass when she should have opened the chamber door to her lover and woven grass returns again and again in metaphor and incident the lovers now that in an aery body they must sorrow for unconsummated love are tangled up as the grass patterns are tangled again they are like an unfinished cloth these bodies having no weft even now are not come together truly a shameful story a tale to bring shame on the gods before they can bring the priest to the tomb they spend the day pushing aside the grass from the overgrown ways in kefu and the countryman who directs them is cutting grass on the hill  when at last the prayer of the priest unites them in marriage the bride says that he has made a dreambridge over wild grass over the grass i dwell in and in the end bride and bridegroom show themselves for a moment from under the shadow of the lovegrass  in hagoromo the feathermantle of the fairy woman creates also its rhythm of metaphor in the beautiful day of opening spring the plumage of heaven drops neither feather nor flame nor is the rock of earth overmuch worn by the brushing of the feathery skirt of the stars one half remembers a thousand japanese paintings or whichever comes first into the memory that screen painted by korin let us say shown lately at the british museum where the same form is echoing in wave and in cloud and in rock in european poetry i remember shelleys continually repeated fountain and cave his broad stream and solitary star in neglecting character which seems to us essential in drama as do their artists in neglecting relief and depth when they arrange flowers in a vase in a thin row they have made possible a hundred lovely intricacies   vii  these plays arose in an age of continual war and became a part of the education of soldiers these soldiers whose natures had as much of walter pater as of achilles combined with buddhist priests and women to elaborate life in a ceremony the playing of football the drinking of tea and all great events of state becoming a ritual in the painting that decorated their walls and in the poetry they recited one discovers the only sign of a great age that cannot deceive us the most vivid and subtle discrimination of sense and the invention of images more powerful than sense the continual presence of reality it is still true that the deity gives us according to his promise not his thoughts or his convictions but his flesh and blood and i believe that the elaborate technique of the arts seeming to create out of itself a superhuman life has taught more men to die than oratory or the prayer book we only believe in those thoughts which have been conceived not in the brain but in the whole body the minoan soldier who bore upon his arm the shield ornamented with the dove in the museum at crete or had upon his head the helmet with the winged horse knew his rôle in life when nobuzane painted the child saint kobo daishi kneeling full of sweet austerity upon the flower of the lotus he set up before our eyes exquisite life and the acceptance of death  i cannot imagine those young soldiers and the women they loved pleased with the illbreeding and theatricality of carlyle nor i think with the magniloquence of hugo these things belong to an industrial age a mechanical sequence of ideas but when i remember that curious game which the japanese called with a confusion of the senses that had seemed typical of our own age listening to incense i know that some among them would have understood the prose of walter pater the painting or puvis de chavannes the poetry of mallarmé and verlaine when heroism returned to our age it bore with it as its first gift technical sincerity   viii  for some weeks now i have been elaborating my play in london where alone i can find the help i need mr dulacs mastery of design and mr itos genius of movement yet it pleases me to think that i am working for my own country perhaps some day a play in the form i am adapting for european purposes shall awake once more whether in gaelic or in english under the slope of slievenamon or croagh patrick ancient memories for this form has no need of scenery that runs away with money nor of a theatrebuilding yet i know that i only amuse myself with a fancy for though my writings if they be seaworthy must put to sea i cannot tell where they may be carried by the wind are not the fairystories of oscar wilde which were written for mr ricketts and mr shannon and for a few ladies very popular in arabia  w b yeats april 1916     nishikigi     nishikigi a play in two acts by motokiyo   persons of the play   the waki                a priest  the shite or hero      ghost of the lover  tsure                   ghost of the woman they have both been long dead and have not yet been united  chorus  the nishikigi are wands used as a love charm  hosonuno is the name of a local cloth which the woman weaves     nishikigi   part first  waki there never was anybody heard of mount shinobu but had a kindly feeling for it so i like any other priest that might want to know a little bit about each one of the provinces may as well be walking up here along the much travelled road  i have not yet been about the east country but now i have set my mind to go as far as the earth goes and why shouldnt i after all seeing that i go about with my heart set upon no particular place whatsoever and with no other mans flag in my hand no more than a cloud has it is a flag of the night i see coming down upon me i wonder now would the sea be that way or the little place kefu that they say is stuck down against it  shite to tsure times out of mind am i here setting up this bright branch this silky wood with the charms painted in it as fine as the web youd get in the grasscloth of shinobu that theyd be still selling you in this mountain  shite and tsure tangled we are entangled whose fault was it dear tangled up as the grass patterns are tangled up in this coarse cloth or as the little mushi that lives on and chirrups in dried seaweed we do not know where are today our tears in the undergrowth of this eternal wilderness we neither wake nor sleep and passing our nights in a sorrow which is in the end a vision what are these scenes of spring to us this thinking in sleep of someone who has no thought of you is it more than a dream and yet surely it is the natural way of love in our hearts there is much and in our bodies nothing and we do nothing at all and only the waters of the river of tears flow quickly  chorus narrow is the cloth of kefu but wild is that river that torrent of the hills between the beloved and the bride  the cloth she had woven is faded the thousand one hundred nights were nighttrysts watched out in vain  waki not recognizing the nature of the speakers   strange indeed seeing these townpeople here   they seem like man and wife   and the lady seems to be holding something   like a cloth woven of feathers   while he has a staff or a wooden sceptre   beautifully ornate   both of these things are strange   in any case i wonder what they call them  tsure   this is a narrow cloth called hosonuno   it is just the breadth of the loom  shite   and this is merely wood painted   and yet the place is famous because of these things   would you care to buy them from us  waki yes i know that the cloth of this place and the lacquers are famous things i have already heard of their glory and yet i still wonder why they have such great reputation  tsure ah well now thats a disappointment here they call the wood nishikigi and the woven stuff hosonuno and yet you come saying that you have never heard why and never heard the story is it reasonable  shite no no that is reasonable enough what can people be expected to know of these affairs when it is more than they can do to keep abreast of their own  both to the priest ah well you look like a person who has abandoned the world it is reasonable enough that you should not know the worth of wands and cloths with loves signs painted upon them with loves marks painted and dyed  waki that is a fine answer and you would tell me then that nishikigi and hosonuno are names bound over with love  shite they are names in loves list surely every day for a year for three years come to their full the wands nishikigi were set up until there were a thousand in all and they are in song in your time and will be chidzuka they call them  tsure   these names are surely a byword   as the cloth hosonuno is narrow of weft   more narrow than the breast   we call by this name any woman   whose breasts are hard to come nigh to   it is a name in books of love  shite tis a sad name to look back on  tsure   a thousand wands were in vain   a sad name set in a story  shite   a seedpod void of the seed   we had no meeting together  tsure let him read out the story  chorus i   at last they forget they forget   the wands are no longer offered   the custom is faded away   the narrow cloth of kefu   will not meet over the breast   tis the story of hosonuno   this is the tale   these bodies having no weft   even now are not come together   truly a shameful story   a tale to bring shame on the gods  ii   names of love   now for a little spell   for a faint charm only   for a charm as slight as the binding together   of pineflakes in iwashiro   and for saying a wish over them about sunset   we return and return to our lodging   the evening sun leaves a shadow  waki go on tell out all the story  shite there is an old custom of this country we make wands of meditation and deck them with symbols and set them before a gate when we are suitors  tsure and we women take up a wand of the man we would meet with and let the others lie although a man might come for a hundred nights it may be or for a thousand nights in three years till there were a thousand wands here in the shade of this mountain we know the funeral cave of such a man one who had watched out the thousand nights a bright cave for they buried him with all his wands they have named it the cave of the many charms  waki   i will go to that lovecave   it will be a tale to take back to my village   will you show me my way there  shite so be it i will teach you the path  tsure tell him to come over this way  both   here are the pair of them   going along before the traveller  chorus   we have spent the whole day until dusk   pushing aside the grass   from the overgrown way at kefu   and we are not yet come to the cave   o you there cutting grass on the hill   please set your mind on this matter   youd be asking where the dew is   while the frosts lying here on the road   whod tell you that now   very well then dont tell us   but be sure we will come to the cave  shite   theres a cold feel in the autumn   night comes  chorus   and storms trees giving up their leaf   spotted with sudden showers   autumn our feet are clogged   in the dewdrenched entangled leaves   the perpetual shadow is lonely   the mountain shadow is lying alone   the owl cries out from the ivies   that drag their weight on the pine   among the orchids and chrysanthemum flowers   the hiding fox is now lord of that lovecave   nishidzuka   that is dyed like the maples leaf   they have left us this thing for a saying   that pair have gone into the cave sign for the exit of shite and tsure   part second  the waki has taken the posture of sleep his respectful visit to the cave is beginning to have its effect  waki restless   it seems that i cannot sleep   for the length of a prickets horn   under october wind under pines under night   i will do service to butsu he performs the gestures of a ritual  tsure   aie honoured priest   you do not dip twice in the river   beneath the same trees shadow   without bonds in some other life   hear soothsay   now is there meeting between us   between us who were until now   in life and in afterlife kept apart   a dreambridge over wild grass   over the grass i dwell in   o honoured do not awake me by force   i see that the law is perfect  shite supposedly invisible   it is a good service you have done sir   a service that spreads in two worlds   and binds up an ancient love   that was stretched out between them   i had watched for a thousand days   take my thanks   for this meeting is under a difficult law   and now i will show myself in the form of nishikigi   i will come out now for the first time in colour the characters announce or explain their acts as these are mostly symbolical thus here the shite or shte announces his change of costume and later the dance  chorus   the three years are over and past   all that is but an old story  shite   to dream under dream we return   three years and the meeting comes now   this night has happened over and over   and only now comes the tryst  chorus   look there to the cave   beneath the stems of the suzuki   from under the shadows of the lovegrass   see see how they come forth and appear   for an instant illusion  shite   there is at the root of hell   no distinction between princes and commons   wretched for me tis the saying  waki   strange what seemed so very old a cave   is all glitteringbright within   like the flicker of fire   it is like the inside of a house   they are setting up a loom   and heaping up charmsticks no   the hangings are out of old time   is it illusion illusion  tsure   our hearts have been in the dark of the falling snow   we have been astray in the flurry   you should tell better than we   how much is illusion   you who are in the world   we have been in the whirl of those who are fading  shite   indeed in old times narihira said   and he has vanished with the years   let a man who is in the world tell the fact   it is for you traveller   to say how much is illusion  waki   let it be a dream or a vision   or what you will i care not   only show me the old times overpast and snowed under   now soon while the night lasts  shite   look then the old times are shown   faint as the shadowflower shows in the grass that bears it   and youve but a moon for lanthorn  tsure   the woman has gone into the cave   she sets up her loom there   for the weaving of hosonuno   thin as the heart of autumn  shite   the suitor for his part holding his charmsticks   knocks on a gate which was barred  tsure   in old time he got back no answer   no secret sound at all   save  shite the sound of the loom  tsure   it was a sweet sound like katydids and crickets   a thin sound like the autumn  shite it was what you would hear any night  tsure   kiri  shite     hatari  tsure       cho  shite         cho  chorus mimicking the sound of crickets   kiri hatari cho cho   kiri hatari cho cho   the cricket sews on at his old rags   with all the new grass in the field sho   churr isho like the whir of a loom churr  chorus antistrophe   let be they make grasscloth in kefu   kefu the lands end matchless in the world  shite   that is an old custom truly   but this priest would look on the past  chorus   the good priest himself would say   even if we weave the cloth hosonuno   and set up the charmsticks   for a thousand a hundred nights   even then our beautiful desire will not pass   nor fade nor die out  shite   even today the difficulty of our meeting is remembered   and is remembered in song  chorus   that we may acquire power   even in our faint substance   we will show forth even now   and though it be but in a dream   our form of repentance explaining the movement of the shite and tsure   there he is carrying wands   and she has no need to be asked   see her within the cave   with a cricketlike noise of weaving   the grassgates and the hedge are between them   that is a symbol   night has already come on now explaining the thoughts of the mans spirit   loves thoughts are heaped high within him   as high as the charmsticks   as high as the charmsticks once coloured   now fading lie heaped in this cave

sometimes speaks what the chief characters are thinking sometimes it describes or interprets the meaning of their movements plot the ghost of kumasaka makes reparation for his brigandage by protecting the country he comes back to praise the bravery of the young man who killed him in single combat     kumasaka   part first  priest where shall i rest wandering weary of the world i am a citybred priest i have not seen the east counties and ive a mind to go there crossing the hills i look on the lake of omi on the woods of awatsu going over the long bridge at seta i rested a night at noje and

mean me what is it  shite a certain man died on this day i ask you to pray for him  priest all right but for whom shall i pray  shite i will not tell you his name but his grave lies in the green field beyond that tall pine tree he cannot enter to the gates of paradise and so i ask you to pray  priest but i do not think it is proper to pray unless you tell me his name  shite no no you can pray the prayer ho kai shijo biodo riaku that would do  priest praying unto all mortals let there be equal grace to pass from this life of agony by the gates of death into law into the peaceful kingdom  shite saying first a word or two if you pray for him  chorus continuing the sentence if you pray with the prayer of exeat he will be thankful and you need not be aware of his name they say that prayer can be heard for even the grass and the plants for even the sand and the soil here and they will surely hear it if you pray for an unknown man  shite will you enter this is my cottage  priest this is your house very well i will hold the service in your house but i see no picture of buddha nor any wooden image in this cottage nothing but a long spear on one wall and an iron stick in place of a priests wand and many arrows what are these for  shite thinking yes this priest is still in the first stage of faith aloud as you see there are many villages here zorii awohaka and akasaka but the tall grass of awonogakara grows round the roads between them and the forest is thick at koyasu and awohaka and many robbers come out under the rains they attack the baggage on horseback and take the clothing of maids and servants who pass here so i go out with this spear  priest thats very fine isnt it  chorus you will think it very strange for a priest to do this but even buddha has the sharp sword of mida and aijen miowo has arrows and tamon taking his long spear throws down the evil spirits  shite the deep love  chorus is excellent good feeling and keeping order are much more excellent than the love of bosatsu i think of these matters and know little of anything else it is from my own heart that i am lost wandering but if i begin talking i shall keep on talking until dawn go to bed good father i will sleep too he seemed to be going to his bedroom but suddenly his figure disappeared and the cottage became a field of grass the priest passes the night under the pine trees  priest i cannot sleep out the night perhaps if i held my service during the night under this pine tree  he begins his service for the dead man                                        part second  second shite there are winds in the east and south the clouds are not calm in the west and in the north the wind of the dark evening blusters and under the shade of the mountain  chorus there is a rustling of boughs and leaves  second shite perhaps there will be moonshine tonight but the clouds veil the sky the moon will not break up their shadow have at them ho there dash in that is the way i would shout calling and ordering my men before and behind my bowmen and horsemen i plundered men of their treasure that was my work in the world and now i must go on it is sorry work for a spirit  priest are you kumasaka chohan tell me the tale of your years  second shite now known as kumasaka there were great merchants in sanjo yoshitsugu and nobutaka they collected treasure each year they sent rich goods up to oku it was then i assailed their trains would you know what men were with me  priest tell me the chief men were they from many a province  kumasaka there was kakusho of kawachi there were the two brothers suriharitaro they have no rivals in fencing omotenchi face to face attack  priest what chiefs came to you from the city  kumasaka emoi of sanjo kozari of mibu  priest in the fighting with torches and

who were very strong and skilful  chorus while yoshitsugu was going along in the fields and on the mountains we set many spies to take him  kumasaka let us say that he is come to the village of ubasike this is the best place to attack him there are many ways to escape if we are defeated and he has invited many guests and has had a great feast at the inn  priest when the night was advanced the brothers yoshitsugu and nobutaka fell asleep  kumasaka but there was a small boy with keen eyes about sixteen or seventeen years old and he was looking through a little hole in the partition alert to the slightest noise  priest he did not sleep even a wink  kumasaka we did not know it was ushiwaka  priest it was fate  kumasaka the hour had come  priest be quick  kumasaka have at them  chorus describing the original combat now symbolized in the dance at this word they rushed in one after another they seized the torches it seemed as if gods could not face them ushiwaka stood unafraid he seized a small sword and fought like a lion in earnest like a tiger rushing like a bird swooping he fought so cleverly that he felled the thirteen who opposed him many were wounded besides they fled without swords or arrows then kumasaka said are you the devil is it a god who has struck down these men with such ease perhaps you are not a man however dead men take no plunder and id rather leave this truck of yoshitsugus than my corpse so he took his long spear and was about to make off  kumasaka but kumasaka thought  chorus taking it up what can he do that young chap if i ply my secret arts freely be he god or devil i will grasp him and grind him i will offer his body as sacrifice to those whom he has slain so he drew back and holding his long spear against his side he hid himself behind the door and stared at the young lad ushiwaka beheld him and holding his sword at his side he crouched at a little distance kumasaka waited likewise they both waited alertly then kumasaka stepped forth swiftly with his left foot and struck out with the long spear it would have run through an iron wall ushiwaka parried it lightly swept it away left volted kumasaka followed and again lunged out with the spear and ushiwaka parried the spearblade quite lightly then kumasaka turned the edge of his spearblade towards ushiwaka and slashed at him and ushiwaka leaped to the right kumasaka lifted his spear and the two weapons were twisted together ushiwaka drew back his blade kumasaka swung with his spear ushiwaka led up and stepped into shadow  kumasaka tried  to find him and ushiwaka slit through the backchink of his armour this seemed the end of his course and he was wroth to be slain by such a young boy  kumasaka slowly the wound  chorus seemed to pierce his heart failed weakness oercame him  kumasaka at the foot of this pine tree  chorus he vanished like a dew  and so saying he disappeared among the shades of the pine tree at akasaka and night fell     kagekiyo     kagekiyo a

name and that we are father and child yet i thought this would put dishonour upon you and therefore i let you pass do not hold it against me  chorus at first i was angry that my friends would no longer come near me but now i have come to a time when i could not believe that even a child of my own would seek me out singing   upon all the boats of the men of heikes faction   kagekiyo was the fighter most in call   brave were his men cunning sailors   and now even the leader   is worn out and dull as a horse  villager to kagekiyo many a fine thing is gone sir your daughter would like to ask you  kagekiyo what is it  villager she has heard of your old fame in uashima would you tell her the ballad  kagekiyo towards the end of the third month it was in the third year of juei we men of heike were in ships the men of genji were on land their war tents stretched on the shore we awaited decision and notonokami noritsune said last year in the hills of harima  in midzushima and in hiyodorigoye of bitchiu we were defeated time and again for yoshitsine is tactful and cunning is there any way we can beat them kagekiyo thought in his mind this hangan yoshitsine is neither god nor a devil at the risk of my life i might do it so he took leave of noritsune and led a party against the shore and all the men of genji rushed on them  chorus kagekiyo cried you are haughty his armour caught every turn of the sun he drove them four ways before them  kagekiyo excited and crying out samoshiya run cowards  chorus he thought how easy this killing he rushed with his spearhaft gripped under his arm he cried out i am kagekiyo of the heike he rushed on to take them he pierced through the helmet vizards of miyonoya miyonoya fled twice and again and kagekiyo cried you shall not escape me he leaped and wrenched off his helmet eya the vizard broke and remained in his hand and miyonoya still fled afar and afar and he looked back crying in terror how terrible how heavy your arm and kagekiyo called at him how tough the shaft of your neck is and they both laughed out over the battle and went off each his own way  chorus these were the deeds of old but oh to tell them to be telling them over now in his wretched condition his life in the world is weary he is near the end of his course go back he would say to his daughter pray for me when i am gone from the world for i shall then count upon you as we count on a lamp in the darkness  we who are blind i will stay she said then she obeyed him and only one voice is left  we tell this for the remembrance thus were the parent and child   end     notes  ernest fenollosa has left this memorandum on the stoicism of the last play i asked mr hirata how it could be considered natural or dutiful for the daughter to leave her father in such a condition he said that the japanese would not be in sympathy with such sternness now but that it was the old bushido spirit the personality of the old man is worn out no more good in this life it would be sentimentality for her to remain with him no good could be done he could well restrain his love for her better that she should pray for him and go on with the work of her normal life
