undertaken on slight provocation and were forced on by us in order that we might have an excuse for annexation our struggle with tippoo saib was on the other hand marked by a long endurance of wrong and a toleration of abominable cruelties perpetrated upon englishmen and our native allies hyder ali was a conqueror of the true eastern type he was ambitious in the extreme he dreamed of becoming the lord of the whole of southern india he was an able leader and though ruthless where it was his policy to strike terror he was not cruel from choice  his son tippoo on the contrary revelled in acts of the most abominable cruelty it would seem that he massacred for the very pleasure of massacring and hundreds of british captives were killed by famine poison or torture simply to gratify his lust for murder patience was shown towards this monster until patience became a fault and our inaction was naturally ascribed by him to fear had firmness been shown by lord cornwallis when seringapatam was practically in his power the second war would have been avoided and thousands of lives spared the blunder was a costly one to us for the work had to be done all over again and the fault of lord cornwallis retrieved by the energy and firmness of the marquis of wellesley  the story of the campaign is taken from various sources and the details of the treatment of the prisoners from the published narratives of two officers who effected their escape from prisons  g a henty    chapter 1 a lost father   there is no saying lad no saying at all all i know is that your father the captain was washed ashore at the same time as i was as you have heard me say i owed my life to him i was pretty nigh gone when i caught sight of him holding on to a spar spent as i was i managed to give a shout loud enough to catch his ear he looked round i waved my hand and shouted goodbye captain then i sank lower and lower and felt that it was all over when half in a dream i heard your fathers voice shout hold on ben i gave one more struggle and then i felt him catch me by the arm i dont remember what happened until i found myself lashed to the spar beside him  that is right ben he said cheerily as i held up my head you will do now i had a sharp tussle to get you here but it is all right we are setting inshore fast pull yourself together for we shall have a rough time of it in the surf anyhow we will stick together come what may  as the waves lifted us up i saw the coast with its groves of coconuts almost down to the waters edge and white sheets of surf running up high on the sandy beach it was not more than a hundred yards away and the captain sang out  hurrah there are some natives coming down they will give us a hand  next time we came up on a wave he said when we get close ben we must cut ourselves adrift from this spar or it will crush the life out of us but before we do that i will tie the two of us together  he cut a bit of rope from the raffle hanging from the spar and tied one end round my waist and the other round his own leaving about five fathoms loose between us  there he shouted in my ear if either of us gets chucked well up and the natives get a hold of him the other must come up too now mind ben keep broadside on to the wave if you can and let it roll you up as far as it will take you then when you feel that its force is spent stick your fingers and toes into the sand and hold on like grim death  well we drifted nearer and nearer until just as we got to the point where the great waves tumbled over the captain cut the lashings and swam a little away so as to be clear of the spar then a big wave came towering up i was carried along like a straw in a whirlpool then there was a crash that pretty nigh knocked the senses out of me i do not know what happened afterwards it was a confusion of white water rushing past and over me then for a moment i stopped and at once made a clutch at the ground that i had been rolling over there was a big strain and i was hauled backwards as if a team of wild horses were pulling at me then there was a jerk and i knew nothing more till i woke up and found myself on the sands out of reach of the surf  your father did not come to for half an hour he had been hurt a bit worse than i had but at last he came round  well we were kept three months in a sort of castle place and then one day a party of chaps with guns and swords came into the yard where we were sitting the man who seemed the head of the fellows who had been keeping us prisoners walked up with one who was evidently an officer over the chaps as had just arrived he looked at us both and then laid his hand on the captain then the others came up  the captain had just time to say we are going to be parted ben god bless you if ever you get back give my love to my wife and tell her what has happened to me and that she must keep up her heart for i shall make a bolt of it the first time i get a chance  the next day i was taken off to a place they call calicut there i stopped a year and then the rajah of the place joined the english against tippoo who was lord of all the country and i was released i had got by that time to talk their lingo pretty well though i have forgotten it all now and i had found out that the chaps who had taken your father away were a party sent down by tippoo who having heard that two englishmen had been cast on shore had insisted upon one of them being handed over to him  it is known that a great many of the prisoners in tippoos hands have been murdered in their dungeons he has sworn over and over again that he has no european prisoners but every one knows that he has numbers of them in his hands whether the captain is one of those who have been murdered or whether he is still in one of tippoos dungeons is more than i or any one else can say  well as i have told you ben that is what we mean to find out  i know that is what your mother has often said lad but it seems to me that you have more chance of finding the man in the moon than you have of learning whether your father is alive or not  well we are going to try anyhow ben i know its a difficult job but mother and i have talked it over ever since you came home with the news three years ago so i have made up my mind and nothing can change me you see i have more chances than most people would have being a boy is all in my favour and then you know i talk the language just as well as english  yes of course that is a pull and a big one but it is a desperate undertaking lad and i cant say as i see how it is to be done  i dont see either ben and i dont expect to see until we get out there but desperate or not mother and i are going to try  dick holland the speaker was a lad of some fifteen years of age his father who was captain of a fine east indiaman had sailed from london when he was nine and had never returned no news had been received of the ship after she touched at the cape and it was supposed that she had gone down with all hands until nearly three years later her boatswain ben birket had entered the east india companys office and reported that he himself and the captain had been cast ashore on the territories of the rajah of coorg the sole survivors as far as he knew of the hooghley  after an interview with the directors he had gone straight to the house at shadwell inhabited by mrs holland she had left there but had removed to a smaller one a short distance away where she lived upon the interest of the sum that her husband had invested from his savings and from a small pension granted to her by the company  mrs holland was a half caste the daughter of an english woman who had married a young rajah her mothers life had been a happy one but when her daughter had reached the age of sixteen she died obtaining on her deathbed the rajahs consent that the girl should be sent to england to be educated while her son who was three years younger should remain with his father  over him she had exercised but little influence he had been brought up like the sons of other native princes and save for his somewhat light complexion the english blood in his veins would never have been suspected  margaret on the other hand had been under her mothers care and as the latter had always hoped that the girl would at any rate for a time go to her family in england she had always conversed with her in that language and had until her decreasing strength rendered it no longer possible given her an english education  in complexion and appearance she took far more after her english mother than the boy had done and save for her soft dark eyes and glossy jetblack hair might have passed as of pure english blood when she sailed it was with the intention of returning to india in the course of a few years but this arrangement was overthrown by the fact that on the voyage john holland the handsome young first mate of the indiaman completely won her heart and they were married a fortnight after the vessel came up the thames  the matter would not have been so hurried had not a letter she posted on landing to her mothers sister who had promised her a home received an answer written in a strain which determined her to yield at once to john hollands pressing entreaties that they should be married without delay her aunt had replied that she had consented to overlook the conduct of her mother in uniting herself to a native and to receive her for a year at the rectory but that her behaviour in so precipitately engaging herself to a rough sailor rendered it impossible to countenance her as she stated that she had come over with a sum sufficient to pay her expenses while in england she advised her to ask the captainwho by the way must have grossly neglected his duties by allowing an intimacy between her and his mateto place her in some school where she would be well looked after until her return to india  the indian blood in margarets veins boiled fiercely and she wrote her aunt a letter which caused that lady to congratulate herself on the good fortune that had prevented her from having to receive under her roof a girl of so objectionable and violent a character  although the language that john holland used concerning this letter was strong indeed he was well satisfied as he had foreseen that it was not probable margarets friends would have allowed her to marry him without communicating with her father and that the rajah might have projects of his own for her disposal he laid the case before the captain who placed her in charge of his wife until the marriage took place  except for the long absences of her husband margarets life had been a very happy one and she was looking forward to the time when after another voyage he would be able to give up his profession and settle down upon his savings  when months passed by and no news came of the hooghley having reached port mrs holland at once gave up her house and moved into a smaller one for although her income would have been sufficient to enable her to remain where she was she determined to save every penny she was able for the sake of her boy she was possessed of strong common sense and firmness of character and when ben birket returned with his tale he was surprised at the composure with which she received it  i have always she said had a conviction that john was still alive and have not allowed dick to think of his father as dead and now i believe as firmly as before that someday john will be restored to me i myself can do nothing towards aiding him a woman can do little here she can do nothing in india save among her own people i shall wait patiently for a time it may be that this war will result in his release but in the meantime i shall continue to prepare dick to take up the search for him as soon as he is old enough  i hear once a year from my brother who is now rajah and he will be able to aid my boy in many ways however for a time i must be patient and wait i have learnt to wait during my husbands long absences and besides i think that the women of india are a patient race i trust that john will yet come home to me but if not when it is time we will try to rescue him  ben said nothing at the time to damp her courage but he shook his head as he left the cottage  poor creature he said i would not say anything to discourage her but for a woman and boy to try to get a captive out of the claws of the tiger of mysore is just madness  each time he returned from a voyage ben called upon mrs holland he himself had given up every vestige of hope when it was known that the name of her husband was not among the list of those whom tippoo had been forced to release margaret holland however still clung to hope her face was paler and there was a set pathetic expression in it so when she spoke of her husband as being still alive ben would sooner have cut out his tongue than allow the slightest word indicative of his own feeling of certainty as to the captains fate to escape him and he always made a pretence of entering warmly into her plans  the training as she considered it of her son went on steadily she always conversed with him in her fathers language and he was able to speak it as well as english she was ever impressing upon him that he must be strong and active when he was twelve she engaged an old soldier who had set up a sort of academy to instruct him in the use of the sword and in such exercises as were calculated to strengthen his muscles and to give him strength and agility  unlike most mothers she had no word of reproach when he returned home from school with a puffed face or cut lips the signs of battle  i do not want you to be quarrelsome she often said to him but i have heard your father say that a man who can use his fists well is sure to be cool and quick in any emergency you know what is before you and these qualities are of far more importance in your case than any book learning therefore dick i say never quarrel on your own account but whenever you see a boy bullying a smaller one take the opportunity of giving him a lesson while learning one yourself in the days of old you know the first duty of a true knight was to succour the oppressed and i want you to be a true knight you will get thrashed sometimes no doubt but dont mind that perhaps next time you will turn the tables  dick acted upon this advice and by the time he was fifteen had established a reputation among not only the boys of his own school but of the district in addition to his strength and quickness he had a fund of dogged endurance and imperturbable good temper that did not fail him even on the rare occasions when in combats with boys much older than himself he was forced to admit himself defeated  the fact that he fought not because he was angry but as if it were a matter of business gave him a great advantage and his readiness to take up the cause of any boy illtreated by another was so notorious that i will tell dick holland became a threat that saved many a boy from being burned  ten days before his conversation with ben his mother had said  dick i can stand this no longer i have tried to be patient for six years but i can be patient no longer i feel that another year of suspense would kill me therefore i have made up my mind to sail at once the voyage will take us five months and perhaps you may have to remain some little time at my brothers before you can start  now that the time is come i think that perhaps i am about to do wrong and that it may cost you your life but i cannot help it dick i dream of your father almost every night and i wake up thinking that i hear him calling upon me to help him i feel that i should go mad if this were to last much longer  i am ready mother the boy said earnestly i have been hoping for some time that you would say you would start soon and though i have not of course the strength of a man i think that will be more than made up by the advantage i should have as a boy in looking for my father and at any rate from what you tell me i should think that i am quite as strong as an average native of your country  anyhow mother i am sure that it will be best for us to go now it must have been awful for you waiting all this time and though you have never said anything about it i have noticed for a long time that you were looking ill and was sure that you were worrying terribly what would be the use of staying any longer i should not be very much stronger in another year than i am now and a year would seem an age to father  and so it was settled and mrs holland at once began to make preparations for their departure she had already without saying anything to dick given notice that she should give up the house she had during the six years saved a sum of money amply sufficient for the expenses of the journey and outfit and she had now only to order clothes for herself and dick and to part with her furniture  ben on his return had heard with grave apprehension that she was about to carry out her intention but as he saw that any remonstrance on his part would be worse than useless he abstained from offering any and warmly entered into her plans after an hours talk he had proposed to dick to go out for a stroll with him  i am glad to have a talk with you ben dick said of course i have heard from mother what you told her when you came home but i shall be glad to hear it from you so as to know exactly how it all was you know she feels sure that father is still alive i should like to know what your opinion really is about it of course it will make no difference as i should never say anything to her but i should like to know whether you think there is any possibility of his being alive  to this ben had replied as already related he was silent when dick asserted that desperate or not he intended to carry out his mothers plan  i would not say as i think it altogether desperate as far as you are concerned he said thoughtfully it dont seem to me as there is much chance of your ever getting news of your father lad and as to getting him out of prison if you do come to hear of him why honest i would not give a quid of baccy for your chance but i dont say as i think that it is an altogether desperate job as far as you are concerned yourself talking their lingo as you do its just possible as you might be able to travel about in disguise without anyone finding you out especially as the rajah your uncle ought to be able to help you a bit and put you in the way of things and perhaps send some trusty chap along with you there is no doubt you are strong for your age and being thin and nothing but muscle you would pass better as a native than if you had been thick and chunky my old woman tells me as you have a regular name as a fighter and that you have given a lesson to many a bully in the neighbourhood altogether there is a lot in your favour and i dont see why you should not pull through all right at any rate even should the worst come to the worst and you do get news somehow that your poor father has gone down i am sure it will be better for your mother than going on as she has done for the last six years just wearing herself out with anxiety  i am sure it will ben i can tell you that it is as much as i can do sometimes not to burst out crying when i see her sitting by the hour with her eyes open but not seeing anything or moving as much as a fingerjust thinking and thinking and thinking  i wish we were going out in your ship ben  i wish you was lad but it will be five or six weeks before we are off again anyhow the ship you are going inthe madrasis a fine craft and the captain bears as high a character as anyone in the companys fleet  well lad i hope that it will all turn out well if i could have talked the lingo like a native i would have been glad to have gone with you and taken my chances the captain saved my life in that wreck and it would only have been right that i should risk mine for him if there was but a shadow of chance of its being of use but i know that in a job of this sort i could be of no good whatsomever and should be getting you into trouble before we had gone a mile together  i am sure that you would help if you could ben but of course you could be of no use  and when do you think of being home again lad  there is no saying benit may be years but however long it takes i shant give it up until i find out for certain what has become of my father  and aint there a chance of hearing how you are getting on dick i shall think of you and your mother often and often when i am on deck keeping my watch at night and it will seem hard that i maynt be able to hear for years as to what you are doing  the only thing that i can do ben will be to write if i get a chance of sending a messenger or for my mother to write to you to the office  that is it you send a letter to ben birket boatswain of the madeira care of east india company leadenhall street and i shall get it sooner or later of course i shall not expect a long yarn but just two or three words to tell me how you are getting on and whether you have got any news of your father and if you come back to england leave your address at the companys office for me for it aint an easy matter to find anyone out in london unless you have got their bearings right  ten days later mrs holland and dick embarked on the madras dick had been warned by his mother to say nothing to anyone on board as to the object of their voyage  i shall mention she said that i am going out to make some inquiries respecting the truth of a report that has reached me that some of those on board the hooghley of which my husband was captain survived the wreck and were taken up the country that will be quite sufficient say nothing about my having been born in india or that my father was a native rajah some of these officialsand still more their wivesare very prejudiced and consider themselves to be quite different beings to the natives of the country i found it so on my voyage to england  at any rate we dont want our affairs talked about it will be quite sufficient for people to know that we are as i said going out to make some inquiries about the truth of this rumour  all right mother at any rate the captain has told you that he will look after you and make things comfortable for you so we need not care about anything else  we certainly need not care dick but it is much more agreeable to get on nicely with everyone i was very pleased when captain barstow called yesterday and said that having heard at the office that the mrs holland on the passenger list was the widow of his old shipmate john holland he had come round to see if there was anything that he could do for her and he promised to do all in his power to make us comfortable of course i told him that i did not regard myself as captain hollands widowthat all we knew was that he had got safely ashore and had been taken up to mysore and as i had a strong conviction he was still alive i was going out to endeavour to ascertain from native sources whether he was still living  well maam i hope that you will succeed he said all this is new to me i thought he was drowned when the hooghley went ashore anyhow mrs holland i honour you for making this journey just on the off chance of hearing something of your husband and you may be sure i will do all i can to make the voyage a pleasant one for you  so you see we shall start favourably dick for the captain can do a great deal towards adding to the comfort of a passenger when it is known by the purser and steward that a lady is under the special care of the captain it ensures her a larger share of civility and special attentions than she might otherwise obtain  as soon as they went on board indeed the captain came up to them  good morning mrs holland he said you have done quite right to come on board early it gives you a chance of being attended to before the stewards are being called for by twenty people at once  he beckoned to a midshipman  mr hart please tell the purser i wish to speak to him  so this is your son mrs holland a fine straightlooking young fellow are you going to put him in the service you have a strong claim you know which i am sure the board would acknowledge  do you know captain it is a matter that i have hardly thought ofin fact i have for years been so determined to go out and try and obtain some news of my husband as soon as dick was old enough to journey about as my protector that i have not thought as i ought to have done what profession he should follow however he is only fifteen yet and there will be time enough when he gets back  if he is to go into the service the sooner the better maamone can hardly begin too young however i dont say there are not plenty of good sailors afloat who did not enter until a couple of years older than he isthere is no strict rule as to age  only fifteen is he i should have taken him for at least a year older however if you like mrs holland i will put him in the way of learning a good deal during the voyage he might as well be doing that as loafing about the deck all day  much better captain i am very much obliged to you and i am sure that he will be too  i should like it immensely captain dick exclaimed  at this moment the purser came up  mr stevenson the captain said this is mrs holland she is the wife of my old friend john hollandwe were midshipmen together on board the ganges he commanded the hooghley which was lost you know five or six years ago somewhere near calicut there were two or three survivors and he was one of them and it seems that he was taken up the country so mrs holland is going out to endeavour to ascertain whether he may not be still alive though perhaps detained by one of those native princes  please do everything you can to make her comfortable and tell the head steward that it is my particular wish she shall be well attended to who is she berthed with  the purser took the passenger list from his pocket  she is with mrs colonel williamson and the wife of commissioner larkins  the captain gave a grunt of dissatisfaction the purser went on  there is a small cabin vacant captain two ladies who were to have ita mother and daughterhave i hear this morning been unexpectedly detained owing to the sudden illness of one of them their heavy baggage is all in the hold and must go on and they will follow in the next ship shall i put mrs holland in there  certainly this is most fortunate  i dont think that you would have been comfortable with the other two mrs holland i dont know the colonels wife but mrs larkins has travelled with us before and i had quite enough of her on that voyage  thank you very much captain it will indeed be a comfort to have a cabin to myself  dick found that he was berthed with two young cadets whose names he learned from the cards fastened over the bunks were latham and fellows  half an hour after the arrival of the hollands on board the passengers began to pour in rapidly and the deck of the madras was soon crowded with them their friends and their luggage below all was bustle and confusion men shouted angrily to stewards women laden with parcels blocked the gangway and appealed helplessly to every one for information and aid sailors carried down trunks and portmanteaus and mrs holland when she emerged from her cabin having stowed away her belongings and made things tidy congratulated herself on having been the first on board and so had not only avoided all this confusion but obtained a separate cabin which she might not otherwise have been able to do as the captain would have been too busy to devote any special attention to her  after having handed her over to the care of the purser captain barstow had spoken to the second officer who happened to be passing  mr rawlinson he said this is the son of my old friend captain holland he is going out with his mother i wish you would keep your eye upon him and let him join the midshipmen in their studies with you in the morning possibly he may enter the service and it will be a great advantage to him to have got up navigation a bit before he does so at any rate it will occupy his mind and keep him out of mischief a lad of his age would be like a fish out of water among the passengers on the quarterdeck  ay ay sir i will do what i can for him  and he hurried away  dick saw that for the present there was nothing to be done but to look on and it was not until the next morning when the madras was making her way south outside the goodwins that the second officer spoke to him  ah there you are lad i have been too busy to think of you and it will be another day or two before we settle down to regular work however i will introduce you to one or two of the midshipmen and they will make you free of the ship  dick was indeed already beginning to feel at home the long table full from end to end had presented such a contrast to his quiet dinner with his mother that as he sat down beside her and looked round he thought he should never get to speak to anyone throughout the voyage however he had scarcely settled himself when a gentleman in a naval uniform next to him made the remark  well youngster what do you think of all this i suppose it is all new to you  it is sir it seems very strange at first but i suppose i shall get accustomed to it  oh yes you will find it pleasant enough by and bye i am the ships doctor the purser has been telling me about you and your mother  i made one voyage with your father it was my first and a kinder captain i never sailed with i heard from the purser that there seems to be a chance of his being still alive and that your mother is going out to try and find out something about him i hope most sincerely that she may succeed in doing so but he has been missing a long time now still that is no reason why she should not find him there have been instances where men have been kept for years by some of these rascally nativeswhy goodness only knows except i suppose because they fear and hate us and think that some time or other an english prisoner may be useful to them  your mother looks far from strong he went on as he glanced across dick to mrs holland who was talking to a lady on the other side of her has she been ill  no sir i have never known her ill yet she has been worrying herself a great deal she has waited so long because she did not like to go out until she could take me with her she has no friends in england with whom she could leave me she looks a good deal better now than she did a month ago i think directly she settled to come out and had something to do she became better  that is quite natural the doctor said there is nothing so trying as inactivity i have no doubt that the sea air will quite set her up again it performs almost miracles on the homewardbound passengers they come on board looking pale and listless and washed out at the end of a month at sea they are different creatures altogether  the purser had taken pains to seat mrs holland at table next to a person who would be a pleasant companion for her and the lady she was now talking to was the wife of a chaplain in the army she had a year before returned from india in the madras and he knew her to be a kind and pleasant woman  dick did not care for his cabin mates they were young fellows of about eighteen years of age one was a nephew of a director of the company the other the son of a high indian official they paid but little attention to him generally ignoring him altogether and conversing about things and people in india in the tone of men to whom such matters were quite familiar  in three or four days dick became on good terms with the six midshipmen the madras carried two of them were younger than himself two somewhat older while the others were nearly out of their time and hoped that this would be their last trip in the midshipmens berth the four younger lads studied two hours every morning under the second officers instruction and dick took his place at the table regularly with them  mathematics had been the only subject in which he had at all distinguished himself at school and he found himself able to give satisfaction to mr rawlinson in his studies of navigation after this work was over they had an hours practical instruction by the boatswains mate in knotting and splicing ropes and in other similar matters  in a fortnight he had learned the names and uses of what had at first seemed to him the innumerable ropes and long before that had accompanied one of the midshipmen aloft on the first occasion that he did so two of the topmen followed him with the intention of carrying out the usual custom of lashing him to the ratlines until he paid his footing seeing them coming up the midshipman laughed and told dick what was in store for him  the boy had been as awkward as most beginners in climbing the shrouds the looseness and give of the ratlines puzzling him but he had for years practised climbing ropes in the gymnasium at shadwell and was confident in his power to do anything in that way the consequence was that as soon as the sailors gained the top where he and the midshipman were standing dick seized one of the halliards and with a merry laugh came down hand over hand a minute later he stood on the deck  well done youngster said the boatswains mate who happened to be standing by as dicks feet touched the deck this may be the first time you have been on board a ship but it is easy to see that it isnt the first by a long way that you have been on a rope could you go up again  yes i should think so dick said i have never climbed so high as that because i have never had the chance but it ought to be easy enough  the man laughed  there are not many sailors who can do it he said well let us see how high you will get  as dick was accustomed to go up a rope thirty feet high hand over hand without using his legs he was confident that with their assistance he could get up to the main top lofty as it was and he at once threw off his jacket and started he found the task harder than he had anticipated but he did it without a pause he was glad however when the two sailors above grasped him by the arms and placed him beside them on the main top  well sir one said admiringly we thought you was a johnny newcome by the way you went up the ratlines but you came up that rope like a monkey  well sir you are free up here and if you werent it would not make much odds to you for it would take half the ships company to capture you  i dont want to get off paying my footing dick said pulling five shillings from his pocket and handing them to the sailors for his mother had told him that it was the custom on first going aloft to make a present to them and had given him the money for the purpose i can climb but i dont know anything about ropes and i shall be very much obliged if you will teach me all you can    chapter 2 a brush with privateers   dick was surprised when on descending to the deck he found that what seemed to him a by no means very difficult feat had attracted general attention not only did half a dozen of the sailors pat him on the back with exclamations expressive of their surprise and admiration but the other midshipmen spoke quite as warmly the eldest saying  i could have got up the rope holland but i could not have gone up straight as you did without stopping for a bit to take breath you dont look so very strong either  i think that it is knack more than strength dick replied i have done a lot of practice at climbing for i have always wanted to get strong and i heard that there was no better exercise  when presently dick went aft to the quarterdeck captain barstow said to him  you have astonished us all lad i could hardly believe my eyes when i saw you going up that rope i first caught sight of you when you had climbed but twenty feet and wondered how far you would get at that pace i would have wagered a hundred guineas to one that you would not have kept it up to the top  well lad whatever profession you take to it is certain that you will be a good sailor spoilt  they had now been three weeks out but had made slow progress for the winds had been light and mostly from the southwest  this is very dull work the doctor said to dick one day at dinner here we are three weeks out and still hardly beyond the channel there is one consolation it is not the fault of the ship she has been doing well under the circumstances but the fates have been against her thus far i have no doubt there are a score of ships still lying in the downs that were there when we passed and tedious as it has been beating down the channel with scarce wind enough most of the time to keep our sails full it would have been worse lying there all the time  still we have gained a good bit on them sir  if the wind were to change round say to the northeast and they brought it along with them they would soon make up for lost time for it would not take them three days to run here however we shall begin to do better soon i heard the captain say that he should change his course tomorrow we are somewhere off cork and when he makes a few miles more westing he will bear away south if we had had a favourable wind we should have taken our departure from the start but with it in this quarter we are obliged to make more westing before we lay her head on her course or we should risk getting in too close to the french coast and their privateers are as thick as peas there  but we should not be afraid of a french privateer doctor  well not altogether afraid of one but they very often go in couples and sometimes three of them will work together i dont think one privateer alone would venture to attack us though she might harass us a bit and keep up a distant fire in hopes that another might hear it and bear down to her aid but it is always as well to keep free of them if one can you see an unlucky shot might knock one of our sticks out of us which would mean delay and trouble if no worse  we had a sharp brush with two of them on the last voyage but we beat them off we were stronger then than we are now for we had two hundred troops on board and should have astonished them if they had come close enough to try boardingin fact we were slackening our fire to tempt them to do so when they made out that a large craft coming up astern was an english frigate and sheered off  i dont know what the end of it was but i rather fancy they were taken the frigate followed them gaining fast and later on we could hear guns in the distance  you did not join in the chase then doctor  oh no our business is not fighting if we are attacked of course we defend ourselves but we dont go a foot out of our way if we can help it  three weeks at sea had done wonders for mrs holland now that she was fairly embarked upon her quest the expression of anxiety gradually died out the sea air braced up her nerves and what was of still greater benefit to her she was able to sleep soundly and dreamlessly a thing she had not done for years dick was delighted at the change in her  you look quite a different woman mother he said i dont think your friends at shadwell would know you if they were to see you now  i feel a different woman dick i have not felt so well and so bright since your father sailed on his last voyage i am more convinced than ever that we shall succeed i have been trying very hard for years to be hopeful but now i feel so without trying of course it is partly this lovely weather and the sea air and sleeping so well and partly because everyone is so kind and pleasant  as soon as the madras had been headed for the south she began to make better way the wind freshened somewhat but continued in the same quarter grumbling ceased over the bad luck they were having and hopeful anticipations that after all they would make a quick passage were freely indulged in  on the fourth day after changing her course she was off the coast of spain which was but a hundred and fifty miles distant at noon that day the wind dropped suddenly and an hour later it was a dead calm  we are going to have a change dick the doctor said as he stopped by the lad who was leaning against the bulwark watching a flock of seabirds that were following a shoal of fish dashing down among them with loud cries and too intent upon their work to notice the ship lying motionless a hundred yards away  what sort of a change doctor  most likely a strong blow though from what quarter it is too soon to say however we have no reason to grumble after nearly a month of light winds we must expect a turn of bad weather i hope it will come from the north that will take us down to the latitude of madeira and beyond that we may calculate upon another spell of fine weather until we cross the line  as the afternoon wore on the weather became more dull there were no clouds in the sky but the deep blue was dimmed by a sort of haze presently after a talk between the captain and the first officer the latter gave the order all hands take in sail  the order had been expected and the men at once swarmed up the rigging in a quarter of an hour all the upper sails were furled the light spars were then sent down to the deck  you may as well get the topgallant sails off her too mr green the captain said to the first officer it is as well to be prepared for the worst it is sure to blow pretty hard when the change comes  the topgallant sails were got in and when the courses had been brailed up and secured the hands were called down presently the captain after going to his cabin rejoined mr green  the glass has gone up again dick heard him say  that looks as if it were coming from the north sir  yes with some east in it it could not come from a better quarter  he turned and gazed steadily in that direction  yes there is dark water over there  so there is sir that is all right i dont mind how hard it blows so that it does but come on gradually  i agree with you these hurricane bursts when one is becalmed are always dangerous even when one is under bare poles  gradually the dark line on the horizon crept up towards the ship as it reached her the sails bellied out and she began to move through the water the wind increased in strength rapidly and in half an hour she was running south at ten or eleven knots an hour the thermometer had fallen many degrees and as the sun set the passengers were glad to go below for shelter  before going to bed dick went up on deck for a few minutes the topsails had been reefed down but the madras was rushing through the water at a high rate of speed the sea was getting up and the waves were crested with foam above the stars were shining brilliantly  well lad this is a change is it not the captain said as he came along in a pea jacket  we seem to be going splendidly captain  yes we are walking along grandly and making up for lost time  it is blowing hard sir  it will blow a good deal harder before morning lad but i do not think it will be anything very severe things wont be so comfortable downstairs for the next day or two but that is likely to be the worst of it  the motion of the ship kept dick awake for some time but wedging himself tightly in his berth he presently fell off to sleep and did not wake again until morning his two cabin mates were suffering terribly from seasickness but he felt perfectly well although it took him a long time to dress so great was the motion of the ship  on making his way on deck he found that overhead the sky was blue and bright and the sun shining brilliantly the wind was blowing much harder than on the previous evening and a heavy sea was running but as the sun sparkled on the white crests of the waves the scene was far less awe inspiring than it had been when he looked out before retiring to his berth the ship under closelyreefed main and foretop sails was tearing through the water at a high rate of speed throwing clouds of spray from her bows and occasionally taking a wave over them that sent a deluge of water along the deck  what do you think of this lad mr rawlinson who was in charge of the watch asked him as after watching his opportunity he made a rush to the side and caught a firm hold of a shroud  it is splendid sir he said has she been going like this all night  the officer nodded  how long do you think it will last sir  two or three days  will it be any worse sir  not likely to be it is taking us along rarely and it is doing us good in more ways than one  look there and as they rose on a wave he pointed across the water behind dick  the lad turned and saw a brig running parallel to their course half a mile distant  what of her sir  that is a french privateer unless i am greatly mistaken  but she has the british ensign flying sir  ay but that goes for nothing she may possibly be a trader on her way down to the guinea coast but by the cut of her sails and the look of her hull i have no doubt that she is a frenchman  we are passing her sir  oh yes in a gale and a heavy sea weight tells and we shall soon leave her astern but in fine weather i expect she could sail round and round us if the french could fight their ships as well as they can build them we should not be in it with them  why dont we fire at her mr rawlinson  the officer laughed  how are you going to work your guns with the ship rolling like this no lad we are like two muzzled dogs at presentwe can do nothing but watch each other i am sorry to say that i dont think the fellow is alone two or three times i have fancied that i caught a glimpse of a sail on our starboard quarter i could not swear to it but i dont think i was mistaken and i called the captains attention that way just before he went down ten minutes ago and he thought he saw it too however as there was nothing to be done he went down for a caulk he had not left the deck since noon yesterday  but if she is no bigger than the other i suppose we shall leave her behind too mr rawlinson  ay lad we shall leave them both behind presently but if they are what i think we are likely to hear more of them later on they would not be so far offshore as this unless they were on the lookout for indiamen which of course keep much farther out than ships bound up the mediterranean and having once spotted us they will follow us like hounds on a deers trail however i think they are likely to find that they have caught a tartar when they come up to us  ah here is the doctor  well doctor what is the report below  only the usual number of casualtiesa sprained wrist a few contusions and three or four cases of hysterics  is mother all right doctor dick asked  as i have heard nothing of her i have no doubt she is i am quite sure that she will not trouble me with hysterics women who have had real trouble to bear dick can be trusted to keep their nerves steady in a gale  i suppose you call this a gale doctor  certainly it is a stiff northeasterly gale and if we were facing it instead of running before it you would not want to ask the question  that is a suspiciouslooking craft rawlinson he broke off catching sight of the brig now on their port quarter  yes she is a privateer i have no doubt and unless i am mistaken she has a consort somewhere out there to starboard however we need not trouble about them travelling as we are we are going two knots an hour faster than the brig  so much the better the doctor said shortly we can laugh at one of these fellows but when it comes to two of them i own that i dont care for their company so the longer this gale holds on the better  the mate nodded  well dick the doctor went on do you feel as if you will be able to eat your breakfast  i shall be ready enough for it doctor but i dont see how it will be possible to eat it with the vessel rolling like this  you certainly will not be able to sit down to itnothing would stay on the table a minute there will be no regular breakfast today you must get the steward to cut you a chunk of cold meat put it between two slices of bread and make a sandwich of it as to tea ask him to give you a bottle and to pour your tea into that then if you wedge yourself into a corner you will find that you are able to manage your breakfast comfortably and can amuse yourself watching people trying to balance a cup of tea in their hand  not more than half a dozen passengers ventured on deck for the next two days but at the end of that time the force of the wind gradually abated and on the following morning the madras had all her sails set to a light but still favourable breeze madeira had been passed to dicks disappointment but except for a fresh supply of vegetables there was no occasion to put in there and the captain grudged the loss of a day while so favourable a wind was taking them along  do you think we shall see anything of that brig again doctor dick asked as for the first time since the wind sprang up the passengers sat down to a comfortable breakfast  there is no saying dick if we gained two knots an hour during the blow and i dont suppose we gained more than one and a half they must be a hundred and twenty miles or so astern of us after all that is only half a days run i think they are pretty sure to follow us for a bit for they will know that in light winds they travel faster than we do and if we get becalmed while they still hold the breeze they will come up hand over hand it is likely enough that in another three days or so we may get a sight of them behind us  this was evidently the captains opinion also for during the day the guns were overhauled and their carriages examined and the muskets brought up on deck and cleaned on the following day the men were practised at the guns and then had pike and cutlass exercise  none of the passengers particularly noticed these proceedings for dick had been warned by the captain to say nothing about the brig and as he was the only passenger on deck at the time no whisper of the privateers had come to the ears of the others  the party were just going down to lunch on the third day when a lookout in the maintop hailed the deck  a sail astern  how does she bear  she is dead astern of us sir and i can only make out her upper sails i should say that they are her royals  mr green ran up with his telescope slung over his shoulder  i cannot make much out of her sir he shouted to the captain she may be anything she must be nearly thirty miles astern i think with pearson that it is her royals we see  take a look round mr green  the mate did so and presently called down  i can make out something else away on the starboard quarter but so far astern that i can scarce swear to her still it can be nothing but a sail  thank you mr green i daresay that we shall know more about her later on  when the captain joined the passengers at table one of the ladies said  you seem interested in that ship astern of us captain  yes mrs seaforth one is always interested in a ship when one gets down as far as this she may be another indiaman and although the madras has no claim to any great speed in a light breeze like this one never likes being passed  the explanation was considered as sufficient and nothing more was said on the subject by sunset the upper sails of the stranger could be made out from the deck of the madras mr green again went up and had a look at her  she is coming up fast he said when he rejoined the captain she keeps so dead in our wake that i cant make out whether she is a brig or a three master but i fancy that she is a brig by the size and cut of her sails i can see the other craft plainly enough now she is eight or ten miles west of the other and has closed in towards her since i made her out before i have no doubt that she is a large schooner  well it is a comfort that they are not a few miles nearer mr green there is no chance of their overtaking us before morning so we shall be able to keep our watches as usual and shall have time to get ready for a fight if there is to be one  the sooner the better sir so that it is daylight it is quite certain that they have the legs of us  in the morning when dick came up he found that the wind had quite died away and the sails hung loosely from the yards looking astern he saw two vessels they were some six miles away and perhaps two miles apart as they lay without steerage way they had swung partly round and he saw that they were a brig and a schooner the former he had no doubt from her lofty masts and general appearance was the same the madras had passed six days before as the passengers came up they were full of curiosity as to the vessels  of course we know no more actually than you do yourselves the captain said as some of them gathered round and questioned him but i may as well tell you frankly that we have very little doubt about their being two french privateers we passed them during the gale and had some hopes that we should not see them again but in the light breeze we have been having during the last few days they have made up lost ground and i am afraid we shall have to fight them  exclamations of alarm broke from some of the ladies who heard his words  you need not be alarmed ladies he went on we carry twelve guns you know and i expect that all of them are of heavier metal than theirs the madras is a stronglybuilt ship and will stand a good deal more hammering than those light craft will so that i have no doubt we shall give a good account of ourselves  after breakfast the hatches were opened and the gun cases belonging to the passengers brought on deck scarce one of them but had a rifle and many had in addition a shotgun the day passed without any change in the positions of the vessels for they still lay becalmed  why dont they get out their boats and tow their vessels up dick asked the doctor  because they would be throwing away their chances if they did so they know that we cannot get away from them and we might smash up their boats as soon as they came within range besides their speed and superior handiness give them a pull over us when fighting under sail they may try to tow up during the night if they think they are strong enough to take us by boarding but i hardly think they will do so  the night however passed off quietly but in the morning a light breeze sprang up from the east the sails were trimmed and the madras again began to move through the water by breakfast time the craft behind had visibly decreased their distance  the meal was a silent one when it was over the captain said  as soon as those fellows open fire ladies i must ask you all to go down into the hold the sailors have already cleared a space below the waterline large enough for you and they will take down some cushions and so on to make you as comfortable as possible under the circumstances pray do not be alarmed at any noises you may hear you will be below the waterline and perfectly safe from their shot and you may be sure that we shall do our best to keep the scoundrels from boarding us and i will let you know from time to time how matters are going  the unmarried men at once went up on deck the others lingered for a short time behind talking to their wives and daughters and then followed  the wind has strengthened a bit mr green the captain said and i fancy we shall get more  i think so too captain  then you may as well get off the upper sails and make her snug get off everything above the top gallant then if the wind increases we shall not want to call the men away from the guns  the crew had without orders already mustered at quarters the lashings had been cast off the guns the boatswain had opened the magazines and a pile of shot stood by each gun together with cases of canister and grapeshot for close work boarding pikes and cutlasses were ranged along by the bulwarks the men had thrown aside their jackets and many of those at the guns were stripped to the waist some of them were laughing and talking and dick saw by their air of confidence that they had no doubt of their ability to beat off the assault of the privateers  the latter were the first to open the ball a puff of smoke burst out from the brigs bows followed almost instantly by one from the schooner both shots fell short and for a quarter of an hour the three vessels kept on their way  we have heavier metal than that the captain said cheerfully and i have no doubt we could reach them but it is not our game to play at long bowls for it is probable that both of them carry a long pivot gun and if they were to draw off a bit they could annoy us amazingly while we could not reach them  presently the privateers opened fire again they were now about a mile away and the same distance from each other their shot fell close to the indiaman and two or three passed through her sails  still no reply was made the men at the guns fidgeted and kept casting glances towards the poop in expectation of an order it came at last but was not what they had expected  double shot your guns men the captain said  scarcely was the order obeyed when the brig which was now on the port quarter luffed up a little into the wind and fired a broadside of eight guns there was a crashing of wood the madras was hulled in three places two more holes appeared in her sails while the other shot passed harmlessly just astern of her  there was an angry growl among the sailors as the schooner bore away a little and also fired her broadside except that a man was struck down by a splinter from the bulwarks no damage was done  bear up a little the captain said to the second officer who was standing by the helmsman i want to edge in a little towards the brig but not enough for them to notice it  now gentlemen he went on to the passengers i have no doubt that most of you are good shots and i want you after we have fired our broadside to direct your attention to the brigs helmsmen if you can render it impossible for the men to stand at the wheel we will make mincemeat of this fellow in no time directly i have fired our port broadside i am going to bring her up into the wind on the opposite tack and give him the starboard broadside at close quarters dont fire until we have gone about and then pick off the helmsmen if you can  get ready men  the brig was now but a little more than a quarter of a mile distant  aim at the foot of his mainmast he went on let each man fire as he gets the mast on his sight  a moment later the first gun fired and the whole broadside followed in quick succession  down with the helm hard down sheets and tacks  the men whose duty it was to trim the sails ran to the sheets and braces the madras swept up into the wind and as her sails drew on the other tack she came along on a course that would take her within a hundred yards of the brig  as she approached three rifles cracked out on her poop one of the men at the helm of the brig fell and as he did so half a dozen more shots were fired and as his companion dropped beside him the brig deprived of her helm flew up into the wind  three men ran aft to the wheel but the deadly rifles spoke out again two of them fell the third dived under the bulwark for shelter  steady men the captain shouted fetch her mainmast out of her  as they swept along under the stern of the brig each gun of their other broadside poured in its fire in succession raking the crowded deck from end to end a moment later the mainmast was seen to sway and a tremendous cheer broke from the madras as it went over the side dragging with it the foretopmast with all its gear  down with the helm again the captain shouted bring her head to wind and keep her there  the first officer sprang forward to see that the order was carried into effect and a minute later the indiaman lay with her sails aback at a distance of a hundred yards on the quarter of the brig  grape and canister the captain shouted and broadside after broadside swept the decks of the brig which hampered by her wreckage was lying almost motionless in the water so terrible was the fire that the privateers men threw down the axes with which they were striving to cut away the floating spars and ran below  double shot your guns and give her one broadside between wind and water the captain ordered  haul on the sheets and braces mr green and get her on her course againthe schooner wont trouble us now  that craft had indeed at first luffed up to come to the assistance of her consort but on seeing the fall of the latters mast and that she was incapable of rendering any assistance had again altered her course feeling her incapacity to engage so redoubtable an opponent single handed three hearty cheers broke from all on board the madras as after pouring in a broadside at a distance of fifty yards she left the brig behind her and proceeded on her way  then you dont care about taking prizes captain one of the passengers said as they crowded round to congratulate him upon his easy and almost bloodless victory  no taking prizes is not my business and were i to weaken my crew by sending some of them off in a prize i might find myself shorthanded if we met another of these gentlemen or fell in with bad weather besides she would not be worth sending home  the brig is signalling to her consort sir mr green said coming up  ay ay i expect she wants help badly enough i saw the chips fly close to her waterline as we gave her that last broadside  they are lowering a boat one of the passengers said  so they are i expect they havent got more than one that can swim  i think she is settling down the captain said as he looked earnestly at the wreck astern see how they are crowding into that boat and how some of the others are cutting and slashing to get the wreckage clear of her  she is certainly a good bit lower in the water than she was the first officer agreed the schooner has come round and wont be long before she is alongside of her  there was no doubt that the brig was settling down fast men stood on the bulwarks and waved their caps frantically to the schooner others could be seen by the aid of a glass casting spars hen coops and other articles overboard and jumping into the water after them and soon the sea around the wreck was dotted with heads and floating fragments while the wreckage of the mainmast was clustered with men  when the madras was a mile away the schooner was lying thrown up head to wind fifty yards from the brig and her boats were already engaged in picking up the swimmers suddenly the brig gave a heavy lurch  there she goes the captain exclaimed  a moment later the hull had disappeared and the schooner remained alone  by this time the whole of the ladies had ascended from their place of safety to the poop and a general exclamation broke from the passengers as the brig disappeared  the schooner will pick them all up the captain said they must have suffered heavily from our fire but i dont think any will have gone down with her the boat which has already reached the schooner must have taken a good many and the mainmast and foretopmast and spars would support the rest to say nothing of the things they have thrown overboard there is one wasp the less afloat  no further adventure was met with throughout the voyage they had a spell of bad weather off the cape but the captain said it was nothing to the gales they often encountered there and that the voyage as a whole was an exceptionally good one for even after the delays they had encountered at the start the passage had lasted but four months and a half  they touched at point de galle for news and to ascertain whether any french warships had been seen of late along the coast a supply of fresh vegetables and fruit was taken on board as the vessel after touching at madras was to go on to calcutta a few of the passengers landed at point de galle but neither dick nor his mother went ashore  you will have plenty of opportunities of seeing indians later on dick mrs holland had said and as the gigs will not take all ashore we may as well stop quietly here i heard the captain say that he would weigh anchor again in four hours  dick was rather disappointed but as they would be at madras before long he did not much mind  ten days later they anchored off that town little was to be seen except the fort a number of warehouses and the native town while the scenery contrasted strongly with that of ceylon with its masses of green foliage with hills rising behind  for the last fortnight mrs holland had been somewhat depressed now that the voyage was nearly over the difficulties of the task before her seemed greater than they had done when viewed from a distance and she asked herself whether after all it would not have been wiser to have waited another two or three years until dick had attained greater strength and manhood the boy however when she confided her doubts to him laughed at the idea  why you know mother he said we agreed that i had a much greater chance as a boy of going about unsuspected than i should have as a man besides we could never have let father remain any longer without trying to get him out  no no mother you know we have gone through it over and over again and talked about every chance we have had a firstrate voyage and everything is going on just as we could have wished and it would never do to begin to have doubts now we have both felt confident all along it seems to me that of all things we must keep on being confident at any rate until there is something to give us cause to doubt  on the following morning they landed in a surf boat and were fortunate in getting ashore without being drenched there was a rush of wild looking and halfnaked natives to seize their baggage but upon mrs holland with quiet decision accosting the men in their own language and picking out four of them to carry the baggage up to one of the vehicles standing on the road that ran along the top of the high beach the rest fell back and the matter was arranged without difficulty  after a drive of twenty minutes they stopped at a hotel  it is not like a hotel mother dick remarked as they drew up it is more like a gentlemans house standing in its own park  almost all the european houses are built so here dick and it is much more pleasant than when they are packed together  much nicer dick agreed if each house has a lot of ground like this the place must cover a tremendous extent of country  it does dick but as every one keeps horses and carriages that does not matter much blacktown as they call the native town stands quite apart from the european quarter  as soon as they were settled in their rooms which seemed to dick singularly bare and unfurnished mother and son went out for a drive in one of the carriages belonging to the hotel dick had learned so much about india from her that although extremely interested he was scarcely surprised at the various scenes that met his eye or at the bright and varied costumes of the natives  many changes had taken place during the seventeen years that had elapsed since mrs holland had left india the town had increased greatly in size all signs of the effects of the siege by the french thirty years before had been long since obliterated large and handsome government buildings had been erected and evidences of wealth and prosperity were everywhere present    chapter 3 the rajah   now mother let us talk over our plans dick said as after dinner they seated themselves in two chairs in the veranda at some little distance from the other guests at the hotel how are we going to begin  in the first place dick we shall tomorrow send out a messenger to tripataly to tell my brother of our arrival here  how far is it mother  it is about a hundred and twenty miles in a straight line i think but a good bit farther than that by the way we shall go  how shall we travel mother  i will make some inquiries tomorrow but i think that the pleasantest way will be to drive from here to conjeveram i think that is about forty miles there we can take a native boat and go up the river palar past arcot and vellore to vaniambaddy from there it is only about fifteen miles to tripataly  i shall tell my brother the way i propose going of course if he thinks any other way will be better we shall go by that  are we going to travel as we are mother or in native dress  that is a point that i have been thinking over dick i will wait and ask my brother which he thinks will be the best when out there i always dressed as a native and never put on english clothes except at madras i used to come down here two or three times every year with my mother and generally stayed for a fortnight or three weeks during that time we always dressed in english fashion as by so doing we could live at the hotel and take our meals at public tables without exciting comment my mother knew several families here and liked getting back to english ways occasionally  of course i shall dress in indian fashion while i stay at my brothers so it is only the question of how we shall journey there and i think i should prefer going as we are we shall excite no special observation travelling as english as it will only be supposed that we are on our way to pay a visit to some of our officers at arcot at conjeveram which is a large place there is sure to be a hotel of some sort or other for it is on the main road from madras south on the way up by water we shall of course sleep on board and we shall go direct from the boat to tripataly  however we need not decide until we get an answer to my letter for it will take a very short time to get the necessary dresses for us both i think it most likely that my brother will send down one of his officers to meet us or possibly may come down himself  you heard what they were all talking about at dinner dick  yes mother it was something about tippoo attacking the rajah of travancore but i did not pay much attention to it i was looking at the servants in their curious dresses  it is very important dick and will probably change all our plans travancore is in alliance with us and every one thinks that tippoos attack on it will end in our being engaged in war with him i was talking to the officer who sat next to me and he told me that if there had been a capable man at the head of government here war would have been declared as soon as the sultan moved against travancore now that general meadows had been appointed governor and commanderinchief there was no doubt he said that an army would move against tippoo in a very short timethat it was already being collected and that a force was marching down here from bengal  so you see my boy if this war really breaks out the english may march to seringapatam and compel tippoo to give up all the captives he has in his hands  that would be splendid mother  at any rate dick as long as there is a hope of your father being rescued in that way our plans must be put aside  well mother that will be better in some respects for of course if father is not rescued by our army i can try afterwards as we arranged it would be an advantage in one way as i should then be quite accustomed to the country and more fit to make my way about  a week later an old officer arrived from tripataly  ah rajbullub mrs holland exclaimed as he came up with a deep salaam i am indeed glad to see you again i knew you were alive for my brother mentioned you when he wrote last year  rajbullub was evidently greatly pleased at the recognition  i think i should have known you lady he said but eighteen years makes more changes in the young than in the old truly i am glad to see you again there was great joy among us who knew you as a child when the rajah told us that you were here he has sent me on to say that he will arrive tomorrow i am to see to his apartments and to have all in readiness he intends to stay here some days before returning to tripataly  will he come to this hotel  no lady he will take the house he always has when he is here it is kept for the use of our princes when they come down to madras he bade me say that he hopes you will remain here for that none of the rooms could be got ready at such a short notice  he has not written for he hates writing which is a thing that he has small occasion for i was to tell you that his heart rejoiced at the thought of seeing you again and that his love for you is as warm as it was when you were a boy and girl together  this is my son rajbullub he has often heard me speak of you  yes indeed dick said warmly i heard how you saved her from being bitten by a cobra when she was a little girl  ah the young lord speaks our tongue rajbullub said with great pleasure we wondered whether you would have taught it to him if it had not been that you always wrote to my lord in our language we should have thought that you yourself would surely have forgotten it after dwelling so long among the white sahibs  no we always speak it when together rajbullub i thought that he might some day come out here and that he would find it very useful and i too have been looking forward to returning for a time to the home where i was born  there were many questions to ask about her brother his wife and two sons they were younger than dick for mrs holland was three years senior to the rajah  at last she said i will not detain you longer rajbullub i know that you will have a great deal to do to get ready for my brothers coming at what time will he arrive  he hopes to be here by ten in the morning before the heat of the day sets in  i shall of course be there to meet him  so he hoped lady he said that he would have come straight here first but he thought it would be more pleasant for you to meet him in privacy  assuredly it would she agreed  i will bring a carriage for you here at nine oclock and take you and my young lord to the rajahs house  at the appointed time a handsome carriage and pair drove up to the door of the hotel and in ten minutes mrs holland and dick alighted in the courtyard of a large house four native servants were at the door and the old officer led the way to a spacious room this was carpeted with handsome rugs soft cushions were piled on the divan running round the room the divan itself being covered with velvet and silk rugs looking glasses were ranged upon the walls a handsome chandelier hung from the roof draperies of gauze lightly embroidered with gold hung across the windows  why rajbullub you have done wondersthat is if the house was unfurnished yesterday  it is simple the hindoo said my lord your brother like other rajahs who use the house when they come down here has a room upstairs in which are kept locked up everything required for furnishing the rooms he uses four of his servants came down here with me we had but to call in sweepers to clear the house from dust and wash down the marble floors and then everything was put into its place the cook who also came down has hired assistants and all will be ready for my lord when he arrives  in half an hour one of the servants ran in and announced that the rajah was in the courtyard there was a great trampling of hoofs and a minute later he ascended the stairs and was met by his sister and dick at the door of the room  mrs holland had attired herself handsomely not so much for the sake of her brother but that as his sister those with him would expect to see in her an english lady of position and dick thought that he had never seen her looking so well as when in a dress of rich brocade and with a flush of pleasure and expectation on her cheeks she advanced to the door she was still but a little over thirtythree years old and although the long years of anxiety and sorrow had left their traces on her face the rest and quiet of the sea voyage had done much to restore the fulness of her cheeks and to soften the outline of her figure  the rajah a young and handsomelooking man of thirty ascended the stairs with an eagerness and speed that were somewhat at variance with dicks preconceived ideas of the stateliness of an eastern prince  my sister margaret he exclaimed in english and embraced her with a warmth that showed that his affection for her was unimpaired by the years that had passed since he last saw her  then he stood with his hands on her shoulders looking earnestly at her  i know you again he said you are changed but i can recall your face well you are welcome margaret most welcome  and this is my nephew he went on turning to dick and holding out both his hands to him you are taller than i expectedwell nigh as tall as i am you are like your mother and my mother and you are bold and active and strong she writes me my boys are longing to see you and you will be most welcome at tripataly  i have almost forgotten my english margaret and indeed he spoke with some difficulty evidently choosing his wordsi should quite have forgotten it had not i often had occasion to speak it with english officers i see by your letters that you have not forgotten our tongue  not in the least mortiz i have for years spoken nothing else with dick and he speaks it as well as i do  that is good the rajah replied in his own tongue and in a tone of relief i was wondering how he would get on with us  now let us sit down we have so much to tell each other and moreover i am ravenous for breakfast as i have ridden forty miles since sunrise  breakfast was speedily served the rajah eating in english fashion  i cling to some of our mothers ways you see margaret as i have grown older i have become more english than i was naturally as a boy of thirteen as i was when you last saw me i listened to the talk of those around me and was guided by their opinions a good deal among them there was a feeling of regret that our father had married an english woman and i of course was ever trying my hardest to show that in riding or the chase or in exercises of any kind i was as worthy to be the son of an indian rajah as if i had no white blood in my veins  as i grew up i became wiser i saw how great the english were how steadily they extended their dominions and how vastly better off were our people under their sway than they were in the days when every rajah made war against his neighbour and the land never had rest then i grew proud of my english blood and although i am to my people rajah of tripataly a native prince and lord of their destinies keeping up the same state as my father and ruling them in native fashion in my inner house i have adopted many english ways  my wife has no rival in the zenana i encourage her to go about as our mother did to look after the affairs of the house to sit at table with me and to be my companion and not a mere plaything i am sure margaret your stay with us will do her much good and she will learn a great deal from you  you have heard no news since you last wrote mortiz  a slight cloud passed across the rajahs animated face  none margaret we have little news from beyond the mountains tippoo hates us who are the friends of the english as much as he hates the english themselves so there is little communication between mysore and the possessions of the nabob of arcot we will talk later on of the plans you wrote of in your last letter to me  you do not think that they are hopeless mortiz mrs holland asked anxiously  i would not say that they are hopeless he said gently although it seems to me that after all these years the chances are slight indeed that your husband can be alive and the peril and danger of the enterprise that so far as i understood you you intend your son to undertake would be terrible indeed  we see that mortiz dick and i have talked it over a thousand times but so long as there is but a shadow of a chance of his finding his father he is ready to undertake the search he is a boy in years but he has been trained for the undertaking and will when the trial comes bear himself as well as a man  well margaret i shall have plenty of opportunities for forming my own judgment because of course he will stay with us a long time before he starts on the quest and it will be better to say no more of this now  now tell me about london is it so much a greater city than madras  mrs holland sighed she saw by his manner that he was wholly opposed to her plan and although she was quite prepared for opposition she could not help feeling disappointed however she perceived that as he said it would be better to drop the subject for a time and she accordingly put it aside and answered his questions  madras is largethat is it spreads over a wide extent but if it were packed with houses as closely as they could stand it would not approach london in the number of its population  how is it that the english do not send more troops out here margaret  because they can raise troops here and english soldiers cannot stand the heat as well as those born to it moreover you must remember that at present england is at war not only with france and half europe but also with america she is also obliged to keep an army in ireland which is greatly disaffected with all this on her hands she cannot send a large army so far across the seas especially when her force here is sufficient for all that can be required of it  that is true he said it is wonderful what they have done out here with such small forces but they will have harder work before they conquer all indiaas i believe they will dothan they have yet encountered in spite of tippoos vauntings they will have mysore before many years are over the sultan seems to have forgotten the lesson they taught him six or seven years back but the next time will be the last and tippoo tiger as he is will meet the fate he seems bent on provoking  but beyond mysore lies the mahratta country and the mahrattis alone can put thirty thousand horsemen into the field they are not like the people of bengal who have ever fallen with scarce an attempt at resistance under the yoke of one tyrant after another the mahrattis are a nation of warriors they are plunderers if you will but they are brave and fearless soldiers and might had they been united have had all india under their feet before the coming of the english that chance has slipped from them but when wei say we you see margaretmeet them it will be a desperate struggle indeed  we shall thrash them uncle dick broke in you will see that we shall beat them thoroughly  the rajah smiled at dicks impetuosity  so you think english soldiers cannot be beaten eh  well uncle somehow they never do get beaten i dont know how it is i suppose that it is just obstinacy look how we thrashed the french here and they were just as well drilled as our soldiers and there were twice as many of them  the rajah nodded  one secret of our success dick is that the english get on better with the natives here than the french doi dont know why except what i have heard from people who went through the war they say that the french always seemed to look down on the natives and treated even powerful allies with a sort of haughtiness that irritated them and made them ready to change sides at the first opportunity while the british treated them pleasantly so that there was a real friendship between them  dick finding that the conversation now turned to the time when his mother and uncle were girl and boy together left them and went downstairs he found some twenty horses ranged in the courtyard while their riders were sitting in the shade several of them being engaged in cooking these were the escort who had ridden with the rajah from tripatalyfor no indian prince would think of making a journey unless accompanied by a numerous retinue  scarcely had he entered the yard than rajbullub came up with the officer in command of the escort a finelooking specimen of a hindoo soldier he salaamed as rajbullub presented him to dick the lad addressed him at once in his own tongue and they were soon talking freely together the officer was surprised at finding that his lords nephew from beyond the sea was able to speak the language like a native  first dick asked the nature of the country and the places at which they would halt on their way then he inquired what force the rajah could put into the field and was somewhat disappointed to hear that he kept up but a hundred horsemen including those who served as an escort  you see sahib there is no occasion for soldiers now that the whites are the masters they do the fighting for us when the rajahs father was a young man he could put two thousand men under arms and he joined at the siege of trichinopoly with twelve hundred but now there is no longer need for an army there is no one to fight some of the young men grumble but the old ones rejoice at the change formerly they had to go to the plough with their spears and their swords beside them because they never knew when marauders from the hills might sweep down besides when there was war they might be called away for weeks while the crops were wasting upon the ground  as to the younger men who grumble i say to them if you are tired of a peaceful life go and enlist in a companys regiment and every year some of them do so  in other ways the change is good now that the rajah has no longer to keep up an army he is not obliged to squeeze the cultivators therefore they pay but a light rent for their lands and the rajah is far better off than his father was so that on all sides there is content and prosperity but even now the fear of mysore has not quite died out  my position margaret the rajah said after dick had left the room is a very precarious one when hyder ali marched down here eight years ago he swept the whole country from the foot of the hills to the sea coast my father would have been glad to stand neutral but was of course bound to go with the english as the nabob of arcot his nominal sovereign went with them his sympathies were of course with your people but most of the chiefs were at heart in favour of hyder it was not that they loved him or preferred the rule of mysore to that of madras but at that time madras was governed by imbeciles its council was composed entirely of timid and irresolute men it was clear to all that before any force capable of withstanding him could be put in the field the whole country beyond reach of the guns of the forts at madras would be at the mercy of hyder  what that mercy was had been shown elsewhere whole populations had been either massacred or carried off as slaves therefore when the storm was clearly about to burst almost all of them sent secret messages to hyder to assure him that their sympathies were with him and that they would gladly hail him as ruler of the carnatic  my father was in no way inclined to take such a step his marriage with an english woman the white blood in my veins and his longknown partiality for the english would have marked him for certain destruction and as soon as he received news that hyders troops were in movement he rode with me to madras at that time his force was comparatively large and he took three hundred men down with us he had allowed all who preferred it to remain behind and some four hundred stayed to look after their families most of the population took to the hills and as hyders forces were too much occupied to spend time in scouring the ghauts in search of fugitives when there was so much loot and so many captives ready to their hands on the plains the fugitives for the most part remained there in safety the palace was burnt the town sacked and partly destroyed and some fifteen hundred of our people who had remained in their homes killed or carried off  my father did some service with our horse and i fought by his side we were with colonel baillies force when it was destroyed after for two days resisting the whole of hyder alls army being mounted we escaped and reached madras in safety after losing half our number but all that i can tell you about some other day  when peace was made and hyder retired we returned home rebuilt the palace and restored the town but if tippoo follows his fathers example and sweeps down from the hills there will be nothing for it but to fly again tippoo commanded one of the divisions of hyders army last time and showed much skill and energy and has since he came to the throne been a scourge to his neighbours in the north so far as i can see madras will be found as unprepared as it was last time and although the chiefs of vellore arcot conjeveram and other places may be better disposed towards the english than they were beforefor the carnatic had a terrible lesson last timethey will not dare to lift a finger against him until they see a large british force assembled  so you see sister your position will be a very precarious one at tripataly and it is likely that at any time we may be obliged to seek refuge here the trouble may come soon or it may not come for a year but sooner or later i regard it as certain that tippoo will strive to obtain what his father failed to gainthe mastership of the carnatic indeed he makes no secret of his intention to become lord of the whole of southern india the nizam his neighbour in the north fears his power and could offer but a feeble resistance were tippoo once master of the south and west coast the mahrattis can always be bought over especially if there is a prospect of plunder he relies too upon aid from france for although the french since the capture of pondicherry have themselves lost all chance of obtaining india they would gladly aid in any enterprise that would bring about the fall of english predominance here  there are too considerable bodies of french troops in the pay of the nizam and these would at any rate force their master to remain neutral in a struggle between the english and tippoo  however it will be quite unnecessary that you should resume our garb or that dick should dress in the same fashion did i intend to remain at tripataly i should not wish to draw the attention of my neighbours to the fact that i had english relations resident with me of course every one knows that i am half english myself but that is an old story now they would however be reminded of it and tippoo would hear of it and would use it as a pretext for attacking and plundering us but as i have decided to come down here there is no reason why you should not dress in european fashion  we would remain here brother mrs holland said rather than bring danger upon you dick could learn the ways of the country here as well as with you and could start on his search without going to tripataly  not at all margaret whether you are with me or not i shall have to leave tripataly when tippoo advances and your presence will not in any way affect my plans my wife and sons must travel with me and one woman and boy more or less will make no difference at present this scheme of yours seems to me to border on madness but we need not discuss that now i shall at any rate be very glad to have you both with me the english side of me has been altogether in the background since you went away and though i keep up many of the customs our mother introduced i have almost forgotten the tongue though i force myself to speak it sometimes with my boys as i am sure that in the long run the english will become the sole masters of southern india and it will be a great advantage to them to speak the language  however i have many other things to see about and the companionship of dick will benefit them greatly you know what it always is out here the sons of a rajah are spoilt early by every one giving way to them and their being allowed to do just as they like naturally they get into habits of indolence and self indulgence and never have occasion to exert themselves or to obtain the strength and activity that make our mothers countrymen irresistible in battle they have been taught to shoot and to ride but they know little else and i am sure it will do them an immense deal of good to have dick with them for a time  if nothing comes of this search for your husband i hope you will take up your residence permanently at tripataly you have nothing to go back to england for and dick with his knowledge of both languages should be able to find good employment in the companys service  thank you greatly brother if as you say my quest should come to nothing i would gladly settle down in my old home dicks inclinations at present turn to the sea but i have no doubt that what you say is true and that there may be far more advantageous openings for him out here however that is a matter for us to talk over in the future  the rajah stayed four days at madras every morning the carriage came at nine oclock to fetch mrs holland who spent several hours with her brother and was then driven back to the hotel while dick wandered about with rajbullub through the native town asking questions innumerable observing closely the different costumes and turbans and learning to know at once the district trade or caste from the colour or fashion of the turban and other little signs  the shops were an endless source of amusement to him and he somewhat surprised his companion by his desire to learn the names of all the little articles and trinkets even of the various kinds of grain dick in fact was continuing his preparations for his work he knew that ignorance of any trifling detail which would as a matter of course be known to every native would excite more surprise and suspicion than would be caused by a serious blunder in other matters and he wrote down in a notebook every scrap of information he obtained so as to learn it by heart at his leisure  rajbullub was much surprised at the lads interest in all these little matters which as it seemed to him were not worth a thought on the part of his lords nephew  you will never have to buy these things sahib he said why should you trouble about them  i am going to be over here some time rajbullub and it is just as well to learn as much as one can if i were to stroll into the market in tripataly and had a fancy to buy any trifle the country people would laugh in my face were i ignorant of its name  his companion shook his head  they would not expect any white sahib to know such things he said if he wants to buy anything the white sahib points to it and asks how much then whether it is a brass iota or a silver trinket or a file or a bunch of fruit the native says a price four times as much as he would ask anyone else then the sahib offers him half and after protesting many times that the sum is impossible the dealer accepts it and both parties are well satisfied  if you have seen anything that you want to buy sahib tell me and i will go and get it for you then you will not be cheated  the start for tripataly was made at daybreak dick and his mother drove in an open carriage that had been hired for the journey the rajah rode beside it or cantered on ahead his escort followed the vehicle the luggage had been sent off two days before by cart  the country as far as arcot was flat but everything was interesting to dick and when they arrived at the city where they were to stop for the night at the house the rajah had occupied on his way down he sallied out as soon as their meal was over to inspect the fort and walls he had during his outward voyage eagerly studied the history of clives military exploits and the campaigns by which that portion of india had been wrested from the french and he was eager to visit the fort whose memorable defence by clive had first turned the scale in favour of the british these had previously been regarded by the natives as a far less warlike people than the french who were expected to drive them in a very short time out of the country  rajbullub was able to point out to him every spot associated with the stirring events of that time  tis fortysix years back and i was but a boy of twelve but six years later i was here for our rajah was on the side of the english although tripataly was and is now under the nabob of arcot but my lord had many causes of complaint against him and when he declared for the french our lord who was not then a rajah although chief of a considerable district threw in his lot with the english and when they triumphed was appointed rajah by them and tripataly was made almost wholly independent of the nabob of arcot at one time a force of our men was here with four companies of white troops when it was thought that dupleix was likely to march against us and i was with that force and so learned all about the fighting here  the next day the party arrived late in the evening at tripataly a large number of men with torches received them in front of the palace and on entering mrs holland was warmly received by the rajahs wife who carried her off at once to her apartments which she did not leave afterwards as she was greatly fatigued by the two long days of travel  dick on the contrary although he had dozed in the carriage for the last two or three hours of the journey woke up thoroughly as they neared tripataly as soon as they entered the house the rajah called his two sons handsome darkfaced lads of twelve and thirteen  this is your cousin boys he said you must look after him and see that he has everything he wants and make his stay as pleasant as you can  although a little awed by the to them tall figure they evinced neither shyness or awkwardness but advancing to dick held out their hands one after the other with grave courtesy their faces both brightened as he said in their own language  i hope we shall be great friends cousins i am older and bigger than you are but everything is new and strange to me and i shall have to depend upon you to teach me everything  we did not think that you would be able to talk to us the elder whose name was doast assud said smiling we have been wondering how we should make you understand many of the white officers who come here sometimes speak our language but none of them as well as you do  you see they only learn it after they come out here while i learnt it from my mother who has talked to me in it since i was quite a little boy so it comes as naturally to me as to you  in a few minutes supper was announced the two boys sat down with their father and dick and the meal was served in english fashion dick had already become accustomed to the whiterobed servants at the hotel at madras and everything seemed to him pleasant and homelike  tomorrow dick his uncle said you must have your first lesson in riding  the two boys looked up in surprise they had been accustomed to horses from their earliest remembrance and it seemed to them incredible that their tall cousin should require to be taught dick smiled at their look of astonishment  it is not with us in england as it is here he said boys who live in the country learn to ride but in london which is a very great town with nothing but houses for miles and miles everywhere few people keep horses to ride the streets are so crowded with vehicles of all sorts and with people on foot that it is no pleasure to ride in them and everyone who can afford it goes about in a carriage those who cannot go in hired vehicles or on foot you would hardly see a person on horseback once in a week  i do not like walking doast said gravely  well you see you have no occasion to walk as you always have your horses besides the weather here is very hot but in england it is colder and walking is a pleasure i have walked over twenty miles a day many times not because i had to do it but as a days pleasure with a friend  can you shoot cousin  no dick laughed there is nothing to shoot at there are no wild beasts in england and no game birds anywhere near london  dick saw at once that he had descended many steps in his cousins estimation  then what can you find to do the younger boy asked  oh there is plenty to do dick said in the first place there is school that takes the best part of the day then there are all sorts of games then i used to take lessons in sword exercise and did all sorts of things to improve my muscles and to make me strong then on holidays three or four of us would go for a long walk and sometimes we went out on the river in a boat and every morning early we used to go for a swim oh i can tell you there was plenty to do and i was busy from morning till night but i want very much to learn to shoot both with gun and pistol as well as to ride  we have got english guns and pistols doast said we will lend them to you we have a place where we practise  our father says everyone ought to be able to shootdont you father  the rajah nodded  everyone out here ought to doast because you see every man here may be called upon to fight and everyone carries arms but it is different in england nobody fights there except those who go into the army and nobody carries weapons  what not swords pistols and daggers father doast exclaimed in surprise for to him it seemed that arms were as necessary a part of attire as a turban and much more necessary than shoes but when people are attacked by marauders or two chiefs quarrel with each other what can they do if they have no arms  there are no marauders and no chiefs dick laughed in the old times hundreds of years ago there were nobles who could call out all their tenants and retainers to fight their battles and in those days people carried swords as they do here there are nobles still but they have no longer any power to call out anyone and if they quarrel they have to go before a court for the matter to be decided just as everyone else does  this seemed to doast a very unsatisfactory state of things and he looked to his father for an explanation  it is as your cousin says doast you have been down with me to madras and you have seen that except the officers in the army none of the europeans carry arms it is the same in england england is a great island and as they have many ships of war no enemy can land there there is one king over the whole country and there are written laws by which everyone high and low alike are governed so you see no one has to carry arms all disputes are settled by the law and there is peace everywhere for as nothing would be settled by fighting and the law would punish any one however much in the right he might be who fought there is no occasion at all for weapons it is a good plan for you see no one however rich can tyrannise over others and were the greatest noble to kill the poorest peasant the law would hang him just the same as it would hang a peasant who killed a lord  and now boys you had better be off to bed your cousin has had a long day of it and i have no doubt he will be glad to do so tomorrow we will begin to teach him to ride and to shoot and i have no doubt that he will be ready in return to teach you a great deal about his country  the boys got up but doast paused to ask his father one last question  but how is it father if the english never carry weapons and never fight that they are such brave soldiers for have they not conquered all our princes and rajahs and have even beaten tippoo sahib and made him give them much of his country  the answer would be a great deal too long to be given tonight doast you had better ask your cousin about it in the morning    chapter 4 first impressions   the next morning dick was up early eager to investigate the palace of which he had seen little the night before the house was large and handsome the rajah having added to it gradually every year on passing the doors the great hall was at once entered its roof of elaborately carved stones was supported by two rows of pillars with sculptured capitals the floor was made of inlaid marble and at one end was raised a foot above the general level here stood a stone chair on which the rajah sat when he adjudicated upon disputes among his people heard petitions and gave audiences while a massive door on the lefthand side gave entrance to the private apartments these were all small in comparison with the entrance hall the walls were lined with marble slabs richly carved and were dimly lighted by windows generally high up in the walls which were of great thickness the marble floors were covered with thick rugs and each room had its divan with soft cushions and rich shawls and covers  the room in which they had supped the night before was the only exception this had been specially furnished and decorated in english fashion the windows here were low and afforded a view over the garden next to it were several apartments all fitted with divans but with low windows and a bright outlook they could be darkened during the heat of the day by shutters with the exception of these windows the others throughout the house contained no glass the light entering through innumerable holes that formed a filigree work in the thin slabs of stone that filled the orifices  the grounds round the palace were thickly planted with trees which constituted a grove rather than a garden according to dicks english notions this was indeed the great object of the planter and numerous fountains added to the effect of the overhanging foliage  dick wandered about delighted early as it was men with water skins were at work among the clumps of flowers and shrubs that covered the ground wherever there was a break among the trees here and there were small pavilions whose roofs of sculptured stone were supported by shafts of marble the foliage of shrubs and trees alike was new to dick and the whole scene delighted him half an hour later his two cousins joined him  we wondered what had become of you doast said and should not have found you if rajbullub had not told us that he saw you come out here  come in now coffee is ready we always have coffee the first thing except in very hot weather when we have fruit sherbet after that we ride or shoot till the sun gets hot and then come in to the morning meal at ten  on going in dick found that his mother and the ranee were both up and they all sat down to what dick considered a breakfast consisting of coffee and a variety of fruit and bread one or two dishes of meat were also handed round but were taken away untouched  now come out to the stables dick the rajah said anwar the officer who commanded the escort will meet us there he will be your instructor  the stables were large the horses were fastened to rings along each side and were not as in england separated from each other by stalls a small stone trough with running water was fixed against each wall at a convenient height and beneath this was a pile of fodder before each horse  this is the one that i have chosen for you the rajah said stopping before a pretty creature that possessed a considerable proportion of arab blood as was shown by its small head it is very gentle and well trained and is very fast when you have got perfectly at ease upon it you shall have something more difficult to sit until you are able to ride any horse in the stable bare backed murad is to be your own property as long as you are out here  a syce led the horse out it was bridled but unsaddled and anwar gave a few instructions to dick and then said  i will help you up but in a short time you will learn to vault on to his back without any assistance see you gather your reins so in your left hand place your right hand on its shoulder and then spring up  i can do that now dick laughed and placing his hand on the horses shoulder he lightly vaulted into his seat  well done dick the rajah said while the two boys who had been looking on with amused faces clapped their hands  now sahib anwar went on you must let your legs hang easily press with your knees and let your body sway slightly with the movement of the horse balance yourself rather than try to hold on  i understand dick said it is just as you do on board ship when she is rolling a bit let go the reins  for half an hour the horse proceeded at a walk along the road that wound in and out through the parklike grounds  i begin to feel quite at home dick said at the end of that time i should like to go a bit faster now it is no odds if i do tumble off  shake your rein a little the horse will understand it anwar said  dick did so and murad at once started at a gentle canter easy as it was dick thought several times that he would be off however he gripped as tightly as he could with his knees and as he became accustomed to the motion and learned to give to it acquired ease and confidence he was not however sorry when at the end of another half hour anwar held up his hand as he approached him and the horse stopped at the slightest touch of the rein  as he slid off his legs felt as if they did not belong to him and his back ached so that he could scarce straighten it the rajah and his sons had returned to the palace and the boys were there waiting for him  you have done very well cousin doast said with grave approval you will not be long before you can ride as well as we can now you had better go up at once and have a bath and put on fresh clothes  dick felt that the advice was good as bathed in perspiration and stiff and sore in every limb he slowly made his way to his room  for the next month he spent the greater part of his time on horseback for the first week he rode only in the grounds of the palace then he ventured beyond accompanied by anwar on horseback then his two cousins joined the party and by the end of the month he was perfectly at home on murads back  so far he had not begun to practise shooting  it would be of no use the rajah said when he one day spoke of it you want your nerves in good order for that and it requires an old horseman to have his hand steady enough for shooting straight after a hard ride your rides are not severe for a horseman but they are trying for you leave the shooting alone lad there is no hurry for it  by this time the rajah had become convinced that it was useless to try and dissuade either his sister or dick from attempting the enterprise for which they had come over possibly the earnest conviction of the former that her husband was still alive influenced him to some extent and the strength and activity of dick showed him that he was able to play the part of a man he said little but watched the boy closely made him go through trials of strength with some of his troopers and saw him practise with blunted swords with others dick did well in both trials and the rajah then requested anwar who was celebrated for his skill with the tulwar to give him daily halfanhours sword play after his riding lesson he himself undertook to teach him to use the rifle and pistol  dick threw himself into his work with great ardour and in a very short time could sit any horse in the stable and came to use a rifle and pistol with an amount of accuracy that surprised his young cousins  the boy is getting on wonderfully well the rajah said one day to his sister his exercises have given him so much nerve and so steady a hand that he already shoots very fairly i should expect him to grow up into a fine man margaret were it not that i have the gravest fears as to this mad enterprise which i cannot help telling you both for your good and his is in my opinion absolutely hopeless  i know mortiz she said that you think it is folly on my part to cling to hope and while i do not disguise from myself that there would seem but small chance that my husband has survived and that i can give no reason for my faith in his still being alive and my confidence that he will be restored to me some day i have so firm a conviction that nothing will shake it why should i have such a confidence if it were not well founded in my dreams i always see him alive and i believe firmly that i dream of him so often because he is thinking of me  when he was at sea several times i felt disturbed and anxious though without any reason for doing so and each time on his return i found when we compared dates that his ship was battling with a tempest at the time i was so troubled about him i remember that the first time this happened he laughed at me but when upon two other occasions it turned out so he said  there are things we do not understand margaret you know that in scotland there are many who believe in second sight as it is called and that there are families there and they say in ireland also where a sort of warning is given of the death of a member of the family we sailors are a superstitious people and believe in things that landsmen laugh at it does not seem to me impossible that when two people love each other dearly as we do one may feel when the other is in danger or may be conscious of his death it may be said that such things seldom happen but that is no proof that they never do so for some people may be more sensitive to such feelings or impressions than others and you may be one of them  there is one thing margaret the fact that you have somehow felt when i was in trouble should cheer you when i am away for if mere danger should so affect you surely you will know should death befall me and as long as you do not feel that you may be sure that i shall return safe and sound to you  now i believe that firmly i was once troubledso troubled that for two or three days i was illand so convinced was i that something had happened to jack and yet that he was not dead that when nigh two years afterwards ben came home and i learned that it was on the day of the wreck of his ship that i had so suffered i was not in the least surprised since then i have more than once had the same feelings and have always been sure that at the time jack was in special danger but i have never once felt that he was dead never once thought so and am as certain that he is still alive as if i saw him sitting in the chair opposite to me for i firmly believe that did he die i should see his spirit or that at any rate i should know for certain that he had gone  so whatever you say though reason may be altogether on your side it will not shake my confidence one bit i know that jack is alive and i believe firmly although of this i am not absolutely sure that he will someday be restored to me  you did not tell me this before margaret the rajah said and what you say goes for much with me here in india there are many who as is said possess this power that you call second sight certainly some of the fakirs do i have heard many tales of warnings they have given and these have always come true i will not try in future to damp your confidence and will hope with you that your husband may yet be restored to you  one evening dick remarked  you said down at madras uncle that you would someday tell me about the invasion by hyder ali will you tell me about it now  the rajah nodded his sons took their seats at his feet and dick curled himself up on the divan by his side  you must know the rajah began that the war was really the result of the intrigues of sir thomas rumbold the governor of madras and his council in the first place they had seriously angered the nizam the latter had taken a french force into his service which the english had compelled basult jung to dismiss and madras sent an officer to his court with instructions to remonstrate with him for so doing at the same time they gave him notice that they should no longer pay to him the tribute they had agreed upon for the territory called the northern circars this would have led to war but the bengal government promptly interfered cancelled altogether the demands made by the madras government and for the time patched up the quarrel the nizam professed to be satisfied but he saw that trouble might arise when the english were more prepared to enforce their demands he therefore entered into negotiations with hyder ali and the mahrattis for an alliance whose object was the entire expulsion of the british from india  the mahrattis from poonah were to operate against bombay those in central india and the north were to make incursions into bengal the nizam was to invade the northern circars and hyder was to direct his force against madras hyder at once began to collect military stores and obtained large quantities from the french at mahe a town they still retain on the malabar coast  the madras government prepared to attack mahe when hyder informed them that the settlements of the dutch french and english on the malabar coast being situated within his territory were equally entitled to his protection and that if mahe were attacked he should retaliate by an incursion into the province of arcot in spite of this threat mahe was captured hyder for a time remained quiet but the madras government gave him fresh cause for offence by sending a force in august 1779 to the assistance of basult jung at adoni  to get there this detachment had to pursue a route which led for two hundred miles through the most difficult passes and through the territories both of the nizam and hyder the council altogether ignored the expressed determination of both these princes to oppose the march and did not even observe the civility of informing them that they were going to send troops through their territory  i do not say dick that this made any real difference in the end the alliance between the three native powers being made it was certain that war would break out shortly still had it not been for their folly in giving hyder and the nizam a reasonable excuse for entering upon hostilities it might have been deferred until the madras government was better prepared to meet the storm  the bengal government fortunately again stepped in and undid at least a part of the evil it took the entire management of affairs out of the hands of rumbolds council and its action was confirmed by the board of directors who censured all the proceedings dismissed sir thomas rumbold and his two chief associates from the council and suspended other members  the prompt and conciliatory measures taken by the bengal government appeased the resentment felt by the nizam and induced him to withdraw from the confederacy hyder however was bent upon war and the imbecile government here took no steps whatever to meet the storm the commissariat was entirely neglected they had no transport train whatever and the most important posts were left without a garrison  it was towards the end of june that we received the news that hyder had left his capital at the head of an army of ninety thousand men of whom twentyeight thousand were cavalry he attempted no disguise as to his object and moved confident in his power to conquer the carnatic and drive the english into the sea  my father had already made his preparations everything was in readiness and as soon as the news reached him he started for madras under the guard of his escort with my mother and myself most of the traders of the town and the landowners who had gathered here in fear and trembling  it was a painful scene as you may imagine and i shall never forget the terrified crowds in the streets and the wailing of the women many families who then left reached madras in safety but of those who remained in the town all are dead or prisoners beyond the hills hyder descended through the pass of changama on the 20th of july and his horsemen spread out like a cloud over the country burning devastating and slaughtering hyder moved with the main army slowly occupying town after town and placing garrisons in them  you must not suppose that he devastated the whole country he was too wise for that he anticipated reigning over it as its sovereign and had no wish to injure its prosperity it was only over tracts where he considered that devastation would hamper the movements of an english army that everything was laid waste  on the 21st of august he invested arcot and a week later hearing that the british army had moved out from madras he broke up the siege and advanced to meet them sir hector munro the british general was no doubt brave but he committed a terrible blunder instead of marching to combine his force with that of colonel baillie who was coming down from guntoor he marched in the opposite direction to conjeveram sending word to colonel baillie to follow him baillies force amounted to over two thousand eight hundred men munros to five thousand two hundred had they united the force would have exceeded eight thousand and could have given battle to hyders immense army with fair hope of success the english have won before now with greater odds against them  my father had marched out with his cavalry one hundred and fifty strong with munro of course i was with him and it was to him that the english general gave the despatch to carry to colonel baillie we rode hard for at any moment hyders cavalry might swoop down and bar the road but we got through safely and the next morning the 24th baillie started  the encampment was within twentyfive miles of madras and with one long forced march we could have effected a junction with munro the heat was tremendous and baillie halted that night on the bank of the river cortelour the bed was dry and my father urged him to cross before halting the colonel replied that the men were too exhausted to move farther and that as he would the next day be able to join munro it mattered not on which side of the river he encamped  that night the river rose and for ten days we were unable to cross on the 4th of september we got over but by that time tippoo with five thousand picked infantry six thousand horse six heavy guns and a large body of irregulars detached by hyder to watch us barred the way  colonel baillie finding that there was no possibility of reaching conjeveram without fighting took up a position at a village and on the 6th was attacked by tippoo the action lasted three hours and although the enemy were four times more numerous than we were the english beat off the attacks we were not engaged for against tippoos large cavalry force our few horsemen could do nothing and were therefore forced to remain in the rear of the british line but though colonel baillie had beaten off the attacks made on him he felt that he was not strong enough to fight his way to conjeveram which was but fourteen miles distant and he therefore wrote to sir hector munro to come to his assistance  for three days sir hector did nothing but on the evening of the 8th he sent off a force composed of the flank companies of the regiments with him these managed to make their way past the forces both of hyder and tippoo and reached us without having to fire a shot  their arrival brought our force up to over three thousand seven hundred men had munro made a feigned attack upon hyder and so prevented him from moving to reinforce tippoo we could have got through without much difficulty but he did nothing and hyder seeing the utter incapacity of the man opposed to him moved off with his whole army and guns to join his son  our force set out as soon as it was dark on the evening of the 9th but the moment we started we were harassed by the enemys irregulars the march was continued for five or six miles our position becoming more and more serious and at last colonel baillie took the fatal resolution of halting till morning instead of taking advantage of the darkness to press forward at daybreak fifty guns opened on us our ten field pieces returned the fire until our ammunition was exhausted no orders were issued by the colonel who had completely lost his head so that our men were mowed down by hundreds until at last the enemy poured down and slaughtered them relentlessly  we did not see the end of the conflict when the colonel gave the orders to halt my father said to me  this foolish officer will sacrifice all our lives does he think that three thousand men can withstand one hundred thousand with a great number of guns we will go while we can we can do no good here  we mounted our horses and rode off in the darkness we came suddenly upon a body of tippoos horsemen but dashed straight at them and cut our way through but with the loss of half our force and did not draw rein until we reached madras  the roar of battle had been heard at conjeveram and the fury and indignation in the camp at the desertion of colonel baillies detachment was so great that the general at last gave orders to march to their assistance when his force arrived within two miles of the scene of conflict the cessation of fire showed that it was too late and that baillies force was wellnigh annihilated munro retired to conjeveram and at three oclock the next morning retreated with the loss of all his heavy guns and stores to madras  the campaign only lasted twentyone days and was marked by almost incredible stupidity and incapacity on the part of the two english commanders we remained at madras my father determined that he would take no more share in the fighting until some english general possessing the courage and ability that had always before distinguished them took the command in the meantime hyder surrounded and captured arcot after six weeks delay and then laid siege to amboor chingleput and wandiwash  in november sir eyre coote arrived from england and took the command confidence was at once restored for he was a fine old soldier and had been engaged in every struggle in india from the time of clive but with the whole country in the hands of hyder it was impossible to obtain draft animals or carts and it was not until the middle of january that he was able to move on the 19th he reached chingleput and on the 20th sent off a thousand men to obtain possession of the fort of carangooly it was a strong place and the works had been added to by hyder who had placed there a garrison of seven hundred men the detachment would not have been sent against it had not news been obtained on the way that the garrison had fallen back to chingleput  our troop of cavalry went with the detachment as my father knew the country well to the surprise of captain davis who was in command we found the garrison on the walls  what do you think rajah captain davis who was riding by his side asked my orders were that i was to take possession of the place but it was supposed that i should find it empty  i should say that you had better try with or without orders my father replied the annihilation of baillies force and the miserable retreat of munro have made a terribly bad impression through the country and a success is sorely needed to raise the spirits of our friends  we will do it captain davis said and called up a few english engineers and a company of white troops he had with him and ordered them to blow in the gate  my father volunteered to follow close behind them with his dismounted cavalry and when the word was given forward we went it was hot work i can tell you the enemys guns swept the road and their musketry kept up an incessant roar many fell but we kept on until close to the gate and then the white troops opened fire upon hyders men on the walls so as to cover the sappers who were fixing the powder bags  they soon ran back to us there was a great explosion and the gates fell with loud shouts we rushed forward into the fort and close behind us came the sepoys led by captain davis  it took some sharp fighting before we overcame the resistance of the garrison who fought desperately knowing well enough that after the massacre of baillies force little quarter would be given them the british loss was considerable and twenty of my fathers little company were among the killed great stores of provisions were found here and proved most useful to the army  the news of the capture of carangooly so alarmed the besiegers of wandiwash that they at once raised the siege and retreated and on the following day sir eyre coote and his force arrived there it was a curious thing that on the same day of the same month sir eyre coote had twentyone years before raised the siege of wandiwash by a victory over the army that was covering the operation wandiwash had been nobly defended by a young lieutenant named flint who had made his way in through the enemys lines a few hours before the treacherous native officer in command had arranged with hyder to surrender it and taking command had repulsed every attack and had even made a sortie  there was now a long pause having no commissariat train sir eyre coote was forced to make for the seashore and though hotly followed by hyder reached cuddalore a french fleet off the coast however prevented provisions being sent to him and even after the french had retired the madras government were so dilatory in forwarding supplies that the army was reduced to the verge of starvation  it was not until the middle of june that a movement was possible owing to the want of carriage the country inland had been swept bare by hyder and on leaving cuddalore sir eyre coote was obliged to follow the seacoast when he arrived at porto novo the army was delighted to find a british fleet there and scarcely less pleased to hear that lord macartney had arrived as governor of madras  hyders army had taken up a strong position between the camp and cuddalore and sir eyre coote determined to give him battle four days rice was landed from the fleet and with this scanty supply in their knapsacks the troops marched out to attack hyder we formed part of the baggage guard and had therefore an excellent opportunity of seeing the fight the march was by the sea the infantry moved in order of battle in two lines after going for some distance we could see the enemys position plainly it was a very strong one on its right was high ground on which were numerous batteries which would take us in flank as we advanced and their line extended from these heights to the sand hills by the shore  they had thrown up several batteries and might for aught we knew have many guns hidden on the high ground on either flank an hour was spent in reconnoitring the enemys position during which they kept up an incessant cannonade to which the english field guns attempted no reply to me and the officers of this troop it seemed impossible that any force could advance to the attack of hyders position without being literally swept away by the crossfire that would be opened upon it but when i expressed my fears my father said  no you will see no repetition of that terrible affair with baillies column the english have now got a commander who knows his business and when that is the case there is never any fear as to what the result will be i grant that the lookout seems desperate hyder has all the advantage of a very strong position a very powerful artillery and has six or seven to one in point of numbers but for all that i firmly believe that before night you will see us in possession of those hills and hyders army in full flight  presently we saw a movement the two lines of infantry formed into columns and instead of advancing towards hyders position turned down towards the sea and marched along between it and the sand hills we were at the same time set in motion and kept along between the infantry and the sea so as to be under their protection if hyders cavalry should sweep down all his preparations had been made under the supposition that we should advance by the main road to cuddalore and this movement entirely disconcerted his plans the sand hills completely protected our advancing columns and when they had reached a point almost in line with hyders centre the artillery dashed up to the crest of the hills and the first column passed through a break in them and moved forward against the enemy the guns above clearing a way for them  a short halt was made until the artillery of the second line came up and also took their position on the hill then the first column with its guns moved forward again  hyder had in the meantime moved back his line and batteries into a position at right angles to that they had before occupied and facing the passage through the sand hills by which the english were advancing as soon as the column issued from the valley a tremendous fire was poured upon it but it again formed into line of battle and covered by the fire of the artillery moved forward  it was a grand sight my father and i had left the baggage which remained by the sea and had ridden up on to a sand hill from which we had a view of the whole of the battleground it was astonishing to see the line of english infantry advancing under that tremendous fire against the rising ground occupied by the dense masses of the enemy  presently there was a movement opposite and a vast body of cavalry moved down the slope as they came the red english line suddenly broke up and as if by magic a number of small squares surrounded by glistening bayonets appeared where it had stood  down rode hyders cavalry every gun on our side was turned upon them but though we could see the confusion in the ranks caused by the shot that swept them they kept on it seemed that the little red patches must be altogether overwhelmed by the advancing wave but as it came closer flashes of fire spurted out from the faces of the squares we could see the horses recoil when close to the bayonets and then the stream poured through the intervals between the squares as they did so crackling volleys broke out while from the batteries on the sand hills an incessant fire was kept up upon them then following the volleys came the incessant rattle of musketry the confusion among the cavalry grew greater and greater regiments were mixed up together and their very numbers impeded their action many gallant fellows detaching themselves from the mass rode bravely at the squares and died on the bayonets others huddled together confused and helpless against the storm of bullets and shot and at last as if with a sudden impulse they rode off in all directions and sweeping round regained their position in the rear of their infantry while loud cheers broke from our side  the squares again fell into line which advancing steadily drove hyders infantry before it as this was going on a strong force of infantry and cavalry with guns was moved round by hyder to fall on the british rear these however were met by the second line which had hitherto remained in reserve and after fierce fighting were driven back along the sand hills but as they were retiring the main body of hyders cavalry moved round to support the attack fortunately a british schooner which had sailed from porto novo when the troops started had anchored near the shore to give what protection she could to the baggage and now opened fire with her guns upon the cavalry as they rode along between the sand hills and the sea and with such effect that they halted and wavered and when two of the batteries on the sand hills also opened fire upon them they fell back in haste  this was hyders last effort the british line continued to advance until it had gained all the positions occupied by the enemy and these were soon in headlong flight hyder himself who had been almost forced by his attendants to leave the ground being with them it was a wonderful victory the english numbered but 8476 men of whom 306 were killed or wounded hyders force was about 65000 and his loss was not less than 10000  the victory had an immense effect in restoring the confidence of the english troops which had been greatly shaken by the misfortunes caused by the incapacity of munro and baillie but it had no other consequences for want of carriage and a deficiency of provisions and equipment prevented sir eyre coote from taking the offensive and he was obliged to confine himself to capturing a few forts near the coast  on the 27th of august the armies met again hyder having chosen the scene of his victory over baillies force to give battle believing the position to be a fortunate one for himself hyder had now been joined by tippoo who had not been present at the last battle and his force numbered 80000 men while the english were 11000 strong  i did not see the battle as we were at the time occupied in escorting a convoy of provisions from madras the fight was much better contested than the previous battle had been hyder was well acquainted with the ground and made skilful use of his opportunities by fortifying all the points at which he could be attacked the fight lasted eight hours at last sir eyre cootes first division turned the enemys left flank by the capture of the village of pillalore while his second turned their right and hyder was obliged to fall back but this was done in good order and the enemy claimed that it was a drawn battle this however was not the case as the english at night encamped on the position occupied by hyder in the morning  still the scandalous mismanagement at madras continued to cripple us but learning from the commandant at vellore that unless he were relieved he would be driven to surrender for want of provisions sir eyre coote marched to his help he met the enemy on the way hyder was taken by surprise and was moving off when the english arrived in order to give his infantry time to march away he hurled the whole of his cavalry against the english again and again they charged down with the greatest bravery and although the batteries swept their ranks with grape and the squares received them with deadly volleys they persevered until tippoo had carried off his infantry and guns and then having lost five thousand men followed him the english then moved on towards vellore hyder avoided another encounter and vellore was relieved sir eyre coote handed over to its commandant almost the whole of the provisions carried by the army and having thus supplied the garrison with sufficient food for six weeks marched back to madras his troops suffering greatly from famine on the way  nothing took place during the winter except that sir eyre coote again advanced and revictualled vellore in march a french fleet arrived off the coast landed a force of three thousand men to assist hyder and informed him that a much larger division was on its way fortunately this did not arrive many of the ships being captured by the english on their way out in the course of the year there were several fights but none of any consequence and things remained in the same state until the end of the year when on the 7th of december hyder died and tippoo was proclaimed his successor  bussy arrived with fresh reinforcements from france in april and took the command of hyders french contingent and in june there was a battle between him and a force commanded by general stuart the successor to sir eyre coote who had been obliged to resign from ill health and who had died in the spring  the french position was a very strong one and was protected by numerous field works the battle was the most sanguinary fought during the war considering the numbers engaged the english carried a portion of the works and captured fourteen guns and as the french retired during the night were able to claim a victory their loss however was over a thousand while that of the french was not more than a third of that number  during that year there was little fighting down here a bombay force however under the command of general matthews captured bednore but tippoo hastened against him with a great force besieged bednore and forced it to surrender after a desperate defence tippoo violated the terms of capitulation and made the defenders prisoners bangalore was next besieged by him but resisted for nearly nine months and only surrendered in january 1784  tippoo had by this time lost the services of his french auxiliaries as england and france had made peace at home negotiations between tippoo and the english went on till march when a treaty was signed by its provisions tippoo should have handed back all his prisoners he murdered large numbers of them but 1000 british soldiers and 1600 sepoys obtained their liberty no one knows how many were retained of the number calculated at 200000 of natives carried off from the countries overrun by hyders troops only 2000 were released  more british would doubtless have been freed had it not been for the scandalous cowardice of the three men sent up as british commissioners to tippoo they were treated with the greatest insult and contempt by him and in fear of their lives were too glad to accept the prisoners he chose to hand over without troubling themselves in the slightest about the rest whom they basely deserted and left to their fate    chapter 5 war declared   that gives you a general idea dick of the war with tippoo i saw little of the events after the battle of porto novo as my father was taken ill soon after and died at madras seeing that there was no probability whatever of the english driving hyder back until they had much larger forces and a much better system of management i remained in madras until peace was made then i came back here rebuilt the palace and have since been occupied in trying to restore the prosperity of my poor people  it is i feel a useless task for it is certain that ere long the english will again be engaged with mysore and if they are it is wellnigh certain that tippoos hordes will again sweep down from the hills and carry ruin and desolation everywhere  he would as hyder had have the advantage on his side at the beginning of the war he has a score of passes to choose from and can descend on to the plain by any one he may select and even were there a force here capable of giving battle to the whole mysorean army it could not watch all the passes as to do so the army would have to be broken up into a dozen commands tippoo will therefore again be able to ravage the plains for weeks perhaps before the english can force him to give battle  but there is no army at present in existence of sufficient strength to meet him the madras force would have to wait until reinforcements arrived from calcutta it was bad before but it will be worse now hyder no doubt slaughtered many but he was not cruel by nature he carried off enormous quantities of people with their flocks and herds but he did this to enrich mysore with their labour and did not treat them with unnecessary cruelty  tippoo on the other hand is a human tiger he delights in torturing his victims and slays his prisoners from pure love of bloodshed he is proud of the title of tiger his footstool is a tigers head and the uniforms of his infantry are a sort of imitation of a tigers stripes he has military talent and showed great judgment in command of his divisionindeed most of the successes gained during the last war were his work since then he has laboured incessantly to improve his army numbers of regiments have been raised composed of the captives carried off from here and from the west coast they are drilled in european fashion by the english captives he still holds in his hands  but why uncle instead of giving time to tippoo to come down here should we not march up the passes and compel him to keep his army up there to defend seringapatam  because dick in the first place there is not an army strong enough to do so but even were there a force of fifty thousand men at madras they could not take the offensive in time an english army cannot move without a great train to carry ammunition stores and provisions and to get such a train together would be the work of months as i have been telling you during the three years the last war lasted the madras authorities were never able to collect such a train and the consequence was that their army was unable to go more than two or three days march from the city  on the other hand tippoo could any day order that three days supply of rice or grain should be served out to each soldier and could set out on his march the following morning as from the moment he reached the plains his cavalry would have the whole of the resources of the country at their mercy  i see uncle then if war broke out you would at once go to madras again  there would be nothing else to do dick i should send everything of value down there as soon as i saw that war was inevitable the traders here have already begun to prepare the shops are half empty for they have not replaced goods they have sold and a very few hours would suffice for everything worth taking to be cleared out of the town the country round here is comparatively uninhabited and but a small portion of it tilled so great was the number carried off by hyder next time they will take to the hills at once and i believe that many have already stored up grain in hiding places there this time it may be hoped that a few weeks or months at most may see tippoo driven back and for that time the peasants can manage to exist in the hills no doubt the richer sort who have large flocks of goats and many cattle will as soon as danger threatens drive them down to madras where they are sure to fetch good prices for the use of the army  i have already told all men who have bullock carts and teams that they can if forced to leave home earn a good living by taking service in the english transport train i hope therefore that the results will not be so disastrous as before the town may be burnt down again but unless they blow up my palace they can do little harm to it when i rebuilt it seeing the possibility of another war i would not have any wood whatever used in its construction therefore when the hangings are taken down and the furniture from these rooms cleared out there will be nothing to burn and they are not likely to waste powder in blowing it up  as to the town i warned the people who returned that it might be again destroyed before long and therefore there has been no solid building the houses have all been lightly run up with wood which is plentiful enough in the hills and no great harm therefore will be done if it is again burnt down the pagoda and palace are the only stone buildings in it they did some harm to the former last time by firing shot at it for a day or two and as you can see for yourself no attempt has since been made to repair it and i do not suppose they will trouble to damage it further  so you see dick we are prepared for the worst  will you fight again as you did last time uncle  i do not know dick i show my loyalty to the english rule by repairing to the capital but my force is too small to render much service you see my revenues have greatly diminished and i cannot afford to keep up so large a force as my father could fortunately his savings had been considerable and from these i was able to build this palace and to succour my people and have still enough to keep up my establishment here without pressing the cultivators of the soil for taxes this year is the first that i have drawn any revenue from that source but at any rate i am not disposed to keep up a force which while it would be insufficient to be of any great value in a war like this would be a heavy tax on my purse  even the force you have must be that uncle  not so much as you would think dick with your english notions the pay here is very smallso small that it would seem to you impossible for a man to live on it and yet many of these men have wives and families all of them have patches of land that they cultivate only twenty who are changed once a month being kept on duty they are necessary for i should have but little respect from my people and less still from other rajahs did i not have sentries at the gates and a guard ready to turn out in honour of any visitor who might arrive to say nothing of an escort of half a dozen men when i ride through the country of course all can be called out whenever i want them as for example when i rode to madras to meet you the men think themselves well off upon the pay of three rupees a month as they are practically only on duty two months each year and have the rest of the time to cultivate their fields therefore with the pay of the officers my troop only costs me about four hundred rupees a month which is you know equivalent to forty english pounds so that you cannot call it an expensive army even if it is kept for show rather than use  no indeed uncle it seems ridiculous that a troop of a hundred men can be kept up for five hundred pounds a year  of course the men have some little privileges dick they pay no rent or taxes for their lands this is a great thing for them and really costs me nothing as there is so much land lying uncultivated then when too old for service they have a pension of two rupees a month for life and on that and what little land they can cultivate they are comparatively comfortable  well it does not seem to me uncle that soldiering is a good trade in this country  i dont know that it is a good trade in the money way anywhere after all the pay out here is quite as high in comparison with the ordinary rate of earning of a peasant as it is in england it is never the pay that tempts soldiers among young men there are always great numbers who prefer the life to that of a peasant working steadily from daylight to dark and i dont know that i altogether blame them  then you think uncle there is no doubt whatever that there will be war  not a shadow of doubt dickindeed it may be said to have begun already and like the last it is largely due to the incapacity of the government of madras  i have just received a message from arcot the rajah said two months later and i must go over and see the nabob  i thought mrs holland said that tripataly was no longer subject to him i understood that our father was made independent of arcot  no margaret not exactly that the nabob had involved himself in very heavy debts during the great struggle the company had done something to help him but were unable to take all his debts on their shoulders and indeed there was no reason why they should have done so for although during most of the war he was their ally he was fighting on his own behalf and not on theirs  in the war with hyder it was different he was then quite under english influence and indeed could scarcely be termed independent and as he suffered terriblyhis lands were wasted his towns besieged and his people driven off into slaverythe company are at present engaged in negotiations for assisting him to pay his debts which are very heavy  it was before you left when the nabob was much pressed for money and had at that time no claim on the company that our father bought of him a perpetual commutation of tribute taxes and other monies and subsidies payable by tripataly thus i am no longer tributary to arcot nevertheless this forms a portion of the nabobs territories and i cannot act as if i were an independent prince  i could not make a treaty with mysore on my own account and it is clear that neither arcot nor the english could allow me to do so for in that case mysore could erect fortresses here and could use tripataly as an advanced post on the plain therefore i am still subject to the nabob and could be called upon for military service by him indeed that is one of the reasons why even if i could afford it i should not care to keep up a force of any strength as it is my troop is too small to be worth summoning the nabob has remonstrated with me more than once but since the war with hyder i have had a good excuse namely that the population has so decreased that my lands lie untilled and it would be impossible for me to raise a larger force i have however agreed that in case of a fresh war i will raise an additional hundred cavalry  i expect it is in relation to this that he has sent for me to arcot we know that the english are bound by their treaty with travancore to declare war they ought in honour to have done it long ago but they were unprepared now that they are nearly ready they may do so at any time and indeed the nabob may have learned that fighting has begun  the lookout is bad the government of madras is just as weak and as short sighted as it was during hyders war there is but one comfort and that is that lord cornwallis at calcutta has far greater power than his predecessors and as he is an experienced soldier and is said to be an energetic man he may bring up reinforcements from calcutta without loss of time and also set the troops of bombay in motion i expect that as before things will go badly at first but hope that this time we shall end by giving mysore so heavy a lesson that she will be powerless for mischief in future  and release all the captives mrs holland exclaimed clasping her hands  i sincerely trust so margaret her brother said gravely but after what happened last time we must not be sanguine scattered about as they may be in the scores of little hill forts that dot the whole country we can unhappily never be sure that all are delivered when we have only the word of a treacherous tyrant like tippoo we know that last time he kept back hundreds of prisoners among whom as we may hope was your husband and it may be that however completely he may be defeated he may yet retain some of them knowing full well it is impossible that all these hill forts and their dungeons can be searched however doubtless if an english army marches to seringapatam many will be recovered though we have reason to fear that many will as before be murdered before our arrival  when the rajah returned from arcot on the following day he brought back the news that general meadows had moved to the frontier at caroor fifty miles beyond trichinopoly and that the war was really about to begin  you know he said how matters stand up to now tippoo after making peace with the nizam and the mahrattis with whom he had been engaged in hostilities for some time turned his attention to the western coast where coorg and malabar had risen in rebellion after as usual perpetrating horrible atrocities and after sending a large proportion of the population as slaves to mysore he marched against travancore now travancore was specially mentioned in the treaty of mangalore as one of the allies of the english with whom tippoo bound himself not to make war and had he not been prepared to fight the english he would not have attacked their ally the excuse for attacking travancore was that some of the fugitives from coorg and malabar had taken refuge there  seeing that tippoo was bent upon hostilities lord cornwallis and his council at calcutta directed as i learnt from an official at madras the authorities there to begin at once to make preparations for war instead of doing so mr holland the governor gave the rajah the shameful and cowardly advice to withdraw his protection from the fugitives the rajah refused to comply with such counsel and after some months spent in negotiations tippoo attacked the wall that runs along the northern frontier of travancore  that was about six months ago yes it was on the 28th of decemberso it is just six months his troops fourteen thousand strong made their way without difficulty through a breach but they were suddenly attacked by a small body of travancore men a panic seized them they rushed back to the breach and in the wild struggle to pass through it no less than two thousand were either killed or crushed to death  it was nearly three months before tippoo renewed his attack the lines were weak and his army so strong that resistance was impossible a breach threequarters of a mile in length was made in the wall and marching through this he devastated travancore from end to end  his unaccountable delay before assaulting the position has been of great advantage to us had he attacked us at once instead of wasting his time before travancore he would have found the carnatic as defenceless and as completely at his mercy as hyder did he would still have done so had it depended upon madras but as the authorities here did nothing lord cornwallis took the matter into his own hands he was about to come here himself when general meadows formerly governor of bombay arrived invested by the company with the offices of both governor and of commanderinchief  he landed here late in february and at once set to work to prepare for war lord cornwallis sent from calcutta a large amount of money stores and ammunition and a battalion of artillerymen the sepoys objected to travel by sea as their caste rules forbade them to do so and he therefore sent off six battalions of infantry by land and the nabob tells me they are expected to arrive in four or five weeks time the nabob of arcot and the rajah of tanjore both of whom are very heavily in debt to the government are ordered during the continuance of the war to place their revenues at its disposal a liberal allowance being made to them both for their personal expenses  tippoo is still in travancoreat least he was there ten days ago and has been endeavouring to negotiate the nabob tells me he believes that the object of general meadows in advancing from trichinopoly to caroor is to push on to coimbatoor where he will if he arrives before tippoo cut him off from his return to his capital and as meadows has a force of fifteen thousand men he ought to be able to crush the tyrant at a blow  i fear however there is little chance of this the mysore troops move with great rapidity and as soon as tippoo hears that the english army is marching towards caroor he is sure to take the alarm and by this time has probably passed coimbatoor on his way back with all his faults tippoo is a good general and the nabobs opinionand i quite agree with himis that as soon as he regains the table land of mysore he will take advantage of the english army being far away to the south and will pour down through the passes into this part of the carnatic which is at present absolutely defenceless this being the case i shall at once get ready to leave for madras and shall move as soon as i learn for certain that tippoo has slipped past the english  the nabob has called upon me to join him with my little body of cavalry and as soon as the news comes that tippoo is descending the passes i shall either join him or the english army that will be a matter to decide afterwards  you will take me with you of course uncle dick asked eagerly  certainly dick if you are old enough to undertake the really perilous adventure of going up in disguise to mysore you are certainly old enough to ride with me besides we may hope that this time the war is not going to be as onesided as it was the last time and that we may end by reaching seringapatam in which case we may rescue your father if he is still alive very much more easily than it could be managed in the way you propose  the news that the english army had marched to caroor and that there was no force left to prevent the mysoreans from pouring down from the hills spread quickly and when dick went out with the two boys into the town groups of people were talking earnestly in the streets some of them came up and asked respectfully if there was any later news  nothing later than you have heard dick said  the rajah is not going away yet sahib  no he will not leave unless he hears that tippoo has returned with his army to seringapatam then he will go at once for the sultan might come down through the passes at any moment and can get here a fortnight before the english army can return from caroor  yes it will be no use waiting here to be eaten up sahib do you think conjeveram would be safe because it is easy to go down there by boat  i should think so hyder could not take it last time and the english army is much stronger than it was then besides there will be six thousand men arriving from bengal in a months time so i should think there is no fear of conjeveram being taken  it is little trouble getting there the trader said but it is a long journey to madras we could go down with our families and goods in two days in a boat but there would not be boats enough for all and it will be best therefore that some should go at once for if all wait until there is news that tippoo is coming many will not be able to get away in time  no not in boats dick agreed but in three days a bullock cart would get you there  next day several of the shops containing the most valuable goods were shut up and day by day the number remaining open grew smaller  it is as i expected the rajah said one morning as he came into the room where the family was sitting a messenger has just come in from the nabob with the news that sickness broke out among the army as soon as they arrived at caroor and in twentyfour hours a thousand men were in hospital this delayed the movement and when they arrived at coimbatoor they were too late tippoo and his army had already passed moving by forced marches back to mysore  finish your packing ladies we will start at daybreak tomorrow morning i secured three boats four days ago and have been holding them in readiness rajbullub will go in charge of you there is not the least fear of tippoo being here for another fortnight at the earliest  i shall ride with the troop dick and the boys will go with me we shall meet you at conjeveram i have already arranged with some of our people who have gone on in their bullock carts with their belongings and will unload them there to be in readiness to take our goods on to madras so there will be no delay in getting forward  by nightfall the apartments were completely dismantled the furniture was all stowed away in a vault which the rajah had had constructed for the purpose when the palace was rebuilt access was obtained to it through the floor in one of the private apartments the floor was of tessellated marble but some ten squares of it lifted up in a mass forming together a trapdoor from which steps led down into the vault when the block was lowered again the fit was so accurate that after sweeping a little dust over the joint the opening was quite imperceptible to any one not aware of the hiding place the cushions of the divans were taken down here as well as the furniture and all the less valuable carpets rugs and hangings while the costlier articles were rolled up into bales for transport  the silver cups and other valuables were packed in boxes and were during the night carried by coolies down to the boats over which a guard was placed until morning provisions for the journey down the river were also placed on board the palace was astir long before daybreak the cushions that had been slept on during the night were carried down to the boats the boxes of wearing apparel closed and fastened and a hasty meal was taken  the sun was just rising when they started one boat had been fitted up with a bower of green boughs for the use of the two ladies and their four attendants the other two carried the baggage  after seeing them push off the rajah his sons and dick returned to the palace here for a couple of hours he held a sort of audience and gave his advice to the townspeople and others who came in considerable numbers to consult with him when this was done they went into the courtyard where all was ready for their departure  the troop had during the past week been raised to two hundred men many of the young cultivators coming eagerly forward as soon as they heard that the rajah was going to increase his troop being anxious to take a share in the adventures that might be looked for and to avenge the sufferings that had been inflicted on their friends by hyders marauders they were a somewhat motley troop but this mattered little as uniformity was unknown among the forces of the native princes  the majority were stout young fellows all provided their own horses and arms and although the former lacked the weight and bone of english cavalry horses they were capable of performing long journeys and of existing on rations on which an english horse would starve  all were well armed for any deficiency had been made up from the rajahs store and from this a large number of guns had three days before been distributed among such of the ryots as intended to take to the hills on the approach of the enemy ammunition had also been distributed among them every man in the troop carried a shield and tulwar and on his back was slung a musket or spear and there were few without pistols in their girdles  they rode halfway to conjeveram and stopped for the night at a villagethe men sleeping in the open air while the rajah his sons and dick were entertained by the chief man of the place the next afternoon they rode into conjeveram where just at sunset the boats also arrived  the troop encamped outside the town while the rajah and his party occupied some rooms that had been secured beforehand for them in the morning the ladies proceeded in a native carriage with the troop an officer and ten men following in charge of the bullock carts containing the baggage  on reaching madras they encamped on the maidana large open space used as a drill ground for the troops garrisoned thereand the rajah and his party established themselves in the house occupied by him on the occasion of his last visit the next day the rajah went to the government house and had an interview with the deputy governor  i think the latter said after some conversation that your troop of cavalry will be of little use to the nabob if tippoo comes down from the hills he will not be able to take the field against him and will need all his forces to defend arcot vellore and his smaller forts and cavalry would be of no real use to him your troop would be of much greater utility to the battalions from bengal when they arrive they will be here in three weeks or so and as soon as they come i will attach you to them i will write to the nabob saying that you were about to join him but that in the interest of the general defence i have thought it better at present to attach you to the bengal contingent you see they will be entirely new to the country and it will be a great advantage to them to have a troop like yours many of whom are well acquainted with the roads and general geography of the country your speaking english too will add to your usefulness  i have a nephew with me who speaks english perfectly and also hindustani the rajah said he is a smart young fellow and i have no doubt that the officer in command would be able to make him very useful he is eager to be of service his father who was an englishman was wrecked some years ago on the west coast and sent up a prisoner to mysore he was not one of those handed over at the time of the peace but whether he has been murdered or is still a prisoner in tippoos hands we do not know my sister came out with the boy three or four months ago to endeavour to obtain some news of him  i will make a note of it rajah i have no doubt that he will be of great use to colonel cockerell  in the last week in july the rajah moved with his troop to conjeveram and on the 1st of august the bengal forces arrived there they were joined at once by three regiments of europeans one of native cavalry and a strong force of artillery raising their numbers to nine thousand five hundred men  colonel kelly took command of the force and begged the rajah to advance with his horsemen at once to the foot of the ghauts to break it up into half troops and to capture or destroy any small parties of horse tippoo might send down by any of the passes to reconnoitre the country and ascertain the movements and strength of the british forces he was also to endeavour to obtain as much information as he could of what was going on in mysore and to ascertain whether tippoo was still with his army watching general meadows in the west or was moving as if with the intention of taking advantage of the main force of the english being away south to descend into the carnatic  the order was a very acceptable one to the rajah his troop made a good appearance enough when in company with those of the nabob of arcot but he could not but feel that they looked a motley body by the side of the trained native and european troops and he was frequently angered by hearing the jeering comments of english soldiers to each other when he rode past them with his troop and had not a little astonished the speakers more than once by turning round on his horse and abusing them hotly in their own language  he was therefore glad to be off for such work his men were far better fitted than were even the native cavalry in the companys service they were stout active fellows accustomed to the hills and speaking the dialect used by the shepherds and villagers among the ghauts  proceeding northward through vellore he there divided his force into four bodies he himself with fifty men took up a position at the mouth of the pass of amboor another fifty were sent to the pass of moognee to the west of chittoor under the command of anwar the captain of the troop the rest were distributed among the minor passes  dick remained with his uncle who established himself in a village seven miles up the pass he was well satisfied with the arrangement for he was anxious to learn to go about among the hills as a spy and was much more likely to get leave from his uncle to do so than he would have been from any of the officers of the troop who would not have ventured to allow the rajahs nephew to run into danger  in the second place his especial friend among the officers a youth named surajah son of rajbullub was with the detachment surajah had been especially picked out by the rajah as dicks companion he generally joined him in his rides and they had often gone on shooting excursions among the hills he was about three years dicks senior but in point of height there was but little difference between them  every day half the troop under an officer rode up the pass until within a mile of the fort near the summit garrisoned by mysorean troops they were able to obtain but little information for the villages towards the upper end of the pass were all deserted and in ruins the inhabitants never having ventured back since hyders invasion  the rajah was vexed at being able to learn nothing of what was passing on the plateau and was therefore more disposed than he might otherwise have been to listen to dicks proposal  dont you think uncle the latter said one evening that i might try to learn something by going up with surajah alone we could strike off into the hills as if on a shooting expedition just as we used to do from tripataly except that i should stain my face and hands the people in the villages on the top of the ghauts are every one says simple and quiet they have no love for tippoo or mysore but are content to pay their taxes and to work quietly in their fields there will be little fear of our being interfered with by them  you might find a party of tippoos troops in one of the villages dick and get into trouble  i dont see why we should uncle of course we should not go up dressed as we are but as shikarees and when we went into a village should begin by asking whether the people are troubled with any tigers in the neighbourhood you see i specially came out here to go into mysore in disguise and i should be getting a little practice in this way besides obtaining news for you  i am certainly anxious to get news dick so far i have had nothing to send down except that the reports from all the passes agree in saying that they have learned nothing of any movement on the part of tippoo and that no spies have come down the passes or any armed party whatever this is good so far as it goes but it only shows that the other passes are like this entirely deserted therefore we really know nothing whatever even at this moment tippoo may have fifty thousand men gathered on the crest of the hills ready to pour down tomorrow through one of the passes and therefore as i do not think you would be running any great danger i consent to your going with surajah on a scouting expedition on foot among the hills as you say you must of course disguise yourselves as peasants you had better in addition to your guns each take a brace of pistols and so armed even if any of the villagers were inclined to be hostile they would not care about interfering with you  thank you uncle when would you expect us back if we start tomorrow morning  that must be entirely in your hands dick you would hardly climb the ghauts and light upon a village in one day and it might be necessary to go farther before you could obtain any news it is a broken country with much jungle for some distance beyond the hills and the villages lying off the roads will have but little communication with each other and might know nothing whatever of what was happening in the cultivated plains beyond at any rate you must not go into any villages on the roads leading to the heads of the passes for there are forts everywhere and you would be certain to find parties of troops stationed in them  even before war broke out i know that this was the case as they were stationed there to prevent any captives native or european escaping from mysore you must therefore strictly avoid all the main roads even though it may be necessary to proceed much farther before you can get news i should think if we say three days going and as many returning it will be as little as we can count upon and i shall not begin to feel at all uneasy if you do not reappear for a week it is of no use your returning without some information as to what is going on in mysore and it would be folly to throw away your work and trouble when in another day or two you might get the news you want i shall therefore leave it entirely to your discretion  greatly pleased at having succeeded beyond his expectations dick at once sought out surajah the latter was very gratified when he heard that he was to accompany the young sahib on such an expedition and at once set about the necessary preparations there was no difficulty in obtaining in the village the clothes required for their disguises and one of the sheep intended for the following days rations was killed and a leg boiled  if we take in addition to this ten pounds of flour a gourd of ghee and a little pan for frying the cakes in we shall be able to get on without having to buy food for four or five days and of course when we are once among the villages we shall have no difficulty in getting more you had better cut the meat off the bone and divide it in two portions and divide the flour too then we can each carry our share  i will willingly carry it all sahib  not at all surajah we will each take our fair share you see we shall have a gun pistols ammunition and a tulwar and that with seven or eight pounds of food each and our water bottles will be quite enough to carry up the ghauts the only thing we want now is some stain  i will get something that will do and bring it with me in the morning sahib it wont take you a minute to put on i will come for you at the first gleam of daylight  dick returned to the cottage he occupied with his uncle and told him what preparations they had made for their journey and they sat talking over the details for another hour the rajahs last words as they lay down for the night were  dont forget to take a blanket each you will want it for sleeping in the open which you will probably have to do several times although you may occasionally be able to find shelter in a village  by the time the sun rose the next morning they were well upon their way they had a good deal of toilsome climbing but by nightfall had surmounted the most difficult portions of the ascent and encamped when it became dark in a small wood here they lighted a fire cooked some cakes of flour and with these and the cold meat made a hearty meal they had during the day halted twice and had breakfasted and lunched off some bread of which they had brought sufficient for the days journey  i suppose there is no occasion to watch surajah  i dont know sahib i do not think it will be safe for us both to sleep there are as you know many tigers among these hills and though they would not approach us as long as the fire is burning brightly they might steal up and carry one of us off when the fire gets low i will therefore watch  i certainly should not let you do that without taking my turn dick said and i feel so tired with the days work that i do not think i could keep awake for ten minutes it would be better to sleep in a tree than that  you would not get much sleep in a tree sahib i have done it once or twice when i have been hunting in a tigerinfested neighbourhood but i got scarcely any sleep and was so stiff in the morning that i could hardly walk i would rather sit up all night and keep up a good fire than do that  dick thought for a minute or two and then got up and walked about under the trees keeping his eyes fixed upon the branches overhead  this will do he said at last come here surajah there do you see those two branches coming out in the same direction at one point they are but five or six feet apart we might fasten our blankets side by side with the help of the straps of our water bottles and the slings of the guns so as to make what are called on board a ship hammocks and lie there perfectly safe and comfortable  surajah nodded  i have a coil of leather thong sahib i thought that it might be useful if we wanted to bind a prisoner or for any other purpose so i stuffed it into my waist sash  that is good let us lose no time for i am quite ready for sleep i will climb up first  in ten minutes the blankets were securely fastened side by side between the branches surajah descended threw another armful of wood on to the fire placed their meat in the crutch of a bough six feet above the ground and then climbed the tree again thus they were soon lying side by side in their blankets these bagged rather inconveniently under their weight but they were too tired to mind trifles and were very soon fast asleep  dick did not wake until surajah called him it was already broad daylight his companion had slipped down quietly stirred up the embers of the fire thrown on more wood and cooked some chupatties before waking him  it is too bad surajah dick said as he looked down you ought to have woke me i will unfasten these blankets before i get down it will save time after breakfast  half an hour later they were again on their way and shortly came upon a boy herding some goats he looked doubtfully at them but seeing that they were not mysorean soldiers he did not attempt to fly  how far is it to the next village lad surajah asked and which is the way we are shikarees are there any tigers about  plenty of them the boy said i drive the goats to a strong high stockade every evening and would not come out before the sun rose for all the money they say the sultan has  make for that tree and close to it you will see a spring follow that down it will take you to the village  after walking for six hours they came to the village it was a place of some little size but there were few people about women came to the doors to look at surajah and dick as they came along  where are you from an old man asked as he came out from his cottage  from down the mountain side tigers are getting scarce there and we thought we would come over and see what we could do here  here there are many tigers the old man said for the last twenty years the wars have taken most of our young men away some are forced to go against their will for when the order comes to the head man of the village that the sultan requires so many soldiers he is forced to pick out those best fitted for service others go of their own free will thinking soldiering easier work than tilling the fields besides the chance of getting rich booty so there are but few shikarees and the tigers multiply and are a curse to us  we are but poor people but if you choose to stay here for a time we will pay something for every tiger you kill and we will send round to the other villages within ten miles and doubtless every one of them will contribute so that you might get enough to pay you for your exertions  we will think of it surajah replied we did not intend to stop in one village but proposed to travel about in the junglecovered district and wherever we hear complaints of a tiger committing depredations we will stop and do our best to kill the evil beast we mean first to find out where they are most troublesome and then we shall work back again we hear that the sultan gives good prices for those taken alive  i have heard so the old man said but none have been caught alive here or by anyone in the villages round the sultan generally gets them from the royal forests where none are allowed to shoot save with his permission sometimes when there is a lack of them there his hunters come into these districts and catch them in pitfalls and have nets and ropes with which the tigers are bound and taken away  a little crowd had by this time collected round them and the women when they heard that the strangers were shikarees who had come up with the intention of killing tigers brought them bowls of milk cakes and other presents  i suppose now that the sultan is away at war dick said his hunters do not come here for tigers  we know nothing of his wars a woman said they take our sons from us and we do not see them again we did hear a report that he had gone with an army to conquer travancore but why he should want to do it none of us can make out his dominions are as wide as the heart of man can require it is strange that he cannot rest contented but like his father should be always taking our sons away to fight however these things are beyond the understanding of poor people like us but we cant help thinking that it would be better if he were to send his armies to destroy all the tigers if he would do that we should not grudge the sums we have to pay when the tax gatherers come round  after pausing for an hour in the village they continued on their way two or three other small collections of huts were passed but it was not until the evening of the next day that they issued from the junglecovered country onto the cultivated plain at none of the places they had passed was there anything known as to tippoo or his army but they were told that there were parties of troops in all the villages along the edge of the plain as well as in the passes  we must be careful now surajah dick said as after a long days march they sat down to rest at a distance of half a mile from a large village our tale that we are shikarees will not do here had that really been our object we should have stopped at the first place we came to and at any rate we should not have come beyond the jungle we might still say that we are shikarees but that tigers had become scarce on the other side of the hills and hearing a talk that tippoo and the english are going to war with each other we made up our minds to go to seringapatam and enlist in his army  that would do very well surajah agreed they would have no reason for doubting us and even if the officer here were to suggest that we should enlist under him we could do so as there would be no difficulty in slipping away and making off into the jungle again  they waited until the sun set and then walked on into the village they had scarcely entered when two armed men stopped them and questioned them whence they came  surajah repeated the story they had agreed upon and the men appeared quite satisfied  you will be just in time one said we have news that the sultan has just moved with his army to seringapatam officers came here only yesterday to buy up cattle and grain these are to be retained here until orders are received where they are to be sent so i should say that he is coming this way and will be going down the passes as hyder did  we shall be very glad for i suppose we shall join as he passes along it has been dull work here and we are looking forward to gaining our share of the loot it would be just as well for you to join us here now as to go on to seringapatam  it would save us a long tramp surajah agreed we will think it over and maybe we will have a talk with your officer tomorrow morning  they sauntered along with the men talking as they went and so escaped being questioned by other soldiers presently they made the excuse that they wanted to buy some flour and ghee before the shops were closed and with a friendly nod to the two soldiers stopped before the stall of a peasant who had on a little stand in front of him a large jar of ghee having purchased some they went a little farther and laid in a fresh supply of flour  things are very dear surajah remarked  there is very little left in the village the man said all the flour was bought up yesterday for the sultans army which they say is coming in this direction and i have only got what you see here it has been pounded by my wife and some other women since morning  that is good enough dick said as they walked away our work is done surajah and it is not likely that we should learn anything more if we were to stop here for a week let us turn down between these houses and make our way round behind we might be questioned again by a fresh party of soldiers if we were to go along the street  they kept along on the outskirts of the village regained the road by which they had come and walked on until they reached the edge of the jungle going a short distance among the trees they collected some sticks lit a fire and sat down to cook their meal  at the last village or two they had heard but little of tigers and now agreed that they could safely lie down and that it would not be necessary for them to rig up their blankets as hammocks as they had done on the first two nights    chapter 6 a perilous adventure   they retraced their steps without adventure until they reached the village they had first stopped at  there are soldiers here surajah exclaimed as they entered  we cant help it now dick said there is nothing for it but to go on boldly i suppose that tippoo has sent troops into all these frontier villages to prevent any chance of news of his movements being taken to the plains  ah there is the old chap who spoke to us last time let us stop at once and talk with him  so you are back again the peasant said as they came up to him  yes surajah replied we told you we should come back here unless we got news of some tiger being marked down near one of the other villages we have been as far as the edge of the jungle and although we have heard of several not one of them seems to be in the habit of coming back regularly to the same spot so we thought we could not do better than return here at once and make it our headquarters  i see you have got some soldiers here  yes the old man said discontentedly and a rough lot they are they demand food and instead of paying for it in money their officer gives us bits of paper with some writing on them he says that when they go we are to take them to him and he will give us an order equal to the whole of them for which we can receive money from the treasury at seringapatam  a nice thing that none of us have ever been to seringapatam and should not know what to do when we got there moreover there would be no saying whether one would ever come back again it is terrible besides we have only grain enough for ourselves and shall have to send down to the plains to buy more and where the money is to come from nobody can tell  i think i could tell you how you had better proceed if you will take us into your house surajah said this is not a place for talking there are four or five soldiers there watching us  the old man entered the house and closed the door behind them  how would you counsel us to proceed he asked as soon as they had seated themselves on a divan formed of a low bank of beaten earth with a thick covering of straw  it is simple enough surajah said one of you would take the order on the sultans treasury to a large village down in the plain you would go to a trader and say that you wished to purchase so much grain and other goods and would pay for them with an order on the sultans treasury it would probably be accepted as readily as cash for the trader would send it to a merchant or banker at seringapatam to get it cashed for him to pay for goods he had obtained there and either to send him any balance there might be or to retain it for further purchases an order of that kind is better than money for trading purposes for there would be no fear of its being stolen on the way as it could be hidden in the hair or shoe or anywhere among the clothes of the messenger  wonderful the old peasant said your words are a relief indeed to me and will be to all the village when they hear them  and now dick broke in let us talk about tigers while you have been speaking those soldiers have passed the door twice and have been looking suspiciously at the house if they take it into their heads to come here and to ask who we are and what is our business it would not do to tell them that we have been discussing the value of the orders on the sultans treasury  now if our advice has been of any assistance to you in this matter you in turn can render us aid in our business of killing tigers we want you to find out for us when a tiger was last seen near the village where its lair is supposed to be and whether according to its situation we should have the best chance of killing it by digging a pitfall on the path by which it usually comes from the jungle or by getting a kid and tying it up to attract the tiger to a spot where we shall be stationed in a tree  i will assuredly do that and every one here will be glad to assist when i tell them the advice i have received from youand would indeed do so in any case for it will be a blessing to the village if you can kill the tiger that so often carries off some of our sheep and goats  at this moment there was a loud knocking at the door on the peasant opening it a group of soldiers demanded to see the men who had entered  we are here surajah said coming forward what do you want  we want to know who you are and where you come from  any one in the village could have told you that surajah said we are shikarees and have come here to destroy tigers we were arranging with this old man to find us guides who can point out the tracks of the one which has for some time been preying on their animals  yes and our children the old man put in for three of them were carried off from the street here within the last month  the soldiers looked doubtful but one of them said  this is for our officer to inquire about the men are strangers to the village and he will want to question them  we are quite ready to be questioned surajah said our host here will bear me out in what i say and there are others in the village who will tell you that we have been arranging with them to kill tigers in this neighbourhood though as yet we have not settled what they will pay us for each beast we destroy  accompanied by the peasant they went with the soldiers to the guard house with which each of the frontier villages was provided it consisted of a group of huts surrounded by a thick wall of sunburnt bricks they were taken into the largest hut where the officer of the party was seated on a rough divan  who have you here he asked irritably for he had been awakened from a doze by their entry  they are two young fellows who are strangers here they say they are shikarees who have come into the village to gain a reward for killing a tiger that has been troublesome  they were here three days ago sahib the villager said and asked us many questions about the tigers and were when the soldiers came to the door questioning me as to the tigers place of retreat and whether a pitfall or a kid as a decoy would be most suitable  where do you come from the officer asked surajah  we live in a little village some distance down the ghauts we heard that tigers were more abundant in the jungle country up here than they are below and thought that we would for a time follow our calling here we can get good prices for the skins down below and with that and what we get from the villages for freeing them from the tigers we hope in a few months to take back a good store of money  your story is a doubtful one the officer said harshly you may be what you say and you may be spies  if we had been spies surajah said we should not be here but at bangalore or seringapatam these villages are not the places where news is to be gained  this was so self evident that the officer had nothing to say against it  at any rate he said after a pause there is no confirmation to your story and as i have orders to put all suspicious persons under arrest i shall detain you  it is very hard surajah began but the officer made an impatient gesture while two of the soldiers put their hands on the shoulders of the prisoners and led them from the hut  you need not look so downcast one of them said good naturedly i dont suppose you will be kept here long and will no doubt be released when the sultan has gone down the passes with his army a week or two here will do you no harmthe tigers can wait for a bit  there give us your weapons i daresay you will get them back again when we go on as i hope we shall do for there is nothing to eat and nothing to do in this miserable place  the arms were taken into the officers hut and as there was a sentry at the gate no further attention was paid to them  i will get you some provisions and bring them in the old man said it is hard indeed that men cannot go about their business without being interfered with  thank you but we have enough for two or three days when that is gone we will give you some money to buy more for we have a few rupees with us as we knew it might be some time before we should be able to kill a tiger  as soon as the old man had left them they seated themselves on a large faggot of wood that had been brought in by the villagers for fuel  we cannot stay here surajah it is most important that we should get back with the news and i have no doubt that pigheaded brute in there will do as he says and will hold us prisoners until tippoo has gone down the passes we must get off tonight if possible we are not likely to be looked after very sharply i dont think that fellow really suspects us but is simply keeping us to show his authority there ought to be no difficulty in getting out i suppose we shall be put into one of the soldiers huts tonight and if we crawl out when they are asleep we have only to make our way up those narrow steps to the top of the wall and then let ourselves down the other side it is not above fifteen feet high and even if we dropped we should not be likely to hurt ourselves  there will most likely be a sentry at the gate surajah observed and there is a moon tonight  there ought to be no difficulty in pouncing on him suddenly gagging him before he can give the alarm and then tying him we will walk round and see if there is any rope lying about if not i will tear my sash into strips we can use yours to lower ourselves over the wall i should like to get our weapons if we could the guns do not matter but the pistols are good ones and if there is an alarm given we may have to fight besides it is not impossible that we may come across a tiger as we go along i vote that when we have secured the sentry we pay the officer a visit  surajah nodded he was quite ready to agree to anything that dick might suggest and felt a strong desire to repossess himself of his arms for it seemed to him that it would be a humiliation to go back without them  of course dick went on if the sentry gives the alarm before we can secure him we must give up part of our plan for in that case we should have to bolt once over the wall we should be all right they may fire away at us as we run but there is no fear of their hitting us half asleep as they will be and not quite sure what it is all about if we get a fair start of them we need not have much fear of their catching us  not as long as it is straight running sahib but if they follow us far they may come up within range of us as we are making our way down some of those nasty places where we came up the face of the ghaut  if we once get well away from them we will hide up somewhere and then strike off on another line  we might do that surajah agreed but you know the place where we came up was the only one that seemed to us climbable and it would be certainly better to make for it again if we can find our way  i quite agree with you there surajah it would never do to go and find ourselves on the edge of a precipice that we could not get down with the soldiers anywhere near us besides it is of the greatest importance that we should take the news back as soon as possible as every hour may be of importance i only wish we could find out which pass tippoo means to go by but i dont suppose that will be known until he starts for it anyhow our news will be very valuable for at present he is supposed to be over on the other side and he would have taken our troops entirely by surprise if he had suddenly poured out onto the plain so we must give up my idea of hiding up for if we did so we should have to lie there all day and it would mean the loss of twentyfour hours for i would not go down those ghauts for any money except in daylight it is a very different thing going downhill to going up and if we were to attempt it in the dark we should break our necks for a certainty if we can get away early tonight we shall be at the edge of that steep place by nine oclock in the morning and if we strike the right point we might be back to the rajah by nightfall  it will be difficult to find our way back in the dark surajah said  no doubt still we can keep in the general direction and even if we do not hit upon the stream tonight we shall find it in the morning  it was late in the afternoon when they reached the village and it was now growing dark two soldiers came up to them and bade them follow them into one of the huts and there pointed to the farther corner as their place they wrapped themselves in their blankets and at once lay down  if they take it into their heads dick whispered to surajah to put a sentry on guard at the door it will upset all our plans it would not be very difficult to cut our way through the mud wall behind us but in the first place they have taken away our knives and even if we had them it would be risky work trying it  the chances are that they will sit and talk all night of course we might surprise the sentry but it would be a great risk with those fellows close at hand and we should have to run straight for the steps and might get a dozen balls after us before we were over the wall  i dont think there would be much chance of their hitting us surajah said jumping up from their sleep in confusion they would be a minute or so before they could find out what had happened and we should be at the foot of the steps before they saw us and then they would fire almost at random  but in that case we should lose our weapons he added regretfully  we cannot help that the arms are of no consequence at all compared to our getting awayunless of course any of them happen to overtake us  for three or four hours the soldiers of whom there were ten in the hut sat eating talking and smoking round the fire which they kept burning on the earthen floor one by one however they left it and lay down when but three remained one of them got up with a grumble of discontent took his musket which was leaning against the wall and went out of the hut  what a nuisance dick whispered he is evidently going on sentry duty  perhaps he has gone to the gate surajah suggested  i am afraid not i expect the other hut is furnishing the sentry there listen  during the pauses of the low conversation of the two men still sitting by the fire they could hear a footfall outside  that settles the question dick said now the sooner those fellows go to sleep the better  we had better wait for some time after they do surajah replied one or two of the men who lay down first are sure to get up and go to the door and look out they always do that once or twice during the night the sentry will soon get accustomed to the door being opened and wont look round sharp  that is a good idea dick agreed the moon is at the back of the hut so we shall be in the shadow i will spring upon him and will try and grip him by the throat so that he cant holloa you wrench the musket from his hands and snatch his belt of cartridges that will give us a weapon anyhow as soon as you have got it i will give him one sharp squeeze and throw him down it will be some time before he gets breath enough to holloa  in half an hour the two men by the fire lay down it was not long before as surajah predicted one of the sleepers sat up and stretched himself then he rose and walked to the door opened it and stood at the entrance a moment later he was joined by another figure and for a few minutes they stood talking together then he came in again shut the door and lay down  during the next hour three of the others followed his example the last of them leaving the door ajar behind him when he came in  now is our chance surajah we must give him ten minutes to fall asleep again then we will move should one of them be lying awake and notice uswhich is not likely for it is too dark in here to see figures distinctlyand ask where we are going say to the door to get cool they wont imagine that we are thinking of escape with one sentry at the door and another at the gate  dont you think sahib that it would be safer to kill the sentries  safer or not surajah we will not do it at present they have done us no harm they are only acting as their officer ordered and we have no grudge against them when they take to shooting at us we must shoot at them but to kill this sentry would be nothing short of murder  after waiting a few minutes longer dick said  we had better be off now if we were to wait longer we should have another fellow getting up  they rose quietly to their feet made their way to the door and opened it noiselessly the sentry was standing leaning on his long matchlock a few feet away suddenly a voice behind exclaimed who is that  the sentry was in the act of turning round when dick sprang upon him and grasped him by the throat no cry came from the mans lips but the gun fell from his grasp as he clutched convulsively at dicks wrists and went off as it fell  pick it up dick shouted and run  he released his grip from the mans throat snatched the bandolier from his shoulder and tripping his feet from under him threw him heavily to the ground and then turned to run  the whole had occupied but a few seconds but as he started a soldier ran out from the hut shouting loudly he had a gun in his hand dick changed his mind turned threw himself upon him wrenched the gun from his hold and as the man staggered back struck him with his right hand under the chin  the man fell back through the open door as if shot dick seized the handle and closed it and then ran at full speed towards the foot of the steps they were but some twenty yards away  up you go surajah we have not a moment to lose  dick sprang up the steps surajah following as they reached the top of the wall a shot was discharged at them by the sentry at the gate who ignorant of the cause of the sudden uproar had been standing in readiness to fire he was however too excited to take aim and the bullet flew harmlessly over their heads in another instant they sprang over the parapet  lower yourself by your arms and then drop  the wall like many others of its sort was thicker at the base than on the top and the foot projected two feet beyond the upper line so that it was a sharp slide rather than an absolute fall it was well that it was so for although only some twelve feet high inside it was eight feet higher on its outer face as a dry ditch encircled it both came down in a heap on the sand that had crumbled from the face of the wall  as soon as they picked themselves up dick exclaimed keep along the foot of the wall surajah and they dashed along until they reached the angle as they turned the corner they heard a burst of voices from the wall where they had slid down and several shots were fired dick led the way along the ditch to the next angle then left it and entered the village and dashed along the street  the sound of firing had roused many of the peasants doors were opening and men coming out exclamations of surprise were heard as the two figures rushed past but no one thought of interfering with them as they left the houses behind them surajah said  you are going the wrong way sahib you are going right away from the ghauts  i know that well enough dick panted but i did it on purpose we will turn and work round again they will hear from the villagers that we have come this way and will be following us down the road while we are making our way back to the ghauts  they ran for another hundred yards then quitted the path and made across the fields from the fort and village they could hear a great hubbub and above it could make out the voice of the officer shouting orders they continued to run for another quarter of a mile and then turned  now we can go quietly dick said breaking into a walk this line will take us clear of the fort and village and we have only to make straight for the ghauts i think we have thrown them well off the scent and unless the officer suspects that we have only gone the other way to deceive him and that we are really making for the ghauts we shall hear nothing more of them  it is capital surajah said i could not think what you were doing when you turned round the corner of the fort and made for the village instead of going the other way but where did you get that gun from  dick told him how it had come into his possession  it was not so much that i cared for the gun he said as that i wanted to prevent the man from using it if he had followed me closely he could hardly have helped hitting one of us as we went up the steps by shutting the door we gained a few moments for they were all in confusion in the dim light inside and would certainly not learn anything either from the man i pitched in among them or from the sentry outside  i dont suppose any of them had an idea of what had happened until the sentry shouted to them that we had got over the wall then they rushed up and fired at random from the top thinking that we should be running straight from it  they walked along for a short distance and then dick said  i have got my wind again now we will go on at a jog trot i mistrust that officer he had a crafty face and as we said we belonged to a village down the ghauts he may have a suspicion that we have been trying to throw him off our scent and think we should be sure to double back and make for home  they kept on their way sometimes dropping into a walk but generally going at an easy trot until day broke  as soon as it gets a little lighter surajah we will go up on to one of these rises so as to have a good look down over the line we have come if they are following us we must go on at the top of our speed if we see nothing of them we can take it quietly of course they cant have been following our steps but it is quite likely that some of the villagers may know that the ghauts can be climbed at the point where we came up you know we noticed signs of a path two or three times on the way up in that case if the officer really did think of pursuing us he would take one of the villagers as guide  half an hour later they ascended a sharp rise and threw themselves down on its crest  i dont think that there is the least chance of their coming surajah said carelessly when they had gone some distance without overtaking us on the road they may possibly have suspected that we had turned and made this way but by the time they got back to the village they would know well enough that there was no chance of overtaking us  dick made no answer he had a sort of uneasy conviction that the officer would at once suspect their plan and that pursuit would have commenced very shortly after they had repassed the fort for some minutes no words were spoken no sign of life was to be seen but in so broken a country covered in many places with jungle or wood a considerable body of men might be coming up unperceived  suddenly dick grasped surajahs arm  there they are you see that i was right look at that clump of bush half a mile away well to the left of the line we came by they have just come out from there there are ten or twelve of them  i see them surajah said they are running too but not very fast  we will crawl back till we are out of their sight and then make a run for it they must have got a guide and are no doubt taking a more direct line than we are for we may be a good bit off the stream we followed as we came along i have not seen anything i recognise since it got light though i am sure we have been going somewhere near the right direction now we have got to run for it  they dashed off at a rate of speed much higher than that at which they had before been travelling keeping as much as possible in ground covered from the sight of their pursuers and bearing somewhat to the left so as to place the latter directly behind them and to strike the path dick had no doubt their pursuers were keeping  it is no use running too fast he said a few minutes later there is a good long way to go yetanother ten miles i should think and anyhow i dont think we can get down that steep place before they come to the edge of the cliff above you see we are not certain as to where it is we might strike the cliffs a mile or two on either side of it and i have no doubt they will go straight to the spot i expect the man they have got as a guide has been in the habit of going down the ghauts and knows his way  if it were not that we are in such a hurry to get to uncle with the news about tippoo it would be much better to turn off altogether and stay in a wood for a day or two they would not stop very long at the top of the ghauts for they cannot be sure that we are going that way at all and when a few hours passed and we didnt come the officer would suppose that he was mistaken and that we really kept on in the line on which we started  they trotted along for some time in silence and then surajah said  do you not think that it would be better for us to make for the pass to the left it is twenty miles off but we should be there by the evening and we should surely find some way of getting into it below where the fort stands  dick stopped running  why not go the other way and make for the pass we know he said it cant be more than fifteen miles at the outside and once below the fort we know our way and should get down to the village twelve hours sooner than if we went round by the other pass  it would be the right plan if we could do it surajah agreed but you know the rocks rise straight up on both sides of the fort and the road passes up through a narrow cleft with the fort standing at its mouth that is why i proposed the other pass  i think we had better try it nevertheless surajah we should not be more than three hours in going straight there and shall have ample time to follow the edge of the precipice for the last five miles we may discover some break where we can get down if we should find it impossible to descend anywhere we must sleep till sunset then strike the road above the fort go down at night and manage to slip past the sentry  the only thing is sahib that it seemed as if the fort lay right across the entrance to the gorge and the road went through it  it did look like that surajah certainly the road went through a gateway but there must be a break somewhere we could see that in the wet season a lot of water comes down there so there must be some sort of passage for it and if the passage is big enough for the storm water to go through it must be big enough for us  surajah agreed and they turned off from the line that they had before been following no longer hurrying but walking at a leisurely pace they were not pressed for time there was no chance whatever of pursuit and as they had been going for some six hours at the top of their speed they were both feeling exhausted  after proceeding for two miles they came upon a small stream here they sat down lighted a fire mixed some flour and waterfor although the ghee had been taken from them when they were disarmed they had been allowed to retain their supply of flour for their sustenance in prisonand made some small cakes these they cooked in the glowing embers they could not be termed a success for the outside was burned black while the centre was a pasty mass however they sufficed to satisfy their hunger and after an hours rest they again went forward  it was not very long before they stood on the edge of the rock wall they followed this along but could nowhere find a spot where a descent seemed at all possible after walking for an hour they saw a road winding up a long valley below them  that is our road dick exclaimed that clump of houses surajah must be the one where we generally turned i know that from below these rocks looked as steep as walls so there is no chance of our finding a way down anywhere between this and the fort  surajah nodded to him also the ascent of the ghauts had seemed impracticable  it is no use following this line any more dick went on we may as well strike across until we come onto the edge of the pass somewhere above the fort find a place where we can descend easily and then lie down and sleep till it is time to make our attempt  in another hour they were looking down on the road a mile or so above the fort the slopes here were gradual and could be descended without the least difficulty even in the dark  there do you see surajah the water course runs along by the side of the road there is a little water in it now you know we used to meet with it down below and water our horses at a pool close to that ruined village when we start we can follow the road until we get close to the fort and then crawl along in the water course and take our chances if we should find it so blocked up that we cant get through we must then see how we can get past the place in some other way if the gate is only barred no doubt we should be able to overpower the sentry and get the gate open before any alarm is given if it is locked we must do the best we can we may calculate upon taking the sentry by surprise as we did in the prison and on silencing him at once then we should have time to break up some cartridges and pour the powder into the keyhole which is sure to be a big one make a slow match and blow the lock open we could make the slow match before we start if we had some water  shall i go down to the stream and get some  you have nothing to carry it up in surajah and besides someone might come along the valley  we shall only want a little water i will take off my sash and dip it in the stream that will give us plenty when it is wrung out  at any rate surajah we will do nothing until it is getting dusk see there are some peasants with three bullocks coming down the valley and there are four armed horsemen riding behind them we will go back to those bushes a hundred yards behind us and sleep there until sunset then we will make our way down to that heap of boulders close to the stream manufacture our slow match and hide up there until it is time to start we want a rest badly we did not sleep last night and if we get through we must push on tonight without a stop so we must have a good sleep now  the sun was low when they woke they watched it dip below the hills and then after waiting until it began to get dusk started for the valley no one was to be seen on the road and they ran rapidly down the slope until they reached the heap of boulders surajah tore off a strip of cotton six inches long by an inch wide from the bottom of his dress went forward to the stream and wetted it when he came back they squeezed the moisture from it broke up a cartridge rubbed the powder into the cotton and then rolled it up longways  that will be dry enough by the time we want to start dick said i hope we shant have to use it but if there is no other way we must do so  they remained where they were until they thought that the garrison of the fort would be for the most part asleep then they crossed the stream and walked along by the side of the road taking care not to show themselves upon it as their figures would be seen for a long distance on its white dusty surface presently the sides of the valley approached more closely to each other and just where they narrowed they could make out a number of dark objects which were they doubted not the houses occupied by the garrison they at once took to the bed of the stream stooping low as they went so that their bodies would be indistinguishable among the rocks  they could hear the murmur of voices as they passed through the village once beyond it they entered the gorge here there was but room enough for the road and the stream whose bed was several feet below the causeway a few hundred yards farther the gorge widened out a bit and in the moonlight they could see the wall of the fort stretching before them and a square building standing close to it  that is the guard house no doubt dick said in low tones it is too close to be pleasant if we have to attack the sentry  very carefully they picked their way among the rocks until close to the wall then dick gave a low exclamation of disappointment the stream ran through a culvert some twelve feet wide and ten feet high but this was closed by iron bars crossing each other at intervals of only five or six inches the lower ends of the perpendicular bars being fixed in a stone dam extending across the bed of the stream dick waded across the pool formed by the dam and felt the bars but found them perfectly solid and strong  it is no good surajah he said when he returned there is no getting through there there is nothing for it but the gate unless we can find the steps up to the top of the wall and get up unnoticed then we might tear up our sashes longways knot them together and slip down  the first thing to do is to have a look round i will get up close to the wall it is in shadow there  entering the pool again he climbed up the steep bank which was here faced with stones he stopped when his eyes were above the level and looked round there was the gate twelve feet away and to his delight no sentry was to be seen he was about to whisper surajah to join him when he heard voices they came from above and he at once understood that instead of a man being posted behind the gate two were on guard on the wall above it he beckoned to surajah to join him and when he did so whispered what he had discovered  if the gate is only barred we are all right now surajah except that we shall have to run the risk of being shot by those fellows on the wall we shall be a pretty easy mark on that white road by moonlight our only plan will be to keep close to the wall when we are through the gate get down into the bed of the stream again and then crawl along among the rocks the bottom will be in shadow and we may get off without being noticed the only fear is that we shall make a noise in opening the gate  now let us try it  keeping close to the wall they crept to the gateway this projected two feet beyond the gate itself and standing against the latter they could not be seen even in the unlikely event of one of the sentries looking down the only risk was of anyone in the guard house coming out this however could not be avoided and they at once began to examine the fastenings of the gate which consisted of two massive bars of wood running across it these by their united strength they removed one after another but when they tried it they found the gate still immovable  the beastly thing is locked dick said there is nothing to do but to blow it open  he broke off the ends of three cartridges poured the powder in at the keyhole and then inserted the slow match  stand in the corner there surajah i will go down to the stream again to light the tinder the noise is less likely to be heard there  he stole back again sat down at the edge of the water placed his tinder box in his lap took his turban off and put it over his hands so as to deaden the sound and then struck the steel sharply against the flint the first blow was successful the spark fell on the tinder and at once began to extend  he listened intently the men on the wall were still talking and the sound had evidently not reached their ears    chapter 7 besieged   dick hastily clambered up the wall ran to the gate blew the tinder and then applied it to the slow match a moment later this began to fizz  round the corner of the wall surajah he exclaimed running back himself  a few anxious seconds passed then came a sharp explosion in an instant they ran up the gate stood two or three inches open it yielded to a push and they ran out  loud shouts were heard from the men above and a hubbub of cries from the guard house  run surajah we must risk it keep on the edge of the road and dodge as you go the chances are they will run down below to see what has happened  at the top of their speed they dashed down the road no shot was fired from the wall dicks conjecture that the first impulse of the sentries would be to run down below having been justified they were a couple of hundred yards away before two shots were fired from the gate the bullets whistled by harmlessly  we are all right now dick cried they can scarcely see us and we shall soon be out of sight altogether  five or six more shots were fired a few seconds later as the men from the guard house reached the gate on looking back when they had gone another hundred yards they saw a number of figures on the road  not quite so fast surajah dick said it is going to be a long chase now we have got three hundred yards start and they wont be able to load again running at full speed  for a time their pursuers gained somewhat upon them then gradually they began to straggle as the effect of the speed at which they were running told upon them when they reached the ruined village there were four men running together some three hundred yards behind the rest were a considerable distance in the rear  another mile or two and they will all give up the chase except these four surajah and if they turn out better runners than we do we can make a stand there are some more huts another two miles farther and we will fight them there  they were going slower now for although the downward course of the road helped them a good deal the run was telling on them not a word was spoken until they reached the second village when they came to the first house they stopped simultaneously and looked round their pursuers were not more than two hundred yards behind them  in here surajah dick said as he ran into the ruined hut  its roof was gone its door hung loose on its hinges it had but one window a small one looking up the valley dick laid his gun on the sill which was nearly level with his shoulder  i must wait until they get pretty close he said for i am panting so that i cant keep the barrel steady even with this rest  i will kneel down outside surajah said  mind i will fire first surajah dont you fire until they are within twenty yards of you by that time i shall have loaded again  dick had more time than he had expected for as soon as their pursuers saw them enter the hut they slackened their pace considerably they were within about eighty yards when dick held his breath and standing for a moment immovable took a steady aim and fired  one of the men stumbled in his run took a step or two forward and then fell on his face the others paused for a moment and then with a fierce yell ran forward  the moment he had fired dick dropped the stock of his gun on to the ground snatched a cartridge from the bandolier bit off the end and emptied the powder into the barrel gave the gun a shake so as to be sure that it ran into the touch hole and then rammed down the bullet as he was in the act of doing so surajah fired and a loud yell told that his shot had been successful  dick sprang to the door as surajah entered two shots at the same instant rang out but at even so short a distance the bullets went wide dick stepped out and in turn fired one of the two men fell the other threw down his musket and fled up the road  thank goodness that is over dick exclaimed i thought they had no chance with us here now the first thing is to get our wind again  they stood for two or three minutes breathing heavily then as their breath came again they prepared to move when dick exclaimed suddenly what is that noise  there was a dull confused sound in the air and then surajah pointing up the road exclaimed cavalry  far away on the white road a dark mass could be seen at first dick instinctively turned to resume their flight but then he said  it is of no use surajah the sides of the valley are too steep to climb and they will be up in five or six minutes we must fight it out here run out to that man i shot and bring in his gun bandolier pistols if he has any and sword i will take them from these two it will make all the difference having spare weapons  surajah without a word hurried up the road while dick ran over to the house opposite which seemed to be larger than the one they had first entered he looked round it contained only one room but this was twenty feet square there were three small windows one looking into the street one looking up the valley and one behind the floor was littered with the beams of the roof the door was still in its place having ascertained this he ran back to the bodies of the two men picked up the three guns took off their bandoliers and removed the pistols from their sashes and with these and one of their swords returned to the house just as surajah came back  this is the best house to defend surajah there are some beams with which we can block up the door  laying down the arms inside they set to work with the beams and barricaded the door so firmly that short of its being splintered to pieces no entry could be effected this done they recharged the six guns examined the pistols and finding that they were loaded placed three of them in each of their sashes and hung the swords by their sides then they went to the window looking up the valley the horsemen some twenty in number were but a short quarter of a mile away and were coming along at a gallop  dont fire surajah dick said they will have heard from the man who has got away that we are in the house opposite and if they dont find us there they will think that we have gone on and will ride down the valley till they are sure they must be ahead of us then they will search the ground carefully as they come back and altogether we may gain an hour and every moment is of use it must be two oclock now and our troop generally gets here soon after seven  as he spoke the horsemen drew up in front of the opposite hut there was a momentary pause and then a voice said  it is empty  then followed the command  ride on men they cant have got very far we shall overtake them in ten minutes  as soon as they started dick said  take a ramrod surajah and make some holes through the walls to fire through if we were to show ourselves at the windows we might get shot  the walls were built of mud and clay and with the iron ramrods they had no difficulty in making four holes an inch wide and two inches high on each side of the house  now we are ready for them dick said when they had finished they have been gone half an hour and it wont be long before they are back  in a few minutes they heard the clatter of horses hoofs it ceased some forty or fifty yards away and by the sound of voices and orders it was evident that the other houses were being searched voices were also heard at the back of the house and they guessed that the ground was being closely examined up to the foot of the rock walls which enclosed the valley  now surajah you can take a shot from the window of that side the others will be here in a minute and it is just as well to let them know where we are before they get close up to our door  surajah went to the window at the back four horsemen were making their way at a walk along the level ground between the rocks and the huts the nearest was but some forty yards away surajah fired and the man at once fell from his horse the others instantly galloped on at full speed up the valley and from the window at the end surajah saw them gather on the road three or four hundred yards away and then after a short consultation cross to the other side of the valley with the intention he had no doubt of rejoining their comrades  the sound of the gun had been followed by shouts and exclamations from the party in the village dick could hear a conference in low tones then all was silent he went to the loophole at the corner laid his rifle in it and waited looking along the barrel two or three minutes later the hole was darkened and he fired at once there was a sound of a heavy fall followed by cries of rage and a moment later there was a rush of men against the door  surajah ran across two spare guns were pushed through the loopholes one on each side of it these had not been bored straight through the wall but at angles that would enable them to fire at anyone attacking it looking along the barrels each could see one of the group in front and fired at the same moment with a yell of rage and surprise the assailants of the door sprang back and ran down the street  there are four less anyhow dick said as he and surajah reloaded the empty guns those loopholes will puzzle them and i dont think they will care to come on again for a bit  there was a pause for some minutes and then from the huts opposite and from various points higher up the valley and behind a dropping fire was opened  keep out of the line of the windows whatever you do surajah and it will be just as well to lie down for a bit until we see whether any of their shots come through the wall i think we are quite safe from the distant fire but from the house opposite it is possible they may penetrate it anyhow dont stand in the line of a loophole a stray ball might find its way in  for a few minutes the enemy fired away unanswered and then dick who had been seated on the ground with his back against the end wall got up and went along that facing the street carefully examining it  i dont think any of their balls have come through surajah i should be able to see out into the moonlight if they had done so now it is time for us to be doing something i expect they are getting a little bolder and will perhaps give us a chance  you take this loophole it is exactly in a line with the opposite hut and the fellows in there must come to their door to fire i will take this slanting hole by the doorpost i can see one of the windows of the next hut to that we were in i have no doubt that they are firing from there also dont wait for them to shoot but fire directly a figure shows itself  in a very short time surajah fired dick heard the clatter of a gun as it fell to the ground  you have hit him surajah  yes but only wounded him i think i hit him on the shoulder he let his gun drop and ran into the house  take a spare gun at once if there are others there they will think that you are loading and may show themselves again  a moment later dick saw a gun thrust out through the window he was watching then the head and shoulders of a man appeared behind it he fired and the figure disappeared almost at the same instant surajah fired again  i had one that time sahib  it was now quiet for some little time then a horseman dashed suddenly past and galloped up the valley at full speed  the end window surajah bring him down if you can  surajah ran there and fired  i have missed him he said in a tone of deep disappointment  it does not make much difference if you had hit him they could have sent another off close to the opposite side of the valley there is no doubt as to what he has gone for you see they have lost six killed and one wounded and they must know that they have not the slightest chance of taking this hut i have no doubt that he has ridden back to bring down the infantry from the fort from the number of huts round the gate and the sound of talking i should think there were fifty or sixty at leastperhaps a hundred  if they send down fifty we shall have sharp work our difficulty will be to prevent them from making a rush at all the windows together if they were to get there they could riddle us with balls  could we block them up sahib  that is just what i was thinking dick replied we might try anyhow it will be an hour and a half before they are down here it must be past four now and in another hour daylight will begin to break  there is any amount of the old thatch down on the floor the best way would be to fill up the window holes with it first then to put two or three bits of wood across and a strong piece down behind it and to keep that in its place by wedging one of the long beams against it if they came up and tried to pull the thatch out we could fire through it with our pistols and we will make a loophole below each when we have got the work done  it was not so difficult a business as they thought it would be the windows were little more than a foot across and two feet high it was but the work of a few minutes to fill these up with the masses of thatch when this was done they picked out thick pieces of wood for crossbars then they took a beam eight feet long made a hole with their tulwars in the clay floor close to the wall put one end of the beam into it and reared it upright against the window dick held it in its place while surajah hacked a deep notch in ita by no means difficult matter for it was half rotten with exposure  the notch was cut just opposite the middle of the window the three crosspieces were then put into their place and the upright pressed firmly against them one end of a long beam was placed in the notch the other in a slight hole made in the ground thus forming a strut which held the rest firmly in their positions  that is a good job done dick said but a very hot one now surajah sharpen three or four pieces of wood and drive them down into the ground at the foot of that strut then it will be as firm as a rock  they then proceeded in the same way with the other two windows  it is getting light fast dick said as he wiped the perspiration from his face take a look out up the valley they ought to be coming by this time  surajah applied his eye to one of the loopholes  i can see them he said they are half a mile away there are two mounted men i expect one is their officer and the other the man who rode back to fetch them  let us set to work at the loopholes under the windows surajah it is most important to get them done you make the one at the end i will do that one looking into the street put it as close to the beam as you can  they worked hard and it was not long before the walls were pierced  now surajah you do the one at the back the fellows will soon be within range and i will give them a lesson to be careful they will naturally break up and go round behind the houses opposite as they can find shelter nowhere else and for a bit at any rate we shall get them all on one side of us which is what we want  dick carried the six guns to the end of the hut and then applied his eye to the loophole there the enemy were coming along at a run in a confused mass  i cant very well miss them he muttered to himself as he thrust his gun through a loophole and fired without waiting to see the result he thrust another gun out aimed and fired  never mind the hole surajah he said come here and reload  the four other shots were discharged in rapid succession the mysoreans at first opened an irregular fire on the hut when the sixth shot was fired they left the road in a body and ran across the valley leaving four of their number on the ground behind them  as soon as the guns were reloaded surajah returned to his work it was now broad daylight and the sun was shining upon the hilltops a quarter of an hour passed without a movement from the enemy dick and his companion occupied the time in further strengthening the door with crossbeams kept in their place by struts  if they break it to splinters dick said when they had finished they will hardly be able to force their way in for if they were to try to crawl in between those crossbeams they would be completely at our mercy  now we must get ready for a rush i expect they will come all together there are the six guns and three pistols each keep one of the latter in reserve we ought not to waste a shot and if they lose ten men i should think they will give up the attack on the door  stand clear of it surajah they will probably fire into it before they chargekeep down below the level of the loopholes  presently a volley of musketry was fired and the door was riddled by bullets then a number of figures sprang from between the two opposite houses and rushed at the door two of them carried a long heavy beam  two shots flashed out in return from the hut one of the men carrying the beam fell as did an officer who was leading them but instantly another caught up the end of the timber and in a moment a crowd were clustered round the door several caught hold of the beam and swung it as though they meant to use it as a battering ram  two more puffs of smoke spurted out from the loopholes and again two of the men fell the others however swung it forward with a crash against the door the end of the beam went right through the rotten woodwork dick and surajah fired their last musket shots with as deadly effect as before the next blow dashed the door from its hinges and split and shattered by the former shocks it fell forward into the road while a yell of triumph broke from the mysoreans  this died away however when they saw the three crossbars blocking their entrance again two pistol shots carried death among them  load your guns surajah  but before surajah had time to do so the mysoreans made a rush at the door the defenders stepped forward and fired between the crossbars and then drawing their tulwars ran the two men in front through the body as they dropped those behind them drew back  the last pistols dick shouted and they fired two shots into the crowd  this completed the consternation of the enemy it seemed to them that the defenders possessed an unlimited supply of firearms already twelve shots had been fired and not one had failed to take effect with a cry of consternation they fled down the street leaving the ground in front of the fatal door strewn with bodies  the defenders instantly set about the work of recharging their firearms they were not interrupted but presently an irregular fire opened upon them from the jungle that had taken the place of the garden between the opposite houses  we may as well lie down at full length dick said setting the example there is no use in running risks you keep that side and listen attentively it is likely enough that they will work round behind next time and try the windows by the way they are firing i fancy there are not more than five or six of them opposite  another half hour passed then surajah exclaimed i can hear them on this side  dick got up and crossed at once  i will take the loophole under this window you go to the one at the end i expect they will try both windows at once  dick placed the muzzle of his gun in the loophole and glancing along saw that something dark barred his view he fired at once there was a loud cry and a fall then a rush to the window and a moment later a hole appeared in the thatch dick discharged two pistols through it and as he did so surajah fired  the thatch was speedily pulled down as the enemy had learned to avoid the loopholes a yell of rage rose as the fallen thatch showed them that the window was defended with crossbars in the same way as the door immediately afterwards dick had a narrow escape from a shot fired through a loophole close to him  stoop down he cried and crouching below the level of the loopholes made his way to the end of the hut recharge the guns first surajah they may fire away through the loopholes as long as they like it is lucky we made them so high except the three under the windows we must be careful in keeping out of the line of those  you sit down where you can command the end window and the one behindi will watch the front window and door a bold fellow might put his musket through and pick one of us off and that is what we have to prevent so keep your gun in readiness and if you see a head appear dont miss it  the enemy now kept up a constant fire through the loopholes at the end and back of the house but as these were shoulder high and there was no altering the elevation of the guns the shots flew harmlessly over the heads of the defenders several times dick went to one or other of the loopholes pistol in hand and standing close beside it waited until a shot was fired and then thrusting the barrel into the loophole fired before another gun could be inserted the discharge being generally followed by a sharp cry of pain  after this had gone on for nearly an hour the assailants evidently became discouraged the shots came from the loopholes less frequently and presently ceased altogether  i would give a good deal to know what they are up to dick said after a long pause  shall i look through the loophole surajah asked  certainly not there will be a man standing at each of them waiting in expectation of our taking a look out  but there are none in front surajah said  that is more than we can say they have not been firing on that side but they may have men there now no we will leave well alone surajah the longer they delay the better for us  keep your eye on the top of the wall as well as on the window they may have made some ladders by this time and may intend to try a shot  perhaps they are gone surajah suggested  it is quite possible they must know that our troop comes up here early and as they have four miles to walk back to the fort and several wounded to carry with them they certainly wont stay much longerif as you say they have not gone already  it was indeed well that surajah had not attempted to look out at one of the loopholes for at the time he asked the question a dark figure was standing at each looking along the barrel of his gun in readiness to fire the moment the light was obscured  a few minutes later dick exclaimed  how stupid we can easily test whether there is any one there surajah and taking up a piece of thatch he pushed it suddenly across one of the loopholes  no shot followed the action and he went round the hut and repeated the experiment at each of them  they have all gone he said confidently had they been outside they would certainly have fired directly the light was obscured  standing a short distance back from the end window he looked out between the crossbeams  hurrah he shouted there they go up the road they are a quarter of a mile away they are not more than half as strong as they were when they came down they are carrying eight or ten figures on their shoulders on litters or doors  i dont see the cavalry surajah said as he joined him  no it is likely enough that they may be in hiding among the huts opposite and are waiting in hopes that we may be foolish enough to take it for granted that they are all gone and pull down the bars of the door i expect they will stay until they see our troop coming up the valley  they continued to look out from the window from which they had now removed the bars half an hour later dick exclaimed  there they go up that side of the valley i have no doubt they see our troop and that in a few minutes we shall hear them coming  it was not long before they heard a trampling of horses and a moment later the rajahs voice exclaimed  why what is this here are a dozen dead bodies they are mysoreans by their dress  all right uncle dick shouted we will be out as soon as we get these bars down we have been standing a siege  it did not take long to remove the bars the rajah and his men had dismounted as soon as some of the latter had gone round the hut and had brought back the report that there were five more dead on that side as dick and his companion stepped out the rajah exclaimed  what are you alone  yes there is no one with us uncle  do you mean to say that you two have defended this place alone and killed sixteen of the enemy besides some i see lying farther up the road  yes uncle you see it was a pretty strong position and we had time to block up the doors and windows and to make loopholes to fire through  what think you of that anwar the rajah exclaimed to the captain of the troop my nephew and rajbullubs son have shown themselves brave fighters have they not  it is wonderful the captain said and exclamations of admiration broke from the men standing round  tell us all about it dick the rajah went on  it is a long story uncle but the real news is that tippoo with his army has left the head of the western passes and has gone to seringapatam he is going to march down one of the passes this side at once provisions have been collected for his army to consume on the march no one knows yet which pass he will come down by but it will not be far from here for they are buying up cattle in the villages at the top of the ghauts  that is important indeed dick and we must ride off without delay but first i must have a look at this fortress of yours  he entered the hut the soldiers crowding in after him and examined the defences at the windows and the loopholes while dick explained how the bars had been arranged to defend the door  we began on the other side uncle we had a fight with four men who came up with us there only one of them got awayand he left his gun behind it was lucky for their guns and pistols were of immense use to us we could not have held out with only our own weapons  about twenty of their cavalry came up a few minutes afterwards we beat them off and then they sent up to the fort for infantry and about fifty men came down and attacked us just at sunrise they kept it up to within half an hour ago then the infantry marched back knowing of course that your troop generally got here about seven  the horsemen stayed here till within a few minutes of your arrival no doubt they thought that we should suppose they had all gone and might venture out and let them get a shot at us  why it must have been a veritable battle dick  there was a good deal of noise uncle though not much danger so long as we kept below the level of the loopholes and windows and out of the line of the door there was no chance of our being hit  they must have made a strong attack on the door the rajah said i see that the two lying next to it were both killed by sword thrusts  yes that was the most critical moment uncle we had emptied nearly all our barrels and if they could have broken down the bars which i have no doubt they could have done if they had stuck to it they would have made very short work of us  now let us be going the rajah said you can tell me the whole story as we go along  two of the sowars were ordered to give up their horses to dick and surajah and to mount behind comrades then they started down the valley dick riding between his uncle and the captain while surajah took his place with the two other officers of the troop they rode so rapidly that dicks story was scarcely concluded by the time they reached the village where the troops were quartered  well you have done marvelously well dick his uncle said surajah deserves the highest praise too now i will write a note to the british officer with the nabob giving the news of tippoos movements and will send it off by two of the troopers at once where colonel maxwells force is i have no idea it marched to join general meadows on the day we came up here  in the meantime you can have a wash while breakfast is being cooked i have no doubt that you are ready for it  i am indeed uncle we had nothing yesterday but a few cakes made of flour and water and have had nothing at all since  all right lad i will be ready almost as soon as breakfast is  after the meal was over the rajah lit his hookah and said  you must go through the story again this evening dick you cut short some of the details as you told it to me on the road and i want to understand it all thoroughly you had better turn in now for a long sleep you must want it badly enough lad after the work of the two last nights  dick slept until his uncle roused him at six oclock  dinner will be ready in ten minutes it is just as well that you should get up for two or three hours after that you will be good for another sleep till morning we shall have to look out sharp now and keep a couple of vedettes always at that village as for all we know this may be the pass by which tippoo is coming down  dick got up rather reluctantly but he was not long in shaking off his drowsiness and after dinner was able to go through the story again with full details of his adventures  i dont know what i should have done without surajah uncle he is a capital fellow and if ever i go up by myself into mysore to look for my father i hope that you will let me take him  that i will certainly do dick ever since i first heard of your plans i have quite decided that you ought not to go alone i daresay i should have chosen an older man to accompany you but after what you and the lad have done together i dont think you could do better than take him of course such an affair would demand infinitely greater caution and care though not greater courage than you had occasion to use on this excursion it is one thing to enter a village to ask a few questions make a purchase or two and be off again but it is a very different thing to be among people for weeks or perhaps months and to live as one of themselves however we may hope that this war will end in our army marching to seringapatam when we shall recover many of the prisoners in tippoos hands  i do not say all we know how many hundreds remained in his power last time in spite of his promise to deliver them all up and maybe something of the same sort will occur next time numbers may be sent away by him to the hill fortresses dotted all over the country and we should never be able to obtain news of them however we must hope for the best  the next morning the troopers arrived with a letter from the english resident at arcot the rajah glanced through it and handed it to dick with the remark  you will not get the honour you deserve dick  the letter ran  dear rajah  your news would be extremely valuable were it correct but unfortunately it is not so and doubtless the reports brought down by your nephew were spread by tippoo for the purpose of deceiving us or possibly he may have intended to have come that way but afterwards changed his mind we have news that just after colonel maxwell effected his junction with general meadows near caveripatam and was about to ascend the ghauts by the tapour pass tippoo came down by that very route slipped past them and is marching on to trichinopoly that being the case i see no further utility in your remaining with your troop in the passes but think it were best that you should reassemble them at once and march here there is no chance of tippoo capturing trichinopoly before meadows who is following him can come up and force on a battle so it is likely that the mysore army may continue their march in this direction in which case every fighting man will be of use to defend this place until it is relieved by the general  dick uttered an exclamation of disgust as he laid the letter down  it does not matter about my news turning out wrong he said but it is very bad that general meadows should have allowed tippoo to pass him as he may do frightful damage to the country before he can be overtaken  he never can be overtaken as long as he chooses to keep ahead he is hampered with no baggage train he lives on the plunder of the country he passes through and the british army with all its baggage and provision train has no more chance of overtaking him than it has of flying  messengers were at once sent off to call in the scattered portions of the troop these were assembled in twentyfour hours and at once started for arcot where they arrived after a two days march they there learned that tippoo had appeared before trichinopoly and after pillaging and laying waste the sacred island of seringham had marched north  day after day news arrived of the devastation he was committing on his march at thiagur however he met with a serious repulse great numbers of the inhabitants from the surrounding country had crowded into the town with their valuables and tippoo expecting a rich booty attacked the town but although its fortifications were insignificant the little garrison was commanded by captain flint the officer who had so bravely defended wandiwash in the previous war and two assaults were repulsed with serious loss  at trinalee thirtyfive miles farther north he was more successful capturing the town and putting the inhabitants to the sword here tippoo changed his course and marched for pondicherry capturing permacoil by the way  the news that tippoo had changed his course to the southeast was received with great joy at arcot although confident that this capital would be able to resist any sudden attack the belief had been general that the whole territory would be laid waste as it had been by hyder and hopes were now entertained that the british army would arrive in time to bar tippoos further progress    chapter 8 the invasion of mysore   for some time there was a pause in the hostilities tippoo remained with his army near pondicherry carrying on negotiations with the french governor and arranging for the despatch of an envoy to france with a request that the republic would furnish him with six thousand french troops while he was thus wasting his time general meadows was slowly moving with the army towards an encampment formed at vellout some eighteen miles west of madras  on the 14th of december a messenger arrived with the news that lord cornwallis had arrived from calcutta two days before with considerable reinforcements and that he was about to assume the supreme command of the army the news caused unbounded satisfaction by the extreme dilatoriness of his movements and especially by the manner in which he had allowed tippoo to pass him near caveripatam when he might easily have attacked him while his army was still struggling through the pass general meadows had disgusted his troops he had frittered away without striking a single blow the finest army that the british had up to that time ever put into the field in india and had enabled tippoo unmolested to spread destruction over a large extent of country  the only countervailing success that had been gained by the british was a brilliant victory won by colonel hartley who was in command of a bombay force consisting of a european regiment and two battalions of sepoys with these he engaged hossein ali who had been left by tippoo in malabar with a force of 9000 men when the sultan first retreated before general meadows advance this force was defeated with a loss of 1000 men killed and wounded 900 including hossein himself taken prisoners on the field and 1500 in the pursuit the total british loss being only 52 men a few days after this victory general abercrombie arrived from madras with reinforcements and the whole of tippoos fortified places in malabar were captured one after another and the entire province conquered  as soon as lord cornwallis reached the camp at vellout with a large train of draught animals that had been brought by sea from calcutta the rajah and his troops received orders to join him it was on the 29th of january 1791 that the commander in chief arrived at vellout and the rajah arrived there on the 4th of february as he was the bearer of a letter from the resident at arcot he was at once enabled to have an interview with lord cornwallis on finding that he could speak english the general received him with much courtesy  i am glad indeed to have a troop like yours with us rajah he said there are few of my officers who know anything of this part of the country and your local knowledge will be invaluable moreover as i do not speak the language myself it will be a great advantage to have someone with me through whom i can communicate freely with the people of the country there is no doubt that such communications are much more effectual when they come through one of their own princes than through english officers i shall therefore order that on the march a space be allotted for the encampment of your troop by the side of that occupied by my own escort and hope that when not employed on scouting or other duties you will ride with my staff  your mother rajah was an english lady i am told  she was sir my sister who married an englishman is at present in madras with my family and her son is with me  i beg to recommend him to your lordship he speaks my language perfectly and having been brought up in his fathers country naturally speaks english as well as hindustani and will understand far better than i can do any orders that you may give he has come out with his mother in the hopes of finding his father who has if alive been a prisoner for several years in the hands of tippoo  he is a fine young fellow the other day he made a most dangerous reconnaissance into mysore in order to ascertain tippoos movements he had with him a young officer of mine two or three years older than himself and when i tell you that the two young fellows held a ruined hut for hours against the attack of some seventy of tippoos troops and beat them off with a loss of upwards of twenty killed i need hardly say that he has no lack of courage  you are right indeed rajah let the lad ride beside you with my staff some day he will perhaps shorten a long days march by giving me details of this adventure of his  on the 5th of february the army started on its march and on the 11th reached vellore tippoo had for two months been wasting his time at pondicherry but upon hearing news that instead of as he expected the english general having marched south from vellout to meet him he had turned westward and that mysore itself was threatened with invasion he hastily broke up his camp and marched at full speed for the ghauts and reaching the table land hurried to oppose the british army as it endeavoured to ascend the pass going from vellore through amboor by which he made sure he would come  lord cornwallis encouraged him in the idea by sending a battalion a considerable distance up the pass while he started north and entered the easy pass of mooglee leading west from chittoor to moolwagle he pushed rapidly up the pass and gained the summit before tippoo could reach the spot and oppose him it took four days longer for the battering train baggage and provisions to reach the top of the pass after a delay of a day or two to rest the animals which included sixtyseven elephants which had been brought from bengal the army set out for bangalore the second largest town in mysore  the rajahs troops had been busily employed from the time the army moved from vellout the men on their tireless little horses carried his messages to the various divisions and brigades brought up news of the progress of the train or rode on ahead with the officers of the quartermasters department whose duty it was to precede the army to decide on the camping ground and to mark off the spots to be occupied by the various corps in this way they saved the regular cavalry from much fatiguing duty  surajah and dick were generally with the party that went on with the quartermasters and as soon as the camping ground was fixed upon aided them in the purchase of forage and food from the natives as it was most desirable that the forty days provisions the army carried with it should remain intact until the army had passed up the ghauts beyond that it was expected that it would be harassed by the mysore horse who would render it impossible for the cavalry to go out to collect forage or provisions from the country through which it marched  so well did the rajahs troop perform its duties that lord cornwallis ordered it to be taken on the strength of the army and to receive the pay and rations of native cavalry in the service on the day after leaving vellore the general sent an orderly to request the rajah and his nephew to ride with him  i have not had an opportunity of hearing of your scouting expedition he said to dick and shall be glad if you will give me full details of it  dick related the adventure from the time they had started  you were wonderfully lucky in getting back safely the general said when he had finished at least luck is not the proper word for your safety was due to your quick wittedness and courage and your escape with your companion from the guard house the manner in which you got through the fort in the pass and your defence of that hut until the rajahs troop arrived to your rescue were all of them admirably managed  he then proceeded to inquire further into the object for which dick had come out to india  i heartily wish you success in your search he said and sincerely hope we may obtain news of your father i do not know what your intentions may be afterwards but should you wish to enter the army i will at once nominate you to a commission in one of our native cavalry regiments  i am deeply obliged to your excellency dick replied but as if we learn nothing of my father during the war i am quite resolved to spend if necessary some years in mysore in the search for him i must therefore be free to devote my time to that  at any rate the general said if at any time you should feel free to accept my offer it will be open to you in the meantime i will appoint you one of the interpreters to the army during the expedition and will attach you to my own staff it will give you a recognised position and it is only right that as you are doing good service you should receive pay you shall be put in orders this evening you can of course continue to camp and live with the rajah  the change made very little difference in dicks duties and he continued at his former work in the quartermasters department until the army was ready for its advance to bangalore to the general surprise as the army moved forward nothing was seen of tippoos cavalry by which they had expected to be continually harassed the sultan had as soon as he perceived that bangalore was threatened hurried the whole army to that city where he had sent his harem when he started from seringapatam to attack travancore and instead of sending off a few hundred horsemen to escort them to the capital while with his army he opposed the advance of the british he took his whole force with him in order to remove his harem with all the pomp and ceremony with which their passage through the country was generally accompanied consequently it was not until after taking without resistance the forts of colar and ooscotah and arriving within ten miles of bangalore that the army encountered tippoos cavalry  this was on the 4th of march they made an attempt to reach the baggage trains but were sharply repulsed and on the following day the army took up its position before bangalore as they approached the town three horsemen dashed out from a small grove and rode furiously towards a little group consisting of lord cornwallis general meadows and the staff who were reconnoitring at some little distance from the head of the column it was evident that their intention was to cut down the general  the rajah who was riding as usual with the staff dashed forward with four or five other officers and encountered the horsemen before they could reach him the rajah cut down one of them another was killed by one of the staff and the third knocked off his horse and captured  it was learned that the enterprise was not a planned one but was the result of a quarrel between the men themselves one had charged the others with cowardice and in return they had challenged him to follow them where they dared go all had prepared themselves for the enterprise by half intoxicating themselves with bhang and thus made but a poor fight when they found their object thwarted by the officers who threw themselves between them and their intended victim  bangalore was a fine town situated on a plain so elevated that the climate was temperate the soil fertile and vegetation abundant the town was of considerable extent that portion lying within the fortifications being a mile and a quarter long by half a mile broad it was surrounded by a strong rampart a thick hedge and a deep dry ditch the wall however did not extend across the side facing the fort whose guns were supposed to render it ample protection  the fort was oval in shape and about nine hundred yards across at its greatest diameter it was defended by a broad rampart strengthened by thirty semicircular bastions and five outworks the two gates one at each end were also protected by outworks in the fort stood the splendid palace built by tippoo here also were immense foundries of cannon factories for muskets the arsenal and large magazines of grain and ammunition  the position taken up by the army lay to the northeast of the petah or town and the next morning a reconnoitring party escorted by colonel floyd with the whole of the cavalry and a brigade of infantry went out to examine the defences of the town and fort seeing a large body of laden elephants and camels escorted by a strong body of horsemen colonel floyd rode with the cavalry to attack them the movement was a rash one as the guns on the fort opened fire and although at first he defeated the mysore horse a heavy fire was poured upon him when entangled in broken ground he himself was shot by a musket ball which striking him in the face passed through both jaws it was at first believed that he was dead but he was carried back to camp and ultimately recovered this rash attack cost the lives of seventyone men and of four times as many horses  as tippoos army was lying at a distance of only six miles away the general determined that it would be best in the first place to capture the town without delay and to assault the fort on that side as he could then do so without any fear of an attack by tippoo who would be able to harass him constantly were he to approach the fort from any other direction orders were therefore issued for the 36th regiment supported by the 26th bengal sepoys and a party of artillery under colonel moorhouse to prepare to storm the north gate of the town at daybreak the next morning  as soon as dawn broke the troops rushed forward against the gate the outside work was speedily stormed but as they issued from it towards the gate itself they were received with a very heavy fire from the walls together with a storm of hand grenades colonel moorhouse brought forward a six pounder receiving two wounds as the piece was run up to the gate the first time it was fired it had no effect beyond making a small hole and the next shot had no greater success colonel moorhouse ordered a twelvepounder to be brought up but as he was aiding to put it into position another ball struck him and he fell dead  while the artillerymen were pouring shot after shot into the gate the roar of musketry was unceasing the 36th keeping up an incessant fire upon the enemy upon the wall in order to cover as much as possible the operations of the gunners at last the gate gave way the troops poured in cheering loudly and the enemy at once fled  many however took up their positions in the houses and kept up a galling fire until their places of refuge were stormed by detachments of troops scattered through the town by nine oclock all was over and the town completely in the possession of the british  tippoo furious at its having been so speedily captured moved down early in the afternoon with a strong force of infantry and marching along by the side of the fort endeavoured to force his way into the town through the open space at that end he was aided by the guns of the fort while his artillery kept up a heavy cannonade upon the british encampment  when the sultan was seen marching towards the town with the evident intention of endeavouring to retake it the 76th regiment was sent in to reinforce the garrison and the three battalions opposed so steady a resistance to tippoos infantry that the latter were forced to fall back after sustaining a loss of five hundred men the troops began next morning to erect batteries  the position was a singular one a small army was undertaking the siege of a strong fortress while an army vastly outnumbering it was watching them and was able at any moment to throw large reinforcements into the fort through the mysore gate which was at the opposite end of the fort to that attacked the efforts of the british being directed against the delhi gate which faced the town  the advantage which had been gained by the employment of the great train carrying the provisions for the troops was now manifest for unless the army had been so provided it would have been forced to retreat as in the face of tippoos army with its great host of cavalry it would have been impossible to gather provisions  the first batteries erected by the engineers proved to be too far distant from the wall of the fort to effect any material damage and others were commenced at a much shorter range the work was performed with great difficulty for the guns of the defenders were well served and a storm of missiles were poured night and day into the town and against the batteries the garrison which consisted of eight thousand men were frequently relieved by fresh troops from the sultans army and were thus able to maintain their fire with great vigour  on the 17th tippoo cannonaded the british camp from a distance but without doing great damage in the meantime the fire of our siege guns was steadily doing its work in spite of the heavy fire kept up on them the stone facing of the bastion next to the gateway was soon knocked away but the earth banks behind which were very thick and constructed of a tough red clay crumbled but slowly still the breach was day by day becoming more practicable and tippoo alarmed at the progress that had been made moved his army down towards the east side of the fort and seemed to meditate an attack upon our batteries he placed some heavy guns behind a bank surrounding a large tank and opened some embrasures through which their fire would have taken our trenches which were now pushed up close to the fort in flank  lord cornwallis at once directed a strong force to advance as if with the intention of attacking the new work and tippoo ordered his troops to retire from it it was evident however that he had determined to give battle in order to save the fort and the english general therefore determined to storm the place that very night the 21st of march the preparations were made secretly lest the news should be taken to tippoo by one of the natives in the town and it was not until late in the evening that orders were issued to the troops which were to take part in the assault  the column was to be composed of the grenadier and light companies of all the european regiments and these were to be followed and supported by several battalions of sepoys the force commanded by colonel maxwell at eleven oclock issued from the town and advanced through the trenches the besieged were vigilant and the instant the leading company sprang from the trenches and in the bright moonlight ran forward to the breach a number of blue lights were lighted all along the ramparts and a heavy musketry fire was opened  the scene was eagerly watched by the troops in the camp every feature being distinctly visible the storming party could be seen rushing up the breach and mounting by ladders over the gateway which was the central object of attack the enemy gathered in masses at the top of the breach but as soon as the stormers collected in sufficient strength and charged them with the bayonet they broke and dispersed  the grenadiers moved along the ramparts to the right clearing it of its defences as they went along the light companies did the same along the ramparts to the left while the sepoys descended into the body of the fort the whole of the defenders fled towards the mysore gate at the other end of the fort and when the three bodies of troops met there they found the gate blocked by the masses of fugitives  they charged them on all sides the governor a brave old soldier and a great favourite of the sultan died fighting gallantly to the last six hundred of the garrison fell and three hundred for the most part wounded were taken prisoners the british loss was only fifty officers and men killed and wounded  the body of the governor was found next morning among the slain and lord cornwallis sent a message to tippoo with an offer to have the body carried to his camp for burial tippoo however replied that the proper place for a soldier to be buried was where he fell and accordingly the brave old soldier was laid to rest in the fort by the mohammedan troops in the sepoy regiments with all military honours  while the assault was going on tippoowho in spite of the precautions taken had received news of the intention of the general and had warned the garrison of the fort to be prepareddespatched two heavy columns as soon as the fire opened to attack the british camp on its flank the movement had been foreseen and prepared against and the attacks were both repulsed with heavy loss  the capture of the fort was effected but just in time for the provisions were almost entirely consumed and the scanty rations were eked out by digging up the roots of grasses and vegetables within the circuit of our pickets the draught and carriage cattle were dying daily by hundreds the few remaining intended for food were in so emaciated a state that the flesh was scarcely eatable and worst of all the supply of ammunition was almost exhausted  the news of the fall of the fortress considered by the natives to be almost impregnable under the very eyes of the sultan himself and his great army produced a widespread effect greatly depressing the spirit of tippoos adherents while it proportionately raised those of the british troops and excited the hopes of the peoples conquered by tippoo and his father one result was that the polagars or chiefs of a tribe that had but recently fallen under the yoke of mysore were at once emboldened to bring in provisions to the town as great stores were found in the magazines in the fort the starving animals regained some of their condition during the ten days that the troops were occupied in repairing the breaches burying the dead and placing the fort in a condition to stand a siege should tippoo return during the absence of the army  when this was done and the stores of ammunition replenished from the magazines the army started on its march north to deonhully where they were to effect a junction with the cavalry that the nizam had agreed to furnish as it marched it passed within three miles of tippoos army which was proceeding in a westerly direction tippoo could here have brought on a general engagement had he wished it but the capture of bangalore had for the time cowed his spirit and he continued his march at a rate that soon placed him beyond the reach of the british  at deonhully a junction was effected with the nizams horse ten thousand in number these proved however of no real utility being a mere undisciplined herd who displayed no energy whatever except in plundering the villagers the united force now moved southeast to guard a great convoy which was advancing up the pass of amboor and when this had been met returned to bangalore  during the operations of the siege the rajahs troop had remained inactive and dicks duties as interpreter had been nominal at bangalore no english prisoners had been found and he was heartily glad when he heard that it was the intention of lord cornwallis to march directly upon seringapatam  it was indeed a necessity for the english general to bring the campaign to a speedy termination the war was entailing a tremendous strain upon the resources of the company the nizam and mahrattis were not to be depended upon in the slightest degree and might at any moment change sides the french revolution had broken out and all europe was alarmed and many of the english regiments might at any moment be ordered to return home therefore anything like a thorough conquest of mysore was impossible and there was only time to march to seringapatam to capture tippoos capital and to dictate terms to him  immense exertions were made to restore the efficiency of the baggage train and on the 3rd of may the army marched from bangalore  tippoo devoured alike by rage and fear had taken no efficient steps to meet the coming storm his first thought was to prevent the english from discovering the brutal cruelty with which his white captives had been treated he had over and over again given the most solemn assurances that he had no white prisoners in his hands and he now endeavoured to prevent their obtaining evidence of his falsehood and cruelty by murdering the whole of those who remained in his hands at seringapatam having effected this massacre he next ordered all the pictures that he had caused to be painted on the walls of his palace and other buildings holding up the english to the contempt and hatred of his subjects to be obliterated and he also ordered the bridge over the northern loop of the cauvery to be destroyed he then set out with his army to bar the passage of the british to seringapatam  the weather was extremely bad when the british started rain storms had deluged the country and rendered the roads well nigh impassable and the movement was in consequence very slow tippoo had taken up a strong position on the direct road and in order to avoid him lord cornwallis took a more circuitous route and tippoo was obliged to fall back  the whole country through which the english passed had been wasted the villages were deserted and not an inhabitant was to be met with suffering much from wet and the immense difficulties of bringing on the transport the army on the 13th of may arrived on the cauvery nine miles east of seringapatam here it had been intended to cross the river but the rains had so swollen the stream that it was found impossible to ford it it was therefore determined to march to a point on the river ten miles above seringapatam where it was hoped that a better ford could be found and where a junction might be effected with general abercrombies bombay army which was moving up from the malabar coast and was but thirty or forty miles distant  to effect this movement it was necessary to pass within sight of the capital tippoo came out and took up a strong position on a rugged and almost inaccessible height in front was a swamp stretching to the river while batteries had been thrown up to sweep the approaches  by a night march accomplished in the midst of a tremendous thunder and rain storm lord cornwallis turned tippoos position the confusion occasioned by the storm however and the fact that several of the corps lost their way prevented the full success hoped for from being attained and gave tippoo time to take up a fresh position  colonel maxwell led five battalions up a rocky ledge held by a strong body of the mysore troops carried it at the point of the bayonet and captured some guns tippoo immediately began to fall back but would have lost the greater portion of his artillery had not the nizams horse moved forward across the line by which the british were advancing here they remained in an inert mass powerless to follow tippoo and a complete barrier to the british advance so unaccountable was their conduct that it was generally believed in the army that it was the result of treachery and it was with difficulty that the british troops could be restrained from firing into the horde of horsemen who had from the time they joined the force been worse than useless  as soon as the british could make their way through or round the obstacle to their advance they pursued the retreating force of tippoo until it took refuge under the guns of the works round seringapatam their loss had been 2000 that of the british 500  but the success was of little benefit to the latter the terrible state of the roads and the want of food had caused the death of great numbers of draught animals and the rest were so debilitated as to be absolutely useless and during the two days marches that were required to reach the point on the river previously determined upon the battering train and almost the whole of the carts were dragged along by the troops  the position of the army was bad in the extreme neither food nor forage were to be obtained from the country round the troops were almost on famine rations worn out by fatigue and by the march through heavy rains and nights spent on the sodden ground tippoos horsemen hovered round them the cavalry of the nizam which had been specially engaged to keep the foe at a distance never once ventured to engage them it was absolutely impossible to communicate with general abercrombie and after remaining but a couple of days in his new camp lord cornwallis felt that the army could only be saved from destruction by immediate retreat  no time was lost in carrying out the decision when once arrived at some natives were paid heavily to endeavour to make their way to abercrombie with orders for him to retire down the ghauts again into malabar then the whole of the battering train and the heavy equipments were destroyed and on the 26th of may the army started for its long march back to bangalore  it had made but six miles when a body of horsemen some two thousand strong were seen approaching preparations were instantly made to repel an attack when a soldier rode in and announced that the horsemen were the advance party of two mahratta armies close at hand this was welcome news indeed for lord cornwallis had no idea that the mahrattis were within two hundred miles of him and had come to believe that they had no intention whatever of carrying out their engagements  they had it appeared sent off a messenger every day to inform him of their movements but so vigilant were tippoos cavalry that not one of them ever reached the british in a few hours the junction was completed and the sufferings of the army were at an end stores of every kind were abundant with the mahrattis and not only food but clothing and every necessary of life could be purchased in the great bazaars occupied by the mahratta traders who accompanied the army  had the two mahratta armies arrived a couple of days earlier the destruction of the siege train would have been avoided seringapatam would have been besieged abercrombies army of eight thousand men have joined and the war brought at once to a conclusion it was now however too late the means for prosecuting the siege of so powerful a fortress were altogether wanting and the united armies returned by easy marches to bangalore  on the march the future plan of operations was decided upon lord cornwallis sent orders for the sum of 1500000 rupees that had been intended for china to be at once despatched to bangalore for the use of the army and the allies the larger of the mahratta forces under purseram bhow with a detachment of bombay troops that had accompanied it were to march to the northwest and reduce some of the forts and towns still held by the troops of mysore the other mahratta force consisting chiefly of cavalry under hurry punt were to remain at bangalore  the cause of the long delay on the part of the nizam and the mahrattis was now explained the nizams troops had spent six months in the siege of the fortress of capool while an equal time had been occupied by purseram bhow in the siege of durwar a very strong place garrisoned by ten thousand men  tippoo began negotiations immediately after his defeat near seringapatam and these were continued until july when they were finally broken off some months were occupied in reducing a number of the hill forts commanding the entrances to the various passes among these two deemed absolutely impregnable savandroog and nundidroog were captured but the attack upon kistnagherry was repulsed with considerable loss  by the capture of these places lord cornwallis obtained access to supplies from the malabar and carnatic coasts and was thus free from the risk of any recurrence of the misfortunes that had marred his previous attempt to lay siege to seringapatam and on the 5th of february 1792 he again came within sight of tippoos capital    chapter 9 news of the captive   during the nine months that had elapsed since the retreat from before seringapatam dick had been occupied in following out the main object of his presence in mysore finding that purseram bhows army was the first that would be engaged in active service he asked permission from the general to join it this was at once granted and lord cornwallis introduced him to the officer in command of the bombay troops attached to that army informing him of the object that he had in view  he will not be of much use as an interpreter he said for as the country in which you are going to operate formed until lately a part of the mahratta dominions mahratti will be principally spoken he will therefore go simply as an officer of my staff attached for the present to your command he has asked me to allow him to take with him twenty men belonging to the troop of his uncle the rajah of tripataly his object in doing so is that he will be able to traverse the country independently and can either rejoin me here or go to one of the other columns operating against the hill forts if it should seem to him expedient to do so should you desire to make a reconnaissance at any time while he is with you you will find him useful as an escort and will not be obliged to ask purseram bhow for a party of his cavalry  dick was sorry to leave his uncle whose tent he had now shared for the last ten months he found himself however very comfortable with the bombay troops being made a member of the mess consisting of the officer in command and the four officers of his staff wishing to have some duties with which to occupy himself he volunteered to act as an aidedecamp and although the work was little more than nominal it gave him some employment when not otherwise engaged he generally rode with surajah whom his uncle had appointed to command the twenty troopers  in the year that had elapsed since his arrival in india dick had grown considerably and broadened out greatly and was now a powerful young fellow of over seventeen he had since the troop joined the army of lord cornwallis exchanged his civilian dress for the undress uniform of an officer which he had purchased at the sale of the effects of a young lieutenant on the generals staff who had died just as the army arrived before bangalore it was indeed necessary that he should do this riding about as he did either on the staff of the general or with the officers of the quartermasters department there would be no difficulty in renewing his uniform for hardship fever and war had carried off a large number of officers as well as men and the effects were always sold by auction on the day following the funeral  many hill fortresses were captured by the mahrattis but few offered any resistance as their commanders knew well that there was no chance of their being relieved while the men were in most cases delighted at the prospect of an escape from their enforced service and of freedom to return to their homes in a few of these forts english captives were found some had been there for years their very existence being apparently forgotten by the tyrant some had been fairly treated by the mysore governor and where this was the case the latter was furnished by the british officers with papers testifying to the kindness with which they had treated the prisoners and recommending them to the officers of any of the allied forces they might encounter on their way home or when established there  upon the other hand some of the prisoners were found to have been all but starved and treated with great brutality in two cases where the captives said that some of their companions had died from the effects of the ill treatment they had received the governors were tried by court martial and shot while some of the others they sentenced to be severely flogged  every captive released was closely scrutinised by dick and eagerly questioned from one of them he obtained news that his father had certainly been alive four years previously for they had been in prison together in a hill fort near bangalore  i was a civilian and he a sailor he said consequently neither of us were of any use in drilling tippoos battalions and had been sent up there your father was well then the governor was a good fellow and we had nothing much to complain of mr holland was a favourite of his for being a sailor he was handy at all sorts of things he could mend a piece of broken furniture repair the lock of a musket and make himself generally useful he left there before i did as the governor was transferred to some other forti never heard where it wasand he took your father with him i dont know whether he had tippoos orders to do so or whether he took him simply because he liked him  at any rate he was the only prisoner who went with him the rest of us remained there till a few months back when the fort was abandoned it was just after the capture of bangalore and the place could have offered no resistance if a body of troops had been sent against it at any rate an order arrived one morning and a few hours afterwards the place was entirely abandoned and we and the garrison marched here  my father was quite well  quite well he used to talk to me at times of trying to make his escape being a sailor i have no doubt that he could have got down from the precipice on which the fort stood but he knew that if he did so we should all suffer for it and probably be all put to death as soon as tippoo heard that one of us had escapedfor that was always done in order to deter prisoners from trying to get away  do you think that there is any chance of his being still alive  that is more than i can possibly say you see we have not known much of what is passing outside our prison some of the guards were good natured enough and would occasionally give us a scrap of news but we heard most from the illtempered ones who delighted in telling us anything they knew that would pain us  three or four months ago we heard that every white prisoner in seringapatam had been put to death by tippoos orders and that doubtless there would be a similar clearance everywhere else then again we were told that the english had retreated beaten from before seringapatam and that the last of them would soon be down the ghauts but whether the prisoners have been killed in other hill forts like this i cannot say although i suppose not or we should not have escaped  certainly no such orders can have been sent to the forts here for we have found a few prisoners in several of them of course it may be otherwise in the forts near the capital which tippoo might have thought were likely to fall into our hands while he may not have considered it worth while to send the same orders to places so far away as this where no british force was likely to come still at any rate it is a great satisfaction that my father was alive four years ago and that he was in kind hands that is all in favour of my finding him still alive in one of the places we shall take for lord cornwallis intends to besiege some of the fortresses that command the passes because he cannot undertake another siege of seringapatam until he can obtain supplies freely and regularly from beyond the ghauts as nothing whatever can be obtained from the country round so completely is it wasted by tippoos cavalry i have therefore great hopes that my father may be found in one of these forts  i hope indeed that you may find him i am convinced that the governor would save his life if he could do so though on the other hand he would i am sure carry out any order he might receive from tippoo of course he may not be in charge of a fort now and may have been appointed colonel of one of the regiments however it is always better to hope that things will come as you wish them however unlikely it may seem that they will do so we have been living on hope here though the chances of our ever being released were small indeed of course we did not even know that tippoo and the english were at war until we heard that an english army was besieging bangalore and even then we all felt that even if tippoo were beaten and forced to make peace it would make no difference to us he kept back hundreds of prisoners when he was defeated before and would certainly not surrender any he now holds unless compelled to do so and no one would be able to give information as to the existence of captives in these distant forts  and yet in the teeth of all these improbabilities we continued to hope and the hopes have been realised  the capture of forts by the mahratta army was abruptly checked having so far met with such slight opposition purseram bhow became over confident and scattered his force over a wide extent of country in order that they might more easily find food and forage in this condition they were suddenly attacked by tippoo who took advantage of the english being detained at bangalore while the transport train was being reorganised to strike a blow at the mahrattis  the stroke was a heavy one many of the detached parties were completely destroyed and the mahratta general after gathering the rest to his standard was forced to retreat until strong reinforcements were sent him from bangalore  learning from them that it was probable lord cornwallis would advance as soon as they rejoined him dick determined to go back to bangalore as it was unlikely that after the severe check they had received the mahrattis would resume the offensive for a time  surajah and the men were glad to return to the troop and as soon as the mysorean force returned to seringapatam dick without waiting for the infantry to get in motion rode rapidly across the country with his little party  he accompanied the english army during their operations obtaining permission to go with the columns engaged in the siege of the hill fortresses and was present at the capture of all the most important strongholds to his bitter disappointment no english prisoners were found in any of them and it was but too certain that all who might have been there had been massacred by tippoos orders on the first advance of the british against seringapatam  great indeed was the satisfaction of the army when they at last came in sight of the city the capital of mysore stood on an island in the river cauvery this was four miles in length and two in breadth the town stood in its centre the fort at the northern end the island was approached by two bridges one close to the fort the other at the south both being defended by strong batteries there were also three fords two of these being at the north end of the island and also defended by batteries the third was near the centre of the island a mile below the fort and leading to the native town  the fort was separated from the rest of the island by a deep ditch cut across it it was defended by numerous batteries there were two gardens on the island full of large trees one of them being the burial place of hyder ali this was connected with the fort by two avenues of trees the country round was flat a considerable portion being almost level with the river and devoted to the cultivation of rice while at other points a forest extended almost to the bank  after obtaining a view from some high ground of the city and of tippoos army encamped beyond its walls the british force took up its position six miles to the northwest of the city no sooner had the army reached their camping ground than lord cornwallis with his staff reconnoitred the approaches  a thick hedge formed by a wide belt of thorny shrubs interlaced and fastened together by cords extended from the bank of the river about a thousand yards above seringapatam and making a wide sweep came down to it again opposite the other end of the island  it was within the shelter of this formidable obstacle that tippoos army was encamped within the enclosed space were seven or eight eminences on which strong redoubts had been erected fearing that tippoo might as soon as he saw the position taken up by the assailants sally out with his army take the field and as before cut all his communications lord cornwallis determined to strike a blow at once  at sunset orders were accordingly issued for the forces to move in three columns at three oclock by which time the moon would be high enough to light up thoroughly the ground to be traversed the centre column consisting of 3700 men under lord cornwallis himself was to burst through the hedge at the centre of the enemys position to drive the enemy before them and if possible to cross the ford to the island with the fugitives  this however was not to be done until the centre column was reinforced by that under general meadows which was to avoid a strong redoubt at the northwest extremity of the hedge and entering the fence at a point between the redoubt and the river drive the enemy before it until it joined the centre column colonel meadows had 3300 under his command the left column consisting of 1700 men under colonel maxwell was first to carry a redoubt on carrygut hill just outside the fence and having captured this to cut its way through the hedge and to cross the river at once with a portion of the centre column  unfortunately owing to a misunderstanding as to the order the officer guiding general meadows column instead of taking it to a point between the northwestern redoubt and the river led it directly at the fort this was stoutly defended and cost the british eighty men and eleven officers leaving a strong garrison here the column advanced but came upon another redoubt of even greater strength and magnitude and the general fearing that the delay that would take place in capturing it would entirely disarrange the plan of the attack thought he had better make his way out through the hedge march round it to the point where the centre column had entered it and so give lord cornwallis the support he must need opposed as he was to the whole army of tippoo  in the meantime colonel maxwells force had stormed the work on carrygut hill and had made its way through the hedge suffering heavily as it did so from the fire of a strong body of the enemy concealed in a water course the head of the centre column under general knox after cutting its way through the hedge pushed on with levelled bayonets thrust its way through the enemys infantry and mingling with a mass of fugitives crossed the main ford close under the guns of the fort and took possession of a village half way between the town and the fort  unfortunately in the confusion but three companies had followed him the rest of the regiment and three companies of sepoys crossed lower down and gained possession of a palace on the bank of the river the officer in command however not knowing that any others had crossed and receiving no orders waited until day began to break he then recrossed the river and joined lord cornwallis a portion of whose column having been reinforced by maxwells column crossed the river nearly opposite the town  as they were crossing a battery of the enemys artillery opened a heavy fire upon them but colonel knox with his three companies charged it in the rear drove out the defenders and silenced the guns  all this time lord cornwallis was with the reserve of the central column eagerly waiting the arrival of general meadows division this in some unaccountable way had missed the gap in the hedge by which the centre column had entered and marching on halted at last at carrygut hill where it was not discovered until daylight  the mysore army on its left was still unbroken and had been joined by large numbers of troops from the centre on discovering the smallness of the force under lord cornwallis they attacked it in overwhelming numbers led by tippoo himself the british infantry advanced to meet them with the bayonet and drove them back with heavy loss they rallied and returned to the attack again and again but were as often repulsed continuing their attacks however until daylight when lord cornwallis discovering at last the position of general meadows joined him on carrygut hill  when day broke the commanders of the two armies were able to estimate the results of the nights operations on the english side the only positions gained were the works on carrygut hill the redoubt at the northwest corner of the hedge another redoubt captured by the centre column and the positions occupied by the force under colonels stuart and knox at the eastern end of the island  the sultan found that his army was much reduced in strength no less than twentythree thousand men being killed wounded or missing of these the missing were vastly the most numerous for ten thousand chelahs young hindoos whom tippoo had carried off in his raids and forced to become soldiers and nominally mohammedans had taken advantage of the confusion and marched away with their arms to the forest of coorg  tippoo made several determined efforts to drive colonel stuarts force off the island and to recapture the redoubts but was repulsed with such heavy loss that he abandoned the attempt altogether evacuated the other redoubts and brought his whole army across on to the island  tippoo now attempted to negotiate he had already done so a month before but lord cornwallis had refused to accept his advances saying that negotiation was useless with one who disregarded treaties and violated articles of capitulation  send hither he wrote the garrison of coimbatoor and then we will listen to what you have to say  lord cornwallis alluded to the small body of troops who under lieutenants chalmers and nash had bravely defended that town when it had been attacked by one of tippoos generals the gallant little garrison had surrendered at last on the condition that they should be allowed to march freely away this condition had been violated by tippoo and the garrison had been marched as prisoners to seringapatam the two officers had been kept in the fort but most of the soldiers and twentyseven other european captives who had lately been brought in from the hill forts were lodged in the village that colonel knox had first occupied on crossing the river and had all been released by him some of these had been in tippoos hands for many years and their joy at their unexpected release was unspeakable  preparations were now made for the siege general abercrombie was ordered up with a force of six thousand men but before his arrival lieutenant chalmers was sent in with a letter from tippoo asking for terms of capitulation negotiations were indeed entered into but doubting tippoos good faith the preparations for the siege were continued and upon the arrival of general abercrombies force on the 15th of february siege operations were commenced at the end of the island still in british possession  a few days afterwards the army was astounded at hearing that the conditions had been agreed upon and that hostilities were to cease at once so great was the indignation indeed that a spirit of insubordination and almost mutiny was evinced by many of the corps they had suffered extreme hardships had been engaged in most arduous marches had been decimated by fever and bad food and they could scarce believe their ears when they heard that they were to hold their hands now that after a years campaigning seringapatam was at their mercy and that the man who had butchered so many hundred english captives who had wasted whole provinces and carried half a million people into captivity who had been guilty of the grossest treachery and whose word was absolutely worthless was to escape personal punishment  still higher did the indignation rise both among officers and men when the conditions of the treaty became known and it was discovered that no stipulation whatever had been made for the handing over of the english prisoners still in mysore previous to a cessation of hostilities this condition at least should have been insisted upon and carried out previous to any negotiations being entered upon  the reasons that induced lord cornwallis to make this treaty when seringapatam lay at his mercy have ever been a mystery tippoo had proved himself a monster unfitted to live much less to rule and the crimes he had committed against the english should have been punished by the public trial and execution of their author to conclude peace with him now was to enable him to make fresh preparations for war and to necessitate another expedition at enormous cost and great loss of life tippoo had already proved that he was not to be bound either by treaties or oaths and lastly it would have been thought that as a general lord cornwallis would have wished his name to go down to posterity in connection with the conquest of mysore and the capture of seringapatam rather than with the memorable surrender of york town the greatest disaster that ever befell a british army  the conditions were in themselves onerous and had they been imposed upon any other than a brutal and faithless tyrant might have been deemed sufficient tippoo was deprived of half his dominions which were to be divided among the allies each taking the portions adjacent to their territory a sum of 3300000 pounds was to be paid for the expenses of the war all prisoners of the allied powers were to be restored  two of tippoos sons were to be given up as hostages even after they had been handed over there were considerable delays before tippoos signature was obtained and it was not until lord cornwallis threatened to resume hostilities that on the 18th of march a treaty was finally sealed of the ceded territory the mahrattis and the nizam each took a third as their share although the assistance they had rendered in the struggle had been but of comparatively slight utility it may indeed be almost said that it was given to them as a reward for not accepting the offers tippoo had made them of joining with him against the british  the british share included a large part of the malabar coast with the forts of calicut and cananore and the territory of our ally the rajah of coorg these cessions gave us the passes leading into mysore from the west on the south we gained possession of the fort of dindegul and the districts surrounding it while on the east we acquired the tract from amboor to caroor and so obtained possession of several important fortresses together with the chief passes by which hyder had made his incursions into the carnatic  dick felt deeply the absence of any proviso in the treaty that all prisoners should be restored previous to a cessation of hostilities at the same time admitting the argument of his uncle that although under such an agreement some prisoners might be released there was no means of insuring that the stipulation would be faithfully carried out  you see dick no one knows or has indeed the faintest idea what prisoners tippoo still has in his hands we do not know how many have been murdered during the years tippoo has reigned men who have escaped have from time to time brought down news of murders in the places where they had been confined but they have known little of what has happened elsewhere moreover we have learned that certainly fifty or sixty were put to death at seringapatam before we advanced upon it the first time we know too that some were murdered in the hill forts that we have captured but how many remain alive at the present time we have not the slightest idea tippoo might hand over a dozen and take a solemn oath that there was not one remaining and though we might feel perfectly certain that he was lying we should be in no position to prove it  the stipulation ought to have been made if only as a matter of honour but it would have been of no real efficiency of course if we had dethroned tippoo and annexed all his territory we should undoubtedly have got at all the prisoners wherever they were hidden but we could hardly have done that it would have aroused the jealousy and fear of every native prince in india it would have united the nizam and the mahrattis against us and would even have been disapproved of in england where public opinion is adverse to further acquisitions of territory and where people are of course altogether ignorant of the monstrous cruelties perpetrated by tippoo not only upon english captives but upon his neighbours everywhere  naturally i am prejudiced in favour of this treaty for the handing over of the country from amboor to caroor with all the passes and forts will set us free at tripataly from the danger of being again overrun and devastated by mysore my people will be able to go about their work peacefully and in security free alike from fear of wholesale invasion or incursions of robber bands from the ghauts all my waste lands will be taken up my revenue will be trebled  there is another thing now that the english possess territory beyond that of the nabob of arcot and are gradually spreading their power north there can be little doubt that before long the whole country of arcot travancore tanjore and other small native powers will be incorporated in their dominions arcot is powerless for defence and while during the last two wars it has been nominally an ally of the english the nabob has been able to give them no real assistance whatever and the burden of his territory has fallen on them they took the first step when at the beginning of the present war they arranged with him to utilise all the resources and collect the revenues of his possessions and to allow him an annual income for the maintenance of his state and family this is clearly the first step towards taking the territory into their own hands and managing its revenues and the same will be done in other cases  lord cornwallis the other day in thanking me for the services that you and i and the troop have rendered promised me that an early arrangement should be made by which i should rule tripataly under the government of madras instead of under the nabob this you see will be virtually a step in rank and i shall hold my land direct from the english instead of from a prince who has become in fact a puppet in their hands  a few days later the army set off on its march from mysore and the same day the rajah after making his adieus to lord cornwallis started with his troop for tripataly making his way by long marches instead of following the slow progress of the army after a couple of days at tripataly they went down to madras and brought back the rajahs household  the meeting between dick and his mother was one of mixed feeling it was twenty months since the former had left with his uncle and he was now nearly eighteen he had written whenever there was an opportunity of sending any letters and although his position as interpreter on the staff of the general had relieved her from any great anxiety on his account she was glad indeed to see him again  upon the other hand the fact that as the war went on and fortress after fortress had been captured no news came to her that her hopes had been realised and that the war had now come to a termination without the mystery that hung over her husband being in any way cleared up had profoundly depressed mrs holland and it was with mingled tears of pleasure and sorrow that she fell on his neck on his return to madras  you must not give way mother dick said as she sobbed out her fears that all hope was at an end remember that you have never doubted he was alive and that you have always said you would know if any evil fate had befallen him and i have always felt confident that you were right there is nothing changed i certainly have not succeeded in finding him but we have found many prisoners in some of the little outoftheway forts now some of them have been captives quite as long as he has therefore there is no reason whatever why he should not also be alive i have no thought of giving up the search as hopeless i mean to carry out our old plans and certainly i am much better fitted to do so than i was when i first landed here i know a great deal about mysore and although i dont say i speak the dialect like a native i have learnt a good deal of it and can speak it quite as well as the natives of the ghauts and outlying provinces surajah who is a great friend of mine has told me that if i go he will go too and that will be a tremendous help anyhow as long as you continue to believe firmly that father is still alive i mean to continue the search for him  i do believe that he is alive dick as firmly as ever i have not lost hope in that respect it is only that i doubt now whether he will ever be found  well that is my business mother as long as you continue to believe that he is still alive i shall continue to search for him i have no other object in life at present it will be quite soon enough for me to think of taking up the commission i have been promised when you tell me that your feeling that he is alive has been shaken  mrs holland was comforted by dicks assurance and confident tone and putting the thought aside for a time gave herself up to the pleasure of his return they had found everything at tripataly as they had left it for the mysore horsemen had not penetrated so far north before tippoo turned his course east to pondicherry the people had months before returned to their homes and avocations  one evening the rajah said as they were all sitting together  i hear from my wife dick that your mother has told her you still intend to carry out your original project  yes uncle i have quite made up my mind as to that there are still plenty of places where he may be and certainly i am a good deal more fitted for travelling about in disguise in mysore than i was before  the rajah nodded  yes i think dick you are as capable of taking care of yourself as anyone could be i hear that surajah is willing to go with you and this will certainly be a great advantage he has proved himself thoroughly intelligent and trustworthy and i have promised him that someday he shall be captain of the troop you are not thinking of starting just yet i suppose  no uncle i thought of staying another month or two before i go off again mother says she cannot let me go before that  i fancy it will take you longer than that dick before you can pass as a native  dick looked surprised  why uncle i did pass as a native eighteen months ago  yes you did dick but for how long you went into shops bought things chatted for a short time with natives and so on but that is not like living among them you would be found out before you had been a single day in the company of a native  dick looked still more surprised  how uncle what do i do that they would know me by  it is not what you do dick but it is what you dont do you cant sit on your heelssquat as you call it that is the habitual attitude of every native he squats while he cooks he squats for hours by the fire smoking and talking he never stands for any length of time and except upon a divan or something of that sort he never sits down before you can go and live among the natives and pass as one for any length of time you must learn to squat as they do for hours at a stretch and i can tell you that it is not by any means an easy accomplishment to learn i myself have quite lost the power i used to be able to do it as a boy but from always sitting on divans or chairs in european fashion i have got out of the way of it and i dont think i could squat for a quarter of an hour to save my life  dicks mother and cousins laughed heartily but he said seriously you are quite right uncle i wonder i never thought of it before it was stupid of me not to do so of course when i have been talking with surajah or other officers by a camp fire i have sat on the ground but i see that it would never do in native dress i will begin at once  wait a moment dick the rajah said there are other things which you will have to practise you may have to move in several disguises and must learn to comport yourself in accordance with them you must remember that your motions are quicker and more energetic than are those of people here your walk is different the swing of the arms your carriage are all different from theirs you are unaccustomed to walk either barefooted or in native shoes now all these things have to be practised before you can really pass muster therefore i propose that you shall at once accustom yourself to the attire which you can do in our apartments of an evening the ranee and the boys will be able to correct your first awkwardness and to teach you much  after a week or two you must stain your face arms and legs and go out with rajbullub in the evening you must keep your eyes open and watch everything that passes and do as you see others do when rajbullub thinks that you can pass muster you will take to going out with him in the daylight and so you will come in time to reach a point that it will be safe for you to begin your attempt  do not watch only the peasants there is no saying that it may not be necessary to take to other disguises observe the traders the soldiers and even the fakirs you will see that they walk each with a different mien the trader is slow and sober the man who wears a sword walks with a certain swagger the fakir is everything by turns he whines and threatens he sometimes mumbles his prayers and sometimes shrieks at the top of his voice  when you are not riding or shooting lad do not spend your time in the garden or with the women go into the town and keep your eyes open bear in mind that you are learning a lesson and that your life depends upon your being perfect in every respect  as to your first disguise i will speak to rajbullub and he will get it ready by tomorrow evening the dress of the peasant of mysore differs little from that here save that he wears rather more clothing than is necessary in this warm climate    chapter 10 in disguise   on the following evening dick appeared in the room where the others were sitting in the dress rajbullub had got for him and which was similar to that of other peasants the boys had already been told that he was shortly going on a journey and that it would be necessary for him to travel in disguise but had been warned that it was a matter that was not to be spoken of to anyone the early respect that dicks strength and activity had inspired them with had been much shaken when they discovered that he was unable either to ride or shoot but their fathers narrative of his adventures when scouting with surajah had completely reinstated him in their high opinion  when he entered however they burst out laughing the two ladies could not help smiling and dick was not long before he joined in the laugh against himself he had felt uncomfortable enough when he started in an almost similar dress with surajah although there was then no one to criticise his appearance but now in the presence of his mother and aunt he felt strangely uncomfortable  never mind dick his uncle said encouragingly the boys would feel just as uncomfortable as you do now if they were dressed up in european fashion now while we are talking make your first attempt at sitting on your heels  dick squatted down until his knees nearly touched his chest and a moment later lost his balance and toppled over amid a roar of laughter next time he balanced himself more carefully  that is right dick you will get accustomed to it in time but you must see already that there is a good deal more to be done than you thought of before you can pass as a native remember you must not only be able to balance yourself while sitting still but must be able to use your handsfor cooking purposes for example for eating or for doing anything there may be to donot only without losing your balance but without showing that you are balancing yourself  it is much more difficult than i thought uncle of course i have always seen the natives squatting like this but it seemed so natural that it never struck me it was difficult at all i say it is beginning to hurt already my shin bones are aching horribly  yes that is where the strain comes my boy but you have got to stick to it until your muscles there which have never been called into play in this way before get accustomed to the work  i understand that uncle it was just the same with my arms when i began to climb but i cant stand this any longer i can no more get up than i can fly and dick rolled over on to his side  again and again he tried after a short rest between each trial as he gave it up and limped stiffly to the divan he said  i feel as if some one had been kicking me on the shins until he had nearly broken them mother i have been kicked pretty badly several times in fights by rough fellows at home in shadwell but it never hurt like this and he rubbed his aching legs ruefully  well uncle i am very much obliged to you for putting me up to practising this position it seemed to me that it would be quite a simple thing to walk along quietly and to move my arms about as they do but i never thought of this  i wonder mother you never told me that above all things i should have to learn to squat on my heels for any time it would not have been so difficult to learn it five or six years ago when i was not anything like so heavy as i am now  it never once occurred to me dick i wish it had i thought i had foreseen every difficulty but it never once came into my mind that in order to pass as a native you must be able to sit like one  ah well i shall learn in time mother dick replied cheerfully every exercise is hard at first but one soon gets accustomed to it  dick threw himself with his usual energy into his new work although of a morning when he first woke his shins caused him the most acute pain he always spent half an hour in practice afterwards he would sit for some time allowing the water from the tap at the side of the bath to flow upon the aching muscles then he would dress and as soon as breakfast was over go for a run in the garden at first it was but a shamble but gradually the terrible stiffness would wear off and he would return to the house comparatively well  of an evening the practice was longer and was kept up until the aching pain became unendurable at the end of four or five days he was scarcely able to walk at all but after that time matters improved and three weeks later he could preserve the attitude for half an hour at a time  in other respects his training had gone on uninterruptedly every day he went out into the town accompanied sometimes by rajbullub sometimes by surajah in the disguises of either a peasant a soldier or a trader and learnt to walk and carry himself in accordance with his dress before putting on these disguises he painted himself with a solution that could easily be washed off on his return to the palace where he now always wore a european dress  you cannot be too careful the rajah said there are of course mohammedans here and for aught we know some may act as agents or spies of tippoo just as the english have agents and spies in mysore were one of them to send word that you had taken to indian attire and that it was believed that you were about to undertake some mission or other it would add considerably to your difficulties and dangers as it is no one outside our own circle ever sees you about with me or the boys except in your european dress and rajbullub tells me that in no single instance while you have been in disguise has any suspicion been excited or question asked by the people of various classes with whom you and he converse in the streets  another month passed and by this time dick could without any great fatigue squat on his heels for an hour at a time as the date for his departure drew near his mother became more and more nervous and anxious  i shall never forgive myself if you do not come back she said one day when they were alone i cannot but feel that i have been selfish and that really on the strength of a conviction which most people would laugh at as whimsical and absurd i am risking the substance for a shadow and am imperilling the life of my only boy upon the faint chance that he may find my husband i know that even your uncle although he has always been most kind about it and assisted in every way in his power has but little belief in the success of your search although as he sees how bent i am upon it he says nothing that might dash my hopes  if evil comes of it dick i shall never forgive myself i shall feel that i have sacrificed you to a sort of hallucination  i can only say mother dick replied that i came out here and entered into your plans only because i had the most implicit faith that you were right i should now continue it on my own account even if tomorrow you should be taken from me of course i see plainly enough that the chances are greatly against my ever hearing anything of father but from what has taken place during the campaign i have seen that there must be many british captives still hidden away among the hill forts and it is quite possible he may be among them i do not even say that it is probable but the chances are not so very greatly against it and even if i thought they were smallermuch smaller than i believe them to bei should still consider it my duty to go up and try and find him so even if it should happen that i never come back again you will not have yourself to blame for it is not you that are sending me but i who am going of my free will and indeed i feel it so much my duty that even were you to turn round now and ask me to stay i should still think it right to undertake this mission  but indeed mother i see no great danger in it in fact scarcely any danger at allat any rate unless i find father if i do so there might certainly be risk in attempting to get him away but this if i am lucky enough in discovering him will not weigh with me for an instant if i do not find him it seems to me that the risk is a mere nothing surajah and i will wander about enlisting in the garrisons of forts then if we find there are no prisoners there we shall take an early opportunity of getting away in some places no doubt i shall be able to learn from men of the garrison whether there are prisoners without being forced to enter at all for although in the great forts like savandroog and outradroog it is considered so important the defences should be kept secret that none of the garrison are allowed to leave until they are discharged as too old for service there is no occasion for the same precaution in the case of less important places thus you see we shall simply have to wander about keeping our eyes and ears open and finding out either from the peasants or the soldiers themselves whether there are any prisoners there  i wish i could go with you dick i used to think that when the work of searching for your father had begun i could wait patiently for the result but instead of that i find myself even more anxious and more nervous than i was at shadwell  i can quite understand mother that it is very much more trying work sitting here waiting than it is to be actively engaged the only thing is that you must promise me not to trouble more than you can help for if i think of you as sitting here fretting about me i shall worry infinitely more than i otherwise should over any difficulties we may have to encounter you must remember that i shall have surajah with me he is a capital companion and will always be able to advise me upon native business he is as plucky as a fellow can be and i can trust him to do anything just as i would myself  the preparations for departure now began in earnest there was some discussion as to the arms that were to be taken but at last it was decided that with safety they could carry nothing beyond a matchlock a pistol and a sword each  great pains were taken in the selection of the matchlocks in the armoury were several weapons of high finish with silver mountings that had belonged to the rajahs father and grandfather these were tried against each other and the two that were proved to be the most accurate were chosen dick found indeed that at distances up to a hundred yards they were quite equal to the english rifle he had brought out the silver mountings were taken off and then the pieces differed in no way in appearance from those in general use among the peasantry  the pistols were chosen with equal care the swords were of finely tempered steel the blades being removed from their jewelled handles for which were substituted rough handles of ordinary metal  ten gold pieces were sewn up underneath the iron bands encircling the leathern scabbard as many under the bosses of their shields and five pieces in the soles of each of their shoes in their waist sashes the ordinary receptacle of money each carried a small bag with native silver coins  at last all was ready and an hour before daybreak dick took a cheerful farewell of his mother and a hearty one of his uncle and with surajah passed through the town and struck up into the hills each carried a bag slung over his shoulder well filled with provisions a small water bottle and hung upon his matchlock a change of clothing in the folds of his turban dick had a packet of the powder used for making dye so that he could at any time renew the brown shade when it began to fade out  for a time but few words were spoken dick knew that although his mother had borne up bravely till the last she would break down as soon as he left her and the thought that he might never see her again weighed heavily upon him surajah on the contrary was filled with elation at the prospect of adventures and dangers and he was silent simply because he felt that for the present his young lord was in no humour for speech  as soon as the sun rose dick shook off his depression they were now a considerable distance up the hillside there was no path for the people of tripataly had no occasion to visit mysore and still less desire for a visit from the mysoreans periodically raids were made upon the villages and plains by marauders from the hills but these were mostly by the passes through the ghauts thirty or forty miles left or right from the little state which nestling at the foot of the hills for the most part escaped these visitationswhich now that the british had become possessed of the territories and the hills had it was hoped finally ceased nevertheless the people were always prepared for such visits every cultivator had a pit in which he stored his harvest except so much as was needed for his immediate wants the pit was lined with mats others were laid over the grain two feet of soil was then placed over the mats and after the ground had been ploughed there was no indication of the existence of the hiding place  the town itself was surrounded by a wall of sufficient strength to withstand the attacks of any parties of marauders and the custom of keeping a man on a watch tower was still maintained at the foot of the tower stood a heavy gun whose discharge would at once warn the peasants for miles round of an enemy calling those near to hasten to the shelter of the town while the men of the villages at a distance could hurry with their wives and families to hiding places among the hills  dick and surajah had no need of a path for they were well acquainted with the ground and had often wandered up nearly to the crest of the hills in pursuit of game an hour before noon they took their seats under a rock that shaded them from the suns rays and sitting down partook of a hearty meal there was no occasion for haste and they prepared for rest until the heat of the day was passed  we are fairly off now surajah dick said as he stretched himself out comfortably i have been thinking of this almost as long as i can remember and can hardly believe that it has come to pass  i have thought of it but a short time my lord  no no surajah dick interrupted you know it was arranged that from the first you were to call me purseram for unless you get accustomed to it you will be calling me my lord in the hearing of others  i had forgotten surajah replied with a smile and then went on it is but a short time since i was sure i was going with you but i have ever hoped that the time would come when instead of the dull work of drilling men and placing them on guard i might have the opportunity of taking part in war and adventure and indeed had thought of asking my lord your uncle to permit me to go away for a while in one of the companys regiments and there to learn my business since the english have become masters and there is no longer war between rajah and rajah as there used to be in olden times this is the only way that a man of spirit can gain distinction but this adventure is far better for there will be much danger and need for caution as well as courage  dick nodded  more for caution and coolness than for courage i think surajah it will only be in case we find my father or if any grave suspicion falls on us that there will be need for courage once well into mysore i see but little chance of suspicion falling upon us we have agreed that we will first make for seringapatam avoiding as much as possible all places on the way where inquiries whence we come may be made of us once in the city we shall be safe from such questions and can travel thence where we will and it will be hard if we do not when there manage to learn the places at which any prisoners there may be are most likely to be kept  besides my father is as likely to be there as anywhere for tippoo may since our army marched away have ordered all prisoners to be brought down from the hill forts to seringapatam  when the sun had lost its power they proceeded on their way again their start had been timed so that for the first week they would have moonlight and would therefore be able to travel at night until they arrived at seringapatam it was considered that it was only necessary to do this for the first two or three nights as after that the tale that they were coming from a village near the frontier and were on their way to join tippoos army would seem natural enough to any villagers who might question them  they continued their course until nearly midnight by which time they were both completely fatigued and choosing a spot sheltered by bushes lay down to sleep it took another two days before they were clear of the broken country and the greater portion of this part of the journey they performed in daylight occasionally they saw in the distance the small forts which guarded every road to the plateau to these they always gave a very wide berth as although according to the terms of peace they should all have been evacuated they might still be occupied by parties of tippoos troops  indeed all the news that had arrived since the army left represented tippoo as making every effort to strengthen his army and fortresses and to prepare for a renewal of the war  several times they saw bears which abounded among the ghauts and once beheld two tigers crossing a nullah they had however other matters to think of and neither the flesh nor the skins of the bears would have been of any use to them the work was severe and they were glad when at last they reached the level country in some of the upper valleys opening on to this they had seen small villages near one of these they had slept and as in the morning they saw that the inhabitants were hindoos they fearlessly went out and talked with them in order to gain some information as to the position of the forts and to learn whether any bodies of tippoos troops were likely to be met with  they found the people altogether ignorant on these matters they were simple peasants their whole thoughts were given to tilling their land and bringing in sufficient to live upon and to satisfy the demands of the tax gatherers when they visited them they had little communication with other villages and knew nothing of what was passing outside their own they evinced no curiosity whatever concerning their visitors who bought from them some cakes of ground ragee which formed the chief article of their food  the country through which they passed on emerging from the hills was largely covered with bush and jungle and was very thinly populated it was an almost unbroken flat save that here and there isolated masses of rock rose above it these were extremely steep and inaccessible and on their summits were the hill forts that formed so prominent a feature in the warfare of both mysore and the nizams dominions to the north these forts were for the most part considered absolutely impregnable but the last war with the british had proved that they were not so as several of the strongest had been captured with comparatively slight loss  whenever they passed within a few miles of one of these hill fortresses dick looked at it with anxious eyes for there for aught he knew his father might be languishing  after two days walking across the plain they felt that there was no longer any necessity for concealment except that it would be as well to avoid an encounter with any troops although therefore they avoided the principal roads they kept along beaten paths and did not hesitate to enter villages to buy food  they no longer saw caste marks on the foreheads of the inhabitants the hindoos had been compelled by force to abandon their religion all who refused to do so being put to death at once dick and surajah found that their dialect differed much more from that of the country below the ghauts than they had expected and although they had no difficulty in conversing with the peasants they found that their idea that they would be able to pass as natives of one of these villages was an altogether erroneous one  this will never do surajah dick said as they left one of the villages we shall have to alter our story somehow for the first person we meet in seringapatam will see that we are not natives of mysore we must give out that we come from some village far down on the ghautsone of those which have been handed over to the english by the new treaty you know the country well enough there to be able to answer any questions that may be asked we must say that desiring to be soldiers and hating the english raj we have crossed the hills to take service of some sort in mysore this will be natural enough and of course there are many mohammedans down in the plains especially among the villages on the ghauts  i think that would be best purseram  there is one comfort dick went on it is evident that tippoo is hated by all the hindoos he has forced them to change their religion and we need have no fear of being betrayed by any of them except from pressure or from a desire to win tippoos goodwill  yes that might be the case with those who are fairly well off but would scarcely be so among the poorer classes besides even they were we living among them would have no reason for suspecting our story there seems no doubt from what they say that tippoo is preparing for war again and i think that we shall do well as soon as we enter the city to change our attire or we might be forced into joining the army which would be the last thing we want what i should desire above all things is to get service of some kind in the palace  after six days travel they saw the walls of seringapatam dick had made many inquiries at the last halting place as to the position of the fords on that side of the town and learned that only those leading to the fort were guarded the ford opposite the town was freely open to traffic and could be crossed without question by country people although a watch was kept to see that none of the very numerous prisoners escaped by it  it was here therefore that they crossed the river the water being little more than knee deep no questions were asked by the guard as they passed their appearance differing in no way from that of the peasants of the neighbourhood  after a quarter of a miles walk they entered the town it was open and undefended by a wall the streets were wide and laid out at right angles the shops however were poor for the slightest appearance of wealth sufficed to excite the cupidity of tippoo or his agents and the possessor would be exposed to exorbitant demands which if not complied with would have entailed first torture and then death  the streets however presented a busy appearance they were thronged with soldiers battalions of recruits passed along and it was evident that tippoo was doing all in his power to raise the strength of his army to its former level they wandered about for some time and at last in a small street dick went up to an old man whose face pleased him he was standing at the door of his house  we desire to find a room where we can lodge for a time he said can you direct us where we can obtain one  you are not soldiers the old man asked  no we desire to earn our living but have not yet decided whether to join the army  you are from the plains the native said sharply in their own dialect  that is so dick replied  and yet you are mohammedans  every one is mohammedan here  ah because it is the choice of death or mohammed how comes it that two young men should voluntarily leave their homes to enter this tigers den you look honest youths how come you here  i trust that we are honest dick said we have assuredly not ventured here without a reason and that reason is a good one but this is not a city where one talks of such matters to a stranger in the street even though his face tells one that he can be trusted with a secret  the old man was silent for a minute then he said  come in my sons you can as you say trust me i have a room that you can occupy  they followed him into the house and he led them into a small room at the back it was poorly furnished but was scrupulously clean a pan of lighted charcoal stood in one corner and over this a pot of rice was boiling  i bid you welcome he said gravely  and as the salutation was not one in use by the mohammedans dick saw that his idea that the old man was a hindoo who had been forced to abjure his religion was a correct one the old man motioned to them to take their seats on the divan  i do not ask for your confidence he said but if you choose to give it to me it will be sacred and it may be that poor as i am i am able to aid you i will tell you at once that i am a native of conjeveram and of course a hindoo i was settled as a trader at mysore the old capital but when four years ago the tyrant destroyed that town i with over a hundred thousand of our religion was forced to adopt mohammedanism i was of high caste and like many others would have preferred death to yielding had it not been that i had a young daughter and for her sake i lived and moved here from mysore  i gained nothing by my sin i was one of the wealthiest traders in the whole city and i had been here but a month when tippoos soldiers burst in one day my daughter was carried off to the tigers harem and i was threatened with torture unless i divulged the hiding place of my money  it was useless to resist my wealth was now worthless to me and without hesitation i complied with their demands and all i had was seized save one small hoard which was enough to keep me thus to the end of my days my wants are few a handful of rice or grain a day and i am satisfied i should have put an end to my life were it not that according to our religion the suicide is accursed and moreover i would fain live to see the vengeance that must some day fall upon the tyrant  after what i have said it is for you to decide whether you think i can be trusted with your secret for i am sure it is for no slight reason that you have come to this accursed city  dick felt that he could safely speak and that he would find in this native a very valuable ally he therefore told his story without concealment except that an exclamation of surprise broke from his lips when dick said that he was english the old man listened without a remark until he had finished  your tale is indeed a strange one he said when he had heard the story i had looked for something out of the ordinary but assuredly for nothing so strange as this truly you english are a wonderful people it is marvellous that one should come all the way from beyond the black water to seek for a father lost so many years ago methinks that a blessing will surely alight upon such filial piety and that you will find your father yet alive  were it not for that i should deem your search a useless one thousands of englishmen have been massacred during the last ten years hundreds have died of disease and suffering many have been poisoned many officers have also been murdered some of them here but more in the hill forts for it was there they were generally sent when their deaths were determined upon  still he may live there are men who have been here as many years and who yet survive  then this is where the main body of the prisoners were kept dick asked  yes all were brought here native and english tens of thousands of boys and youths swept up by tippoos armies from the malabar coast and the carnatic were brought up here and formed into battalions and these english prisoners were forced to drill them it was but a poor drill i have seen them drilling their recruits at conjeveram and the difference between the quick sharp order there and the listless command here was great indeed consequently the englishmen were punished by being heavily ironed and kept at starvation point for the slackness with which they obeyed the tyrants orders sometimes they were set to sweep the streets sometimes they were beaten till they well nigh expired under the lash often would they have died of hunger were it not that tippoos own troops took pity on them and supplied them from their store  some of the boys drummer boys or ships boys or little ships officers were kept in the palace and trained as singers and dancers for tippoos amusement very many of the white prisoners were handed over to tippoo by admiral sufferin though how a christian could have brought himself to hand over christians to this tiger i cannot imagine  others were captured in forays and there were till lately many survivors of the force that surrendered in hyders time there are certainly some in other towns for it was the policy of hyder as it is of tippoo always to break up parties of prisoners many were sent to bangalore some to burrampore and very many to the fort of chillembroom but i heard that nearly all these died of famine and disease very quickly  while tippoo at times considers himself strong enough to fight the english and is said to aim at the conquest of all southern india he has yet a fear of englishmen and he thus separates his captives lest if they were together they should plot against him and bring about a rising he knows that all the old hindoo population are against him and that even among the mohammedans he is very unpopular the chelah battalions who numbered twelve or fourteen thousand made up entirely of those he has dragged from their homes in districts devastated by him would assuredly have joined against him were there a prospect of success just as they seized the opportunity to desert six months ago when the english attacked the camp across the river  now if you will tell me in what way i can best serve you i will do so in the first place sturdy young peasants are wanted for the army and assuredly you will not be here many days before you will find yourselves in the ranks whether you like it or not for tippoo is in no way particular how he gets recruits    chapter 11 a useful friend   i agree with you that it would be a disadvantage to go as a soldier dick said after a pause but what disguise would you recommend us to choose  that i must think over you both look too straight and active to be employed as the assistants of a trader or i could have got some of my friends to take you in that capacity the best disguise will be a gayer attire such as would be worn by the retainers of some of the chiefs and were it not that if questioned you could not say who was your employer that is what i should recommend  i saw a number of men working at a battery they are erecting by the river side could we not take service there until something better presents itself  i should not advise that the native replied for the work is very hard and the pay poor indeed most of those employed on it are men driven in from the country round and forced to labour getting only enough pay to furnish them with the poorest food there would also be the disadvantage that if you were so employed you would have no opportunity of seeing any english captives who may have been brought here of late  all that i can at present do myself is to speak to some of my friends who have been here for a long time and ask them whether they can remember an english captive being sent up here from coorg some eight years ago and whether they ever heard what was his fate i should say of course that i have received a message from friends at conjeveram that some of the mans relations have sent out to make inquiries concerning him and asking me if i can find any news as to his fate my friends may not know themselves but they may be able to find out from others very many of our people were forced into the ranks of the army and there is not a regiment which has not some men who although regarded as mohammedans are still at heart as we all are as true to our faith as ever  it is from these that we are more likely to obtain information than in any other way you will not be very long before you will be able to satisfy yourself as to whether or not he whom you seek is in this city and if he should not be here there remain but the two towns that i have named and the hill forts as to these it will be wellnigh impossible to obtain an entrance so jealously are they all guarded none save the garrisons are allowed to enter the paths which are often so steep and difficult that men and provisions have to be slung up in baskets are guarded night and day and none are allowed to approach the foot of the rocks within musket shotlest i suppose they might find some spot where an ascent could be made the garrisons are seldom changed the soldiers are allowed to take their wives and families up with them but once there they are as much prisoners as those in the dungeons that is one reason why captives once sent up there never come down again for were they to do so they might if by chance they escaped be able to give information as to the approaches that would assist an assailing force  i do not say that all are killed though undoubtedly most of them are put to death soon after they arrive but it may be that some are retained in confinement either from no orders being sent for their execution or from their very existence being in time forgotten by the tyrant here some of these may languish in dungeons others may have gained the goodwill of the commanders of the fortfor even among the mohammedans there are doubtless many good and merciful men  now for the present this house has but one storey in front but there is a room over this and that is at your service furniture it has none but i will this evening get a couple of trusses of straw it is but a loft but you will not want to use it save to sleep in you need not fear interruption in this house there is scarce a man here that is not like myself a hindoo for when we were brought here from mysore the piece of ground on which the street stands was assigned to us and we were directed to build houses here few besides ourselves ever enter it for those who still carry on trade have booths in the marketplace  there is one thing i will tell you at once we the persecuted have means of recognising each other outward signs there are none neither caste mark nor peculiarity of dress but we know each other by signs when we salute we turn in the thumbs as we raise our hands to our turbansso if we have no occasion to salute as we move our hands either to stroke our faces or to touch the handles of our daggers or in other way we keep the thumb turned in if the man be one of ourselves he replies in the same way then to prevent the possibility of error the one asks the other a questionon what subject it matters not providing that before he speaks he coughs slightly  you must remember that such communication is not made lightly were it to be so it would soon attract notice it is used when you want to know whether you can trust a man it is as much as to say are you a friend can i have confidence in you will you help meand you can see that there are many occasions on which such knowledge may be most useful even to the saving of life  i do indeed see it dick said and greatly are we indebted to you for telling us of it  they remained talking with their host whose name was he told them pertaub until darkness came on they had shared his rice with him and had requested him to lay in such provision as was necessary for them and as soon as it became dark they went out leaving their guns behind them  busy as the main streets were when they had before passed through them they were very much more so now the shops were all lighted up by lanterns or small lamps and the streets were filled with troops now dismissed from duty and bent some on amusement some in purchasing small additions to their rations with the scanty pay allowed to them in the open spaces the soldiers were crowded round performers of various kinds here was a juggler throwing balls and knives into the air there was a snake charmera hindoo doubtless but too old and too poor to be worth persecuting a short distance off was an acrobat turning and twisting himself into strange postures  two sword players with bucklers and blunted tulwars played occasionally against each other and offered to engage any of the bystanders occasionally the invitation would be accepted but the sword players always proved too skilful for the rough soldiers who retired discomfited amid the jeers of their comrades  more than one party of musicians played what seemed to dick most discordant music but which was appreciated by the soldiers as was evident from the plaudits and the number of small coins thrown to the players in the great open space by the side of the market the crowd was thickest here were large numbers of booths gay with lamps in one were arranged on tables trays of cheap trinkets calicoes cloths blankets shoes and other articles of dress in another were arms matchlocks pistols tulwars and daggers on the ground were lines of baskets filled with grain of many kinds the vendors squatting patiently behind them some of the traders volubly accosted passers by others maintained a dignified silence as if they considered the excellence of their wares needed no advertisement  it was not new but it was very amusing to dick and it was late before they returned to their lodging  i wish he said as they strolled back that i were a good juggler or musician it seems to me that it would be an excellent disguise and we could go everywhere without question and get admittance into all sorts of places we could not get a chance of entering into in any other way  yes that would be a good thing surajah agreed but i am sure that i could not do anything even if you could  no i quite see that and i am not thinking of trying but it would have been a firstrate plan  you are very good at sword play surajah suggested although somewhat doubtfully  dick laughed  the first really good swordsman that came along would make an exhibition of me no one would have to do something really well  the subject was renewed after they had seated themselves with pertaub  it would be an excellent disguise he agreed a good juggler could gain admission to the palace and might even enter forts where no others could set foot for life there is dull indeed and anyone who could amuse the soldiers would be certain of a welcome and even a governor might be willing to see his feats  could one bribe a conjurer to let one pass as his assistant  that would be impossible the hindoo said for an assistant would have opportunities for learning the tricks and no money would induce a really good juggler to divulge his secrets which have been passed down from father to son for centuries  if one had thought of it dick said one could have bought in london very many things which would have seemed almost magical to the people here i am afraid that we must go on on our old line it is a pity for the other would have been first rate  i have obtained for you this evening two suits of clothes such as we spoke of in them you can pass as followers of some petty rajah and are not likely to attract attention i have inquired among some of my friends and hear that the rajah of bohr left here today with his following he is but a petty chief and bohr lies up north close to the nizams frontier thus if you should be asked in whose service you are you will have a name to give and there will be no fear of your being contradicted  if you are still further questioned by anyone with a right to ask you can say that you were told to remain here in order to see how fast the drilling of the troops went on and to send the rajah a report when it is time for him to return here to accompany tippoo on his march you will of course account for your dialect by keeping to your present story that you came from a village on the ghauts in order to enter the service of one of our rajahs and that your father having years ago been a soldier in the pay of the rajah of bohr you made your way there direct instead of coming to the capital  that will do excellently pertaub it was a fortunate moment indeed that brought us to your door  i have done nothing as yet sahib but i hope that in time i may be able to be of use to you it was fortunate for me as well as for you perhaps that you stopped at my door of late i have had nothing to think of save my own grief and troubles but now i have something to give an interest to my life and already i feel that i need not merely drag it on until i am relieved of its burden  and now sahibs i am sure that rest must be needful for you and would recommend that you seek your beds at once  on the following morning pertaub brought up the garments that he had bought for them nothing could be more irregular than the dress of the armed retainers of an indian rajah all attire themselves according to their fancy some carry spears and shields others matchlocks some wear turbans others iron caps the cut and colour of their garments are also varied in the extreme  dicks dress consisted of a steel cap with a drooping plume of red horsehair and a red tunic with a blue sash over it was worn a skirt of linked mail which with leggings fitting tightly completed the costume surajah had a red turban a jerkin of quilted leather with iron scales fastened on to protect the shoulders and chest a scarlet kilt hung to his knees and his legs were enclosed in putties or swathes of coarse cloth wound round and round them he wore a blue and gold girdle  dick laughed as he surveyed the appearance of himself and surajah  we are a rumlooking couple he said but i have seen plenty of men just as gaudy in the train of some of the rajahs who visited the camp when we were up here i think that it is a much better disguise than the one we wore yesterday i shant be afraid that the first officer we meet will ask us to what regiment we belong there were scores of fellows lounging about in the streets last night dressed as we are  sticking their swords and pistols into their girdles they sallied out and were pleased to find that no one paid the slightest attention to them they remained in the town until some battalions of recruits poured out from the fort to drill on the grounds between it and the town the first four that passed were as dick learnt from the remarks of some of the bystanders composed entirely of boyssome of them christians thirty thousand of whom had been carried off by tippoo in his raid on travancore and the young men were compelled to serve after being obliged to become nominally mohammedans after the chelah battalions came those of tippoos army  these fellows look as if they could fight dick said they are an irregular lot and dont seem to have an idea of keeping line or marching in step but they are an activelooking set of fellows and carry themselves well as to the chelahs i should say they would be no good whatever even if they could be relied on which we know they cannot be they look dejected and miserable and i suppose hate it all as much as their officers do i should back half a regiment of english to lick the twelve battalions i wonder tippoo himself does not see that troops like these must be utterly useless  i dont expect he thinks they would be of much use surajah agreed he only turned them into soldiers to gratify his hatred of them  leaving the troops they walked on and entered the great fort which enclosed an area of nearly two square miles in this were tippoos palace his storehousescontaining grain sufficient for the garrison for a siege of many monthsmosques the residences of tippoos officials and officers the arsenals and the huts for the troops there was also a street of shops similar to those in the town  wandering about unquestioned they came presently upon a scene that filled dick with indignation and fury two white officers heavily ironed were seated on the ground another similarly ironed lay stretched beside them he was naked from the waist up his back was covered with blood and he had evidently been recently flogged until he fell insensible half a dozen savagelooking men evidently executioners of tippoos orders were standing round jeering at the prisoners and refusing their entreaties to bring some water for their comrade  you brutes one of the captives exclaimed in english i would give all my hopes of liberty for ten minutes face to face with you with swords in our hands  they would not be of much use to us the other said quietly it is four days since we had a mouthful of food and they would make very short work of us  all the better the other exclaimed death would be a thousandfold preferable to this misery  dick felt that if he remained longer he would be unable to contain himself and turning hastily away walked off accompanied by surajah  it is awful he exclaimed with tears running down his cheeks and to be able to do nothing what must father have gone through i think surajah that if we were to come upon tippoo i should go for him even if he were surrounded by guards of course it would cost me my life if i could kill him i think i should not mind it such a villain is not fit to live and at any rate whoever came after him the prisoners could not be worse off than they are now  let us go back i have had enough for this morning  when they returned dick told pertaub of the scene that he had witnessed  many of them have been starved to death the old man said possibly one of their companions may have tried to escape it is to prevent this that tippoos greatest cruelties are perpetrated it is not so very difficult to get away and take to the jungle some have succeeded but most of them are retaken for a watch is vigilantly kept up at every village and every road leading on to the frontier and if caught they are hung or forced to take poison but whether they are caught or not tippoos vengeance falls upon their companions these are flogged ironed and kept without rations for weeksliving if they do live upon the charity of their guards  this is why there are so few attempts at escape a man knows that whether he himself gets off or not he dooms his companions to torture perhaps death one case i remember in which an english sailor one out of nine attempted to get away he was captured and killed at once and his eight companions were all hung so you see even if one of the captives sees a chance of escape he does not take it because of the consequences that would fall upon his companions  it is horrible dick said and i can quite understand why so few escape the question for me now is whether there are any prisoners kept in dungeons here  not here i think tippoos policy is to make all his captives useful and though one might be ironed and confined for a time i do not think that any are so kept permanently here there were of course some confined to the fort by illness and some in irons it may need some little search before you are quite sure that you have seen every one however i will try to find out how many there are there and to get as many of the names as possible some of my friends who keep shops in the fort may be able to do this for me this would shorten your task  but i cannot hold out any hopes that you will find him whom you seek in the city it is among the hill forts you will find him if he be alive i have been turning the matter over since you spoke to me last night and the best plan i can think of is that you should go as a travelling merchant with surajah as your assistant you would want a good assortment of goods fine muslins and silks and a good selection of silver jewellery from different parts of india all these i could purchase for you here if by good luck you could obtain a sight of the commander of one of these forts you might possibly obtain permission from him to go up and show your wares to the ladies of his establishment and to those of other officers the present of a handsome waist sash or a silvermounted dagger might incline him favourably to your petition  i think that the idea is an excellent one dick said warmly if we cannot get in in that way there seems to me to be no chance save by taking a careful survey of the fortress to discover where the rocks can be most easily climbed there must surely be some spots even among the steepest crags where active fellows like surajah and myself would be able to scale them of course we should have to do it after dark but once up there one ought to be able to move about in the fort without difficulty as we should of course be dressed as soldiers and could take dark blankets to wrap round us we ought then to be able to find where any prisoners who may be there are confined there might be a sentry at the door or if there were no other way one might pounce upon someone force him by threats to tell us what prisoners there are and where they are confined and then bind and gag him and stow him away where there would be no chance of his being discovered before daylight  there would be a terrible risk in such a matter pertaub said shaking his head gravely  no doubt there would be risk but we came here prepared to encounter danger and if it were well managed i dont see why we should be found out even if we were we ought to be able to slip away in the darkness and make our way to the point where we went up once down on the plain we could renew our disguise as traders and however hotly they scoured the country pass without suspicion through them  i think that there will be more chance in that way than in going in as traders for we should in that case have little chance of walking about still less of questioning anyone however it is worth trying that first we can always fall back upon the other if it fails we might on our first visit obtain indications that would be very useful to us on our second    chapter 12 a tiger in a zenana   another week passed and by the end of that time dick was perfectly assured that his father was not at seringapatam it was then a question which of the hill forts to try first pertaub had already procured for them an assortment of goods and dresses suitable for travelling merchants and the purchase of these things had drawn heavily on their stock of money although several of the traders on receiving a hint from pertaub of the purpose for which the goods were required had given many articles without charge while for the majority of the goods dick gave an order on his mother who had told him that he could draw up to five hundred pounds  on the day before they were about to start their plans were interrupted by the issue of a proclamation saying that sports with wild beasts would take place on the following day and they agreed that as one day would make no difference they would stop to see them especially as tippoo himself would be present hitherto although they had several times seen him being carried in his palanquin they had had no opportunity of observing him closely as he was always surrounded by his guards  the sports were held in a great square in the fort a strong network was erected in a semicircle of which the palace formed the base behind the network the spectators ranged themselves tippoo occupied a window in the palace looking down into the square there were always a number of wild beasts in seringapatam available for these purposes as a regular supply of tigers leopards and wild elephants was caught and sent in every month six of the largest tigers were always kept in cages in the courtyard in front of the palace and to these were thrown state criminals or officials who had offended the tyrant and were devoured by them  in his younger days tippoo had been very fond of the chase but he was now too fat and heavy and seldom ventured on horseback  dick and surajah who had arrived early had placed themselves at the corner where the network touched the palace some thirty yards in front of them a balcony projected it was enclosed by a thick lattice work from behind this the ladies of tippoos harem viewed the sports  these began with a contest of fighting rams the animals were placed some fifty yards apart as soon as they saw each other both showed extreme anger uttering notes of defiance then they began to move towards each other at first slowly but increasing in speed until when within a few yards of one another each took a spring meeting in mid air forehead to forehead with a crash that could be heard far away both fell back and stood for a moment shaking their heads as if half stupefied with the blow then they backed two steps and hurled themselves at each other again after this had been repeated once or twice they locked forehead to forehead and each strove to push the other back  for some time the struggle continued on equal terms then the weaker began to give way and was pushed back step by step until its strength failed altogether and it was pushed over on to the ground when the attendants at once interfered and separated them  some thirty pairs of rams fought the affair being to dick extremely monotonous the natives however took great interest in the contests wagering freely on the issues shouting loudly to the combatants and raising triumphant cries when one was adjudged victor  then elephants were brought in but the struggle between these was even tamer than between the rams they pushed each other with their foreheads until one gave way when the other would follow it beating it with its trunk and occasionally shoving it  when this sport was over two parties of men entered the arena amid a shout of satisfaction from the crowd after prostrating themselves before tippoo they took up their ground facing each other each man had on his right hand four steel claws fixed to the knuckles approaching each other cautiously they threw with their left hands the garlands of flowers they wore round their necks into the faces of their opponents trying to take advantage of the moment to strike a blow or to obtain a grip each blow laid open the flesh as by a tigers claws the great object was to gain a grip no matter where which would completely disable the opponent and render him incapable of defending himself when this was done the combat between that pair came to an end  after the ghetties as these men were named had retired a buffalo was matched against a tiger the latter was averse to the contest but upon some firecrackers being thrown close behind him he sprang at the buffalo who had been watching him warily as the tiger launched itself into the air the buffalo lowered its head received it on its sharp horns and threw it a distance of ten yards away no efforts could goad the wounded tiger to continue the fray so it and the buffalo were taken out and two others brought in  the second tiger was a much more powerful beast than its predecessor and was indeed larger than any of those in the cages of the palace it had been captured four days before and was full of fight it walked round the buffalo three or four times and then with the speed of lightning sprang upon it breaking its neck with a single blow from its powerful forepaw six buffaloes in succession were brought in and were killed one after the other by the tiger  satisfied with what it had done the tiger paid no attention to the seventh animal but walked round and round the arena looking for a means of escape then drawing back it made a short rush and sprang at the net which was fourteen feet high strong as were the poles that supported the net it nearly gave way under the impact the tiger hung ten feet above the ground until some of the guards outside ran up discharging their muskets into the air when it recommenced its promenade round the foot of the net roaring and snarling with anger  as it neared the palace it stopped and uttered a roar of defiance at those at the windows then apparently something moving behind the lattice work caught its eye it moved towards it crouching and then with a tremendous spring launched itself against it  the balcony was ten feet from the ground but the tigers spring took it clear of this the woodwork gave way like paper and the tiger burst through a shout of dismay arose from the multitude but high above this sounded the screams of the women  quick surajah dick cried and drawing his keen dagger he cut through the network and dashed through followed by his companion stand here he cried as they arrived below the balcony steady put your hands against the wall  then he sprang on to surajahs back and thence to his shoulder drawing his pistols he put one between his teeth grasping the other in his right hand  steady surajah he said i am going to stand on your head  he stepped on to his companions turban put his left arm on the balcony and raised himself by it until his arms were above its level the tiger was standing with its paw upon a prostrate figure growling savagely but evidently confused and somewhat dismayed at the piercing screams from the women most of whom had thrown themselves down on the cushions of the divan  dick stretched his right hand forward took a steady aim and fired a sharp snarl showed that the shot had taken effect he dropped the pistol snatched the other from his mouth waited for a moment until he could make out the tiger fired again and at once dropped to the ground just as a great body flashed from the window above him  he and surajah had both had their matchlocks slung over their shoulders and before the tiger could recover from its spring they levelled and fired the tiger rolled over but regained its feet and made towards them one of the bullets had however struck it on the shoulder and disabled the leg its movements were therefore comparatively slow and they had time to leap aside surajah discharged his pistol into its ear while dick brought down his keen sword with all his strength upon its neck and the tiger rolled over dead  a mighty shout rose from the crowd  we had better be off dick said or we shall have all sorts of questions to answer  they slipped through the hole in the net again but were so surrounded by people cheering and applauding them that they could not extricate themselves and a minute later some soldiers ran up pushed through the crowd to them and surrounded them  the sultan requires your presence they said and as resistance was out of the question dick and surajah at once accompanied them to the entrance of the palace  they were led through several large halls until they entered the room where tippoo was standing he had just left the womens apartment where he had hurried to ascertain what damage had been done by the tiger dick and his companion salaamed to the ground in accordance with the custom of the country  you are brave fellows the sultan said graciously and all the braver that you risked death not only from the tiger but for daring to look upon my women unveiled  i saw nothing your highness dick said humbly save the tiger that he was standing over a fallen figure i noticed as soon as my eye fell on him i fired at once and the second time as soon as the smoke cleared so that i could catch a glimpse of him  i pardon you that tippoo said and in faith you have rendered me good service for had it not been for your interference he might have worked havoc in my harem and that before a single one of my officers or men had recovered his senses and he looked angrily round at the officers standing near him  how comes it that you were so quick in thought and execution he asked surajah as the elder of the two  my brother and myself have done much hunting among the hills your highness and have learned that in fighting a tiger one needs to be quick as well as fearless  whence come you tippoo asked by your tongue you are strangers  surajah gave the account that they had agreed upon as to their birthplace but he was quickwitted enough to see that it would not be safe to say they were in the service of the rajah of bhor as inquiries might be made and he therefore said  we came hither to take service either with your royal highness or with one of your rajahs but have as yet found no opportunity of doing so  it is well tippoo said henceforth you are officers in my service apartments shall be assigned to you in the palace  here is the first token of my satisfaction and he took out a heavy purse from his girdle and handed it to surajah you are free to go now i will later on consider what duties shall be assigned to you when you return report yourselves to fazli ali my chamberlain and he indicated a whitebearded official among the group standing beside him  salaaming deeply again they left the apartments not a word was spoken until they were outside the precincts of the palace  this makes a sudden change in our plans dick said whether for better or worse i cannot say yet  i was right in not saying we were in the service of the rajah of bhor was i not i thought that tippoo would offer to take us into his service and he might have caused a letter to be sent to the rajah saying that he had done so  yes you were quite right surajah i had thought of that myself and was on thorns when you were telling your story and felt not a little relieved when you changed the tale i think that it has turned out for the best as officers of the palace we may be able to obtain some information as to what christian captives there are and the prisons where they are confined  still more surajah said when we get to be known as being his officers we might present ourselves boldly at any of the hill fortresses as sent there with some orders  you are right dick said i had not thought of that indeed we might even produce orders to inspect the prisoners in order to render an account to tippoo of their state and fitness for service and might even show an order for my father to be handed over to us if we should find him this is splendid and i am sure i cannot be too grateful to that tiger for popping into the harem he has done more for us in a few minutes than we could have achieved in a year  well surajah if my father is alive i think now that we have every chance of rescuing him  as they walked through the streets many of those who had been present at the sports recognised them as the heroes in the stirring episode there and judging they would gain a high place in tippoos favour came up to them and congratulated them on their bravery and made offers of service they replied civilly to all who accosted them but were glad when they turned off to the quiet quarter where pertaub lived the hindoo was surprised indeed when they told him what had happened and that they were already officers in the palace and might consider themselves as standing high in tippoos favour  it is wonderful he said when they brought their story to a conclusion surely providence must have favoured your pious object such good fortune would never have occurred to you had it not been that it was destined you should find your father still alive but if good fortune befalls you it is because you deserve it that you should face a great tiger without hesitation and slay him shows how firm your courage is and the quickness was still more to be admired no doubt there are many others there who to gain the favour of the sultan would have risked their lives but you alone of them were quick enough to carry it out  we were nearest to the spot pertaub had we been among the crowd farther back we could have done nothing  let praise be given where it is due surajah said i had nothing to do with the affair i saw the tiger bound through the window and heard screams and stood frozen with horror i did not even see my lord cut through the net i knew nothing until he seized me by the arm and pulled me after him and it was not until he sprang upon my back and then upon my shoulders that i knew what he was going to do i simply aided in despatching the tiger when he sprang wounded down into the courtyard  and yet you are a hunter and a soldier pertaub said this is how it is that the english have become lords of so wide a territory they are quick while we hesitate and spend great time in making up our minds to do anything they decide and act in a moment they are always ready we are always slow they see the point where a blow has to be struck they make straight to it and strike  the english sahib is very young and yet to him comes in a moment what is the best thing to be done he does not stop to think of the danger while all others stand in consternation he acts and slays the tiger before one of them has so much as moved from his place  but indeed as you say tippoo himself told you your danger was not only from the tiger the tyrant must indeed have been alarmed for the safety of his harem when he forgave you what in the eyes of a mohammedan is the greatest offence you can commit  this will of course change all of your plans  for the present at any rate it may be that later on we shall still find occasion for our disguises as possibly we may fall into disfavour and have to assume them to make our escape we may as tippoos officers manage to obtain entrance into one or two of the hill fortresses but unless absolutely sent by him that is the utmost we could hope for for were we missing messengers would be sent all over the country to order our arrest and in that case we should have to take to some disguise  the first thing now is to procure our dresses how much is there in that purse surajah it seems pretty heavy  surajah poured the gold out on the table  there are fifty tomauns that will be more than enough to clothe you handsomely the hindoo said  much more than enough i should think pertaub  tippoo likes those round him to be well dressed it is not only a proof of his generosity but he likes to make a brave show on great occasions and nothing pleases him more than to be told that neither the nizam nor any other indian prince can surpass him in the magnificence of his court therefore the better dressed you are the more he will be satisfied for it will seem to him that you appreciate the honour of being officers of the palace and that you have laid out his present to the best advantage and have not a mind to hoard any of it  i will take the matter in hand for you you will need two suits one for court ceremonies and the other for ordinary wear in the palace  i shall be very much obliged to you pertaub for indeed i have no idea what ought to be got had we better present ourselves at the palace this evening or tomorrow morning  this evening certainly did he take it into his head to inquire whether you were in the palace and found that you were not it might alter his humour towards you altogether he is changeable in his moods the favourite of one day may be in disgrace and ordered to execution the next you will soon feel that it is as if you were in a real tigers den and that the animal may at any moment spring upon you  take with you the clothes you now wear and those in which you came so that at any moment if you see a storm gathering you can slip on a disguise and leave the palace unobserved in that case hasten here and you can then dress yourselves as merchants  the worst of it is pertaub that our faces will soon become known to so many in the palace that they would be recognised whatever our dress  a little paint and some false hair and a somewhat darker stain to your skin would alter you so that those who know you best would pass you without suspicion i trust that no such misfortune will befall but i will keep everything in readiness to effect a transformation should it be required  now i will go out at once to get the clothes  in two hours he returned followed by a boy carrying the goods he had purchased and in a few minutes dick and his companion were arrayed in court dresses the turbans were pure white and the tunic was of dark rich stuff thickly woven with gold thread a short cloak or mantle secured at the neck by a gold chain three or four inches in length hung from the back but could if necessary be drawn round the shoulders a baldric embroidered with gold crossed the chest and from this hung a sword with an ivory handle  the waist sash was of blue and gold in dicks case purple and gold in that of surajah silvermounted pistols and daggers were stuck into the sashes the dresses were precisely alike except that they differed in colour the trousers were white  surajah was greatly delighted with his dress dick laughed  of course it comes naturally to you he said but i feel as if i were dressed up for a masquerade  the other suits were similar in style but the tunics were of richlyfigured damask instead of cloth of gold  half an hour later they started for the palace a coolie carrying a box containing their second suits and the simple dresses they had worn on their arrival dick could not help smiling at the manner in which the people in the streets obsequiously made way for them  i shall be very glad he said as they traversed the space that divided the town from the fort when we have got over the next day or two and have settled down a bit it all seems so uncertain and i have not the most remote idea of what our duties are likely to be hitherto we have always had some definite plan of action and had only ourselves to depend upon now everything seems doubtful and uncertain however i suppose we shall soon settle down and we have the satisfaction of knowing that if things do not turn out well we can go off to our good friend pertaub and get out of the place altogether  on arriving at the palace they inquired for the chamberlain  he is expecting you my lord one of the attendants said coming forward i will lead you first to the room that is prepared for you and then take you to fazli ali  the room was a commodious one and the richness of the covering of the divan and the handsome rugs spread on the floor were satisfactory signs that the chamberlain considered them prime favourites of the sultan having seen the box placed in a corner and paid the coolie they followed the attendant along some spacious corridors and passages until they entered a room where fazli ali was seated on a divan the attendant let the curtains that covered the door drop behind them as they entered  they salaamed to the chamberlain who looked at them approvingly and motioned to them to take their seats on the divan beside him  i see he said kindly that you possess good judgment as well as courage and quickness the former qualities have won you a place here but judgment will be needed to keep it you have laid out your money well as the sultan loves to see all in the palace well attired and quiet also and discreet in behaviour  can you give us any idea what our duties will be surajah asked as dick had requested him always to be the spokesman if possible  the chamberlain shook his head  that will be for the sultan himself to decide for a time probably you will have little to do but to attend at the hours when he gives public audiences you will doubtless occasionally carry his orders to officers in command of troops at distant places and will form part of his retinue when he goes beyond the palace when he sees that you are worthy of his favour prompt in carrying out his orders and in all respects trustworthy he will in time assign special duties to you but this will depend upon yourselves  as one who admires the courage and promptness that you showed today and who wishes you well i would warn you that it is best when the sultan has had matters to trouble him and may blame somewhat unjustly not to seek to excuse yourselves it is bad to thwart him when he is roused you can rely upon me to stand your friend and when the storm has blown over to represent the matter to him in a favourable light the sultan desires to be just and in his calm moments assuredly is so but when there is a cloud before his eyes there is no saying upon whom his displeasure may fall  at present however there is little chance of your falling into disgrace for he is greatly impressed with the service you have rendered him and especially by the promptness with which you carried it out after you had gone he spoke very strongly about it and said that he would he were possessed of a hundred officers capable of such a deed he would in that case have little fear of any of the foes of his kingdom  it is fortunate that you came here this afternoon it is wellnigh certain that he will ask for you presently and though he could hardly blame you had you required until tomorrow to complete your preparations your promptitude will gratify him and he will i am sure be still more pleased at seeing that you have so well laid out his gift he gave you no orders on the subject and had you appeared in the dresses you wore this morning he would doubtless have instructed me to provide you with more suitable attire the fact that you have so laid out the money will show that you have an understanding of the honour of being appointed to the palace and a proper sense of fitness the sultan himself dresses plainly and save for a priceless gem in his turban and another in his sword hilt there is nothing in his attire to lead a stranger to guess at his rank but while he does this himself he expects that all others in the palace should do justice to his generosity  and now you had best return to your room and remain there until sent for if he does not think of it himself i shall if opportunity occurs inform him that you have already arrived  they had some difficulty in finding their way back to their room and had indeed to ask directions of attendants they met before they discovered it a native was squatting at the door he rose and salaamed deeply as they came up  your slave is appointed to be your attendant my lords he said your servants name is ibrahim  good surajah said as he passed him and entered the room now ibrahim tell us about the ways of the palace for of these we are altogether ignorant in the first place about food do we provide ourselves or how is it  all in the palace are fed from the sultans kitchen at each meal every officer has so many dishes according to his rank these vary from three to twelve in the early morning i shall bring you bread and fruit and sherbet at ten oclock is the first meal and at seven there is supper at one oclock the kitchens are open and i can fetch you a dish of pillau kabobs a chicken or any other refreshment that you may desire at present i have no orders as to how many dishes your excellencies will receive at the two meals  we shall not be particular about that surajah said it is evident we shall fare well at any rate  i am told to inform you my lords that the sultan has ordered two horses to be placed at your service a ghorrawalla has been appointed to take charge of them his name is serfojee if you ask for him at the stable you will be directed to him and he will show you the horses  in an hour supper will be served but this evening i shall only be able to bring you three dishes each such is always the rule until the sultans pleasure has been declared  ibrahim then proceeded to light two lamps hanging from the ceiling for it was now getting dusk and then finding that his masters had no further need of his services he retired  so far so good surajah we are certainly in clover as far as comfort is concerned and the only drawback to the situation is tippoos uncertain temper however we must try our best to satisfy him we have every reason to stand well with him and if he sees that we are really anxious to please him we ought to be able to avoid falling into disgrace even when he is in his worst moods  their attendant presently brought up the six portions of food and they enjoyed their meal heartily each had an ample portion of a pillau of rice and chicken a plate of stew which dick thought was composed of game of some kind and a confection in which honey was the predominating flavour with this they drank water deliciously cooled by being hung up in porous jars  surajah ate his food with the dexterity of long habit but dick had not yet learned to make his bread fulfil the functions of spoon and fork for at his uncles table european methods of eating were adopted  half an hour after they had finished an officer presented himself at the door and said that he was ordered to conduct them to the sultan tippoo had supped in the harem and was now seated on a divan in a room of no great size but richly hung with heavy silken curtains and carpeted with the richest rugs two or three of his chief officers were seated beside him seven or eight others were standing on either side of the room a heavy glass chandelier of european manufacture hung from the richly carved ceiling and the fifty candles in it lighted up the room  the chamberlain met them at the door and advanced with them towards tippoo  great sultan he said these are the young men whom it has pleased your highness to appoint officers in the palace  the two lads salaamed until their turbans touched the ground  truly they are comely youths tippoo said and one would scarcely deem them capable of performing such a feat as that they accomplished this morning  well my slayers of tigers you have found everything fitly provided  far more so than our deeds merit your highness surajah replied we have found everything that heart could desire and only hope for an opportunity to show ourselves worthy of your favours  you have done that beforehand tippoo said graciously and i am glad to see by your attire that you are conscious that as my officers it is fitting you should make a worthy appearance it shows that you have been well brought up and are not ignorant of what is right and proper  at present you will receive orders from fazli ali and will act as assistant chamberlains until i decide in what way your services can be made most useful  now follow me there are others who wish to see you  rising tippoo led the way through a door with double hangings into a room considerably larger than that which they had just left the chandeliers at the end of the room where they stood were all lighted while the other end was in comparative darkness  leaving them standing alone tippoo walked towards the other end and clapped his hands immediately a number of closely veiled figures entered completely filling the end of the room  these are the young men tippoo said to them it is the one on the right to whom it is chiefly due that the tiger did not commit havoc among you it was he who climbed up the balcony and fired twice at the beast you owe your lives to him and his companion for among all my officers and guards there was not one who was quickwitted enough to move as much as a finger  there was a faint murmur of surprise among the veiled figures at the youth of their preserver  hold your heads fully up tippoo went on for dick and his companion after making a deep salaam had stood with bent heads and with eyes fixed upon the ground  then two of the attendants girls of thirteen or fourteen years old came forward from behind the others each bearing a casket  these are presented to you with my permission by the ladies whose lives you saved tippoo said and should you at any time have a favour to ask or even should you fall under my displeasure you can rely upon their good offices in your behalf  there was another low murmur from the other end of the hall then tippoo clapped his hands and the women moved out as noiselessly as they had entered  you can retire now tippoo said as he moved towards the door into the other room be faithful be discreet and your fortune is assured  he pointed to another door and then rejoined his councillors  dick and his companion stood in an attitude of deep respect until the hanging had fallen behind the sultan and then went out by the door he had pointed to and made their way back to their own room  truly surajah fortune is favouring us mightily this morning we walked the streets in fear of being questioned and arrested this evening we are officers of the palace favoured by tippoo and under the protection of the harem  i wonder what the ladies have given us  they opened the caskets which were of considerable size as they examined the contents exclamations of surprise broke from them each contained some thirty or forty little parcels done up in paper and on these being opened they were found to contain trinkets and jewels of all kinds some were very costly and valuable all were handsome  it was evident that every one of the ladies who had been in the room when the tiger burst in had contributed a token of her gratitude many of the more valuable gems had been evidently taken from their settings as if the donors did not care that jewels they had worn should be exposed to view one parcel contained twenty superb pearls another a magnificent diamond and ten rubies and so on down to the more humble giftsalthough these were valuableof those of lower rank  dicks presents were much more costly than those of his companion and as soon as this was seen to be the case dick proposed that they should all be put together and divided equally this however surajah would not hear of  the whole thing is due to you he said it would never have occurred to me to interfere at all i had no part in the matter beyond aiding to kill a wounded tiger and it was no more than i have done many times among our hills and thought nothing of these jewels are vastly more than i deserve for my share in the affair i do not know much about the value of gems but they must be worth a large sum and nothing will induce me to take any of those that you have so well earned  i wonder whether tippoo knows what they have given us dick said after in vain trying to alter his companions decision  i dont suppose he troubled himself about it surajah replied no doubt he was asked for permission for each to make a present to us the jewels in the harem must be of enormous value as for the last fifteen years tippoo has been gathering spoil from all southern india having swept the land right up to the gates of madras they say that his treasures are fabulous and no doubt the ladies of his harem have shared largely in the spoils the question is what had we best do with these caskets we know that in the course of our adventures it may very well happen that we shall be closely searched and it would never do to risk having such valuables found upon us  no i should say that we had best bury them somewhere some of these merchants here may be honest enough for us to leave the jewels in their care without anxiety but as they themselves may at any moment be seized and compelled to give up their last penny these things would be no safer with them than with us  as to pertaub i have absolute faith in him but he himself is liable to be seized at any moment however i should say we had better consult him if we were to bury them say under the floor of his house we might leave them there for a time if we saw any chance of this place being someday captured by our people we could wait till then for their recovery but the war may not be renewed for years possibly pertaub may be able to arrange to send them down only entrusting a portion at a time to a messenger so that if he got into trouble we should only lose what he had upon him  we will put the caskets into our box and lock it up for the present and take them down to pertaub tomorrow evening after it gets dark it will be as well to get them off our minds as soon as possible for although just at present we are in high favour there is no saying how long it may last or when it may be necessary for us to move    chapter 13 officers of the palace   the next morning just as they had finished their early breakfast they were sent for by fazli ali  you had better accompany me on my rounds he said i shall not commit any special duties to you until i see whether the sultan intends that you shall remain with me or whether as is far more likely he assigns other work to you were you placed in separate charges in the palace i should have to fill your places if you left therefore i propose that at present you shall assist me in general supervision  we will first go to the kitchens these give me more trouble than any other part of my duties in the first place one has to see that the contractors do their work properly that the number of carcases sent in is correct the flesh of good quality and that the list of game is correct then one has to check the amount of rice and other grain sent in from the storehouses the issue of spices and other articles of that kind these matters do not require doing every day the kitchen officers are responsible for them but once or twice a week i take care to be present to see that all is right then i ascertain that everything is in good and proper order in the kitchen listen to complaints and decide disputes  when we have done there we will see that the requisitions from the harem are properly complied with and that the sweetmeats perfumes silks and muslins as required are furnished  the payment of salaries does not come into my department that is one of the functions of the treasurer of the palace who also discharges all accounts upon my signature that they are correct  then i take a general tour of the palace to see that the attendants have done their duties and that everything is clean and in order as a rule i have finished everything before the morning meal is served the details of making up the accounts are of course done by clerks  after that my duties depend entirely upon the sultan if there is any state ceremonial in the palace i summon those whose duty it is to attend and see that everything is properly arranged and in order if not i am generally at his highnesss disposal  unless you receive any instructions from me you will be free to occupy yourselves as you like you will of course take part in all public ceremonials you will be among the officers who accompany the sultan when he goes out and will be liable to be summoned to attend him at all times therefore although free to go into the town or ride beyond the island it is well that you should never be long absent and that if you wish to be away for more than two hours at a time you should first let me know as i may be able to tell you if the sultan is likely to require you he has fixed your pay at four hundred rupees a month  dick as he accompanied the chamberlain on his tour through the palace was struck with the order and method that prevailed in every department and the chamberlain told him that tippoo himself inquired closely into details and that large as was the daily expenditure no waste of any kind was allowed  the splendour of some of the apartments was surprising especially the throne room the throne itself was of extraordinary magnificence it was of gold thickly inlaid with gems on the apex stood a jewelled peacock covered entirely with diamonds emeralds and rubies with pendants of pearls in front of it stood a golden tigers head which served as a footstool on either side were standards of purple silk having a sun with gold rays in the centre the spear heads were of gold set with jewels  when the work of inspection was finished they went back to their room where their attendant soon afterwards with an air of great exultation brought their meal which consisted of nine dishes each a proof of the high favour with which tippoo regarded them after this meal was eaten they went down to the stables and were pleased indeed with the mounts provided for them they were fine animals with handsome saddles and trappings and dick and surajah at once mounted and rode through the town to the other extremity of the island as they wore scarves that had been furnished them by fazli ali showing that they were officers of the palace they were everywhere greeted with deep salaams  i hope dick said as they returned from their ride that tippoo will not be long before he finds us some other duties there is nothing very interesting in counting carcases or seeing rice measured  that is true enough surajah agreed but we must not be impatient fortune has befriended us marvellously and i have great faith that it will continue to do so we must be content to wait  yes i know that surajah but i think it is all the more difficult to do so because we have done so much in a short time it seems as if one ought to go on at the same rate  that evening they went down as they had arranged with ordinary wraps round their gay attire to pertaubs taking with them the caskets of gems the hindoo received them warmly  i saw you ride through the streets this morning although you did not notice me truly you made a good appearance and were well mounted i have heard from one of our people who is a servant in the palace that you stand in high favour  we have brought you down these two caskets of gems dick said they were given us by the ladies of the harem and many of the stones surajah thinks are very valuable we dont know what to do with them and wanted to know whether you could arrange to send them down to tripataly for us  i would not undertake to do so if they are valuable pertaub said the prospects of fresh troubles are stronger every day and the roads are so closely watched especially those through the passes that it would be running a terrible risk to trust valuables to anyone  in that case pertaub we thought you might bury them in the ground under your house but first look at some of the stones and tell us what you think of them  the hindoo opened surajahs casket and undid many of the little parcels  assuredly they are valuable he said some of them much more so than others but if all are like these that i have opened they must be worth at least fifty thousand rupees  now look at this casket pertaub  the hindoo uttered an exclamation of surprise as he opened some of the packets and taking out some of the larger gems he examined them by the light of his lamp  i could not place a value on these he said at last the ladies must indeed have felt that they owed their lives to you the gems are a fortune doubtless they are the spoils of a score of districts and tippoo must have distributed them lavishly among his wives or they could never have made such rich presents i would bury them sahib for surely they could not be entrusted even to the most faithful messengers in times like these but though if you like i will hide them here i think it would be far safer for you to take them across the river and bury them in a wood marking well the trees that you may know the place again for although methinks tippoos agents believe that they have squeezed the last rupee from me one can never telli might again be tortured and none can say that they are brave enough to bear the agonies that tippoos executioners inflict  i will bury them for tonight but i pray you give me notice the first time you cross the river i will be at the other side of the ford with the jewels hidden in a sack on an ass this i will drive forward when i see you crossing the ford you will follow me till i enter a wood i will have the tools and when you join me you can go on a short distance and bury them i do not wish to see where you hide them but will move about to make sure that none come near you when so engaged  you had best take out a few small stones which you will find as good as money and much more easily concealed for in every town or large village you will find a jeweller who will give you silver for them  i think that will be a very good plan pertaub and will certainly carry it out  a month passed without any change in their work they rode with other officers behind tippoos palanquin when he went out which he did almost every day to inspect the progress of the fortifications and were among the brilliant circle behind his throne when he gave orders  by this time they had come to know most of the other court officials and were able to inquire cautiously about the prisons they could learn nothing however of any english prisoners in seringapatam save those they had seen in the hut in the fort  six weeks after their appointment as palace officers dick and surajah were sent for by tippoo  i am about to employ you the sultan said when they appeared before him on a mission you are strangers here and are unconnected with any of my officers and i can therefore place greater reliance on your reports than upon those of men who have other interests than my own to serve i desire you to go and inspect the hill forts to see how the repairs of the fortifications injured by the english are progressing and to make sure that the cannon are in good order and the supply of ammunition plentiful you have shown that you are quick sighted and sharp look round the defences and if you see aught that can be done to strengthen them confer with the governors learn their opinions on the subject and if they agree with you they will be authorised to take men from the country round to strengthen the fortifications and i will forward at once such guns and stores as may be required  after the inspection of each fort you will despatch a mounted messenger to me with your report and you will state which fort you will next visit in order that i may despatch there any order that i may have to give you  do your duty well and i shall know how to reward you in order that your authority may be increased you are both named colonels in the army fazli will furnish you with a written copy of the orders i have given you and with authority under my seal to enter and inspect all fortresses and to consult with the governors as to everything considered by them as necessary for their better defence  the last time the english came they captured nundidroog and other hill fortresses that we had regarded as impregnable simply because the governors were overconfident and the defences had been neglected this must not occur again and if there is failure in the defences i shall hold you responsible therefore take care that you do not neglect not only to see that the repairs are being well carried out but to recommend additions to the fortifications wherever it seems to you that there is even a possibility of an enemy making his way up  you will take with you twenty troopers as an escort but these are not to enter any of the fortresses with you for treachery is always possible and no one save the garrisons must be acquainted with the defences of the hill forts  surajah expressed his thanks to the sultan for entrusting them with the mission and assured him that their inspection of the forts should be careful and complete and that they would start in an hours time  when they reached their own room dick threw up his turban in delight  was there ever such a stroke of good fortune he exclaimed the tiger business was as nothing to this tippoo has given us the mission of all others that will enable us to carry out our search our work is as good as done  that is to say he added more gravely we are at least pretty sure to find my father out if he is alive besides we may get information that will be of great use if the war is renewed  now we had better in the first place go and see fazli and get our instructions we will order our horses to be in readiness to start as soon as we have had our mealwe may not get another chance of eating today  i should like to take ibrahim with us he is a capital servant and a strong active fellow i believe he is fond of us and we shall want someone who can cook for us and buy things and so on i will speak to fazli about it  the chamberlain looked up as they entered the room where he was engaged in dictating to a clerk  i congratulate you on your mission he said it will involve a great deal of hard work but as you have told me how you longed for some duty outside the palace you will not mind that tippoo consulted me before sending for you i told him you were diligent in the service and i felt sure you would do your best in the present matter and that as you were accustomed in the pursuit of game to ascend mountains and scale precipices you were far more likely to find the weak spots in the forts than an old officer who would be likely to take everything for granted  there is no doubt that many of the garrisons are very far from being efficient they have been stationed in the forts for many years discipline both among officers and men is sure to have become lax and there will be much that young men going freshly into the matter will see needs amendment that the walls are often weak and the cannon so old as to be almost useless i am well aware for sometimes newlyappointed governors have sent in strong protests and urgent requests that they might be furnished with new cannon and that walls and defences might be renewed but what with the wars the removal of the capital and the building and fortification of this place these matters have been neglected and it is only now that the sultan sees the necessity of putting the fortifications of all these places in good repair  i have had the papers prepared and signed your escort has been ordered is there anything else you can think of  we should like to take our palace attendant with us surajah said he is a good man and starting so suddenly we should have a difficulty in hiring servants we could rely on  i have thought of that the chamberlain replied and have ordered a horse to be got in readiness for him together with a spare animal to carry food and necessaries for your journey you will need them on your marches and may even be glad of them in some of the smaller forts where the fare will be very rough  when they returned to their room they found ibrahim awaiting them he was evidently delighted at the prospect of accompanying them  my lords he said i have the pack horse saddled in the stable with two great sacks and ropes is it your pleasure that i should go down at once to the market and buy flour and rice spices and other things necessary  certainly ibrahim but it will not be necessary to buy much meat it will not keep and we ought always to be able to buy a sheep or a fowl from villagers get some thick wadded sleeping rugs some cooking pots and whatever you think is necessary do not waste any time for we shall start immediately after our meal  as soon as the man had left dick said to surajah  i will hurry down to the town and see pertaub you had best remain here in case tippoo should send for us to give us final instructions you can say should he ask that i have gone down to the town to get a supply of powder and ball for our pistols writing materials and other things that we may require which will be true enough it is most lucky that we buried our jewels in the forest ten days ago for we should not have had time to do it now  dick returned in time for the meal which was brought up by another servant  pertaub was delighted to hear of our good fortune he said on his return he will keep our disguises by him and if we have occasion for them will either bring them himself with the merchandise or will send them by a trusty messenger to any place we may mention directly he hears from us i do not think there is any chance of our wanting them but it is as well to prepare for any contingency that may occur  half an hour later they started at the head of an escort of twenty troopers ibrahim riding in the rear leading the pack horse which carried a change of clothes and thick cloths to keep out the night dews as well as the stock of provisions ibrahim had also purchased two very large dark blankets that could be used for a temporary shelter surajah now felt quite at home for he was engaged in the same sort of duty he performed at tripataly and more than one pair of dark eyes glanced admiringly at the two young officers as they rode down to the ford  they had been furnished by fazli with a list of the forts they were to visit and the order in which they were to take them the first on the list being savandroog fifty miles northeast of the city after a ride of twenty miles they halted at a village to the surprise of the troopers surajah gave orders that nothing was to be taken by force as he was prepared to pay for all provisions required  as soon as the villagers understood this ample supplies were brought in rice grain and fowls were purchased for the soldiers and forage for the horses and after seeing that all were well provided for the two officers went to a room that had been placed at their service in the principal house in the village  ibrahim justified his assertion that he was a good cook by turning out an excellent curry by the time they had finished this it was getting dark and after again visiting the troopers and seeing that their own horses were fed and well groomed they retired to bed  an early start was made and at ten oclock they approached savandroog it was one of the most formidable of the hill forts of mysore and stood upon the summit of an enormous mass of granite covering a base of eight miles in circuit and rising in ragged precipices to the height of 2500 feet the summit of the rock was divided by a deep chasm into two peaks each of which was crowned with strong works and capable of separate defence the lower part of the hill was wherever ascent seemed possible protected by walls one behind the other the natives had regarded the fort as absolutely impregnable until it was stormed by the troops under lord cornwallis  dick looked with intense interest at the great rock with its numerous fortifications the damages committed by the british guns could not be seen at this distance and it seemed to him wellnigh impossible that the place could have been captured they rode on until they neared an entrance in the wall that encircled the fort at the side at which alone access was considered possible  they were challenged as they approached ordering the troopers to remain behind dick and surajah rode forward  we are the bearers surajah cried out as they reined in their horses within twenty yards of the gate of an order from the sultan for our admittance and of a letter to mirzah mohammed bukshy the governor  i will send up word to him an officer on the wall replied i can admit no one until i have received his orders to do so  how long will it be before we receive an answer  an hour and a half at the earliest i regret that your excellencies will be inconvenienced but my orders are absolute  i do not blame you surajah replied it is necessary that you should always be vigilant and they retired under the shade of a tree a hundred and fifty yards from the gate  ibrahim spread out the rugs and then proceeded to light the fire and to prepare a pillau of rice and fowl while dick and his companion regarded the rock with fixed attention and conversed together as to the possibility of ascending at any of the points so steep as to be left undefended by walls they concluded at last that it would be next to impossible to climb the rock anywhere on the side that faced them save by scaling several walls  they had just finished their luncheon when the gate opened and an officer and four soldiers issued out they at once rose and went to meet them  i have the governors order to admit you on the production of the sultans pass  surajah produced the document the officer at once recognised the seal and carried it to his forehead salaaming deeply  your troopers can enter at the gate but cannot proceed farther than the second wall  can we ride up or must we walk dick asked  you can ride he replied the road is steep but nowhere so steep that horses cannot mount it  after the party had entered the gate it was at once closed and bolted the troopers dismounted and were led to a small barrack while surajah and dick accompanied by the officer and four soldiers on foot rode on  the road was a better one than dick had expected it was just wide enough for a cart to proceed up it and was cut out of the solid rock it turned and zigzagged continually and at each angle was a small fort whose guns swept the approach they passed under a score of gateways each defended by guns and after upwards of an hours climbing at a quick pace they approached one of the forts on its summit the governor met them at the gate  you will pardon my not descending to meet you below he said but i am not so young as i used to be and the journey up and down fatigues me much  dick and surajah dismounted and the former presented the two documents the governor after reading the pass bowed and led the way into the interior of the fort and they were soon seated on a divan in his quarters when he read the circular letter  i am glad indeed he said when he had finished that the sultan is pleased to take into consideration the many demands i have made for cannon and ammunition a large number of the pieces are past service and they would be as dangerous to those who fired them as to those at whom they were aimed while i have scarcely powder enough to furnish three rounds for each as to the defences i have done my best to strengthen them idleness is bad for all men most of all for soldiers and i have kept them well employed at repairing the effects of the english fire still there is much to do yet before they are finished and there are points where fortifications might be added with advantage these i will gladly point out to you they have been beyond our means here for as you will perceive it will need blasting in many places to scarp the rock and to render inaccessible several points at which active men can now climb up for this work powder is required and i would submit that for such hard work it will be needful to supply extra rations to the troops for the present scale scarcely suffices to keep the men efficient especially as most of them have their wives and families dependent on them  i have no doubt that the sultan will accede to any reasonable requests your excellency he is anxious that the walls of the forts should be placed in the best possible condition for defence no one doubts that we shall ere long be again at war with england and although the sultan relies much upon large reinforcements that have been promised by france with whom he has entered into an alliance they have not yet arrived and he may have to bear the brunt of the attack of the english by himself  i have heard of this the governor said and regret that we shall again have the feringhees upon us as for the mahrattis or the nizam i heed them notthey are dust whom the sultan could sweep from his path but these english are terrible soldiers i have fought against them under hyder and in the last war they again showed their valour and the strangest thing is that they make the natives under them fight as bravely as they do themselves  as to forts nothing is safe from them were all the troops of the nizam and the mahrattis combined to besiege us i should feel perfectly safe while were there but five hundred englishmen i should tremble for the safety of the fortress you have come up the hill and have seen for yourselves how strong it is and yet they took the place without the loss of a single man i was not here for i was in command of kistnagherry at that time and succeeded in holding it against their assaults when the war was over and kistnagherry was ceded to them i was appointed to this fortress which seems to me to be even stronger than that was  the commander was a brave man the garrison was strong there was no suspicion of treachery and though at last the troops were seized with a panic as they might well be when they saw that they were unable to arrest the advance of the enemy the defence up to that time had been stout the english brought up guns where it was thought no guns could be taken they knocked the defences to pieces and after winning their way to the top in one day captured this fort and that on the hill yonder it seems miraculous  coffee was brought in and pipes for although tippoo was violently opposed to smoking and no one would venture upon the use of tobacco in the palace or fort old officers like the governor in distant commands did not relinquish tobacco  it is necessary here the governor said as he filled his pipe the country round is terribly unhealthy and the air is full of fever i do not discourage its use among the men for they would die off like flies did they not smoke to keep out the bad air the climate is indeed the best protection to the fort for an army that sat down for any length of time before it would speedily melt away  he opened a box that stood on the divan beside him  i have copies here he said taking some papers out of the memorials that i have sent in to the sultan as to the guns this is the last it was sent in two months ago you see i asked for fortynine heavy pieces of these thirty are to replace guns that are honeycombed or split the other eleven are for new works i asked for thirtytwo lighter ones or howitzers and a hundred wall guns of course i could do with less but to place the fort in a perfect state of defence that is the number that i and my artillery officer think are requisite  of powder we have not more than a ton and a half and if the siege were to be a long one we might require ten times as much we have not more than eight rounds of shot for each gun and we ought to have at least fifty for the heavy pieces and twenty for those defending the path up the hill  dick made a note of the figures in a pocket book he had bought for the purpose  as for provisions the governor went on we ought to have large stores of rice and grain the magazines are nearly empty and as we have eight hundred men in garrison and perhaps twice as many women and children we should require a large store were we blockaded for any time  are the troops in good condition surajah asked  the governor shook his head  many of them are past the term of service but until i get reinforcements to supply their places i shall not venture to discharge them many others are wasted by fever and i must say from insufficient rations which not only weakens their bodies but lowers their spirits as long as there was no fear of attack this mattered little but if the english are coming again we shall want wellfed and contented men to oppose them  i see by the stars on your turbans that you are both colonels as well as officers of the palace you are fortunate in obtaining that rank so young  it was due to the sultans favour surajah said the other day at the sports a tiger burst into the sultans zenana and we were lucky enough to kill itthat is my friend did most of the killing i only gave the brute the final coup  ah it was you who performed that deed the governor said warmly i heard the news from one of my officers who was on leave and returned yesterday truly it was a gallant action and one quickly done no wonder that you obtained the sultans favour and your rank as colonel  i was a sportsman in my young days but i think i should have been more frightened at the thought of taking a peep into the sultans zenana than i should have been of fighting the tiger  i did not think anything about it dick said until it was all over i heard some women scream and being quite close went to their assistance without a thought whether they might be the ladies of the zenana or servants of the palace but indeed i saw nothing save the tiger and only vaguely observed that there were women there at all  it was well that the sultan took the view he did of the matter the governor said i have known men put to death for deeds that were but trifles in comparison to looking into the zenana  now colonel i will send for my artillery officer and the horses and we will ride round the fortifications on the brow of the hill inspect the two forts closely and will point out to you the spots where it appears to us the defences ought to be strengthened    chapter 14 a surprise   dick was much pleased with the governor he was evidently an outspoken old soldier and though rough his bearded face had an honest and kindly expression and he thought to himself if my father fell into his hands i dont think he would be treated with any unnecessary hardship though no doubt the sultans orders would be obeyed  when a soldier came in to say that the horses were at the door they went out an officer was standing beside them and the governor presented him as his chief artillery officer  you have not brought your horse he said  no your excellency the distance is not great and we should need to dismount so many times to get a view from the walls that it would not be worthwhile to ride  in that case we may as well walk also dick said  i would rather do so too the governor said i proposed riding because i thought you might be tired as bakir meeram says the distance is not great the walls themselves with the exception of those of the two forts are not more than half a mile in extent for in most places the rocks go sheer down and there defences are of course unnecessary we will inspect this fort first  they went the round of the walls dick and his companion listening to the suggestions of the two officers the principal one was that a wall should be raised inside the gate  the english last time got in here by rushing in at the tail of the fugitives from below they were in before the gates could be closed and took our men so completely by surprise that they were seized with a panic were we to raise a semicircular wall behind the gateway such a thing could not occur again the governor said of course there would be a gate in the inner wall but not immediately behind the outer gateway as if so placed it might be destroyed by the cannon shots that battered the outer gate in i should therefore put it at one end of the inner wall this gate would be generally open but in case of a siege i should have it blocked up with stones piled behind it placing a number of ladders by which men running in could get on to the walls and however closely they were pursued could make a stand there until the ladders were pulled up  that would be an excellent idea surajah said gravely and i will certainly lay it before the sultan i suppose you would propose the same for the other fort  just the same  the only thing that i would observe dick said is that if an enemy once got a footing on the top here you could not hope to make a long defence of these forts  that is so the governor agreed the strength of the defence is not here but on the upward road and if the english once gained the top the forts must fall but at least it shall not be said as long as i am governor that savandroog fell almost bloodlessly in these forts we can at least die bravely and sell our lives to the last it is for that reason i desire that they shall be so defended that they cannot be carried as they were before by a sudden rush  the other fort was then visited and a tour made round the walls the suggestions offered by the governor and the officers were all noted down and approved  then they made what was to dick the most important part of the inspection namely an examination of the undefended portion of the rock the result showed him that the builders of the defences had not acted unwisely in trusting solely to nature at many points the rock fell away in precipices hundreds of feet deep at other points although the descent was less steep it was as far as he could see from above altogether unclimbable but this he thought he would be able to judge better from below  do you have sentries round here at night he asked the governor  no it would not be necessary even if an enemy were encamped below if you will ride round the foot of the hill when you leave you will see for yourself that save from the side you came up the place is absolutely inaccessible  the view from the top of the hill was superb away to the northeast the governor pointed out the pagodas of bangalore twentytwo miles away the distance in the clear air seeming comparatively trifling  are there many troops there dick asked  there are about five battalions of the regular troops and three chelah battalions these can hardly be counted as troops they have never been of the slightest use in the last war they ran like sheep it is a fancy of the sultans but indeed he can hardly expect men to fight who have been forced into the ranks and made to accept mohammedanism against their will naturally they regard an invader not as an enemy but as a deliverer  of course the sultans idea was that since the native troops drilled and led by englishmen fought so well the chelahs who were also drilled and led by englishmen would do the same but the companys troops are willing soldiers and it is the english leading more than the english drill that makes them fight if the chelahs were divided among the hill fortresses they might do good service and i could as far as fighting goes do with a battalion of them here for mixed up with my men they would have to do their duty but of course they will never be placed in the hill forts for one would never be safe from treachery even if all the lower walls were in the hands of my own men some of the chelahs would be sure to manage to desert and give information as to all the defences  a considerable portion of the upper plateau of the rock was occupied by the huts of the troops for the forts were much too small to contain them and their families on their way back they passed through these dick looked anxiously about for white faces but could see none nor any building that seemed to him likely to be used as a prison  when they returned to the governors quarters they found that a room had been placed at their disposal and they presently sat down to dinner with him  i suppose you have no english prisoners here dick said carelessly when the meal was over  the governor paused a moment before he replied  i dont want any of them here he said shortly batches are sent up sometimes from bangalore but it is only for execution i am a loyal subject of the sultan but i would that this work could be done elsewhere almost all the executions take place in the hill forts in order i suppose that they may be done secretly i obey orders but i never see them carried out i never even see the captives they have done no harm or at most one of their number has tried to escape for which they are not to be blamed i always have them shot whether that is the mode of execution ordered or not it is a soldiers death and the one i should choose myself and so that they are dead it can matter little to the sultan how they die if they were all shot as soon as they were taken i should not think so much of it but after being held captive for years and compelled to work it seems to me that their lives should be spared as far as giving up my own life is concerned i would willingly do it at the orders of the sultan but these executions make me ill i lose my appetite for weeks afterwards let us talk of something else  and the governor puffed furiously away at the hookah he had just lighted then the conversation turned to the forts again  no i do not find the life dull he said in answer to a remark of dicks i did so at first but one soon becomes accustomed to it i have my wife and two daughters and there are ten officers so that i can have company when i choose all the officers are married and that gives society up here we do not observe strictly the rules of the plains and although the ladies of course wear veils when they go beyond the house they put them aside indoors and the families mix freely with each other so that we get on very well you see there are very few changes ever made and as many of the ladies are like my wife no longer young we treat them as comrades  in the morning dick and surajah mounted their horses took a hearty farewell of the governor and rode down to the gate a soldier had been sent down half an hour before and they found their escort in readiness to move they had decided that before going to the next fort they would ride round the foot of the hill of savandroog this they did going at a foot pace and scanning the cliffs and slopes as they passed sometimes they reined up their horses and rode a little farther back so as to have a view to the very summit  when they completed the round they agreed that there were but two spots where it seemed to them that an ascent was barely possible and they were very doubtful whether the difficulties when examined more closely would not prove to be absolutely insurmountable  that is not a satisfactory outlook dick said but fortunately there is now no motive for climbing the precipice certainly those places would be of no use to a party wanting to make an attack in the first place though you and i might get up with soft shoes on i am sure that english soldiers with muskets and ammunition pouches could never do it especially at night and in the daytime even if a body of troops strong enough to be of any use could get up those who first arrived at the top would be killed before the others could come to their assistance and a few stones rolled down would sweep all behind them to the bottom  i dont like turning my back on the place he went on as they turned their horses heads to the south for savandroog was the farthest north of the forts they were to visit it seems to me that even now my father may be there  how can that be dick surajah said in surprise nothing could be more straightforward than the governor seemed to be i thought that he was even rash in speaking as frankly as he did to us  i think he saw there was no fear of our repeating what he said surajah he is a frank outspoken old soldier and has evidently been so disgusted at the treatment of the prisoners that he could not mince his words and yet you know he did not absolutely say that he had no prisoners  no i noticed that he did not reply directly to your question  on the contrary he distinctly hesitated before he spoke now why should he have done that he might just as well have said no i have no prisoners they are only sent up here for execution that would have been his natural answer instead of that he hesitated and then began i dont want any of them here batches are sent up sometimes from bangalore now why did he shirk the question if it had been any other subject i might not have noticed that he had not really answered it but of course as it was so important a one i was listening most anxiously for his reply and noticed his hesitation at once and that he gave no direct answer at all  now think it over surajah why should he have hesitated and why should he have turned the question off without answering it unless there had been some reason and if so what could the reason be  surajah had no suggestion to make and they rode on for some distance in silence  it is quite evident dick went on after a long pause that he is a kindhearted man and that he objects altogether to tippoos cruelty to the prisoners therefore if he had any captives his reason for not answering was most likely a kindly one  yes i should think so  you see he would consider that we should report to the sultan all particulars we had gathered about the fortress his remarks about the execution of the prisoners and the worthlessness of the chelah battalions and so on was a private conversation and was only a matter of opinion but supposing he had had some prisoners and had said so we might for anything he knew have had orders to inspect them and to report about them as well as about the garrisons and defences  yes he might have thought that surajah agreed but after all why should he mind that  dick did not answer for some time he was trying to think it out presently he reined in his horse suddenly  this might be the reason he said excitedly this governor may be the very one who we heard had taken my father with him when he was moved from that fort up in the north he was in command at kistnagherry before he came here after the war and he may have gone to kistnagherry from that fort in the north you see there have been executions but they have been those of fresh batches sent up and the governor would not include the captive he had brought with him in time his very existence may have been forgotten and he may still be living there that would account for the governors objection to answering the question as he would be sure that did tippoo hear there was a prisoner there he would send orders for him to be executed at once  this may be all fancy surajah but i cannot think of any other reason why he should have shirked my question  he took up the reins again and the horse at once started forward they rode for some little time in silence dick thinking the matter over again and again and becoming more and more convinced he was right except that as he admitted to himself the prisoner whom the governor wished to shield might not be his father  he was roused at last by surajah asking the question is there anything that you would like us to do  not now dick replied we could not go back again we must visit the other forts on our list and see what we can find out there when we have quite assured ourselves that my father is not in any of them we can think this over again but at present we must put it aside however i shant rest until i get to the bottom of it  during the next ten days they inspected the forts of navandroog sundradroog outradroog and chitteldroog few of these were as extensive and none so strong as savandroog they did the official part of their business and assured themselves that no english captives were contained in any of them the governors all said that prisoners were never kept there many days and that it was only when tippoo wished to get rid of them that they were sent there none of the governors made any objection to answering dicks questions on the subject generally adding an expression of satisfaction that prisoners were never left long under their charge  it entails a lot of trouble the governor of outradroog said they have to be watched incessantly and one never feels certain they may not slip away look at this place you would think that no one could make his escape and yet some ten years ago fourteen of them got away from here they slid down a precipice where no one would have thought a human being could have got down alive they were all of them retaken except one and executed the following day but the sultan was so furious that although it was no fault of the governor who had sentries placed everywhere he sent for him to seringapatam and threw him to the tigers declaring that there must have been treachery at work you may be sure that i have no desire to hold english prisoners after that and when they have been sent here have been glad indeed when orders came for their execution  a good many were ordered to be starved to death but i never waited for that it took too long do what i could the guards would smuggle in pieces of bread and they lingered on for weeks so that it was more merciful to finish with them at once besides making me feel comfortable at the knowledge that there was no chance of their making their escape there were sentries at their doors as well as on the walls when the fourteen i have told you about escaped but they dug a passage out at the back of their hut chose a very dark night and it was only when the sound of some stones that they dislodged as they scrambled down the precipice gave the alarm to the sentries that their escape was discovered  no i do not want any prisoners up here and when they do come there is no sleep for me until i get the order to execute them but they do not often come now most of the prisoners who were not given up have been killed since and there are not many of them left  upon finishing their round they returned to seringapatam where dick drew up a full report of the result of their investigations the sultan himself went through it with them questioned them closely cut off a good many of the items and gave orders that the other demands should be complied with and the guns and ammunition sent off at once to the various forts from the great arsenal at the capital  dick was depressed at the result of their journey his hopes had fallen lower and lower as at each fort they visited he heard the same storythat all prisoners sent up to the mountain fortresses had in a short time been put to death it was possible of course that his father might still be at one of the towns where new levies had been drilled but he had not from the first thought it likely that a merchant sailor would be put to this work and had it not been that he clung to the belief that there was a prisoner at savandroog and that that prisoner was his father he would have begun to despair  it was true that there were still many hill forts scattered about the country unvisited but there seemed no reason why any of the prisoners should have been allowed to survive in these forts when they had all been put to death in those they had visited among which were the places that had been most used as prisons  i would give it up he said to surajah were it not that in the first place it would almost break my mothers heart her conviction that my father is still alive has never been shaken it has supported her all these years and i believe that were i to return and tell her that it was no longer possible to hope her faith would still be unshaken she would still think of him as pining in some dungeon and would consider that i had given up the search from faint heartedness that is my chief reason but i own that i am almost as much influenced by my own conviction that he is in savandroog i quite admit that i can give no reason whatever why if there is a prisoner there it should be my father and yet i cannot get it out of my mind that it is he i suppose it is because i have the conviction that i believe in it why should i have that impression so strongly if it were not a true one i tell myself that it is absurd that i have no real grounds to go upon and yet that does not shake my faith in the slightest it is perhaps because we have been so fortunate altogether everything has turned out so favourably that i cant help thinking he is alive and that i shall find him  what do you think surajah ought we to give it up  why should we surajah replied stoutly i think you are right and that we are destined to find your father there is no hurry we have not been anything like so long a time as we expected to be and fortune has as you say befriended us wonderfully we are well off here we have positions of honour for myself i could wish for nothing better  well at any rate we will wait for a time dick said we may be sent to savandroog again and if so i will not leave the place until i find out from the governor whether he has still a prisoner and if so manage to obtain a sight of him  the next day dick was informed by the chamberlain that the officer who was in charge of the wild beasts had fallen into disgrace and that the sultan had appointed him to the charge dick was well pleased in some respects the work would suit him much better than examining stores and seeing that the servants of the palace did their duty but on the other hand it lessened his chance of being sent to savandroog again however there was no choice in the matter and surajah cheered him by saying  you must not mind dick has not everything turned out for the best and you may be sure that this will turn out so also  it was indeed but two days later that dick congratulated himself upon the change for surajah was sent by tippoo with an order for the execution of four english prisoners dick knew nothing of the matter until surajah on his return told him that he had been obliged to stop and see the orders carried out by poison being forced down the unfortunate officers throats  it was horrible he said with tears in his eyes  horrible dick repeated thank god i have been put to other work for i feel that i could not have done it and yet to have refused to carry out the tyrants orders would have meant death to us both while it would not have saved the lives of these poor fellows anyhow i would not have done it as soon as i had received the order i would have come to you and we would have mounted and ridden off together and taken our chance  let us talk of something else surajah said are the beasts all in good health  as well as they can be when they are fed so badly and so miserably cooped up i made a great row this morning and have kept the men at work all day in cleaning out the places they were all in a horrible state and before i could get the work done i had to threaten to report the whole of them to tippoo and they knew what would come of that i told fazli last night that the beasts must have more flesh and got an order from him that all the bones from the kitchens should be given to them  that evening when dick on his way to the apartments of one of the officers was going along a corridor that skirted the portion of the palace occupied by the zenana a figure came out suddenly from behind the drapery of a door dropped on her knees beside him and seizing his hand pressed it to her forehead it was to all appearance an indian girl in the dress of one of the attendants of the zenana  what is it child he said you must have mistaken me for someone else  no bahador she said it is yourself i wanted to thank one of the other attendants saw you go along this corridor some time ago and ever since i have watched here of an evening whenever i could get away unobserved in hopes of seeing you it was i my lord whom the tiger was standing over when you came to our rescue i was not greatly hurt for i was pushed down when the tiger burst in and save that it seized me with one of its paws and tore my shoulder i was unhurt ever since i have been hoping that the time would come when i could thank you for saving my life  i am glad to have done so child but you had best retire into the zenana it would not be good for you or me were i found talking to you  the girl rose to her feet submissively and he now saw her face which in the dim light that burnt in the corridor he had not hitherto noticed  why he exclaimed with a start you are english  yes sahib i was brought here eight years ago i am fourteen now there were other english girls here then but they were all older than me and have been given away to officers of the sultan i am afraid i shall be too ere long i have dreaded it so much but oh sahib you are a favourite of the sultan if he would but give me to you i should not mind so much  dick was about to reply when he heard a distant footfall  go in he exclaimed someone is coming i will speak to you again in a day or two  when he returned to his room he told surajah what had happened  it will at any rate give me a fresh interest here he said it is terrible to think that a young english girl should be in tippoos power and that he can give her whenever he likes to one of his creatures of course according to our english notions she is still but a young girl but as your people out here marry when the girls are but of the age of this child it is different altogether  she does not suspect that you are english  no as i told you i had only just discovered that she was so when i heard a footstep in the distance but i shall see her again tomorrow or next day  you will be running a great risk surajah said gravely  not much risk i think dick replied she is only a little slave girl and as the tiger was standing over her when i fired no doubt i did save her life and it would be natural enough that she would on meeting me speak to me and express her thanks  that would be a good excuse surajah agreed but a suspicious tyrant like tippoo might well insist that this was only a pretence and that the girl was really giving you a letter or message from one of the inmates of the zenana  dick was silent for a time  i will be very careful he said i must certainly see her again and it seems to me at present that whatever risk there may be i must try to save this poor girl from the fate that awaits her i cannot conceal from myself that however much i may refuse to admit it the hopes of my finding and saving my father are faint indeed and although this girl is nothing to me i should feel that my mission had not been an entire failure if we could take her home with us and restore her to her friends  no i dont think he went on in answer to a grave shake of surajahs head that it would add to our danger in getting away we know that if we try to escape and are caught our lives will be forfeited in any case and if she were disguised as a boy we could travel with her without attracting any more observation than we should alone she would not be missed for hours after she had left and there would be no reason whatever for connecting her departure with ours i dont say surajah that i have made up my mind about itof course it has all come fresh to me and i have not had time to think it over in any way still it does seem to me that when the time for our leaving comes whether we ride off openly as tippoos officers or whether we go off in disguise there ought to be no very great difficulty in taking her away with us you see that yourself dont you  i cant give any opinion about it at present surajah replied i do think that it will add to our difficulties however we may go but i dont say it cannot be managed  i should think not surajah and it would be worth doing however great the difficulties might be just think of the grief that her parents must feel at her loss and the joy when she is restored to them you see it would be no great loss of time if we were obliged to take her down to tripataly first and then come back again to renew our search it would take but a week going and returning and now that the passes are all open to us the difficulties would be nothing to what they were when we went back after our scouting expedition besides at that time they were more vigilant all along the frontier than they will be now because there was war between the two countries and tippoo was anxious that no news of his movements should be taken down there is no talk of war now for though tippoo makes no disguise of his fury at his losses especially at coorg being taken from him and is evidently bent upon fighting again it will take a very long time to get his army into an efficient state to repair his fortresses to complete all the new works of defence he is getting up here and to restore the confidence of his soldiers  i should think it will be fully four or five years before he is ready to fight again at any rate if we once get well away from here with the girl we ought to have no difficulty in getting across the frontier it would mean but a fortnight lost in the search for my father and anyhow we are not making any progress that way as long as we stop here the only drawback would be so far as i can see that we should lose the benefit of our official positions but unless we happen to be sent off with orders to other hill forts that position will only hamper our movements besides we should still have our badges of office and tippoos official orders to the governors possibly the news that we had disappeared might reach the governors of some of the forts in this neighbourhood but it would not be likely to travel very far his officers so frequently fall into disgrace and are either killed or thrown to the tigers that the fact of our being missing would scarce excite a remark and those who heard of it would suppose that we had either been secretly made away with or that having learned that tippoo was displeased with us we had fled  surajah nodded his confidence in his leader was complete and he was always ready to follow unquestioningly  there is one thing surajah dick concluded this state of things cannot last much longer anyhow for next time it might be me he ordered to see to the execution of an english prisoner and that would mean that i should as soon as i received the command make a bolt for it so you see our stay here in any case may not last many days i would rather run any risks than carry out such an order  two evenings later dick went down the corridor at the same hour as that on which he had before met the english girl she came out from behind the hangings at once when he passed  i knew you would come bahador she said joyfully i could see that you were as kind as you were brave and would have pity upon a poor little white slave  i have much that i want to say to you child this is not a good place for speaking someone might come along at any moment how long can you be away without fear of your absence being noticed  not long now she said in the morning i am sent out on messages and could meet you anywhere  very well i will remain in my room all the morning tomorrow and if you do not come then i will stay in next day  i will come the girl said unhesitatingly  he then gave her full instructions how to find his room and made her repeat them to him in order to be sure that she had them correctly  do you know my companion by sight he asked  oh yes i have seen him often  well either he or i will be standing at my door it is as well that you should look carefully round before you enter so as to be sure there is no one in the corridor and that you can slip in unobserved you may be sure that i am asking you to come for no idle freak but because i have something very important to say to you  i fancy i hear footsteps good night  dick was sure that he and surajah would both be at liberty next day for tippoo had that morning started for bangalore where a large number of men were at work repairing the fortifications and removing all signs of the british occupation from the fort and palace he was likely to be away for at least a fortnight as soon as ibrahim had swept the room after their early breakfast dick gave him a number of small commissions to be executed in the town and told him that he should not require him again until it was time to bring up their meal from the kitchen then he and surajah by turns watched at the door  an hour later surajah who was upon the watch said  the girl is coming  there was no one else in sight and when surajah beckoned to her she hurried on and passing through the curtains at the door entered the room it had been arranged that surajah should remain on watch so that should by any chance one of the officials of their acquaintance come along he might go out and talk with him in the corridor and on some excuse or other prevent his entering the room if he showed any intention of doing so  now in the first place dick said as he led the girl to the divan and seated her there what is your name  my name is goorla  no i mean your proper name  my name used to be annieannie mansfield bahador  and my name is dick holland he said in english  she gave a start of surprise  yes annie i am a countryman of yours  she looked at him almost incredulously and then an expression of aversion succeeded that of confidence in her face she sprang from the divan and drew herself up indignantly  please let me go she said haughtily you have saved my life but if you had saved it twenty times i could not like a man who is a deserter  dick had at first been speechless with astonishment at the girls change of manner and at her reception of the news he had thought would have been very pleasant to her as her last words threw a light upon the matter he burst into a merry laugh  i am no deserter annie save my friend at the door and yourself there is no one here who knows that i am english sit down again and i will tell you how i come to be here  my father was the captain of an english ship she was wrecked on the west coast and he was seized and brought up here a prisoner eight years ago my mother who is a daughter of the late rajah of tripataly who married an english lady taught me to speak hindustani so that when i got old enough i could come out here and try to find out if my father was still alive and if so to help him to escape i had only just come up here with my friend who is an officer of the rajahs when that affair with the tiger took place then as you know tippoo made us both officers in the palace of course while we are here we can do nothing towards finding out about my father and we should not have remained here much longer anyway and may have to leave at any moment since you met me and i found that there was an english girl captive here it has of course changed my plans and i feel that i could not go away and leave you to the fate you told me of and that if possible i must take you away with me that is of course if you are willing to go with us and prepared to run a certain amount of risk  do not take on so he continued as the girl threw herself on her knees and clinging to him burst into a passion of tears do not cry like that and stooping down he lifted her and placed her in a corner of the divan there he said patting her on the shoulder as she sobbed almost convulsively try and compose yourself we may be disturbed at any moment and may not have an opportunity of talking again so we must make our arrangements in readiness to leave suddenly i may find it necessary to go at an hours notice you may as you said be given by tippoo to one of his favourites at any time fortunately he has gone away for a fortnight so we have at any rate that time before us to make our plans still it is better that we should arrange now as much as we can    chapter 15 escape   annie mansfield was not long before she mastered her emotions she had learned to do so in a bitter school beaten for the slightest fault or at the mere caprice of one of her many mistresses she had learned to suffer pain without a tear to assume a submissive attitude under the greatest provocation to receive without attempting to defend herself punishment for faults she had not committed and to preserve an appearance of cheerfulness when her heart seemed breaking at the hopelessness of any deliverance from her fate for the last six months she had been specially unhappy for when seringapatam had been besieged she had hoped that when it was captured her countrymen would search the palace and see that this time no english captive remained behind her disappointment then when she heard that peace had been made and that the english army was to march away without even an attempt to see that the condition for the release of captives was faithfully carried out had for a time completely crushed her and all hope had forsaken her  thus then while she had been for a moment overwhelmed at finding that her preserver from the tiger was a countryman in disguise and that he was willing to make an attempt to rescue her yet in a few minutes she stifled her sobs hastily thrust back the hair that had fallen over her face uncoiled herself from her crouching position in the angle of the divan and rose to her feet  i can hardly believe it to be true she said in a low voice oh sahib do you really mean what you say and are you willing to run the risk of taking me away with you  of course i am dick said heartily you dont suppose that an englishman would be so base as to leave a young countrywoman in the hands of these wretches i do not think that there is much risk in it of course you will have to disguise yourself and there may be some hardships to go through but once away from here we are not likely to be interfered with you see my friend and i are officers of the palace and no one would venture to question us as we should be supposed to be travelling upon the sultans business there is peace at present and although tippoo may intend some day or other to fight again everything is settling down quietly traders go about the country unquestioned there is plenty of traffic on the roads from one town to another and so long as your disguise is good enough to prevent your being recognised as a white there is no greater danger in travelling in mysore than there would be down in the carnatic  annie stood before him with her fingers playing nervously with each other long trained in habits of implicit obedience and to stand in an attitude of deep respect before her numerous mistresses she was in ignorance whether she ought to speak or not she had been but a child of six when she had been carried off her remembrance of english manners had quite died out and the habit of silent submission had become habitual to her dick was puzzled by her silence  of course annie he said at last i dont want you to go with me if you would rather stay here or if you are afraid of the risk of travelling  she looked up with frightened eyes  oh sahib it is not that i would go even if i felt sure i should be found out and cut to pieces anything would be better than this i am not afraid at all  but forgive me sahib i dont know how to thank you i dont know what is proper to say it is all so strange and so wonderful  oh that is all right annie dick said cheerfully of course you will feel it a little strange just at starting  well in the first place you must call me dick instead of calling me sahib and in the next place you must talk to me freely as a friend and not stand as if i were your master while we are on this journey together consider me as a sort of big brother when we get down the ghauts i shall hand you over to the care of my mother who is living at present at tripataly with her brother the rajah  now sit down again and let us make our arrangements when we have done that we can talk if there is time now how am i to let you know if i have to go away suddenly do you always get out at this time of a morning  not always but very often i always go down at twelve oclock with some of the other slave girls to fetch the food and sweetmeats for the ladies of the harem  well you must always manage even if you are not sent out to look out through that doorway where you met me at eight oclock in the morning if we have anything particular to say to you surajahthat is my friend you knowwill be there which way do you go out from the harem to fetch the food  not from that door but from the one nearest to the kitchen you go right down that corridor and then take the first turning to the right there is a flight of stairs at its end we come out at the door just at its head at the foot of the stairs there is a long passage and at the end of that is a large room with tables on which the dishes are placed in readiness for us to bring back  well if it is necessary to speak to you at once one of us will meet you in the passage between the bottom of the stairs and the room where the food is if you see one of us you will know that the matter is urgent and as soon as you can possibly slip away you must come here in the evening you had better again look out from the door where you first met me  now as to the disguise it will be better for you to go as a boy it would be strange to see a girl riding behind two of the officers of the palace you wont mind that will you  not at all sahib  not at all dick he corrected well i will have a dress ready for you here you will find it in that corner and there will be a bottle of stain on the table it will be only necessary for you to colour your neck hands and feet but you must cut off your hair behind to a level with your ears so that none of it will show below the turban you must do that of course before you stain your neck and must stain the skin where you have cut off your hair also i am giving you these instructions now because when the time comes there may not be a minute to spare though of course i hope there will be no desperate hurry  i understand she said and will look out for you three times a day  of course he went on if you are suddenly told that you are to be given to any one you must slip out at once and come here you will find everything ready for you to disguise yourself and you must do that at once and wait here till one of us comes even if you are missed it will be some time before any search is made and it would be thought much more likely that you had gone down into the town than that you were hiding in the palace so there would be no chance of their looking for you here before we return anyhow we shall be able to have another talk before tippoo comes back we shall be here every morning until nine and if you are able to get away again come and see us  it will be better perhaps for you not to wait any longer now i suppose you have been charged with some message or other and it would not do for you to be too long gone  the girl stood up at once  i have to go down to the pettah to get some sewing silk to match this and she drew out a small fragment of yellow silk  very well then you had better go and do it or they may think that you are too long away  goodbye annie i hope that in another week or ten days at the latest i shall have you out of this and he held out his hand to her  she took it timidly and would have raised it to her forehead but dick said laughing  that is not the way annie english girls dont treat their friends as if they were lords and masters they just shake hands with them as if it were two men or two girls  i shall know better in time she said with a faint smile though her eyes were full of tears i want to do something though i dont know what you saved my life from the tiger and now you are going to save me again i should like to throw myself down and kiss your feet  you would make me horribly uncomfortable if you did anything of the sort annie i can understand that you feel strange and out of your element at present but you will soon get over that when you come to know me better  there goodbye lassie i hope to see you again tomorrow or next day and then you will be able to tell me more about yourself  is the coast clear surajah  surajah looked out through the curtains  there is no one in sight he said a moment later  the girl passed silently out and went down the corridor surajah returned from his post by the door  the poor girl is shy and awkward as yet dick said but i think she will be plucky enough when the time comes you heard what we said the first thing will be to get her disguise ready for her what do you think had we better take ibrahim with us i think he is to be trusted  i am sure he is surajah agreed he is a hindoo of coorg and was carried away as a slave six years ago in the first place he will be delighted at the prospect of getting away and in the next i am sure that he is very fond of you but there is no occasion to tell him that you are english  no it will be time enough to do that when we get over the ghauts it will be better that he should get the disguise in the first place he will know exactly what is wanted and in the next it would look rum for either of us to be buying such a thing of course we could ask pertaub to get it for us but if we take ibrahim with us he may as well buy it  we shall want a couple more horses these of course we can buy ourselves and saddles and things when we have got them we had better leave them at some place on the other side of the river pertaub would help us there he is sure to know someone who will look after them for a few days then ibrahim and the girl can start together go over there and saddle them so as to be in readiness to mount directly we come along we will stop at the wood and dig up the caskets there is nothing like taking them away with us when there is a chance and it is not likely that we shall come back to seringapatam againit would be like putting our heads into a tigers den  when ibrahim brought in the dishes for their meal dick said  go down and get your own food ibrahim and when you have done come back here again i want to have a talk with you  they had just finished their meal when ibrahim returned  ibrahim would you be glad of a chance of getting away from here and returning to your own country  i would have given anything to do so my lord ibrahim said before i was ordered to attend upon you but i am happy now you are kind to me and i should not like to leave your service  but if i were going too ibrahim  then my lord i would go with you anywhere if you would take me  well ibrahim we feel sure that we can trust you and so i may tell you that i think it likely we shall very shortly go away you know what the sultan is one day he gives you honours and rewards the next he disgraces you and perhaps sends you into the ranks of the army perhaps has you thrown to the tigers we do not care to live under such conditions and we mean in a few days to slip away and go to our friends down the ghauts you can come with us if you like  i would go with you to the end of the world my lord ibrahim exclaimed earnestly to go with you and be a free man and not a slave would be almost too great happiness  very well then that is settled now ibrahim we are not going alone we are going to take with us a young white slave in the harem and restore her to her friends i want you to get a disguise for her let it be a dress like your ownlong white trousers to the ankle a shirt and tunic with waist belt also the stuff for a turban that you must wind in proper folds as she would not be able to do it herself i also want a bottle of stain for the skin  i will get them my lord how tall is she  about half a head shorter than you are she is about the size of an average hindoo woman  shall i get the things at once my lord  yes you had better get them today we may leave at any time and it is as well to have them in readiness we shall buy two horses one for each of you and have them taken across the river you can ride i suppose  yes i used to ride when i was a boy before tippoo came down and killed my father and mother and brought me up here will my lord want me to take the horses across  i will tell you that in the morning ibrahim we are going down into the town now to inquire about them but we shall not buy any until tomorrow as we shall have to make arrangements for them to be kept for us until we want them  they did not go out until it was dark and then took their way to pertaubs house the old hindoo was in  i am glad to see you sahibs he said to dick as they entered i have always fears that ill may in some way befall you  we are going to leave pertaub surajah had two days ago to go up to see four english prisoners put to death at one of the hill forts next time i may be ordered on such a duty i could not carry it out and you know that refusal would probably mean death moreover we are convinced that we have no means here of finding out what captives may still be in tippoos hands and have therefore determined to leave we are going to take with us our servant ibrahim who is a slave from coorg and will we know be faithful to us and also a young english girl who has for eight years been a slave in tippoos harem she will go with us in the disguise of a boy this ibrahim is getting for us we are going to buy a couple of horses for them and shall make straight down the ghauts where i shall leave the girl in my mothers care  it is a good action the hindoo said gravely  now in the first place pertaub would you like to go with us riding as we shall do as two of the officers of the palace it is not likely that any questions whatever will be asked and certainly we shall have no difficulty until it comes to crossing the frontier  no sahib i thank you but i am too old now for any fresh change i have friends here and have none below the ghauts nothing save the rescue of my daughter from the harem would induce me to move now and of that there is little chance she will by this time have become reconciled to her fate and would probably not care to escape were an opportunity offered to her besides with only me to protect her what would she do elsewhere a few months and she might be left alone in the world  as to that dick said i could promise her the protection of my aunt the wife of the rajah of tripataly after the kindness that you have shown to us she would i am sure gladly take her into her service and there would be no difficulty about a dowry for her i would see to that  the old man shook his head  there could be no question of marriage he said but should i ever hear from her that she is unhappy and i can arrange to fly with her i will assuredly avail myself of your offer and take her to tripataly rejoiced indeed that at my death there will be a shelter open to her  and now can i aid you in any way sahib one of my friends a merchant could get the horses for you without difficulty he has often occasion to buy them for the purposes of his trade  thank you pertaub i had intended to buy them myself but doubtless it will be safer for somebody else to do so what i was going to ask you was to let me know of some place on the other side of the river where the horses could be kept until i want them  that i can do sahib i have a friend a cultivator his house stands by itself on this side of the first villagethe one half a mile beyond the ford it is the only house this side of the village so you cannot mistake it it lies about a hundred yards back from the road i will go over and arrange with him that when two horses arrive they shall be placed in his stalls and remain there until one arrives who will say to him after greeting the word madras to him he is to deliver the horses at once whether he comes by night or day  that would do admirably pertaub of course i shall also want saddles and bridles how much do you think it will come to altogether i do not want showy horses but they must be animals capable of performing a long journey and of travelling at a fair rate of speedthe faster the better we are likely to get seven or eight hours start at least but must of course travel fast as long as all goes well i shall keep the main roads but if there is a breakdown or an unforeseen accident occurs i may have to leave the road and take to bypaths  the cost of such horses would be about eighty rupees each the saddles and bridles another fifteen or twenty  then here are two hundred rupees pertaub  have you given up all hope of finding your father sahib i have felt so sure that you would be successful it seemed to me that such brave efforts could not go unrewarded  no pertaub i have not given it up at all i intend to stay at tripataly for a fortnight with my mother and shall then come up the ghauts again  that is another matter i want to speak to you about of course we should not dare to return to seringapatam and i think that we had better settle to go to bangalore could you forward our packs with the merchandise to someone in that town  there will be no difficulty in that sahib there are many hindoo merchants there who have been forced to change their religion and who have frequent dealings with traders here one of my friends will i am sure forward your goods with the next consignment that he sends to bangalore that also i will arrange tomorrow and when you come in the evening will give you the name of the trader there together with a letter from the one here telling him that you are the person to whom the goods are to be given up  thank you pertaub i dont know what we should have done without your assistance  it has been a pleasure to me to be of use to you sahib i had thought my time of usefulness was over and it has given a real pleasure to my life to have been able to aid you you will let me know sahib if ever you find your father  certainly pertaub i will in any case send word to you either that i have found him or that i have given up all hope and have abandoned my efforts  the next morning a lad brought dick a message from pertaub that he had fulfilled all his commissions and on the following morning annie mansfield again came to dicks room  everything is going on well annie dick said as he shook hands with her the horses have been bought there is your disguise in that corner and we can start any moment at a quarter of an hours notice  now i want you to tell me how you came to be brought up here  i have not much to tell she said you see i was only six years old i can remember there was a great deal of firing of guns and that lasted for a long time then the firing stopped i suppose the place surrendered  do you know what place it was annie  she shook her head  i do not know at all i suppose i did know then but i do not remember ever to have heard the name i remember quite well that there were soldiers and father and mother and servants and many other people and everyone was very miserable and we all went together out of a gate and on each side there were a great many natives with guns and swords some on horse and some on foot and there were elephants i dont think i had ever seen one before for i noticed them particularly we went on and on and i know one of the soldiers carried me  at night we stopped somewhere i think it was in a wood and there were fires and we lay down to sleep on the ground then i woke up suddenly and there was a great noise and firing of guns and someone caught me up and threw something over my head and i dont remember anything more for a long time i know that presently i was on horseback before a fiercelooking man there were a good many of them and when i cried for my father and mother they said they would cut off my head if i were not quiet  i do not know how long we were travelling but after the first day there was only the man who carried me and another i was brought here and there were many people and i was very much frightened then i found myself only among women and they took off my clothes and dressed me in their fashion i think i was very happy when i once got accustomed to it the ladies made a sort of pet of me and i was taught to dance and to sing little native songs there were other white girls here and they were all very kind to me though they always seemed very sad and i could not make out why they cried so often especially when they were beaten for crying  as i grew bigger i was not so happy i had ceased to be a plaything and little by little i was set to work to sweep and dust and then to sew and then to do all sorts of work like the other slave girls the other white girls gradually went away the oldest first the last two who were two or three years older than i was went about three years ago  at first i used to wonder why they cried so when they went and why the others all cried too but by the time the last two left i had come to know all about it and knew that they had been given by the sultan to his favourite officers  there were many white men here when i first came when i went out with one of the slaves into the town i saw them often sometimes they would burst into tears when they saw me then i used to wonder why but i know now that i must have reminded them of girls of their own whom they would never see again then till three years ago there were about twenty white boys who had been taught to dance and sing and who used to come sometimes dressed up like women to amuse the ladies of the harem but i heard that they were all killed when the sultan first thought that the english might come here one of the slave girls told me that it was done because the sultan had often sworn to the english that there were no white captives here and so he did not wish that any should be found if they came  i dont think that i have anything else to tell you  well i hope that what you have told me will be enough to enable us some day to find out who you belong to evidently you were in some place that was besieged eight years ago and had to surrender the garrison were promised their lives and liberty to depart they were attacked at night by an armed party who may have been hyders horsemen but who were perhaps merely a party of mounted robbers who thought that they might be able to take some loot most likely they were defeated especially as you saw no other captives in the party but in the confusion of the night attack one of them probably came upon you and carried you off thinking you would be an acceptable present here and that he would get a reward for you from the sultan  are you not noticed when you go into the streets on errands  no i always go veiled except the slaves who are old and ugly all the others wear veils when they go outside the palace and we all wear a red scarf which shows we are servants in the harem and so even when the town is full of rough soldiers no one ventures to speak to us  now tell me dickyou see i have not forgottenall about how you came to be here  dick told her briefly how he had come out with his mother and how finding war had broken out he had joined the army and how at the end of the war having been able to learn nothing about his father he had come up with surajah to search for him  and then you saw that tiger break in the girl said eagerly that was dreadful i will tell you how it was the tiger came to seize me i was standing behind a lady and could not see anything suddenly they all began screaming and ran some to one side some to the other of the window and i who could not think what was the matter remained where i was when there was a great cry and before i had time to move or even to wonder some great thing knocked me down it was only from the screams of the ladies and their cries of tiger that i knew what had happened i felt something heavy standing on meso heavy that i could hardly breathe and indeed i did not try to breathe for i knew many stories of tigers and had heard that sometimes when a man shams being dead the tiger will walk away and kill someone else  the tiger was keeping up an angry growl and i felt that unless it took its paw off me i should soon die when i heard a shot and a fierce growl from the tiger and then the weight was gone and i think i fainted when i came round i was lying where i fell for many of the ladies were insensible and everyone was too busy with them to think anything of me  when i got up one of the other slave girls who had been brave enough to look out of the window told me that it had been killed by two young men one of whom must have been the one who had fired the shot in at the window i went and looked out and saw it lying there after that every one talked and laughed and cried and then the sultans chief wife said that everyone must make a present to the young men who had saved us and that each one ought to give one of her best jewels of course everyone did i had nothing to give except a little cross of gold filigree work that hung round my neck when i was carried off it had been hidden by my dress the men had not noticed it and they had not taken it away when i was brought here it was such a poor little gift but it was all i had  i noticed it annie dick said there was a little flat plate behind it with the letters a m and i thought then that it must be some little ornament taken from one of the englishwomen hyders troops killed it is fortunate you kept it for it may be useful someday in proving that you are annie mansfield  now i must be going she said i was slapped and pinched last time for being so long but i have several things to get today so that if i hurry i can be back again as soon as they expect me you have not settled when you are going yet  no but we rather think of going the day after tomorrow it will be better to do so before tippoo comes back for we might be ordered away so quickly as to have no time to make arrangements besides there will be ten times as many people about in the palace and more guards at the entrances when he returns so altogether it will be better to go before he does so if we settle it so i will come along past your door tomorrow evening and if i say tomorrow morning get here as soon as you can in the morning and directly you have stained your skin and put on your disguise we will start my servant who is going with us will act as your guide and will take you to the place where the horses are and where we shall join you almost as soon as you get there  at the appointed time next evening dick told annie that they should start in the morning he and surajah then went down and said goodbye to pertaub and dick gave him a letter to his aunt to give to her should he ever go to tripataly with his daughter  it may be he said that neither surajah nor i may be there but i shall speak to her about you and of course tell her how much you have done for us so you may be sure of the heartiest welcome from her  and you will also find a hearty friend in my father rajbullub surajah said he is principal officer in the rajahs household and will treat you as a brother and your daughter as if she were my sister  then they returned to the palace where they had a final talk over the route that it would be best to pursue the nearest point to the new frontier was the territory ceded to the english on the malabar coast but this would entail a long sea voyage and they therefore determined to make for caveripatam going by the road that led through anicull and then through ryacotta which stood just outside the line of territory ceded to england and from whence a road led direct down the passes anicull lay nearly due south of bangalore but the road they would follow would not be the one by which tippoo would return as he would come by the main road which ran in a direct line between the two cities  ibrahim was informed of their plans and was told to warn the syce to get their horses saddled and in readiness at eight oclock and that as they were going for a long days ride he would not be required to accompany themas he always did when they rode only into the town for then he might be wanted to hold the horses if they dismounted and went into a shop  he was also to give notice in the kitchen that they would not return to the midday meal and that dishes for them would therefore not be required thus it would be unlikely that any suspicion would be aroused by their absence until they had been gone twentyfour hours by which time they would be more than halfway to the frontier  they went to bed at their usual time and slept soundly for it seemed to them both that there was practically no risk whatever to be run and that they would be across the frontier before any active search was made for them even when it was discovered that they had left the palace it would be thought that they had received some order from bangalore either to join the sultan or to go on some mission for him that had occupied more time than they had anticipated on starting the idea that two officers who were considered to stand high in tippoos favour should desert would scarcely occur to anyone  in the morning they were up early completed their slight preparations and took their early breakfast reserving a portion for annie who they thought would not improbably have eaten nothing before coming to them  she was a quarter of an hour late in arriving and looked somewhat pale and flurried  they did not send me out this morning she said and so i had to stay until i could slip out without being noticed but they may miss me at any moment  that will be all right dick said confidently they will search all the rooms in the harem for you first and certainly wont look for you outside until there has been a lot of talk over your absence but even if they do search you will be able in a few minutes to walk through the middle of them without being suspected  however we will lose no time and to begin with i will cut off what hair is necessary i shall do it a good deal quicker than you would then we will leave you to yourself to stain your skin and put on your disguise when you have finished clap your hands ibrahim will come in and see that your disguise is all right and that your turban covers your hair then he will go with you we shall be waiting near the gate there is practically no chance of your being asked any questions but if you are and there is any difficulty we will pass you through all right having seen you on your way we shall mount and follow you  the operation of cutting off annies hair to the line of her ears was speedily done then with a few reassuring words dick joined surajah in the corridor as they walked down it he said  i dont like leaving them to themselves look here surajah you go down to the stable and mount at once tell the syce i shall come for my horse in a few minutes then ride out and take your post where you can see them come out of the gate and then follow them closely i will stay here and see them safely through the gate and then mount and follow you i shall overtake you before you get to the ford  that will perhaps be safest surajah agreed though i should think there is no chance of her being suspected seeing that she will be with ibrahim even if they met one of the palace officers and he asked ibrahim who he had with him he could say it was a lad who had come to you respecting some horses you had bought  yes that would do very well  dick returned to ibrahim who was squatting down in the corridor near the door  i am going to follow you until you are through the gate and shall keep a short distance behind you if you should meet any officer on your way out who may ask you who you have with you say he has come with a message to me from a trader in the town by the time you have told him that i shall be up  there is no chance of being questioned my lord people come and go all day  that is so ibrahim but one cannot be too careful  they stood talking together until they heard annie clap her hands within ibrahim entered at once and in two or three minutes came out again with the girl ibrahim carried a bundle  you will do very well dick said to annie i should not know you in the least you make a capital boy  what bundle is that ibrahim i thought you took our other disguises on yesterday to the stable where the horses are  yes my lord i took them on these are the things she has taken off i thought perhaps it would be better not to leave them here as if they were found it would be known that she had gone with you  i dont think it makes much difference ibrahim but perhaps it is as well to bring them away we can leave the bundle in the wood  now go along i will follow perhaps i had better go first keep a few paces behind me  they passed through the long passages of the palace without attracting the slightest attention once or twice dick paused to speak to some officials of his acquaintance the others stopping respectfully a few paces away then he went out into the courtyard and across to the gate and as the sentries saluted he stopped and asked them a few questions as to the regiment they belonged to until ibrahim and his companion who had passed straight through were well away he saw surajah sitting upon his horse a couple of hundred yards away and then went to the stables    chapter 16 the journey   the syce brought out his horse as soon as he saw dick approaching  you need not wait up for us after nine oclock dick said as he mounted it is possible that we may be detained and shall not return until tomorrow evening if we come we shall certainly be back by nine at the latest and we shall not be back before seven at any rate so that until then you are free to do as you like  he rode quietly off and did not quicken his pace until he had got beyond the fort then he touched the horse with his heel and cantered down to the ford surajah was halfway across the river when he reached it the other two figures were just ascending the road up the other bank  surajah checked his horse when he got across and waited till dick joined him  shall we go on with them to the farmhouse he asked  we may as well do so as halt in the road besides there are the things ibrahim took over yesterday to put into our saddlebags there is another thing that i never thought of of course the girl has never been on a horse and that may give us a good deal of trouble i wonder i did not think of it though if i had i dont see that anything else could have been done we must see how she gets on and if she cannot manage i must take her before me whenever we see that the road is clear for a good distance ahead of course it does not matter about country people but if we see a body of troops coming in the distance she must mount her own horse again and follow us at a walk if we find that things dont go well we must halt in a wood somewhere and ride only by night  they cantered on now and overtook the others just as they reached the farmhouse the farmer was at his door and looked a little surprised at seeing two of the officers of the palace come up he salaamed deeply  we have not come to requisition anything dick said with a smile as he saw that the farmer looked alarmed as well as surprised we have only come for the two horses that we have bought for our servants as we are going on a journey  can i assist you in any way my lords  no our men will saddle the horses dick said and dismounting went into the stable with ibrahim and annie  you are not afraid of riding i hope annie he said  i am not afraid of anything dick so that i can but get away  we will go quietly at first anyhow mind as you mount put your left foot in the stirrup when you are seated carry yourself as easily as you can the pony looks quiet enough but if when we get fairly off you find that you cannot sit comfortably you must get up before me and ibrahim must lead your pony when we are fairly on the road i will fasten a bit of rope to your bridle to act as a leading rein and you can ride by my side unless we see people coming along then you must drop behind with ibrahim  i wont give more trouble than i can help she said  ibrahim had taken some rugs over with him on the previous afternoon which had been bought in case they should sleep out at night when the horses were saddled dick rolled two of these up strapped one on the high peak and the other on the cantle of the saddle upon which the girl was to ride  that will wedge you in pretty tightly he said  now ibrahim put the things into the saddlebag and then we shall be ready  when this was done the two horses were led outside the farmer had gone back into the house and dick helping the girl into her seat arranged the stirrups the right length for her  now he said you must keep your knees pressed against the roll of blankets in front and hold on as well as you can with them but the principal thing is for you to balance yourself with your body dont sit up stiffly but as if you were in a chair  now we will start at a walk ibrahim will keep quite close to you so as to be able to catch hold of your rein should there be any occasion for him to do so  then mounting he and surajah rode off at a walk the others following a length or two behind them dick looked round from time to time and saw that annie exhibited no signs of nervousness  i am quite comfortable she said in reply to one of his glances  when they got into the road again dick said  we will go at an easy canter now annie if you feel as if you could not keep on call out and we will stop directly but first come up between surajah and myself and we will take the leading reins so that you will have nothing to attend to but holding on  two cords had been attached to the bridle before setting out and surajah and dick each taking one they started again the horses instinctively breaking into a canter which was their usual pace annie at first grasped the strap of the rug in front of her but as soon as she became accustomed to the motion she let go a small rug had been strapped over the saddle before she mounted and this afforded her a much better hold than she would have had of the leather and as the pace of the horse was a gentle one she found it much more easy to keep her seat than she had expected moreover the fact that dick and surajah rode close by her side and would be able to catch her at once if she swayed in the saddle gave her confidence  it is much better than i thought it would be she said it is quite a pleasant motion i will go faster if you like  no there is no occasion for that dick replied this is the pace the horses are most accustomed to and they will go on longer at it than at any other there is no fear of pursuit and we have all day before us  after a quarter of a miles riding they came to a wood  we must turn in here dick said we are going treasure hunting we hid those caskets that were given us by the ladies directly after we got them and we are going to dig them up now and take them with us  they rode at a walk now till they came to a very large baobab tree growing by the path they were following  here we turn off  there is a man there surajah exclaimed when they had ridden a few yards farther  dick checked his horse  it is pertaub he said a moment later and in a minute they were beside the hindoo  i could not sleep thinking of you sahib the latter said as they came up so i came across here partly to help you dig up the caskets and partly that i might see you and assure myself that so far all had gone well  thank you pertaub you have i see brought a pickaxe it will save us half an hours work and besides i am glad to say goodbye again  all has gone well this is the young lady  she is well disguised pertaub said bowing his head to annie she looks so like a boy that even now you tell me i can scarce believe she is a white girl truly you can go on without fear that anyone will suspect her  leading the way to the spot where the caskets had been buried dick looked on while surajah and ibrahim dug them up they were then wrapped up in rugs and strapped securely behind their owners saddles then after a warm adieu to the kind old man they turned their horses heads and rode back out of the woods  after riding for three hours at a canter dick saw that although annie still spoke cheerfully her strength was failing her and on arriving at a wood he said  we will wait here till the heat of the sun has abated we have done very well and the horses as well as ourselves will be glad of a few hours rest  he alighted from the saddle gave his horse to ibrahim and then lifted annie from her seat as he set her down on her feet and loosed his hold of her she slipped down on to the ground dick and surajah at once raised her and placed her so that as she sat she could lean against a tree  here dick supported her while surajah ran and fetched his water bottle annie drank a little and then said with a nervous laugh  it is very silly of me but i feel better now my legs seemed to give way altogether  it was not silly at all dick said you have held on most bravely i can tell you there are not many girls who would have ridden four or five and twenty miles the first time they sat on a horse why i can tell you the first time i mounted i did not do a quarter as much and i was so stiff i could hardly walk when i got down i should have stopped before but you kept talking so cheerfully that it seemed to me you could not be anything like as tired as i was then i was a brute not to have known that you must be thoroughly done up although you did not say so  we have got some food with us do you think you could eat a little  she shook her head  not just yet  all right i have brought a couple of bottles of wine i got at one of the traders stores yesterday you must take a sip of that and then we will leave you to yourself for a bit and you must lie down and have a good nap  dick took a bottle from his holster opened it and gave her some in a tin cup then one of the rugs was spread on the ground with another one rolled up as a pillow and then they led the horses farther into the wood leaving annie to herself  she wont be able to ride again tonight surajah said as they sat down while ibrahim took out the provisions that he had on the previous day carried across to the farm  no i must carry her before me we will shift my saddle a little farther back and strap a couple of rugs in front of it so as to make a comfortable seat for her there is no doubt she will not be able to ride again by herself i am sure that after my first days riding i could not have gone on again for anything  we wont start until it begins to get dusk of course she ought to have a good twentyfour hours rest before she goes on but we dare not risk that i dont think there is any chance of pursuit for days or indeed of any pursuit at all for by the time they begin to suspect that we have really deserted they will know that we have had time to get to the frontier still i dont want to run the slightest risk and at any rate if we have to halt it would be better to do so fifty miles farther on than here  when we mount again we will put the saddlebags from my horse on to hers and ibrahim must lead it her weight wont make much difference to my horse and if i find it tiring i will change with you you may as well put your saddlebags on to her horse also  it would be better would it not surajah said if you change to her horse which will have carried nothing  yes of course that would be best so you had better not shift your saddlebags  after they had had their meal they stretched themselves out for a sleep and when they woke it was already becoming dusk the horses had had a good feed and were now given a drink of water from the skin they were then saddled again the blankets carefully arranged for annies use and then they went back to the place where she was lying still asleep  put the provisions into the wallet again ibrahim we will see if we can get her up without waking her she is so dead beat that perhaps we may do so i dont suppose she would be able to eat anything if we woke her  i had better mount first then you surajah can lift her up to me i can stoop down and take her from your arms and put her in front of me she is no weight to speak of  very gently surajah put his arms under the sleeping girl and lifted her  that is right dick said as he placed her on the blankets before him and held her with his right arm with her head against his shoulder she is dead asleep  the blankets were strapped on to the horses again the others mounted and they started at a walk out of the wood as soon as they were on the road the horses broke into a canter again annie moaned uneasily but did not open her eyes dick drew her still more closely to him  she will do now surajah he said in a low voice i hope that she will sleep till morning  half an hour later they rode through sultanpetta it was quite dark now and although there were people in the streets dick knew that at the rate they were riding in the darkness the fact that he was carrying a lad in front of him would scarce be noticed nor would it be of any consequence if it were as even if they met any officer who should stop and question them it would suffice to say that the lad had been taken ill and that their business being urgent they were taking him on with them  four hours later they passed through conkanelly and crossed the bridge over a branch of the cauvery here dick felt that his horse was flagging halting he dismounted and lifted annie down this time the movement woke her she gave a little cry  where am i she asked  you are quite safe child dick said cheerfully just lie quiet in my arms we have come five hours journey and as my horse is getting tired i am changing to yours ibrahim is shifting the rugs that you have been sitting on  i can go on by myself she said making a little struggle to get down  you must be good and do what you are told he said with a laugh remember that you are a slave and i am your master at present  she said nothing more until they were seated afresh and had got into motion  oh you are good dick she sighed softly only to think of your carrying me like this for five hours without waking me  well it was much better for us both that you should sleep he said and it is the horse that is carrying you not i i have been very comfortable i can assure you  we shall go on for another four hours after that we shall hide up in a wood and sleep till the afternoon then it will depend upon you if you can sit your horse we shall ride on through anicull if not we must wait till it gets dark again and then go on as we are now are you comfortable child  very comfortable dick  they were talking in english now for the first time since they started  i have almost forgotten how to talk english she said we white girls always used to talk it when we were together so as not to forget it and since the last one went three years ago i have always talked it to myself for a bit before going to sleep so as to keep it up but it does not come anything like so easy as the other still i like talking it to you it almost seems as if i were at home again you see i have never heard a man talk english since i was carried away even now i can hardly believe this is not a happy dream and that i shall not wake up presently and find myself a slave girl in the harem  it is pleasant to me to talk english too dick said though it is only a few months since i last spoke it now the best thing you can do is to try and get off to sleep again when we stop you shall have breakfast i am sure you must want something you have had nothing since you ate a mouthful or two in my room before starting  oh i have slept hours and hours she said i shall not want to sleep any more  however before long the easy motion lulled her off again and she did not wake until at about four oclock in the morning they entered a wood that was as dick supposed some three or four miles from anicull  well how do you feel now dick asked as he set her on her feet  i feel stiff she said but that will soon wear off when i have run about a little oh how tired you must be after carrying me all these hours  there has not been much to hold dick said with a laugh especially since we started the last time before that you were so dead asleep that i did have to hold you but you see you nestled up more comfortably when we changed horses and needed very little support since then  now what can i do she asked with a little laugh please order me to do something i am your slave you know and i want to be helping you  well then i command you to aid me to gather some sticks for a fire we have nothing to cook but it will be cheerful and the air is cool  they picked up sticks while surajah and ibrahim loosened the girths of the horses took off their bridles and poured out another feed from the bag of grain they had brought with them in a few minutes a fire was blazing and the wallet of provisions brought out  i wish i had a cup of coffee to offer you annie dick said as he poured her out some wine and water but we must wait for that until we get down to tripataly  i have forgotten all about coffee dick and what it tastes like the white girls used to talk about it and say how they longed for a cup it seems to me funny to drink anything hot i have never tasted anything but water that i can remember until you gave me that wine yesterday  it is very nice and very refreshing there is another drink that is coming into fashion it is called tea i have tasted it a few times but i dont like it as well as coffee and it is much more expensive  the sultan says that all the english get drunk and there used to be pictures of them on the walls they used to make me so angry  i dont say that no english get drunk annie because there is no doubt that some do but it is very far from being true of the great proportion of them tippoo only says it to excite the people against us because now that he has made them all mohammedans they cannot drink wineat any rate openly when i bought these two bottles the trader made a great mystery over it and if i had not given him a sign he understood and which made him believe that i was a hindoo and not a mussulman he would not have admitted that he kept it at all he did say so at first for i have no doubt he thought that as i was an officer of the palace it was a snare and that if he had admitted he had wine i should have reported him and it would have served as an excuse for his being fined and perhaps having all his goods confiscated when i made the sign that an old hindoo had taught me his manner changed directly and he took me to the back of his little shop and produced the wine i told him i wanted it for medicine and that was quite true for i thought it was a drug you were very likely to need on your journey  how much farther have we to ride she asked after a pause  only about thirtyfive milesthat is to say it is only that distance to the frontier there is a road that is rather more direct but it passes through oussoor a large town which we had better avoid it is not more than fifty miles from the frontier to tripataly but once across the line we can take matters easily and stop whenever you get tired  it will be all very strange to me dick i shant mind it as long as you are with me but it will be dreadful when you go i am afraid your mother wont like me you see i know nothing of english ways and i am oh so ignorant i cannot even readat least very little one of the girls used to teach me from a book she had when she was carried off it was a bibleshe used to tell me stories out of it but one day they found it and she was beaten very much for venturing to have it i am afraid i have quite forgotten even my letters but she and the other girls used to teach me about religion and told me i must never forget that i was a christian whatever they might do to me and i was to say my prayers every night after i lay down and every morning before i got up of course i have always done it  you need not be afraid of my mother annie she is very kind and i am sure she will take to you very much and will be very glad that i have brought you to tripataly for you see she has no girls of her own she will teach you to read and write and if we go back to england i dare say you will go to school for a time so as to learn things like other girls  i can work very nicely she said the ladies of the harem all used to say that  well you will find that very useful no doubt  and what else is there to learn she asked  no end of things annieat least there are no end of things for boys to learn i do not know anything about girls but of course you will have to get to know something of history and geography  what is geography dick  well geography is where countries and places are for instance you know something of the geography of india without ever having learnt it you know that madras and the carnatic lie to the east and travancore to the southwest and malabar to the west and the mahratta country and the nizams dominions to the north well that is the geography of this part of the countrythat and the names of the towns and rivers in the same way there are a lot of nations in europe and you want to know all about them and where they lie with respect to each other and the names of their principal towns then there are america and africa and asia and all the countries in them if you dont know about these things you cant follow what people are talking about  and did you like learning geography dick she asked a little anxiously  well no i cant say that i did annie i think i used to hate geography it was very hard to remember where all the places were and what rivers they stood on i know very little about it now except the principal towns and places but then i never was very fond of learning anything i was a very stupid boy at school  oh i am sure you could not have been that dick she said confidently  i was indeed annie i think the only thing i could do well was fighting i was a beggar to fightnot because i used to quarrel with fellows but because it made me hard and tough and my mother thought that it would make me more fit to carry out this search for my father  what did you fight withswords annie asked  dick laughed  no no annie when we quarrel in england we fight with our fists  what is a fist i never heard of that weapon  that is a fist annie you see it is hard enough to knock a fellow down though it does not very often do that but it hurts him a bit without doing him any harm except that it may black his eyes or puff up his face for a day or twoand no boy minds that it accustoms one to bear pain and is a splendid thing for teaching a boy to keep his temper and i believe it is one reason why the english make such good soldiers it is a sort of science you see and one learns it just as people here learn to be good swordsmen i had lessons when i was twelve years old from a little man who used to be a champion lightweightthat is a man of not more than a certain weight  annie looked doubtful for a minute and then exclaimed  ah yes i understand now that is how it is you came to our help so quickly and bravely when the tiger burst in  i daresay it had something to do with it dick said with a smile there is no doubt that boxing as we call it does make you quick there is not much time to waste in thinking how you are to stop a blow and to return it at the same moment one gets into the habit of deciding at once what is the best thing to be done and i have no doubt that i should not have seen at once that one must cut through the netting run to the window jump on to surajahs shoulders and fire at the tiger unless i had been sharpened up by boxing i only say i suppose that because there were no doubt hundreds of men looking on who had pluck enough to face the tiger and who would have gladly done the thing that we did if the idea had occurred to them the idea did not occur to them you see and i have no doubt that it was just owing to that boxing that i thought of it so you see annie it was in a way the fights i had with boys at shadwellwhich is the part of london where i livedthat saved you and perhaps half a dozen ladies of the sultans harem from being killed by that tiger  now i should advise you to walk about the wood for at least an hour to get rid of your stiffness the longer you walk the better when you have tired yourself come back here by that time i daresay you will be ready for another sleep we will start about three oclock and shall cross the frontier before it gets quite dark once across we can camp comfortably where we like or put up at a village if we should light upon one  i should not go far away from here he went on as the girl at once rose and prepared to start very likely the wood may get thicker farther in and you might lose your way or come across a snake so i should not go far out of sight the great thing is to keep moving it is getting broad daylight now  as soon as annie had started dick lay down  i feel dog tired surajah this right arm of mine is so stiff that i can hardly lift it i did not feel it at the time and her weight was nothing but i certainly feel it now  you have a good sleep dick ibrahim and i will keep watch by turns  i dont think there is any occasion for that dick said no one is likely to come into the wood  not very likely surajah agreed but a body of travellers might turn in here for a halt in the middle of the day and it would look strange were they to find two of the palace officers and their attendants all fast asleep  they would only think we came in for a rest a short time before they did dick said drowsily still if you dont mind perhaps it would be best  in two minutes dick was sound asleep  now ibrahim you lie down surajah said i will call you in three hours  in half an hour annie returned she looked pitifully at dick and then seated herself by surajah  he must be tired she said it was too bad of me letting him carry me like that all night i thought so over and over again when he believed i was fast asleep but i knew that it was of no use asking him to let me ride for a bit  you dont mind my sitting here for a little do you i am going away again presently i only came back so soon because i thought he might wonder what had become of me if i did not i could have gone on walking for a long time it was very hard work at first for my back ached dreadfully and every step hurt me so it was as much as i could do to keep on walking but gradually it got better and at last i had a long run and after that i scarcely felt it  how long have you known him surajah and she nodded towards dick  it is about two years and a half since he came to tripataly and i have seen a great deal of him ever since i love him very much he is always the same he never seems to get angry and is kind to everyone  did he fight when he was with the army  not much he was one of the generals own officers and used to ride with the others behind him he fought in the battle before seringapatam for the general and every one else had to fight then  how is it you come to be always with him she asked  it first began when we went out on a scouting expedition together before the english army went up the ghauts we volunteered to find out if we could which way the sultans army was going we went through a good deal of danger together and some hard fighting and the sahib was pleased with me and since then we have always been together  tell me about that surajah  surajah related the story of their capture and escape of their making their way through the fort and the subsequent pursuit and their defence of the ruined hut annie listened almost breathlessly  how i should like to have been with you she said when he finished at least i think i should have liked it i should have been dreadfully in the way but i could have sat down in the hut and loaded the guns while you were both fighting you could have shown me how to do it how brave of you both to have fought fifty or sixty men  it was not so very brave surajah said we knew we should be killed if they took us there is nothing brave in doing your best when you know that but it was not so much the fighting as arranging things and he did all that and i only carried out his orders he always seemed to know exactly what was best to be done and it was entirely his doing our getting through the fort and taking to the hut and making the loopholes and blocking up the windows just as it was his doing entirely that we killed that tiger whatever he says is sure to be right and when he tells me to do a thing i do it directly for i trust him entirely and there is no need for me to think at all if he had told me to go up to the sultan and shoot him in the middle of his officers i should have done it though they would have cut me in pieces a minute afterwards  i will go away again now annie said getting up he told me to keep on walking about and he would not like it if he were to wake up and find me sitting here  and she got up and strolled away again by the time she returned surajah had lain down to sleep and ibrahim was on watch annie was by this time tired enough to be ready for sleep again and wrapping herself in a rug she lay down at a short distance from the others  it was two oclock when she awoke and she sprang to her feet as she saw dick and surajah standing by the fire talking  i was going to wake you soon dick said as she joined them for we must have another meal before we start i hope you feel all the better after your walk and sleep  ever so much better i scarcely feel stiff at all and shall be ready to ride as soon as you like how do you feel dick  oh i am all right annie i was all right before though i did feel i wanted a sleep badly and you see i have been having a long one for i only woke up ten minutes ago i own though that i should like a good wash i dont suppose i can look dirty through this stain but i certainly feel so  there is a pool she said a few hundred yards away there on the right i found it the second time i went away and i did enjoy a wash  i thought you were looking wonderfully tidy dick said smiling well i will go there at once i shall feel a new man after a bath  i will come with you surajah saidfor he had learned to speak a good deal of english during his companionship with dick  they returned in half an hour ibrahim had warmed up some of the chupatties over the ashes and they all thoroughly enjoyed their meal the horses were saddled and were taken to the pool for a good drink  then annie was helped into her saddle and they started again they rode at a canter to anicull their badges of office securing them from any questioning from the soldiers at the guard houses when they entered and left the town  i dont know whether there is any post established at the frontier dick said as annie who had ridden behind with ibrahim as they passed through the town took her place again between him and surajah i have no fear that they will be erecting a fort for after our capturing bangalore and the hill fortresses they will know very well that nothing they could build on the flat would be of the slightest use in stopping an army advancing by this line still there may be a guard placed there  how do you think we had better get past surajah we have still got the order to the governors of forts and it is likely enough that the officer in charge may not be able to read very few of those we met before were able to do so the sight of the sultans seal at the bottom was quite enough for them and i should think it would suffice to pass us here still it would look suspicious our leaving the the country altogether and we must give some explanation if they ask us  i might say that we are charged with a mission to the english commander at kistnagherry  that might do surajah the fort is only eight or ten miles on the other side of the frontier and we might very well be sent on some message a complaint of some of the villagers that their rights have not been respected as agreed by the treaty or that they have been robbed by men from this side of the frontierthere are plenty of things about which tippoo might be sending a message to kistnagherry the worst of it is that tippoo has not given us a mission and i do hate your having to say what is not true  surajah was not so particular and he replied  well he has given us a mission to visit the hill forts and as kistnagherry is a hill fort it is not a very great stretch to include it  dick laughed  that is ingenious surajah anyhow i dont see any better excuse for crossing the frontier and so we must make the best of it but i hope we shant be asked at all  i think if i say we are going to kistnagherry and then show tippoos order and seal that will be sufficient and the story will be quite true for we shall go by kistnagherry as the road passes close to the fortress  yes that will be quite true surajah and the officers are not likely to ask any further questions  how are you getting on annie  oh much better than i did yesterday she said i would much rather not halt until we are across the frontier i am getting accustomed to the motion now and am not at all afraid of falling off i dare say i shall be rather stiff when we halt but that will not matter then  the sun was just setting when they arrived at a newlyerected house round which ten or twelve tents were arranged an officer came out of the house as they approached he salaamed on seeing two officials of the palace wearing the emblems of the rank of colonels surajah returned the usual moslem salutation  we are going to kistnagherry he said here is the sultans order  the officer glanced at the seal placed it to his forehead and then stood aside  will you return tonight my lord i ask that i may give orders to the sentries  no there is no chance of our being able to be back before morning  he touched his horse and then trotted on again not a word was spoken until they had gone a few hundred yards and then dick checked his horse and as annie came alongside held out his hand and said  thank god annie that we have got you safely back onto english territory    chapter 17 back at tripataly   annies lips moved as dick announced that they had crossed the mysore boundary but no sound came from them he saw her eyes close and she reeled in the saddle  hold her surajah dick exclaimed or she will fall  leaning over surajah caught her by the shoulder and dick leaping to the ground stopped her horse and lifting her from the saddle seated her upon a bank and supported her  some water surajah he exclaimed  surajah poured a little water from the skin into the hollow of dicks hand and the latter sprinkled the girls face with it  i have not fainted she murmured opening her eyes but i turned giddy i shall be better directly  drink a little wine dick said  surajah poured some into a cup but with an effort she sat up and pushed it from her  there is nothing the matter she said only only and she burst suddenly into a passion of sobbing  the spirit that she had shown so long as there was danger had deserted her now that the peril had passed and she was safe  dick looked at her helplessly a girl in tears was a creature wholly beyond his experience and he had no idea what he ought to do in such an emergency he therefore adopted what was doubtless the best course had he but known it of letting her alone after a time the violence of her crying abated and only short sobs broke from her as she sat with her face hidden in her hands  that is right annie he said putting his hand on her shoulder it is quite natural for you to cry after the excitement and fatigue you have gone through you have been very brave and have not said a word of complaint today about your fatigue although you must be desperately tired now try and pull yourself together it is getting dark already and we ought to be moving on to ryacotta which cannot be much more than a mile away you shall ride in front of me when we get there  i would rather not she said getting up with a painful effort i am awfully foolish and i am so sorry that i broke down but i felt so delighted that i could not help it you said we could camp safely when we once got across the frontier would you mind doing so for i dont think i could go much farther  certainly we can camp dick said cheerfully but we must get a little bit farther from that post we passed if they were to see a fire here they would be sure to suspect something i see a clump of trees a quarter of a mile on we can make our camp there and i would rather do that myself than go on to ryacotta where our appearance in the mysore uniform would excite a stir and we should have no end of questions to answer  but i am sure that you are not fit to walk even that distance now i will lift you on my saddle and you can sit sideways there i will walk by your side and you can put your hand to my shoulder to steady yourself surajah can lead your horse and his own and ibrahim can take mine  in this way they performed the journey to the trees and then halted annie was lifted down and laid on a rug dick insisted on her drinking some wine and then covering her with another rug they left her and lighted a fire fifty yards away  look here ibrahim put that whole chicken into the pan cover it with water and let it stew dont let it boil fast but just simmer until it falls all to pieces then i will wake her if she has gone to sleep and make her drink the broth it will do her ever so much more good than wine and she will be all right in the morning though no doubt she will be desperately stiff again still it has not been a longer ride than she had yesterday i expect it is the excitement more than the fatigue that has upset her tomorrow she must ride in front of me again  an hour and a half later dick went across with the cup full of strong broth  are you asleep annie he said when he reached her side  no i am not asleep there is so much to think of and it is such happiness to know that i am free that i feel quite wide awake besides you know i have been asleep for hours today and i slept all night as i was riding before you  then sit up and drink this hot broth it will do you good and after that i hope you will go off you wont be fit for anything tomorrow if you dont have a good night you will have plenty of time to think as we ride along  the girl did as she was told  it is very nice she said as she handed the cup back to him oh dick i do hope that we shall find my father and mother i dont want to for some things but i do for others and most of all that they may thank you for all your goodness to me which i shall never be able to do myself  nonsense child he said cheerfully i have done what every one would do if they found a little countrywoman in distress i should have gone away from seringapatam anyhow if i had not met you and getting you down is a good excuse for me to go back and spend a fortnight with my mother  now get off to sleep as quickly as you can we will see what we can do to make things comfortable for your ride tomorrow  it was late when annie awoke the sun was some distance above the horizon and she saw her companions occupied with the horses in a few minutes she joined them  i am ashamed at sleeping so long she said  we were glad to find that you did dick replied if you went to sleep soon after i brought you the broth you have had ten hours of it and ought to feel all the better  i do she said i am very stiff but not so stiff as i was yesterday morning how you are both altered  yes it would never have done to have gone on in our gay dresses and tippoos badges these are the clothes we came up in and we shall attract no attention whatever you wont have to ride far today it will be as well for you to keep to your own horse until we have passed through ryacotta which is not much more than half a mile away after that you must sit on this pad i have fastened behind my saddle you can sit sideways you know and put your arm around me just as ladies used to ride in england a couple of hundred years ago  as soon as they had eaten something they started and rode at a good pace to the little town people looked at them somewhat curiously as they passed through the street wondering that they should have come from mysore but as they did not halt no one asked any questions the population were at present a good deal divided the great majority by no means regretted their change of masters some of the mohammedans had left when the place was taken over by the english and had crossed into mysore others had remained and hoped that ere long tippoo would drive back the british and regain his former dominions  before mounting the rich housings and the silver work on the bridles had been removed and hidden among the rugs and there was nothing beyond the excellence of two of the horses and the direction from which they came to attract attention  when well beyond the town they halted the saddlebags were all packed upon annies horse dick lifted the girl on to the pad behind his saddle and then mounted  now hold tight by me he said and mind whenever you are tired we will halt for an hours rest we will not go more than twenty miles today and then it will only be as much more down to tripataly tomorrow we will walk for a bit until you get quite accustomed to your seat  after a while the horses broke into a gentle canter for a time annie felt very doubtful as to whether she could retain her seat and so held tight with one arm to dick while with the other hand she kept a firm hold of the crupper presently however she was able to release her hold of the latter and it was not long before she was able honestly to assure dick that she felt quite comfortable and had no fear of falling off  in two hours they passed near the hill on which stood the fortress of kistnagherry which had successfully resisted the attack of the english but above which now flew the british flag skirting round the foot they came in the course of an hour and a halfs ride on to the direct road which they had left at anicull in order to avoid passing through the town of oussoor here they came upon a large village and dick found no difficulty in hiring a light native cart to take annie who was as he felt by the relaxation of her hold unable to proceed farther on horseback or continue straight through to tripataly  a thick layer of straw was placed at the bottom of the cart a couple of rugs spread over it and on this annie was enabled to lie down at her ease the horses were fed and watered and had an hours rest and then they started for the last twenty miles of their journey  annie had while the horses were resting a chat with a native woman and had gone into her house with her when they were ready for the start she returned dressed in the costume she had worn in the palace it had originally been intended to get rid of the clothes after starting but annie had asked for them to be taken on  i can change again before i get to tripataly she said i should not like to appear before your mother for the first time dressed as a boy  and dick had at once fallen in with her wishes  the turban was gone and her head was covered in the fashion of native women with a long cotton cloth of a deep red colour  where the road was good the cart proceeded at a fair pace but in the pass down the ghauts they could go only at a walk and the sun had set before they reached tripataly dick seeing that annie was growing very nervous as they neared their destination had ridden all the way by the side of the cart chatting cheerfully with her  why annie he said you look as solemn as if you were just going into slavery instead of having escaped from it  it is not that i feel solemn dick it is that everything is so new and strange of course after your saving my life i have never felt that you were a stranger and as long as there were only you and surajah i did not mind and i have felt quite at home with you but now that i am going to a new place where i dont know anyone i cant help feeling desolate  you will feel quite as much at home with them in twentyfour hours as you have done with me annie you are tired now and quite worn out with your journey and so you take a gloomy view of things i will guarantee that before i go away again you will be good friends with everyone and will wonder how you could have thought it to be anything dreadful to come among them  when they got within a mile of tripataly dick said  now i will ride on ahead annie and prepare my mother for your coming it will be pleasant to have no questions or explanations when you arrive and i am sure she will carry you straight off to bed and keep you there until you have quite got over the effects of your journey  he did not wait to hear annies faint protest against his leaving her but telling surajah to take his place beside the cart and to keep talking to the girl he galloped on ahead he sprang from his horse in the courtyard threw the reins to a servant and ran in the party had just sat down to their evening meal and as he entered he was greeted by exclamations of astonishment and welcome  his mother had received two letters sent through pertaub by traders going down from seringapatam in these he had told her first of his arrival and of the adventure with the tiger and of his obtaining the post in the palace and in the second of the nonsuccess that had attended his visits to the hill forts he had told her that he should probably leave seringapatam shortly and continue the search but that she must not anticipate any result for a long time  well mother he said after the first embrace and greetings were over i have left tippoos service you see and am no longer a colonel or an officer of the palace i have come down to spend a fortnight with you before i set out again on my travels  has surajah come back with you dick the rajah asked  yes he will be here in a few minutes with a cart that is one of the reasons why i came down here i found among the slaves of the harem a white girl about fourteen years old she is the daughter of a british officer named mansfield and was carried away from her parents eight years ago she was the only white captive left in the palace there have been other girls in a similar position but they have all at about fourteen or fifteen been given by tippoo to his officers as would have been her fate before long so i determined to carry her off with me and bring her to you until we could find her parents she is a very plucky girl and although she had never been on a horse before rode all the way down until we got this side of kistnagherry but as you may imagine the poor little thing is completely knocked up so we brought her down from there in a cart  it is something mother to have saved one captive from tippoos grasp even though it is not the dear one that i was looking for and i promised that you would be a mother to her until we could restore her to her friends  certainly i will dick mrs holland said warmly  will you tell the girls gholla she said to her sisterinlaw to have a bed made up for her in my room  i will do so at once the ranee said poor little thing she must have had a journey indeed  she will be here directly mother dick said as his aunt gave the necessary directions for the bed to be prepared and a dish of rice and strong gravy she is very nervous and i am sure it will be best if you will meet her when she arrives and take her straight to her room  that is what i was going to do dick his mother said with a smile well i will go down with you at once  two or three minutes later the cart entered the courtyard mrs holland was on the steps dick ran down and helped annie from the cart the girl was trembling violently  dont be afraid annie dick whispered as he lifted her down here is my mother waiting to receive you  this is the young lady he went on cheerfully as he turned to his mother i promised her a warm welcome in your name  mrs holland had already come down the steps and as the girl turned towards her she took her in her arms and kissed her in motherly fashion  welcome indeed she said i will be a mother to you poor child till i can hand you over to your own i thank god for sending you to me it will be a comfort to me to know that even if my son should never bring my husband back to me he has at least succeeded in rescuing one victim from tippoo and in making one family happy  the girl clung to her crying softly  oh how good you all are she sobbed it seems too much happiness to be true  it is quite true dear come with me we will go up the private stairs and i will put you straight to bed in my room and no one else shall see you or question you until you are quite recovered from your fatigue  i am afraid annie began faintly  she did not need to say more mrs holland interrupted her  dick you must lift her up and carry her into my room poor child she is utterly exhausted and no wonder  a couple of minutes later dick returned to the dining room he had run down first to tell surajah to come up with him but found that he had already gone to his fathers apartments  well dick the rajah said as he entered i was prepared after hearing of that tiger adventure and of you and surajah being colonels in tippoos household for almost anything but i certainly never dreamt of your returning here with an english girl  i suppose not uncle such a thing certainly never entered into my calculations i did not even know there was a white girl in the palace until one day she stopped me as i was passing along the corridor near the harem to thank me for saving her lifefor it was this girl that the tiger had struck down and was standing upon when i fired at him of course she had no idea that i was english we only said a few words then for if i had been seen talking to a slave girl belonging to the harem i might have got into a scrape however i saw her afterwards and she told me about herself and how she was afraid that she would be given away to one of tippoos officers of course i could not leave her to such a fate as that  there was really no difficulty in getting her away she was dressed as a boy and only had to ride with our servant after us we had arranged so that our absence would not be noticed until we had been away for at least twentyfour hours and of course as officers of the palace no one questioned us on the journey so that it is a very simple affair altogether and the only difficulty there was rose from her being completely tired out and exhausted by the journey as she was utterly unaccustomed to travelling i had to carry her one night in front of me on my saddle for she was scarce able to stand  i am not surprised at that a journey of a hundred and fifty miles to anyone who has never been on horseback would be a terrible trial especially to a young girl i really wonder that she did not break down altogether why you can remember how stiff you were yourself the first day or two you were here and that after riding only an hour or two  i know uncle and i should not have been in the least surprised if she had collapsed i talked it over with surajah and we agreed that if she could not go on we must hire a vehicle of some sort and let her travel every day in front of us with ibrahim and that if it delayed us so much that there was any possibility of our being overtaken we would have put on our peasants dresses got rid of our horses and have gone forward on foot  however she kept up wonderfully well and always made the best of things  we wont ask you to tell us anything more dick till your mother joins us or you will have to go over the story twice  no uncle and i can assure you i dont want to tell the story until i have had my supper for our meals have not been very comfortable on the road and i have not eaten anything since early this morning  what is tippoo doing dick  well as far as i can see uncle he is preparing for war again he is strengthening all his forts building fresh defences to seringapatam and drilling numbers of fresh troops  the english general made a great mistake in not finishing with him when he was there we ought to have taken the city sent tippoo down a prisoner to madras and there tried him for the murder of scores of englishmen and hung him over the ramparts we shall have all our work to do over again in another four or five years however it will not be such a difficult business as it was last time now that we have the passes in our hands  there is no doubt uncle that a considerable part of the population will be heartily glad when tippoos power is at an end you see he and hyder were both usurpers and had no more right to the throne than you had  quite so dick and that makes our letting him off when we could have taken the capital easily all the more foolish if he had been the lawful ruler of mysore it might not have been good policy to push him too hard for he would have had sympathy from all the native princes of india but as being only the son of an adventurer who had deposed and illtreated the lawful ruler of mysore it would seem to them but a mere act of justice if the english had dethroned him and punished himprovided of course they put a native prince on the throne and did not annex all his dominions  it has all got to come some day i can see that in time the english will be the rulers of all india but at present they are not strong enough to face a general coalition of the native states against them and any very highhanded action in mysore might well alarm the native princes throughout india into laying aside their quarrels with each other and combining in an attempt to drive them out  just as they had finished their meal mrs holland entered  the poor child is asleep she said she wanted to talk at first and to tell me how grateful she was to you dick but of course i insisted on her being quiet and said that she should tell me all about it in the morning she ate a few mouthfuls of the rice and not long after she lay down she fell asleep i have left sundra sitting there in case she should wake up again but i dont think it is likely that she will do so  now dick you must tell us all about it  dick was not a great hand at writing letters so he had not entered with any fullness into the details of what he was doing the principal point being to let his mother know that he was alive and well  before he begins the rajah said i will send for rajbullub and surajah master dick is rather fond of cutting his stories short and we must have surajah here to fill up details  surajah and his father soon appeared the former was warmly greeted by the rajah and when they had seated themselves on a divan dick proceeded to tell the story he was not interrupted until he came to the incident of the killing of the tiger and here surajah was called upon to supplement the story which he did doing full credit to the quickness with which dick had without a moments loss of time cut the netting and ascended to the window  when dick came to the incident of the ladies of the harem presenting them in tippoos presence with the two caskets mrs holland broke in  you did not say anything about that in your letter dick let me see your casket where is it  it is in one of the saddlebags dick said  they are in my room rajbullub corrected surajah brought them up at once  then he had better get them the rajah said  what do they contain dick he asked as surajah left the room  all sorts of thingsnecklaces and rings some of them are stones as if they had been taken out of their settings pertaub said they had done this because they thought perhaps that tippoo would not allow the jewels they had worn to be sold or worn by anyone else  then i should think that they must be valuable the ranee said  pertaub said they were worth a good deal but i dont know whether he really knew about the cost of precious stones some of the things were of small value being i suppose the trinkets of the slave girls all gave something and there is a little cross there that belonged to annie it has her initials on it and she had it on her neck when she was captured it was the thing she valued most and therefore she gave it i dont suppose she had anything else except the usual trinkets she would wear when she went out on special occasions with the ladies of the harem i thought it would be useful to us to prove who she was  surajah now returned with the casket  you had better look at surajahs first dick said i dont know anything about it but it looks as if mine were the more valuable i wanted surajah to put them all together and divide fairly but he would not  my son was perfectly right rajbullub said if it had not been for the young lord the deed would never have been done at all surajah aided in killing the tiger but that was nothing more than he has done on the hills here it is to you the merit is entirely due the purse that the sultan gave my son was in itself an ample reward for the share he took in it  now surajah open your casket the ladies are waiting to see the contents  the whole of the little packets some fifty in number were opened and examined many of them eliciting exclamations of admiration from the ranee and mrs holland  there is no doubt that many of them are worth a good deal of money the rajah said it is certain that tippoos treasuries are full of the spoils he has carried off from the states he has overrun and the ladies of the harem no doubt possess a store of the jewels and could afford to be liberal to those whom they considered had saved their lives those seven which you put together as the best must alone be worth a large sum i should think that the total value of the whole cannot be less than forty or fifty thousand rupees so that if those in your casket are handsomer than these dick they must be valuable indeed  dicks casket was next examined  some of these stones are magnificent dick those three great diamonds could only be valued by a jeweller accustomed to such things for their value depends upon their being of good lustre and free from all flaws but according to my judgment i should say that at the very least they must be worth ten thousand rupees each that pearl necklace is worth at least as much those rubies are superb i should say lad that the value of the whole cannot be less than fifteen thousand pounds  the harem must be rich in jewels indeed to be able to make such gifts not that i am surprised at that tippoo had all the jewels belonging to the lawful rulers of mysore he has captured all those of coorg travancore and the other states on the malabar coast he and his father have looted all the carnatic from cape comorin to the north of madras he has captured many of the nizams cities and several mahratta provinces  in fact he has accumulated at seringapatam the spoils of the whole of southern india and those of the hindoo portion of his own people the value of the jewels alone must be millions of pounds and as he himself as they say dresses simply and only wears one or two gems of immense value he may well have bestowed large quantities upon his harem especially as these would be in fact only loans as at the death of their wearers they would revert to him or indeed could be reclaimed at any moment in a freak of bad temper  i have no doubt they had to ask his permission to give you the presents and as you at the moment were in high favour with him i daresay he suffered them to give what they chose without inquiring at all into their value the gold he gave you was simply to procure your outfits and he left it to the harem to reward you as they chose for the service you had rendered  well dick i congratulate you heartily it places your future beyond doubt and leaves you free to choose any mode of life that you may prefer  i congratulate you too margaret on the lads good fortune which he has well deserved by his conduct  see this my sons here you have a proof of the advantages of the training your cousin has had the quickness and coolness he has acquired by it enabled him to make his way down through the fort at the top of the pass and to defend the ruined hut against fifty enemies now it has enabled him to seize the opportunity opened by the attack of the tiger on tippoos harem thereby gaining the sultans favour his appointment to the rank of colonel in the mysore army a post in his palace and this magnificent collection of gems without that quickness and decision his courage alone would have done little for him we in india have courage but it is because our princes and nobles are brought up in indolence and luxury that the english though but a handful in point of numbers have become masters of such wide territories surajah is as brave as dick but he would be the first to tell you that it is to dick he owes it that on their first excursion together he escaped with his life and that in this last adventure he attained rank and position and has returned with these valuable gifts  it is indeed my lord surajah said the young lord has been my leader and i have tried to carry out his orders alone i could never have got through the gate in the fort and should no more have thought of going to the assistance of the ladies of the sultans harem than did any other of the thousands of men who were there looking on  so you see boys the rajah went on that though when he came out here your cousin was able neither to shoot nor to ride and can neither shoot nor ride as well now as can tens of thousands of natives he has acquired from his training in rough exercises qualities of infinitely greater value than these accomplishments and i do hope that his example will stir you up to take much greater interest than in spite of my advice you have hitherto done in active sports and exercises your grandmother was an englishwoman and i want to see that with the white blood in your veins you have some of the vigour and energy of englishmen  it was some days before annie mansfield left her room for the first two she had been completely prostrated after that she rapidly gained strength but mrs holland thought it best to insist upon her remaining perfectly quiet until she had quite recovered either she or the ranee were constantly with her so that when at the end of a week she made her first appearance at the breakfast table she was already at home with three of the party  before long her shyness completely wore off and she seemed to have become really a member of the family mrs holland had altered two of her own dresses to fit her but she preferred for a time to dress in indian costume to which she was accustomed and which was indeed much better suited to the climate than the more closelyfitting european dress mrs holland however bargained that she should of an evening wear the frocks she had made for her  you must get accustomed to them my dear so that when you find your own people you will not be stiff and awkward as you certainly will be when you dress in english fashion for the first time  the day after his arrival dick had written to the military secretary of the governor of madras with whom he was well acquainted to tell him that having gone up in disguise to seringapatam to endeavour to ascertain the fate of his father he had discovered a young english girl detained as a slave in tippoos harem and that he had enabled her to effect her escape and had placed her in the charge of his mother he then repeated the account annie had given of her capture and asked if the circumstances could be identified and if the officer of the name of mansfield concerned in it was still alive and if so was he still in india  annie was secretly dreading the arrival of the answer after her life as a slave her present existence seemed to her so perfectly happy that she shrank from the idea of any fresh change she had no memory whatever of her parents and had already a very strong affection for mrs holland she liked the ranee very much also and the absence of all state and ceremony in the household of the rajah was to her delightful she was already on good terms with the boys and as to dick she was always ready to go out with him if he would take her to run messages for him or to do anything in her power and indeed watched him anxiously as if she would discover and forestall his slightest wish  one would think annie he said one day that you were still a slave and that i was your master i dont want you to wait on me child as you waited on the ladies of the harem however as i shall be going away in a few days now it does not matter but i should grow as lazy as a young rajah if this were to go on long  what shall i do when you go away dick  well i hope that you will set to work hard to learn to read and write and other things my mother will teach you you would not like when you find your own people to be regarded by girls of your own age as an ignorant little savage and i want you to set to and make up for lost time so that if you are still here when i come back i shall find you have made wonderful progress  oh i do hope i shant be gone before that dick  i am afraid you must make up your mind to it annie for there is no saying how long i may be away next time you see there is not much chance of my lighting upon another white slave girl and having to bring her down here and i shall go in for a long steady search for my father  i dont want you to find another slave girl dick she said earnestly not even if it brought you down here again i should not like that at all  why not annie  oh you might like her ever so much better than me i should like you to do all sorts of brave things dick and to save people as you have saved me but i would rather there was not another girl  dick laughed  well i dont suppose that there is much chance of it besides i cant turn my uncles palace into a home for lost girls  two days before dick and surajah started again the reply from the military secretary arrived it stated that the time and circumstances pointed out that the place besieged and forced to surrender eight years before was corsepan and this was indeed rendered a certainty by the fact that the officer in command was captain mansfield he had with him a half company of europeans and three companies of sepoys on looking through the official papers at the time he had found captain mansfields report in which he stated that on the night after leaving the fort the troops which had been reduced to half their original strength had been attacked by a party either of dacoits or irregular troops fearing that some such act of treachery might be attempted he had told his men to conceal a few cartridges under their clothes when they marched out with empty cartridge pouches they had on arriving at their halting place loaded and when the dacoits fell upon them had opened fire  the robbers doubtless expected to find them defenceless and speedily fled in the confusion some of them had penetrated far into the camp and had carried off the captains daughter a child of six years old when peace was signed with tippoo three weeks afterwards the commissioners were ordered to make special inquiries as to this child and to demand her restoration they reported that tippoo denied all knowledge of the affair and neither she nor any of the other girls there were ever given up the letter went on  there can be no doubt that the young lady you rescued is the child who was carried off and the initials you speak of on the cross may certainly be taken as proof of her identity her father retired from the service last year with the rank of colonel i am of course ignorant of his address as you say that mrs holland will gladly continue in charge of her i would suggest that you should write a letter to colonel mansfield stating the circumstances of the case and saying that as soon as you are informed of his address the young lady will be sent to england i will enclose the letter in one to the board of directors briefly stating the circumstances and requesting them to forward the enclosure to colonel mansfield  to annie the letter came as a relief it would be nearly a year before a letter could be received from her father until then she would be able to remain in her new home    chapter 18 a narrow escape   mrs holland undertook to write the letter to annies father and did so at very much greater length than dick would have done giving him the story of the girls life at seringapatam the circumstances of her meeting dick and the story of her escape she assured him that his daughter was all that he could wish her to be  she is of a very affectionate disposition she is frank outspoken and naturalqualities that are wonderful considering the years she has passed as a slave in the harem now that she has been with us for a fortnight and has recovered from the fatigue of her flight and is beginning to feel at home she has regained her natural spirits after their long repression  personally she is of about the average height and of a more graceful figure than is usual with girls of her age the stain has now worn off her face and i should say she will as she grows up be pretty she is fair rather than dark has expressive eyes and a nice mouth altogether had i a daughter i should be well content if she resembled your annie i shall i can assure you do my best to supply the place of a mother to her until i receive a letter from you and shall part from her with regret she is of course at present entirely uneducated but she has already begun to learn with me and as she is quick and intelligent i hope that before i resign my charge her deficiencies will be so far repaired that she will be able to pass muster in all ordinary matters  you will be back before i go wont you dick annie said as she sat by his side on a seat in the garden on the evening before he was to start  i think so he said we can calculate on your being here ten months anyhow i have been talking it over with my mother if it had not been for those jewels i should have given up the search for my father after another six months because it would have been high time for me to get to work in some profession i had indeed made up my mind to enter the companys service for lord cornwallis promised me a commission and my uncle received a letter some time ago from the governor of madras saying that on the very strong recommendation of lord cornwallis and his report of my services he was authorised to grant me one it was to be dated back to the time i joined lord cornwallis more than two years ago however now that i am really made independent of a profession i shall probably continue my search for a somewhat longer time but at any rate i will promise to come back at the end of ten months from the present time so as to say goodbye to you before you start  the girls face brightened  thank you dick i dont think i should go anyhow until i saw you againnot even if i got a letter saying that i was to sail by the next ship  my uncle would take you down bodily and put you on board dick laughed mind annie when i come back at the end of ten months i shall expect to find you quite an educated young lady i shall think of all sorts of hard questions in geography and history to put to you  i will try hard dick really hard to please you i have had three lessons and i have learnt all the letters quite well  that is a good beginning annie it took me a lot longer than that i know  the next morning dick and surajah started they were to ride up the ghauts to the frontier line at amboor two troopers accompanying them to bring back their horses there they were to disguise themselves as traders and make their way direct to bangalore dick said goodbye to his mother up in her own room  you must not be downhearted mother he said as she tried in vain to keep back her tears you see i have come back to you twice safely and after passing unsuspected in tippoos palace there is no fear of my being detected elsewhere besides of course every month i am there i become better acquainted with the people and can pass as a native more easily  i am not really afraid my boy you have got on so well that it seems to me god will surely protect you and bring you back safely and i cant help thinking that this time your search may be successful you know why i feel convinced that your father is still alive and in spite of past disappointments i still cling to the belief  well mother if he is to be found i will find him there are still many hill forts where he may be living and his very existence forgotten and until i have visited every one of them i dont mean to give up the search anyhow i shall come back at the end of ten months whether i have heard of him or not i have promised annie that i will be back before she sails it is not a very long journey down here and i shall drop in for a fortnights stay with you as i have done this time  she is in the next room crying her eyes out dick you had better look in there and say goodbye to her she is not fit to go down to the door  after parting with his mother dick went in to see annie  you must not cry so child he said as she rose from the divan with her face swollen with crying i am sure that you will be very happy here until i come back  i know dick but it wont be at all the same without you  oh you will have plenty to do and you will soon fall into regular ways besides you know you have got to comfort my mother and keep up her spirits and i quite rely upon you to do that  i will try dick she said earnestly  now goodbye annie  he held out his hand but she threw her arms round his neck and kissed him  you have never kissed me not once she said reproachfully and you were going away without it now your mother kisses me and the english girls in the harem always used to do so  but that is different annie girls and women do kiss each other but boys and girls do not kiss unless they are brothers and sisters or are relations or something of that sort  but you are not a boy you are a great big man dick  i am not much more than a boy yet annie however there is no harm in kissing when one is saying goodbye so there  now be a good girl and dont fret and he ran downstairs to the door where his uncle and the two boys were standing  take care of yourself lad the rajah said as after bidding them goodbye dick sprang upon his horse whenever you get a chance send down a letter as we arranged last night to the care of azol afool trader tripataly that will seem natural enough whoever you send it by while a letter directed to me might excite suspicion  goodbye  goodbye uncle and with a wave of his hand dick rode off and joined surajah who was waiting for him a short distance off and then followed by ibrahimwho had begged so earnestly to be allowed to accompany them that dick had consented to take him feeling indeed that his services would be most useful to themand the two troopers they rode off at a sharp pace  at amboor they assumed their disguises dick purchased a pack pony and some goods suitable to their appearance as pedlers and then they started up the pass on foot they passed the frontier line without any interruption stopped and chatted for a few minutes with the guard and then passed on up the valley  there is the house where we had our fight surajah dick said as they reached the ruined village though there is peace now i fancy we should not get much farther than that fort ahead if they guessed that we were the fellows who gave them such trouble two years and a half ago  there is no fear of our being recognised surajah said the guard has probably been changed long ago besides they never once caught sight of our faces  oh no we are safe enough dick agreed if i had not been sure of that we would have gone up one of the passes to the south that has been ceded to us though it would have been a great deal longer round to bangaloreunless indeed we had gone by kistnagherry and that would have been too dangerous to attempt for the officers on the frontier would probably have recognised us  it was late in the afternoon before they arrived at the gate it stood open and there was no sentry on duty a few soldiers could be seen loitering about in the street but it was evident that now the war was over and everything finally settled it was considered that all occasion for vigilance was at an end  upon making inquiries they soon found a house where they could put up for the night they had as is the custom in india brought their provisions with them and after leaving their goods in the house and seeing that the horse was fed ibrahim set to work to cook a meal while the others opened one of the packs and went round the village where they disposed of a few small articles  they arrived without any adventure at bangalore there as soon as they had established themselves at one of the caravansaries for travellers dick and surajah went to the house of the trader to whom pertaub had promised to consign their goods  we have come for some packs that have been sent by friends of ours at seringapatam to your care dick said making as he spoke the sign that pertaub had taught him as enabling those who were hindoos to recognise each other at once we were to use the word madras as a sign that we were the parties to whom they were consigned  the goods arrived a week ago the trader said and are lying for you at my warehouse i will hand them over to you tomorrow morning  thank you we may not come early for we have to purchase two pack horses to carry them and three tats for ourselves and our man this may take us some time and it will be perhaps better for us to come to you early the next morning and we can then start away direct  this was arranged and on the following day two strong animals were bought for the packs and three tats or ponies for their own riding dick had disposed of the horse he had ridden down to tripataly for a good price and had also been supplied with funds by his mother although as he said the contents of their packs ought to suffice to pay all their expenses for a long time  then they purchased some provisions for the journey the pack horse they had brought with them was laden with these and the goods brought up from amboor the new pack horses were taken round to the traders and the goods sent from seringapatam packed on them then they mounted and rode off at a walk the pack animals following ibrahims horse tied one behind the other  they had already debated upon the course to pursue and finally decided that they would in the first place again visit savandroog for the conviction dick had entertained that there was at least one white captive there had increased rather than diminished  i cant give any good reason for it surajah he had admitted when they talked it over before starting but it is just because i have no good reason to give that i want to go there again why should i have such a strong conviction without a good cause one has heard of a presentiment of evili cant help feeling that this is a presentiment of good the question is how can we best go there again i dont think it is in the least likely that the governor will have heard of our flight as this would be the last direction anyone would think of our taking for had we done so we might have met the sultan on his way back from bangalore it will naturally be supposed that we have made for the frontier and have descended the western or southern ghauts the affair will of course seem a mystery to them altogether for why should two young fellows so recently promoted and in such high favour desert tippoos service if they do not associate annies disappearance with our flightand there is no reason on earth why they should do so as no one ever saw us speaking to herthey will most likely think that we have fallen into the hands of the dacoits or thugs and have been murdered numbers of people do disappear every year and are as everyone supposes victims of that detestable sect my uncle has told me of thugs he warned me to be very careful if i travelled with strangers for that these men travel in all sorts of disguises  so i think that as far as that goes we could boldly put on our uniforms and badges again and ride into savandroog the disadvantage of doing so is however plain the commander would remain with us all the time we should get no opportunity of speaking privately with any of the soldiers and taking us to be in tippoos confidence he would as before shirk the question of prisoners on the other hand if we can get in as traders we shall be able to move about unwatchedto go to the soldiers huts and offer goods to their wives and be able to find out to a certainty if there is a prisoner there and if so where he is kept we may even see him for while if the governor wished to keep his existence a secret he would have shut him up when he heard that two of tippoos officers were coming he would not trouble about it one way or the other in the case of a couple of traders  the only objection to that course is that we were here but two or three months since and he and his servants and that artillery officer we went round with would know us at once if we go we shall have to alter our appearance completely at any rate we had better provide means for disguise and we can use them or not as we please  while they were at tripataly therefore they had two false beards made for themselves and tried many experiments in the way of painting their faces and found that by tracing light lines on their foreheads and at the corners of their eyes they were able by the help of beards to counterfeit the appearance of old age so well that it could only be detected on close observation dick too had purchased a pair of native spectacles with large round glasses and broad blackhorn rims that made him look as he said like an astonished owl it was agreed that surajah should wear under his dress a very thickly padded vest which would give him the appearance of being fat as well as elderly  they proceeded for seven or eight miles at a walking pace and when the heat of the day rendered it necessary for them to stop turned into a grove by the roadside as they had no intention of going on to savandroog that day intending to halt some miles short of it and to present themselves there the next afternoon they therefore prepared for a stay of some hours the pack horses were unloaded and the saddles taken off the other animals  half an hour later a party of twelve men travelling in the same direction as themselves also halted and turned in among the trees the man who was apparently the leader of the party came across to where they were sitting  we do not disturb you i hope brothers he said the grove is large enough for us all i see that you are traders like myself  by no means surajah replied the wood is open to all and even were it not we should be discourteous indeed did we refuse to share our shade with others sit down by us i beg of you while your people are unloading your animals  i marked you as you left bangalore the trader said as he seated himself beside them and when i saw that you were taking the same route that we should follow i wondered how far our roads might lie together  we are travelling west surajah replied it may be that we shall stop at magree and there or at outradroog stop for a day or two to trade thence we may go north  then as far as outradroog our paths will lie together the merchant said there we shall strike the river and turn south to seringapatam i am sorry that you will not be going farther in our direction for the roads are far from safe since the war with the feringhees ended there are many disbanded soldiers who have taken to dacoity and it is always better to travel with a strong band i wonder that you venture with three loaded animals and only one man beside yourselves  surajah was about to speak but a quick glance from dick stopped him  we think there is less danger in travelling in a small body than there is with a large one the latter said there is less to tempt anyone to interfere with us moreover we could not travel with a caravan because the greater part of our goods are such as would tempt the peasantry only we therefore stop at small villages to trade leaving the towns to those who travel with more valuable merchandise  after chatting for some minutes the traveller got up and joined his party  i dont much like that fellows looks dick said when they were alone  why he looks a very respectable man  oh yes he looks respectable enough but for all that i dont fancy him it may be that he regards us as rivals and was only trying to find out where we intended to stop and whether we were likely to spoil his trade that was why i said what i did so that he might perceive that we were not likely to interfere with him  then again surajah i remembered my uncles warning against joining other travellers as these thugs who they say commit so many murders generally travel in bands disguised sometimes as traders sometimes as men seeking work sometimes as disbanded soldiers anyhow it is as well to be careful we have each got a brace of doublebarrelled pistols in our girdles in addition to these old singlebarrelled indian ones that we carry for show and our swords are leaning against the tree behind us so we can get hold of them in a moment i know of course that the betting is all in favour of these people being peaceful traders but i dont want to leave anything to chance and there is nothing like being prepared for whatever may happen  presently dick got up and sauntered across to ibrahim who was engaged in cooking  ibrahim he said dont look round while i speak to you but go on with your cooking i dont like the look of the leader of this party he may be a respectable trader he may be a dacoit or a thug i want you to keep a sharp lookout without seeming to do so see that your pistols will come out of your girdle easily keep your sword handy for use if you see anything suspicious come over and tell me and if there is not time for that shout  i will watch sahib ibrahim said but they seem to me peaceable men like ourselves of course they carry weapons no one would travel about with merchandise without doing so  they may be all right ibrahim but i have a sort of feeling that they are not and at any rate it is best to be cautious  the other party did not light a fire but sat down and ate some provisions they carried with them when surajah and dick had finished their meal the leader again strolled over to them he asked whether they intended to sleep and on hearing that they did not he again sat down with them he proceeded to discuss trading matters to describe the goods he carried the places where he had purchased them and the prices he had given  as he talked dick noticed that three or four of the others came across they did not sit down but stood round listening to the conversation and sometimes joining in dicks feeling of uneasiness increased and thrusting one hand carelessly into his girdle he grasped the butt of one of his hidden pistols  suddenly a loud cry came from ibrahim at the same moment something passed before dicks face he threw himself backwards drawing his pistol as he did so and fired into the body of the man behind him a second later he shot another who was in the act of throwing a twisted handkerchief round surajahs neck then he leapt to his feet delivering as he did so a heavy blow with the barrel of his pistol on the head of the trader who had been sitting between him and surajah  it had all passed in a few seconds and the other men started back in their surprise at this unexpected failure of their plan  surajah was on his feet almost as quickly as dick even yet he did not understand what had happened at this moment there was the crack of another pistol and then ibrahim came running towards them having shot a man who had suddenly drawn his sword and tried to cut him down at his heels came the six men who had up to this point been standing in a group near their horses  without hesitation dick drew out one of his singlebarrelled pistols and shot the pretended trader whose turban had saved him from the effect of the blow and who shouting loudly to his companions was struggling to his feet the remaining eight men had all drawn their swords and were rushing upon them  fire surajah dick shouted are you asleep man  surajah was not asleep but he was confused by the suddenness of the fray and was still doubtful whether dick had not made an entirely unprovoked attack upon the strangers however he perceived that it was now too late to discuss that point and was a question of fighting for his life accordingly he fired both barrels of one of his pistols one of the men dropped  your sword surajah dick exclaimed as he grasped the scabbard of his own weapon in his left hand while in his right he held his other doublebarrelled pistol  their antagonists with yells of fury were now upon them dick shot one but the next man he aimed at darted suddenly aside when he fired dick dropped his pistol and grasped the hilt of his sword just in time to ward off a blow aimed at his head blow after blow was showered upon him so quickly that he could do no more than ward them off and wait his opportunity he heard surajah fire two more shots in quick succession then ibrahim suddenly dashed forward and cut down his opponent and then furiously engaged another who was on the point of attacking him from behind dick drew his remaining pistol and shot the man through the head  he had then time to look round  both surajahs shots had told and he was now defending himself against the assaults of two others who were pressing him hard while a third stood irresolute a short distance away dick rushed to surajahs assistance as he did so the third man fled  after him ibrahim dick shouted not one of them must get away  the two thugs defended themselves with cries of fanatical fury but their opponents were far better swordsmen and fighting coolly were not long before they cut them both down  what on earth is it all about dick surajah asked as panting with his exertions he looked round after cutting down his opponent  thugs dick said briefly  are you sure dick surajah asked presently it may be a terrible business for us if there is any mistake  for answer dick pointed to the bodies of the two men he had first shot one still grasped the roomal or twisted silk sash while a like deadly implement lay by the side of the other  thank heaven surajah ejaculated i was afraid there might have been a mistake dick but i see that you were right and that it was a party of thugs if it had not been that you were on the watch for them and had your pistol ready we should have lost our lives  it was a close shave as it was surajah one second later and you and i should both have been strangled i had my hand on my pistol and felt so sure that an attack was intended that the moment something passed before my face although i had no idea what it was i threw myself back and fired at the man behind me with an instinctive feeling that my life depended on my speed but it was only when on looking at you i saw a man in the act of throwing a noose round your neck that i knew exactly what i had escaped  it was fortunate that they had not pistols surajah said we should have had no chance against them if they had had firearms  no they could have shot us the moment i first fired but uncle said when he was talking to me one day that he had heard that the stranglers did not carry firearms because the reports might attract attention and that it was a matter of religion with them to kill their victims by strangling but that if the strangler failed which he very seldom did the other men would then despatch the victims with their swords and knives  ah here comes ibrahim  i caught him just outside the trees sahib he will strangle no more travellers  well what had we better do asked surajah  i should say we had better make off as fast as we can of course if we were really traders able to prove who we are we should go back to the town and report the affair but as we cant do that we had better be moving on at once before any other party of travellers comes up that was why when we had killed several of them i was anxious that none should get away for they might have gone and accused us of slaughtering their companions  that would be too unlikely a story to be believed no one would credit that three men would attack twelve  but there would be no one to prove that there were only three the fellows would naturally swear that there were a score of us and that after murdering their companions the rest made off with the booty  ibrahim load the pack animals at once we will saddle the horses  i think surajah we had better leave everything just as it is it is now getting on for the afternoon it is likely enough that no other travellers will enter the grove today by tomorrow at the latest someone will come in and will of course go and report at once in bangalore what he has found and they will send out here to examine into it when they find that the men have all fallen sword in hand that two of them are evidently stranglers and that their girdles have not been searched nor the packs on their horses opened it will be seen that it was not the work of robbers i dont suppose they will know what to make of it but i should think they would most likely conclude that these men have been attacked by some other party and that it is a matter of some feud or private revengethough even then the fact that the bodies have not been searched for valuables or the baggage or animals carried off will beat them altogether  by this time the horses were ready for the start and after looking up and down the long straight road to see that no one was in sight they issued from the wood and continued their journey being anxious now to get away as far as possible from the scene of the struggle instead of going on to magree as they had intended they turned off by the first country road on the lefthand side and made for savandroog which they could see towering up above the plain when within three miles of it they halted in a large wood here as soon as the horses had been unsaddled and the fire lighted their talk naturally turned to the fight they had gone through  i cannot make out how you came to suspect them dick  i can hardly account for it myself but as i told you i did not like the look of that man and i had an uneasy sort of feeling which i could not explain even to myself that there was danger in the air  but what made you think of these stranglers i had heard some talk about them but never anything for certain  the rajah told me when he was warning me against joining parties of travellers that although very little was known about the organisation it was certain that there was a sect who strangled and robbed travellers in great numbers he said that he was aware that complaints had been made to princes all over india of numbers of persons being missing and that it was certain that these murders were not the work of ordinary dacoits but of some secret association and that even powerful princes were afraid to take any steps against it as one or two who had made efforts to investigate the affair had been found strangled in their beds therefore no one cared to take any steps to search into the matter it was not known whether these stranglers scattered as they were very widely obeyed one common chief or whether they acted separately but all were glad to leave this mysterious organisation alone especially as they preyed only on travellers and in no case meddled in any way with rajahs or officials who did not interfere with them consequently the idea occurred to me directly that these men who seemed like traders might be a party of these stranglers and when the others came up while the leader was sitting talking to us i felt as if cold water was running down my back and that someone was whispering to me be on your guard be on your guard therefore the moment something passed before my face i threw myself back and fired at the man behind me without a moments thought as to what it was  well certainly you saved our lives by doing so dick for i suppose if that man behind me had once got his silk scarf round my neck he would have choked me before i had time to so much as lift my hand  i have not the least doubt that he would and i feel thankful indeed that i had such a strange feeling that these men were dangerous do you know surajah it seems to me that it was just the same sort of feeling that my mother tells me she has whenever my father is in danger and i shall be curious to know when we get back whether she had the same feeling about me anyhow i shall in future have even more faith than i had before in her confidence that she would have certainly known if any evil had happened to my father    chapter 19 found at last   the next morning early dick and surajah set to work to perfect their disguises they had before appeared simply as two young traders well to do and of a class above the ordinary peddling merchant they now fitted on the ample beards that had been made at tripataly these were attached so firmly to their faces by an adhesive wax that they could not be pulled off without the use of a good deal of force with the same stuff small patches of hair were fastened on so as to hide the edge of the foundation of the beard tufts of short grey hair were attached to their eyebrows a few grey lines were carefully drawn at the corner of the eyes and across the foreheads and when this was done they felt assured that no one was likely to suspect the disguise  ibrahim who had assisted in the operation declared that he should take them for men of sixtyfive and as before beginning it both of them had darkened their faces several shades they felt confident that no one at the fort was likely to recognise them when surajah had put on the padded undergarment and converted himself into a portlylooking old man and dick the great horn spectacles they indulged in a burst of laughter at their changed appearance while ibrahim fairly shouted with amusement  he was to stay behind in the wood when they went on for it would but have added to the risk had he accompanied them as unless also completely disguised he would have been recognised by the soldiers with whom he had talked during his twentyfour hours stay inside the tower walls he was in the evening to proceed along the road to encamp in the last grove he came to at a distance of a quarter of a mile from the gates and to remain there until they returned  under his garments dick had wound a thin but very strong silken cord that he had purchased at bangalore it was four hundred feet in length and considerably increased his apparent bulk although he was still far from emulating the stoutness of surajah the halters of the pack horses were attached to the cruppers of the riding ponies and after a final instruction to ibrahim that if at the end of four days they had not returned he was to endeavour to find out what had happened to them and was then to carry the news to tripataly they started for the fort when they approached the gate they were as before hailed by the sentry  we are merchants surajah said and we have with us a rich assortment of goods of all descriptionssilks and trinkets for the ladies of the governors harem and handkerchiefs scarves silver ornaments and things of all kinds suitable for the wives of those of lower rank we pray for permission to enter and exhibit our wares which have been collected by us in the cities where they were manufactured and which we can therefore sell at prices hitherto unheard of  i will send word up to the governor the officer said it is a long time since we have been visited by traders and maybe he will grant you permission you had best go back to the shade of those trees it will be a good hour before the answer comes  i think it likely they will let us in dick said as they moved away towards the trees it is but a short time since things were sufficiently settled for traders to venture up here and as savandroog lies altogether off the roads between large towns it is possible that none with such goods as we have have come this way since the garrison took over savandroog from the british detachment that occupied it  in little over an hour there was a shout from the walls and on approaching the gate again they were told that the governor had given permission for them to enter  you are to be blindfolded the officer said as the gate closed behind them no one may ascend the rock unless he consents to this your horses will be led and beware that you do not attempt to remove the bandages until you have permission to do so  it took nearly an hour to mount the steep road and when they came to a standstill and the subofficer who had accompanied them told them they could now remove their bandages they found themselves in front of a small building close to the commanders quarters the packs were by the order of the officer taken off the horses by the soldiers who had led them up and carried into the house the horses were fastened in the shade to rings in the wall and on surajah pointing out the packs containing goods he wished to show to the ladies two of the soldiers carried them across to the governors house the old officer himself came to the door  enter my friends he said you are the first traders who have come up here since we took over the fort some six months ago and methinks you will do a brisk business if your wares are as you sent up to say good and cheap  the bales were taken into a room the soldiers retired and in a minute the commanders wife accompanied by three or four other ladies entered dick and surajah after salaaming profoundly to the veiled figures at once began to unpack their bales  the assortment had been very judiciously made and to women who had for more than six months been deprived of the pleasure of shopping the display was irresistible in their desire to examine the goods the ladies speedily lifted their veils and seating themselves on cushions they had brought in with them chattered unrestrainedly examining the quality of the silks which surajah and dick squatting behind their wares handed for their inspection comparing the colours asking each others advice and endeavouring to beat down the terms surajah named  in the first place he asked the prices marked on small labels attached to each article but suffered himself after the proper amount of reluctance and protests that he should be a ruined man to abate his terms considerably although the ladies were evidently well satisfied that the goods were indeed bargains  it was a long time before the ladies could make up their minds which to choose among the many silks exhibited for their selections when this had been settled the pack containing delicate muslins was opened and the same scene gone through it was altogether four hours before the purchases were all made and even then the boxes of trinkets remained unopened the governors wife saying  no we will not look at them we have ruined ourselves already tomorrow when our husbands know how much we have spent you can show the trinkets to them and try your best to get them to buy these things we have been getting are our own affair it is for them to make us presents of ornaments if they are disposed to  this evening you must come in again the ladies from the other fort will be here then  the purchases made were paid for the bales again fastened up and carried across to their room the governor met them as they went out  i suppose you have been ruining us all he said good humouredly well it is a dull life up here and the ladies have but few chances of spending money  we are to see the ladies from the other fort this evening my lord surajah said have we your permission in the meantime to go and sell in the soldiers quarters we have goods suited to the needs of their wives also as well as those for the ladies  certainly you can go about as you please up here it is only as to the approaches that we have to be careful but wait in your room for a short time i will have food sent over to you  in a few minutes a servant brought across a large dish of pillau and several cakes of sweetmeats the latter being as he informed them the special gift of the governors wife there was no occasion for them to start as they had intended after their meal for the news of their coming had spread and by the time they had finished a number of women were waiting outside until sunset they were busily engaged in selling their goodsfor the most part bright cotton cloths red silk handkerchiefs and cheap silver trinkets soldiers sauntered in and out for these they had provided a store of pipes tobacco tobacco boxes knives and muslins for turbans and as the news spread that these were to be obtained the number of soldiers increased until the room was quite crowded with them as well as by many natives engaged in the work of rebuilding the fortifications  surajah did the selling while dicks part of the work was receiving the money and giving change as he was stooping over a tray in front of him piled with copper picking up the change for silver coin he heard a man ask surajah for a pound of his best tobacco and a pipe  there was something in the accent that caused him to look up sharply as he did so he started the blood rushed to his head so violently that a mist seemed to pass across his eyes and his hand shook so that he dropped the coins he was counting forgetful of the dark stain on his face he bent forward over the tray again to conceal his emotion forced himself to pick out the right change and then handing it to its owner again looked up  the man who was standing before surajah was broader and taller than those around him the sun had darkened his face until its shade approached those of his companions and yet there was no mistaking the fact that he was a european a heavy moustache and beard streaked with grey concealed the lower part of his face dick dared not gaze on the man too earnestly and could see no likeness to the picture on the wall at shadwell but allowing for the effects of hardship and suffering he judged him to be about the age of his father  the man was evidently on good terms with the soldiers one or two of whom were chaffing him on his purchase  will nothing but the best tobacco satisfy you one laughed  nothing and even that wont really satisfy me this stuff is good enough when rolled up for cigars and it does well enough in hookahs but i would give all this pound for a couple of pipes of pigtail which is the tobacco we smoked at sea  again dicks heart beat rapidly this man must have been a sailor he could not restrain himself from speaking  have you been a sailor then he asked  ay i was a sailor though it is many years ago now since i saw the sea  we got some english tobacco at madras dick said not hesitating for once at telling an untruth we sold most of it to the feringhee soldiers on our way up but i think i have got a little of it still left somewhere in the pack i am too busy to look for it now and we shall soon be going to show our goods to the officers wives but if you can come here at nine oclock i may have looked it out for you  i cant come at nine the man said for at halfpast eight i am shut up for the night  come at eight then dick said if i am not back come the first thing in the morning before we get busy  i will come sure enough the man said i would walk a hundred miles if they would let me for half a pound of pigtail  get rid of them surajah dick whispered as the man shouldered his way through the crowd make some excuse to send them off  now my friends surajah said you see it is getting dusk it will soon be too dark to see what you are buying and we have been selling for eight hours and need rest at eight oclock tomorrow we will open our packs again and everyone shall be served but i pray you excuse us going on any longer now as you see we are not as young as we once were and are both sorely weary  as time was no object and the work of purchasing would relieve the tedium of the following day the crowd good humouredly dispersed surajah rose and closed the door after the last of them and then turned to dick he had himself been too busily engaged in satisfying the demands of the customers to look up and had not noticed that one of them was a white man  what is it he asked as he looked round has the heat upset you  then as his eye fell on dick his voice changed and he hurried towards him exclaiming anxiously  what is it dick what has happened  for dick was leaning against a bale by the side of him and had hidden his face in his arms surajah saw that his whole frame was shaking with emotion  my dear lord surajah said as he knelt beside him and laid his arm across his shoulder you frighten me has aught gone wrong are you ill  dick slightly shook his head and lifting one of his hands made a sign to surajah that he could not at present speak a minute or two later he raised his head  did you not see him surajah  see who dick  the white man you last served  i did not notice any white man  it was the one you gave a pound of the best tobacco to did you not hear me speak to him afterwards  no i was so busy and so fearfully hot with this padded thing it was as much as i could do to attend to what they said to me a white man did you say oh dick  and as the idea struck him he rose to his feet in his excitement  do you thinkdo you really think he can be your father  i do think so surajah of course i did not recognise his face nine years must have changed him greatly and he has a long beard but he is about the right age and i should say about the same figure and he has certainly been a sailor for he said to one of the soldiers that he would give that pound of tobacco for a couple of pipes of pigtail which is the tobacco sailors smoke i told him that perhaps i might be able to find him some in my packs and asked him to come here at eight oclock this evening if i was not in then he was to come the first thing tomorrow morning but of course i shall be in at eight you must make some excuse to the ladies say that there are some goods you wish to show them in one of the other packs and ask me to go and look for it  oh dick only to think that after all our searching we seem to have come on him at last it is almost too good to be true  great as was surajahs confidence in dick he had never quite shared his faith that he would find his father alive and his nonsuccess while with the army and since had completely extinguished any hopes he had entertained his surprise therefore equalled his delight at finding that after all it seemed probable that their search was likely to be crowned with success  of course we will manage it he said i will put aside that narrow benares clothofgold work for trimmings and you can be as long as you like looking for it they will be too busy examining the other things to give it a thought after you have gone out  i can be back at halfpast eight dick said for the man told me he was locked up at that hour if it had not been for that i should have arranged for him to come a little later but of course i shall have opportunities for talking to him tomorrow  there is someone at the door  surajah opened it and a soldier entered with their evening meal and a request that they would go across to the governors as soon as they had finished it as the ladies had already assembled there they hurried through their food and then went across there was quite a large gathering for not only had the wives of the officers in the other fort come over but all those who had been there in the morning were again present several of them prepared to make further purchases trade was as actively carried on as it had been before  when he judged it to be nearly eight oclock dick nudged surajah who said a minute afterwards  we have forgotten the benares clothofgold i am sure that will please the ladies for waist bands or for trimmings it must have got into the other bales by mistake  i will go and fetch it dick said and rising left the room  a figure was standing at the door when he reached the house  i was afraid you had forgotten me the man said it is not quite eight oclock yet but as i found that you were both out i began to be afraid that you might be detained until after i had to go and you dont know how i long for a pipe of that tobacco the very thought of it seems to bring old days back again  by this time they had entered the house and dick shut the door behind him he had left a light burning when they went out dick was so agitated that he felt unable to speak but gazed earnestly in the mans face  what is it old chap the latter said surprised at the close scrutiny is anything wrong with you  dick took off his spectacles rather to gain time than to see more clearly for a plain glass had been substituted for the lenses  i want to ask you a question he said is your name holland  the man started  my name is jack holland he said sure enough though how you come to know it beats me altogether for i am always called jack and except the governor i dont think there is a man here knows my other name  you were captain of the hooghley wrecked on the malabar coast nine years ago dick said this time speaking in english  after an exclamation of startled surprise the man stared at him in an astonishment too great for words  are you english he said slowly at last yes i was in command of the hooghley who in gods name are you  dick took his two hands  father he said i am your son dick  the sailor gazed at him with a stupefied air  are you mad or am i he said hoarsely  neither of us father i am disguised as an old man but really i am little more than eighteen i have been searching for you for more than two years and thank god i have found you at last and bursting into tears dick would have thrown his arms round his fathers neck but the latter pushed him off with one hand and held him at arms distance while his other hand plucked at his own throat as if to loosen something that was choking him  it cant be true he muttered to himself i am dreaming this i shall wake presently and you will be gone  it is quite true father mother is down at tripataly waiting for me to bring you to her  with a hoarse cry the sailor reeled and would have fallen had not dick caught him and allowed him to sink gradually to the ground where he lay half supported by one of the bales dick ran to one of the saddlebags where he carried a flask of brandy in case of emergencies poured some into a cup and held it to his fathers lips the sailor gasped  it is brandy he said suddenly i cant have dreamt that  then he broke into a violent sobbing dick knelt by his side and took his hand  it is assuredly no dream father he said gently i am really your son dick i am here with a trusty friend and now we have found you you may be sure that we will in some way manage your escape there is no time now to tell you all that has happened that i can do afterwards all that is important for you to know is that mother is quite well she has never given up hope and has always insisted that you were alive for she said that she should surely have known if you had died so she taught me her language until i could speak like a native and two years and a half ago she came out here with me  i accompanied the army with my uncles troop and searched every hill fort they took for you since they went back i have been up in mysore with my friend surajah and thank god at last we have found you  thank god indeed my boy i do thank him not only that you have found me but that your mother whom i had never hoped to see again is alive and well and also that he has given me so good a son  and now father about your escape in the first place have you given your parole not to try to get away  captain holland was himself now  no lad no at the fort where i was for six years there was no possibility of escape and as i was a long time before i began to speak the language even if i had got away i could never have made my way through the country then the governorit was the same we have heretook me with him to kistnagherry i was the only white captive who went there with him at kistnagherry there were five or six others but when tippoo heard that an english army was coming up the ghauts an order came that they were to be killed but the governor is a kindhearted old fellow and as i had become almost a chum of his he chose to consider that the order did not apply to me but only to those he had found at kistnagherryfor i fancy my existence had been forgotten altogether  i had great hopes that the british would take the place i think that is the only time i have hoped since i was made prisoner but the old man is a good soldier and beat them off  when peace was made kistnagherry was as you know given up and the governor was ordered to evacuate the place and to come here he brought me with him making me dye my face before i started so that in my native dress it would not be noticed in any town we passed through that i was a white for had this been done the news might have come to tippoos ears and there would have been an end of me  except that i am locked up at night i am not treated as a prisoner but the governor who has a strong sense of duty has a certain watch kept over me he has a real friendship for me and would do all in his power to save my life short of disobedience to an actual order but his view is that i have been confided to his care and that if at any moment the sultan should write to demand me of him he would be bound to produce me  well father it must be nearly halfpast eight i will go with you and see where you are confinedthat is the first step we will both tonight think over the best way of attempting your escape and in the morning when your guard is removed if you will come straight here we will talk it over  i am afraid you will have to wait for your pigtail till we get to madras  captain holland laughed  i can afford to wait for that now god bless you my boy i have never looked for such happiness as this again but as you say it is time for me to be off i have never been late yet and if it were reported to the governor that i was so tonight he might think that there was something in the wind  dick walked with his father across the fort  that is the house in the corner the captain said pointing to one before which a group of soldiers were standing dont come any farther  dick stood looking after him and heard a voice say  you are late jack i was beginning to wonder what had become of you  i dont think it is past the hour yet captain holland replied i have been with those traders they told me this afternoon they might be able to find me some english tobacco in their pack but they have been too busy to look for it i hope they will light on it tomorrow if they do i will give you half a pipeful i wont give you more for it is strong enough to blow your head off after this tasteless stuff you smoke here  then dick hurried off to the house snatched up the stuff he was supposed to be looking for and joined surajah at the governors  it was another hour before the ladies had completed their purchases dick on entering had given a little nod to surajah to let him know that it was really his father whom he had discovered and had then tried to keep his attention upon his work as a salesman and surajah as he handed him the goods had given a furtive squeeze to his hand in token of his sympathy  so it is really your father he said as carrying their greatly diminished pack they walked across to their house  it is indeed you may imagine his surprise and joy when i told him who i was now we have got to talk over the best plan of getting him out  when the door was shut and they had seated themselves on two of the bales dick first repeated all that his father had told him and then for a long time they discussed the best plan of attempting an escape both agreed at once that it would be next to impossible to get him down the road and out of the gate in the first place they would have to leave by daylight and even could a disguise be contrived that would deceive the sentries and guard at the gate all of whom were well acquainted with captain hollands figure and appearance it was certain that as but two had come up the rock a third would not be allowed to leave unless he had a special order from the governor  they agreed therefore that the escape must be made over the precipice that this was a matter of great difficulty was evident from the fact that the captain had made no attempt to get away in that manner still there was hope that with the assistance of the silk rope dick had brought with them it might be managed  there was too the initial difficulty of getting out from the fort to be faced  we can do nothing till we have had a long talk with my father dick said i have no doubt that he has thought all these things over and has long before this made up his mind as to the point at which a descent would be easiest as at present we know little except by the casual examination we made last time we can decide on nothing by ourselves  i hope it wont be a long way to let oneself down surajah said for i am quite sure i could not hold on by that thin rope for any distance  nor could i surajah if i had to trust only to my hands my father as a sailor will be able to put us up to the best way to do it but at any rate he might let you down first and i think that by twisting the rope two or three times round my body and then holding it between my knees and feet i might manage but i dare say my father will hit on some better plan than that  and now we will lie down i am so stiff that i can hardly stand from squatting for so many hours behind those things of ours i thought that i had got pretty well accustomed to it but i never calculated on having to do it from ten in the morning until ten at night with only two halfhours off  dick however had little sleep that night he was too excited over the glorious success he had obtained to be capable of closing an eye and it was not until day was breaking that he fell into a doze  an hour later he started to his feet at a knock at the door he was wide awake in a moment and on running to it his father entered  you look older today than you did yesterday the latter said as he held his hand and gazed into dicks face i fancy that neither of us has had any sleep to speak of as for myself i have not closed an eye  nor did i father until day began to break now please let us talk over our plan of escape first for we may be interrupted at any moment  right you are lad does your friend here speak english for i have never got to be a good hand at their lingo i want to thank him too but as you say time is precious and we must postpone that  he understands it father and can talk it pretty fairly we have been constantly together for nearly two years  now in the first place is there any place where we can get down from the top here with the aid of a rope  it would be a pretty tough job anyhow but at the farthest end of the rock is a place where it goes sharp down as if cut with a knife that would be the best place to try i take it to be about two hundred feet deep beyond the ground seems to slope regularly away if i could have got a rope i should have tried it but they are pretty scarce commodities up herein fact i have never seen a piece twenty feet long since we came what sort of rope have you got  dick opened the front of his garment and showed the rope round his body captain holland gave a low whistle of dismay  i should not like to trust a child with that thing dick much less a grown man it is no thicker than a flag halliard  it is thin father but there is no fear as to its strength i tested every yard of it and found it would bear six hundred weight  well that is ample but how is one to hold on to a cord like that  that is just what we want you to tell us father there must be some way of managing it if one could but hit upon it  yes that is so lad the sailor said thoughtfully i will think it over anyhow i think i could lower you both down and by knotting it i might get hold enough to come down after you but even the knots would be precious small  one might get over that father by fastening a short stick across every five or six feet or every two or three feet if you like  good dick that would prevent ones coming down with a run certainly and by keeping it between ones legs one could always get a rest yes that will do lad if i can think of nothing better there are a lot of spears stowed away in the room adjoining mine if we were to cut them up into sixinch lengths with one of a foot long to each ten for sitting on they would be just the thing  that is capital father i had a lot of practice in rope climbing before i came out and i am sure that i could manage with the help that would give i dont think surajah could but we could let him down first easily now as to your prison  there are bars to the windows the captain said and a sentry is always on duty outside the only way would be to escape at the rear i have often thought it over but it was of no use breaking out there if i could not get any farther the wall is built of loose stone without mortar you see it would have been a big job to bring up either mortar or bricks from down below so most of the buildings are entirely of stone the wall is two feet thick but there would be no great difficulty in getting out the stones and making a hole big enough to crawl through i could not do it in my room because they always look round to see that everything is safe before they lock me up and it would take so long to do it noiselessly that half the night would be wasted before i could get out but the magazine where the spears are kept communicates with my room and i could slip in there in the daytime when no one was looking get behind the spears which are piled against the wall and work hidden by them no one would be likely to go into my room during the day and if he did he would not expect to find me there as i am generally about the place in that way i could get out enough stones to render it an easy job to finish it after i was locked up a spear head is as good a thing to help me prize them out as one could wish for  very well father then we had better settle that you shall get out in that way now shall we go round on the outside and help you  no i dont say but that your help would make it easier to get the stones out without making a noise still your going round might be noticed  well then father shall we seize and gag the sentry we have done such a thing before successfully  no that wouldnt do dick the guard house is hard by and the slightest noise would destroy us all besides as they have not many sentries posted up here they relieve guard every hour so that the thing would be discovered in no time  no when i get out i will creep along noiselessly by the wall there are houses in the yard almost all along and though the sentry would not be likely to see me in the shade of the wall i will take care to cross the open spaces when his back is turned i will then come straight here for you and we will make for the wall behind the governors house there is no sentry on that side for that steep ravine covers it from attack there however there are six or eight feet of level ground between the foot of the wall and the edge of the ravine the walls are twenty feet in height with fifty feet of that rope i will make a ladder and will get hold of a piece of iron to make a grapnel of how much time can you give me  i should think we could stay here today and tomorrow without seeming to be dawdling without reason do you think you could get ready by tomorrow night father  yes that will give me plenty of time let me see there is the short ladder to make that wont take me over an hour there are a hundred bits to cut for the long ladder putting them about two feet apart that will be a longish job for the spear shafts are of very tough wood however i have a saw and some oil which will prevent it making a noise and can make fairly quick work of it i have several tools too i very often do carpentering jobs of all sortsthat is what first made the governor take to me i can get all that part of the work done today tonight i will do the knotting of course i shall make it a goodish bit over two hundred feet long for it may turn out that i have not judged the depth right and that the cliff is higher than i thought it was  i dont think sawing up the spear shafts will take more than an hour or two so i shall be able to show myself about the place as usual i will go over and take a good look at the rock again and stick a spear head into the ground at the point where it seems to me that it goes down straightest and where there is the least chance of the rope getting rubbed against a sharp edge i shant begin at the wall until tomorrow for i dont suppose i shall be able to get out the first few stones without making a bit of a noise and it would not do to work at night  now lad i think we can consider that as all settled and i wont come near you again unless there is some change of plan i shall be here tomorrow evening i hope it will be by ten oclockthat must depend upon how long it takes me to get down the outside layer of stone  if you should hear a sudden row make at once for the wall behind the governors house and wait there for me to join you you see some of the stones may come down with a run and if they do i shall give the rest a shove and be out like a shot i shall hear which side the sentry is running round the house and shall belt the other way of course he will see the stones and give the alarm but in the darkness i have not much doubt of being able to slip away and i will then make my way straight to the wall of course i shall have the ladders tied up into bundles and shall take care not to leave them behind me  all right father we will be ready tomorrow evening we shall wait quietly for you until you come unless we hear a sudden alarm if we do we will go round behind the governors house and wait there for your coming  that is it my lad now i will be going i am glad that no one has come in while i have been here    chapter 20 the escape   soon after eight oclock customers began to drop in and throughout the day a brisk trade was carried on surajah was sent for in the course of the morning by the governor who bought several silver bracelets brooches and earrings for his wife most of the other officers came in during the day and made similar purchases and many trinkets were also sold to the soldiers who considered them a good investment for their money indeed no small portion of the earnings of the natives of india are spent upon silver ornaments for their women as they can at any time be converted into cash  the commoner cloths knives beads and trinkets were almost all disposed of by the end of the day for as no traders had come up for six months and as a long time might elapse before others did so the garrison were glad to lay in a store of useful articles for themselves and families especially as the prices of all the goods were at least as low as they could have been bought in a town  we shant leave much behind us dick said as he looked round after the last customer had left and they had sat down to their evening meal almost all the silver work and the better class of goods have gone and i should say threequarters of the rest i daresay we shall get rid of the remainder tomorrow i dont suppose many of the soldiers stationed down by the gate have come up yet but when they hear that we sell cheaply some of them will be here tomorrow we have made no money by the transaction but at any rate we shall have got back the outlay of course i should not have cared if we had got nothing back still it is satisfactory to have cleared oneself  i wonder how ibrahim is getting on down in the wood  he wont be expecting us today surajah replied but i have no doubt he will begin to feel anxious by tomorrow night i wish we could have seen some way of getting the horses down it will be awkward doing without them  yes i hope we shall get a good start of course we must put on our peasants dresses again i am glad enough to be rid of that rope though i have had to put on two or three additional things to fill me out to the same size as before still i dont feel so bound in as i did though it is horribly hot  i am sure i shall be glad to get rid of all this stuffing surajah said i felt ready to faint today when the room was full  well we have only one more day of it dick said i do hope father will be able to get out by ten oclock then before eleven we shall be at the edge of the rock say we are two hours in getting down and walking round to join ibrahim that will take us till one and we shall have a good five hours before fathers escape will be discovered they will know that he cant have gone down the road and it will take them fully two hours to search the fort and all over the rock it will be eight oclock before they set out in pursuit and by that time we ought to be well on the road between cenopatam and anicull  if we can manage to buy horses at cenopatam of course we will do so we shall be there by five oclock and ought to be able to get them in a couple of hours once on horseback we are safe i dont think they will pursue very farperhaps not even so far as cenopatam for the governor will see that he had better not make any fuss about a white captive having escaped when it was not known that he had one there at all i think it more likely that when he finds father has got fairly away he will take no steps at all they have no cavalry here and he will know well enough that there will be no chance of our being tracked and overtaken by footmen if we had but a couple of hours start  i think that is so dick he has done his duty in keeping your father a prisoner but i dont think he will be at heart at all sorry that he has made his escape  i think surajah i will write a letter to him and leave it here to be found after we have got away thanking him in fathers name for the kindness that he has always shown him saying who i am why i came here and asking his pardon for the deception that i have been obliged to play upon him he is a good old fellow and i should think it would please him  i should think it would surajah agreed  i will do up my brace of pistols in a packet and put them with the note dick went on and will say in it that i hope he will accept them as a token of our esteem and gratitude they are wellfinished english pistols and i have no doubt he will prize them i will mention too that we shall have made our escape at eleven oclock and therefore by the time he receives my letter we shall be far beyond the reach of pursuit i daresay that will decide him upon letting the matter pass quietly and he will see himself that by making no fuss over it no one outside the fortress will ever know that a prisoner has escaped  the next day passed comparatively quietly a good many soldiers and women came up from below and before sunset their goods were completely cleared out the governor came over in the afternoon and had a talk with them they expressed their satisfaction at the result of their trading and said that they should be off before sunrise  i hope you will come again he said but not for another six months for assuredly you will take away with you pretty nearly every rupee in the fortress my wife and the other ladies are all well content with their purchases and agree that they would not have got them cheaper at seringapatam or bangalore  we try to buy cheaply and sell cheaply surajah said modestly in that way we turn over our money quickly but it is seldom indeed that we find so good a market as we have done here when we left bangalore we thought that it might be a month before we should have to go back there to replenish our packs from our magazine but we shall only have been away five or six days  i am glad that you are content for you are honest traders and not like some of the rascals that have come up to the forts i have commanded and fleeced the soldiers right and left  although not given to blushing dick felt that he coloured under his dye at the praise for although they had certainly sold cheaply he doubted whether the term honest could be fairly applied to the whole transaction  as ten oclock approached the two friends sat with open door listening intently for every sound conversation was still going on in the houses and occasionally they could make out a dark figure crossing the yard  it was not yet ten when a light footfall was heard and a moment later captain holland appeared at the door  it is all right so far he said but wait five minutes to give me time to get the ladder fixed you had better come one by one and stroll quietly across the yard it is too dark for anyone to recognise you unless they run right against you and even if they do so they will not think it strange you should be out after having been cooped up all the day  in another moment he was gone they had each during the day gone out for a time and had walked round through the narrow lane behind the governors house to see that there were no obstructions that they might fall over in the dark they agreed on comparing notes that captain holland had chosen the best possible place for scaling the wall for the lane was evidently quite unused and the house which was higher than the wall would completely screen them from observation  in five minutes dick followed his father leaving surajah to come on in a minute or two they had secured about them the gold and silver they had received for their purchases but they left behind a large heap of copper coins on the top of which dick had placed his letter to the governor and the parcel containing the brace of pistols he met no one on his way to the rendezvous but almost ran against his father in the dark  steady dick or you will run me down captain holland said i have got the ladder fixed so you had better go up at once take these three spears with you i will bring the long ladder  we shant want the spears father we have a brace of doublebarrelled pistols and two brace of single barrels  never mind that dick you will see that they will come in useful  dick took the spears and mounted the ladder without further question his father then came up and placed the long rope which with the pieces of wood was a bulky bundle on the wall and then descended again it was another five minutes before surajah came up  i was stopped on the way he said and had to talk with one of the officers  he and the captain were soon by dicks side the ladder was then pulled up and lowered on the other side of the wall they were soon standing at its foot  shall i jerk the ladder down father  i think not dick it would only make a clatter and it is no matter to us whether they find it in the morning or not you had better follow me i know every foot of the ground and there are some nasty places i can tell you  they had to make several detours to avoid ravines running deep into the plateau and for a time captain holland walked very cautiously when he had passed these he stepped out briskly and in less than an hour from starting they were near the edge of the precipice their eyes had by this time become accustomed to the darkness  we are just there now captain holland said but we must go very cautiously for the rock falls sheer away without warning ah there is the edge a few yards ahead of me  now do you stay where you are while i feel about for that spear head i put in to mark the place it had about three feet of the staff on it if it were not for that there would be small chance of finding it i know it is somewhere close here  in a few minutes he returned to them  i have found it he said keep close behind me  after walking for fifty yards he stopped  here it is lads  now give me those spears dick  he thrust them firmly into the ground a few inches apart  throw your weight on them too he said that is right now they will stand many times the strain we shall put on them  i have chosen this place dick for two reasons in the first place because it is the most perpendicular and in the second because the soil and grass project slightly over the edge of the rock there is a cushion in that bundle and four spear heads i will peg it down close to the edge and the rope will run easily over it  now surajah we had better let you down first you will be tied quite securely and there will be no risk whatever as you know of the rope giving way i should advise you to keep your eyes shut till you get to the bottom for the rope will certainly twist round and round but keep your arms well in front of you and whenever you feel the rock open your eyes and send yourself off with your arms and legs i dont think you will touch for at this point it seemed to me as i looked down that the rock projects farther out than anywhere else on the face of the precipice and that a stone dropped straight down would fall some fourteen or fifteen feet from its foot would you like me to bandage your eyes  no thank you i will keep my eyes closed  that is the best thing you can do captain holland said though it is so dark that you would not be able to see if you did when you get to the bottom untie the rope pull it gently down and call out to me whether the lowest piece of stick touches the ground if it does not i will pull it up again and fasten on some more i have got a dozen spare ones with me  captain holland then told surajah and dick to take off their upper garments these he wound round and round the lower four feet of the rope increasing its diameter to over two inches  there he said as he fastened this round surajahs body under the arms it wont hurt you now that silk rope would have cut in an inch deep before you got to the bottom if it had not been covered  then he took off his own garment made it up into a roll lashed one end to the rope in the centre of surajahs back passed it between his legs and fastened it to the knot at his chest  there he said that will prevent any possibility of the thing slipping up over your shoulders and will take a lot of the strain off your chest  then he lay down and crawled forward to the edge pegged the cushion down and then turning to surajah said  all is ready now  surajah had felt rather ashamed that all these precautions should be taken for him while the others would have to rely solely upon their hands and feet and sternly repressing any sign of nervousness he stepped forward to the side of captain holland  that is right the captain said approvingly now lie down by my side and work yourself backwards go over on one side of the cushion for you might otherwise displace it i will hold your wrists and let you over dick will hold the rope i will put it fairly on the cushion then i shall take it and stand close to the edge and pay it out gradually as you go down if you should find any projecting piece of rock call out stop i will hold on at once we can then talk over how we can best avoid the difficulty when you are down and i tell you dick is coming take hold of one of the steps and hold the ladder as firmly as you can so as to prevent it from swaying about  now are you ready  quite ready surajah said in a firm voice  dick who was standing five or six yards back tightened the rope gradually he saw surajahs figure disappear over the edge  slack out a little bit his father said that is right i have got it over the cushion now hold it firmly until i am on my feet that is right now pay it out gradually  it seemed an endless time to dick before his father exclaimed  the strain is off thank god he has got down all right  a minute later there was a slight pull on the rope and the captain paid it out until he heard a call from below  have you got to the lowest stick he asked leaning over  yes it is just touching the ground  not such a bad guess the captain said as he turned to dick there are about twenty feet left  he now fastened the rope round the spears in the ground  i will lower you down if you like dick you are half as heavy again as that young native but i have no doubt that i can manage it  not at all father i am not a bit nervous about it if it was light i should not feel so sure of myself for i might turn giddy but there is no fear of my doing so now  well lad it is as well to be on the safe side and i manufactured this yesterday  he put a loop composed of a rope some four feet long over dicks shoulders and under his arms to each end was attached a strong double hook like two fingers  there lad now if you feel at all tired or shaky all you have got to do is to hook this on to one of the steps do you see one hook on each side of the cord that way you can rest as long as you like and then go on again you say you can go down a rope with your hands only i should advise you to do that if you can and not to use your legs unless you want to sit down on one of the long steps for as you know if you use your feet the rope will go in till they are almost level with your head while if you use your arms only it will hang straight down  i know father and i dont suppose i shall have to rest at all for these cross sticks make it ten times as easy as having to grip the rope only  dick laid himself down as surajah had done and crawled backwards until he was lying half over the edge then he seized the rope and began to descend hand over hand he counted the rungs as he went down and half way he sat down on one of the long pieces hitched the hooks on to the one above and rested his arms after a short pause he continued until he reached the bottom  the captain who was stooping with his hand on the rope felt the vibration cease and as he leaned over he heard dick call out  i am all right father those bits of wood make easy work of it  then the captain at once began to descend and was soon standing beside his son and surajah  thank god that job is finished how do you both feel  my arms feel as if they had done some work father i have been four or five months without practice or i should hardly have felt it  and how are you surajah  i feel ashamed at having been let down like a baby captain holland and at being so nervous  there is nothing to be ashamed of captain holland said rope climbing is a thing that only comes with practice and as to nervousness most landsmen are afraid to trust themselves to a rope at all did you open your eyes  not once sahib i kept my arms out as you told me but i did not touch anything i could feel that i was spinning round and round and was horribly frightened just at first but i went down so smoothly and quietly that the feeling did not last long for i knew that the rope was very strong and as i did not touch anything it seemed to me that there could be no fear of it being cut against the rock  the clothes were soon unwound from the rope and put on again captain holland cut off all the slack of the rope and made it into a coil  the slope is all right as far as i could see from the top he said but we may come across nasty bits again and this will stand in useful if we do  they went down cautiously but at a fair rate of speed until without meeting with any serious difficulty they arrived on the plain four miles brisk walking brought them to the grove where ibrahim had been left and they had scarce entered among the trees when he asked  who is it that is coming  it is us ibrahim we have got my father  ibrahim gave an exclamation of joy and a minute later they joined him  you were not asleep then ibrahim dick said  no my lord i have slept during the day and watched at night but i did not sleep yesterday for i was growing sorely anxious and had begun to fear that harm had befallen you  well let us be off at once of course we have had to leave the horses behind us and i want to be at cenopatam by daybreak we will buy horses there  they struck across the country to the southwest until they came on a road between magree and cenopatam and arrived within sight of the latter town just at daybreak as they walked dick and surajah had with no small amount of pain removed their beards and the patches of hair  you ought both to have shaved before you put those things on captain holland said as they muttered exclamations of pain you see cobblers wax or whatever it is sticks to what little down there is on your cheeks and chin and i dont wonder that it hurts horribly pulling it off if you had shaved first you would not have felt any of that  i will remember that father if i ever have to disguise myself again dick said i feel as if i were pulling the whole skin off my face  the painful task was at last finished  i shall be glad to have a look at you in the morning dick his father said so as to see what you are really like of which i have not the least idea at present you must feel a deal more comfortable now that you have got rid of the rope  i am indeed i am sure surajah must be quite as much pleased at leaving his padding behind  they stopped half a mile from the town which was a place of considerable size dick took from the saddlebag of the horse ibrahim was leading the bottle of liquid with which he was in the habit of renewing his staining every few days and darkened his fathers face and hands then they took off their costumes as merchants and put on their peasants attire dick directed ibrahim to make a detour so as to avoid the town and come down on the road half a mile beyond it and there wait until they rejoined themfor his father was to accompany ibrahim  it was growing light as dick and surajah entered the town and in half an hour the streets became alive with people after some search they found a man who had several horses to sell and after the proper amount of bargaining they purchased three fairly good animals another half hour was occupied in procuring saddles and bridles and after riding through quiet streets to avoid questioning they left the town and soon rejoined their companions  now surajah dick said we will be colonels again for a bit  the saddlebags were again opened and in a few minutes they were transformed  why where on earth did you get those uniforms captain holland asked in surprise those sashes are the signs that their wearers are officers of the palace for i have seen them more than once at kistnagherry and the badges are those of colonels there is nothing like impudence dick but it seems to me it would have been safer if you had been contented with subofficers uniforms  dick laughed  we are wearing them because we have a right to them dick laughed we are both colonels in tippoos army and officers of the palacethat is we were so until a month ago though i expect since then our names have been struck off their army list i will tell you about it as we ride  you had better tell me afterwards dick i have never ridden a horse in my life except when they were taking me from the coast to mysore and i shall have enough to do to keep my seat and attend to my steering without trying to listen to you  they rode all day passed through anicull and oussoor and halted for the night in a grove two or three miles farther on they had not been questioned as at a walk they went through the town captain holland had ridden behind with ibrahim and the latter had stopped and laid in a stock of provisions at anicull  thank goodness that is over captain holland said as they dismounted i feel as if i had been beaten all over with sticks and am as hungry as a hunter  ibrahim will have some food ready in half an hour father and i shall be glad of some myself though you know we all had some chupatties he bought  they were better than nothing dick but a pancake or two does not go very far with men who have been travelling since ten oclock last night well lad i am glad that you have got rid of your beard and that except for that brown skin i am able to have a look at you as you are you will be bigger than i am dickbigger by a good bit i should say and any father might be proud of you much more so one who has been fetched out from a captivity from which he had given up all hope of escaping as it is lad words cant tell how grateful i feel to god for giving me such a son  my dear father it is mothers doing it has been her plan ever since she heard that you were wrecked that we should come out here to find you and she has had me regularly trained for it i had masters for fencing and gymnastics we always talked hindustani when we were together and she has encouraged me to fight with other boys so that i should get strong and quick  that evening by the fire dick told his father the whole story of his life since he had been in india  well my lad you have done wonders his father said when he had finished and if i had as much enterprise and go as you have i should have been out of this place years ago but in the first place i was very slow in picking up their lingo you see until within the last three or four years there have always been other englishmen with me of course we talked together and as most of them were able to speak a little of the lingo there was no occasion for me to learn it then i was always from the first when they saw that i was handy at all sorts of things kept at odd jobs and so got less chance of picking up the language than those who were employed in drilling or who had nothing to do but talk to their guards but most of all i did not try to escape because i found that if i did so it would certainly cost my companions their lives that was the way that scoundrel tippoo kept us from making attempts to get off  well soon after the last of the other captives was murdered we moved away to kistnagherry which was a very difficult place to escape from and besides very soon after we got there i heard of the war with our people and hoped that they would take the place it was as you may suppose a terrible disappointment to me when they failed in their attack on it still i hoped that they would finally thrash tippoo and that somehow i might get handed over to them however as you know when peace was made and kistnagherry had to be given over the governor got orders to evacuate it without waiting for the english to come up to take possession  well since i have been at savandroog i have thought often of trying to get away by the time i got there i had learned to speak the language fairly enough to make my way across the country and i have been living in hopes that somehow or other i might get possession of a rope long enough to let myself down the rocks but as i told you i have never so much as seen one up there twenty feet long  i did think of gradually buying enough cotton cloth to twist up and make a rope of but you see when one has been years in captivity one loses a lot of ones energy if i had been worse off i should have set about the thing in earnest but you see i was not badly treated at all i was always doing odd carpentering jobs for the colonel and officers and armourers work at the guns any odd time i had over i did jobs for the soldiers and their wives i got a good many little presents enough to keep me in decent clothes and decent foodif you can call the food you have up there decentand to provide me with tobacco so that except that i was a prisoner and for the thought of my wife and you i had really nothing to grumble about and was indeed better off than anyone in the fortress except the officers so you see i just existed always making up my mind that some day i should see a good chance of making my escape but not really making any preparations towards casting off my moorings  now dick it must be past twelve oclock and i am dog tired how far have we to ride tomorrow  it is thirtyfive miles from oussoor to kistnagherry which will be far enough for us to go tomorrow and then another fiveandtwenty will take us down to tripataly as the horses have gone about forty miles it would be a long journey for them to go right through tomorrow  i dont think i could do it dick if they could i expect i shall be stiffer tomorrow than i am now eager as i am to see your dear mother i dont want to have to be lifted off my horse when i arrive there almost speechless with fatigue  the next day they rode on to kistnagherry passing a small frontier fort without question they slept at the post house there dick and surajah having removed their scarves and emblems of rank as soon as they passed the frontier in order to escape all inquiries they started next morning at daybreak and arrived within sight of tripataly at ten oclock  now father i will gallop on dick said i must break the news to mother before you arrive  certainly dick his father who had scarcely spoken since they started replied i have been feeling very anxious about it all the morning for though as you tell me she has never lost faith in my being alive my return cannot but be a great shock to her  dick rode on and on arriving at the palace was met in the courtyard by the rajah who was on the point of going out on horseback he dismounted at once  i am truly glad to see you back dick for your mother has been in a sad state of anxiety about you eight days ago she started up from a nap she was taking in the middle of the day and burst out crying saying that she was certain you were in some terrible danger though whether you were killed or not she could not say since then she has been in a bad state she has scarcely closed an eye and has spent her whole time in walking restlessly up and down  it is quite true that i was in great danger uncle and i am sorry indeed that she is in this state for my coming home will be a shock to her and she has an even greater one to bear surajah and i have rescued my father and he will be here in a few minutes  i congratulate you the rajah said warmly that is news indeednews that i for one never expected to hear it is simply marvellous dick however i am sure that your mother is not fit to bear it at present i will go up now and tell gholla to break your return gradually to her i will say nothing about your father to your aunt as soon as the news that you are here is broken you must go to your mother tell her as little as possible pretend that you are hungry and have a meal sent up and persuade her to take some nourishment then declare positively that you wont tell her anything about your adventures until she has had a long sleep gholla will prepare a sleeping draught for her  in the meantime i will ride off directly i have seen my wife to meet surajah and your father and bring him on here i shant tell anyone who he is in case a chance word should come to your mothers ears if she wakes up again this evening and asks for you you must judge for yourself whether to tell her anything or to wait until morning you might perhaps if she seems calm gladden her with the news that from what you have heard you have very strong hopes that a prisoner in keeping at one of the hill forts is your father then tomorrow morning you can tell her the whole truth now i will run up to gholla there is no time to be lost  i shall be in the dining room uncle when i am wanted  a few minutes later gholla came in hastily  your mother has fainted dick i broke the news to her very gently but it was too much for her in her weak state when she comes round again and is able to talk i will fetch you in the meantime i will send annie in to you  two minutes later the girl ran in with a flushed face threw herself into dicks arms and kissed him  i cant help it dick she said so it is of no use your scolding me this is a surprise who would have thought of your coming back so soon but it is lucky you did your mother has been in a sad way and she was so sure that you had been in some terrible danger that i have been almost as anxious as she has and now it seems that i need not have frightened myself at all  i was in great danger annie just at the time my mother dreamt about me surajah ibrahim and i were attacked by a party of stranglers disguised as merchants and if it had not been that i had some strange suspicion of them we should all have been murdered as it was we shot the whole gang who fortunately for us had no firearms  it must have been your mother who warned you annie said gravely she told us that she dreamt you were in some terrible danger though she could not remember what it was and she tried with all her might to warn you  perhaps it was that annie i dont know why i suspected them so stronglysurajah quite laughed at the idea anyhow it saved our lives  and how are you getting on annie are you happy  oh so happy she exclaimed at least i was until your mother got ill and i was working very hard at my lessons but of course that has all been stopped as far as taking them from her is concerned but i have gone on working and the rajahs sons have been very good and helped me sometimes and i begin to read words of two letters and what has brought you back so soon  that i cant tell you yet annie i will only tell you that it is not bad news and no one but my uncle will know more than that till i have told my mothereven my aunt wont hear it  has surajah come back too dick  yes i heard horses in the courtyard just now and i have no doubt it was him i rode on first being anxious to see my mother  they chatted for a few minutes then the rajah came to the door and called dick into the next room  i have settled your father in the room at the other end of the gallery dick he agreed with me that it was better for him to keep there by himself until you have told your mother that he is here i have just ordered a meal to be sent and after that will send my barber in to shave him he says your mother will never recognise him with all that hair on his face i am going to see if something cannot be done to take the stain off his face and shall then set half a dozen tailors to work on some dark blue cloth to turn him out a suit before tomorrow morning in what he calls sailor fashion so that he may appear before your mother in something like the style in which she remembers him  a few minutes later gholla came in and said that mrs holland was ready for dick to go in to her dick found his mother looking pale and weak but the joy of his coming had already brightened her eyes and given a faint flush to her cheeks  i have been so dreadfully anxious dick she said after the first embrace i was certain you had been in some terrible danger  i have been but thank god i escaped owing i think to the warning annie says you tried to give me but we must not talk about that now i will tell you all the story tomorrow you are not fit to talk you must take some broth and some wine and a sleeping draught and i hope you will go off and not wake up till tomorrow morning  now you do as i tell you while you are drinking your broth i will go in and take something to eat for i have had nothing today and am as hungry as a hunter then i will come back and sit by you till you go off to sleep  he was not long away but he was met at the door by his aunt who said  she has gone off already dick i have no doubt that she will sleep many hours but if she wakes i will let you know at once  if that is the case gholla the rajah who had come in at the same moment said i can let you into a secret which no one but myself knows yet but which now that margaret is asleep can be told  gholla was very pleased when she heard the news and dick went off at once to his father it was a great relief to the latter to know that his wife had gone off to sleep and would probably be well enough to have the news broken to her in the morning  i hear that you are preparing for the meeting father by getting yourself shaved and having a blue cloth suit made  yes dick i should like to be as much like my old self as possible  i dont think mother will care much what you look like father still it is very natural that you should want to get rid of all that hair  what bothers me lad captain holland went on putting his hand to the back of his neck is this shaved spot here of course with the turban on and the native rig it was all right but it will look a rum affair in english clothes  dick could not help laughing at his fathers look of perplexity  well father it is just the same with myself i have not changed yet but when i do the hair above which is now tucked up under the turban will be quite long enough to come down to the nape of the neck and hide that bare place till the hair grows again  yes i did not think of that my hair is long enough to come down over my shoulders i was going to tell the barber to cut it short all over but i will see now that he allows for that  now father do you mind my bringing in annie mansfield i know she will be wanting to keep close to me all day and i should never be able to get rid of her without telling her about you  bring her in by all means dick she must be a plucky young girl by what you said about her  where have you been dick annie inquired when dick went out a few minutes later i have been looking for you everywhere nobody had seen you unless it was the rajah i asked him and he said that little girls must not ask questions and then laughed  you have not brought home another white girl she exclaimed suddenly  would it not be very nice for you to have a companion annie  no she said sharply i should not like it at all  well i will take you in to see her and i think you will like her  no i am only joking he broke off as he saw tears start into her eyes it is not another girl but you shall see for yourself  he took her hand and led her to his fathers room  there annie this is the gentleman who has come back with me this time  annie looked at captain holland in surprise and then turned her eyes to dick for an explanation  he is a respectablelooking old native isnt he annie  yes he looks respectable annie said gravely but he doesnt look very old why has he come down with you dick he cant have been a slave  but i have lass the captain said in english to annies intense astonishment i have been in their hands a year or so longer than you were  annie turned impulsively to dick and grasped his arm  oh dick she said in an excited whisper is itis it your father after all  ay lass the captain answered for him i am the boys father and a happy father too as you may guess at finding i have such a son and i hear he has been a good friend to you too  oh he has he has indeed annie cried running forward and seizing his hands in both of hers i dont think there ever was anyone so kind and good  what bosh annie dick exclaimed almost crossly  never mind what he says my dear you and i know all about it now we can do very well without him for a time he can go and tell his uncle and cousins all about his adventures which i have no doubt they are dying to hear and you and i can sit here and exchange confidences until my barber comes i dont look much like an englishman now but i hope that they will be able to get me something that will take this stain off my face  mrs holland did not wake till evening she seemed very much better and had a short chat with dick she would have got up had he not told her that he should be going to bed himself in a short time and that all his story would keep very well until the morning when he hoped to find her quite herself again  by dint of the application of various unguents and a vast amount of hard scrubbing captain holland restored his face to its original hue  i look a bit sunburnt he said but i have often come back browner than this from some of my voyages  you look quite like yourself in your portrait at home father dick said it is the shaving and cutting your hair even more than getting off the dye that has made the difference i dont think you look much older than you did then except that there are a few grey hairs  i shall look better tomorrow dick when i get these outlandish things off i have been trying on my new suit and i think it will do first rate those clothes that you wore on board ship and handed to them as a model gave them the idea of what i wanted  and indeed the next morning when captain holland appeared in his new suit dick declared that he looked just as if he had walked down from his picture the ranee had agreed to break the news to mrs holland as soon as she was dressed she came into the room where the others were waiting for breakfast and said to captain holland  come she knows all and has borne it well  she led him to the door of mrs hollands room and opened it as he entered there was a cry of  oh jack my jack  then she closed it behind him and left husband and wife together  a few days afterwards there was a family consultation  now dick his father said we must settle about your plans you know we have decided upon going home by the next ship and taking annie with us without waiting for her fathers letter of course i shall have no difficulty in finding out when i get there what his address is i have promised your mother to give up the sea and settle down again at shadwell where i can meet old friends and shall feel at home we have had a long talk over what you said the other night about your insisting that we should take the money those jewels of yours fetch well we wont do that  then i will sell them father dick said positively and give the money to a hospital  i have not finished yet dick we wont take all the money but we have agreed that we will take a quarter of it of course we could manage on my savings as your mother did when i was away we shall lose the little allowance the company made her but i shall buy a share in a ship with my money which will bring in a good deal better rate of interest than she got for it in the funds so we could still manage very well still as we feel that it would please you we agree to take a quarter of the money the jewels fetch and that with what i have will give us an income well beyond our wants so that is settled  now about yourself i really dont think that you can do better than what you proposed when we were talking of it yesterday you would be like a fish out of water in england if you had nothing to occupy your time and therefore cant do better than enter the service here and remain at any rate for a few years  as your commission was dated from the time you joined lord cornwallis two and a half years ago you wont be at the bottom of the tree and while you are serving you will want no money here and the interest of your capital will be accumulating if i invest it in shipping for you you will get eight or ten percent for it and as i shall pick good ships commanded by men i know and will divide the money up in small shares among half a dozen of them there will be practically no riskand of course the vessels will be insured so that at the end of ten years by reinvesting the profits your money will be more than doubled and you will have a nice fortune when you choose to come home even if the jewels do not fetch anything like what you expect  a week later the party journeyed down to madras where they stayed for a fortnight dick on his arrival called upon the governor who congratulated him most heartily when he heard that he had succeeded in finding and releasing his father and at once appointed him to one of the native cavalry regiments and his parents had the satisfaction of seeing him in uniform before they started annie showed but little interest in the thought of going to england and being restored to her parents being at the time too much distressed at parting from dick to give any thought to other matters but at last the goodbyes were all said and as the anchor was weighed dick returned on shore in a surf boat and next day joined his regiment  surajah had wanted to accompany him to madras and to enlist in any regiment to which he might be appointed and the assurance that it might be a long time before he became a native officer as these were always chosen from the ranks except in the case of raising new regiments had little influence with him the rajah however had finally persuaded him to stay by the argument that his father who was now getting on in years would sorely miss him that the captain of the troop would also be retiring shortly and that he should as a reward for his faithful services to his nephew appoint him to the command as soon as it was vacant ibrahim entered the rajahs service preferring that to soldiering    chapter 21 home   it was early in december 1792 that dick holland joined his regiment which was stationed at madras there were but five other officers and dick found to his satisfaction that the junior of them had had four years service consequently he did not step over any ones head owing to his commission being dated nearly three years previously as there were in the garrison many officers who had served on the general staff in the last war dick soon found some of his former acquaintances and the story of his long search for his father and its successful termination soon spread and gained for him a place in civil as well as military society  the next year passed peacefully and was an unusually quiet time in india that tippoo intended to renew the war as soon as he was able was well known to the government and one of its chief objects of solicitude was the endeavour to counteract the secret negotiations that were constantly going on between him the nizam and the mahrattis  tippoo was known to have sent confidential messengers to all the great princes of indiaeven to the ruler of afghanistaninviting them to join the confederacy of the mahrattis the nizam and himself to drive the english out of india altogether still greater cause for uneasiness was the alliance that tippoo had endeavoured to make with the french who as he had learned had gained great successes in europe and believing from their account that their country was much stronger than england he had sent envoys to the mauritius to propose an offensive and defensive alliance against england the envoys had been politely received and some of them had proceeded to france where tippoos proposal had been accepted they committed france indeed to nothing as she was already at war with england but the french were extremely glad to embrace the proposal of tippoo as they overrated his power and believed that he would prove a formidable opponent to the english and would necessitate the employment of additional troops and ships there and so weaken englands power at home to confirm the alliance some sixty or seventy frenchmen mostly adventurers were sent from the mauritius as civil and military officers  tippoos council had been strongly opposed to this step on his part they had pointed out to him that their alliance with a power at war with the english would render war between the english and him inevitable and that france was not in a position to aid them in any way the only benefit indeed that he could gain was the possibility that the fourteen thousand french troops in the service of the nizam might revolt and come over to him but even this was doubtful as these were not troops belonging to the french government but an independent body raised and officered by adventurers who might not be willing to imperil their own position and interests by embarking on a hazardous war at the orders of a fardistant government  these events happened soon after dicks return but nothing was generally known of what was passing although reports of tippoos proceedings had reached the government of india the party of frenchmen arrived at seringapatam and were at first well received by tippoo but they had soon disgusted him by their assumption of dictatorial powers while they on their part were disappointed at not receiving the emoluments and salaries they had expected most of them very speedily left his service some of the military men were employed at bangalore and other towns in drilling the troops and a few remained at seringapatam neglected by tippoo whose eyes were now open to the character of these adventurers but this in no way shook his belief that he would obtain great aid from france as he had received letters from official personages there encouraging him to combine with other native powers to drive the english out of india and promising large aid in troops and ships  when the earl of morningtonafterwards the marquis of wellesleyarrived at calcutta as governor general of india in may 1798 the situation had become so critical that although war had not been absolutely declared on either side tippoos open alliance with the french rendered it certain that hostilities must commence ere long and lord mornington lost no time in proceeding to make preparations for war as lord cornwallis had done he found the greatest difficulty in inducing the supine government of madras to take any steps they protested that were they to make any show of activity tippoo would descend the ghauts and at once ravage the whole country and they declared that they had no force whatever that could withstand him they continued in their cowardly inactivity until the governor general was forced to override their authority altogether and take the matter into his own hands  the first step was to curb the nizams power for everything pointed to the probability that he intended to join mysore being inclined so to do by tippoos promises and by the influence of the officers of the strong body of french troops in his service negotiations were therefore opened by lord mornington who offered to guarantee the nizams dominions if he would join the english against tippoo and promised that after the war he should obtain a large share of the territory taken from mysore  the nizams position was a difficult one on one side of him lay the dominions of his warlike and powerful neighbour tippoo on the other he was exposed to the incursions of the mahrattis whose rising power was a constant threat to his safety he had moreover to cope with a serious rebellion by his son ali jah  he was willing enough to obtain the guarantee of the english against aggressions by the mahrattis but he hesitated in complying with the preliminary demand that he should dispense with the french the fighting powers of this body rendered them valuable auxiliaries but he secretly feared them and resented their pretensions which pointed to the fact that ere long instead of being his servants they might become his masters when therefore the british government offered him a subsidiary force of six battalions and to guarantee him against any further aggression by the mahrattis he accepted the proposal but in a halfhearted way that showed he could not be relied upon for any efficient assistance in disarming his french auxiliaries  no time was lost by the government in marching the promised force to hyderabad the french 14000 strong refused to disband and were joined by the nizams household force which was in the french interest the nizam terrified at the prospect of a contest the success of which was doubtful abandoned the capital and took refuge in a fortress there to await the issue of events but positively refused to issue orders to the french to disband two of the english battalions which were on the other side of the river to that on which the french were encamped opened a destructive fire upon them and with redhot shot set fire to their magazines and storehouses while the other four battalions moved into position to make a direct attack  the nizam now saw that he had no alternative but to declare openly for the french or to dismiss them he preferred the latter alternative peron who commanded the french saw that unless he surrendered the position of his force was desperate accordingly on receipt of the order he and his officers expressed their readiness to accept their dismissal their men were however in a state of mutiny and the officers were compelled to make their escape from the camp under cover of night the next morning the camp was surrounded by the english and the troops of the nizam and the french then surrendered without a shot being fired  while the nizam was thus rendered powerless negotiations had been going on with the mahrattis but owing to the quarrels and jealousies of their chiefs nothing could be done with them it was however apparent that for the same reason tippoo would equally fail in his attempt to obtain their alliance against us and that therefore it was with mysore alone that we should have to deal  in the meantime though preparing for war lord mornington was most anxious to avoid it when tippoo wrote to complain that some villages of his had been occupied by people from coorg the governor general ordered their immediate restoration to him in november he sent the sultan a friendly letter pointing out that he could look for no efficient aid from france and that any auxiliaries who might possibly join him would only introduce the principles of anarchy and the hatred of all religion that animated the whole french nation that his alliance with them was really equivalent to a declaration of war against england and as he was unwilling to believe that tippoo was actuated by unfriendly feelings or desired to break the engagements of the treaty entered into with him he offered to send an officer to mysore to discuss any points upon which variance might have arisen and to arrange a scheme that would be satisfactory to them both  to this letter no answer was received for five weeks by which time lord mornington had arrived at madras he then received a letter containing a tissue of the most palpable lies concerning tippoos dealings with the french two or three more letters passed but as tippoos answers were all vague and evasive the governor general issued a manifesto on the 22nd of february 1799 recapitulating all the grievances against mysore and declaring that though the allies were prepared to repel any attack they were equally anxious to effect an arrangement with him  but tippoo still believed that a large french army would speedily arrive he had received letters from buonaparte in person written from egypt and saying that he had arrived on the borders of the red sea with an innumerable and invincible army full of the desire to deliver you from the iron yoke of england tippoo well knew also that although the governor general spoke for himself and his allies the nizam was powerless to render any assistance to the english and that the mahrattis were far more likely to join him than they were to assist his foes  the manifesto of lord mornington was speedily followed by action for at the end of january an army of nearly 37000 men had been assembled at vellore of these some 20000 were the madras force with them were the nizams army nominally commanded by meer alum but really by colonel wellesleyafterwards duke of wellingtonwho had with him his own regiment the 33rd 6500 men under colonel dalrymple 3621 infantry for the most part french troops who had reenlisted under us and 6000 regular and irregular horse  dick who had now attained the rank of captain had been introduced by one of lord cornwalliss old staff officers to general harris who as general of the madras army was in command of the whole on hearing of the services dick had rendered in the last war and that his perfect acquaintance with the language and with the ground over which the army would pass would enable him to be equally efficient on the present occasion general harris at once detached him from service with the regiment and appointed him to a post on his own staff  had it not been that dick had seen for the last two years that hostilities must ere long be commenced with tippoo he would before this have left the army and returned home he was heartily tired of the long inaction when the regiment was stationed at madras life was very pleasant but a considerable portion of his time was spent at out stations where the duties were very light and there was nothing to break the monotony of camp life he received letters regularly from his mother who gave him full details of their home life  the first that he received merely announced their safe arrival in england the second was longer and more interesting they had had no difficulty in discovering the address of annies father and on writing to him he had immediately come up to town he had lost his wife on his voyage home from india and was overjoyed at the discovery of his daughter and at her return to england  he is dicks mother wrote very much broken in health annie behaved very nicely poor child it was only natural that after what you did for her and our being all that time with her the thought of leaving us for her parent of whom she had no recollection was a great grief however i talked it over with her many times and pointed out to her that her first duty was to the father who had been so many years deprived of her and that although there was no reason why she should not manifest affection for us she must not allow him to think for a moment that she was not as pleased to see him as he was to welcome her she behaved beautifully when her father arrived and when he had been in the house five minutes and spoke of the death of his wife his bitter regret that she had not lived to see annie restored to them the loneliness of his life and how it would be brightened now that she was again with him his words so touched her that she threw herself into his arms and sobbed out that she would do all she could to make his life happy he had of course received the letter we had written to him from tripataly and quite pained me by the gratitude he showed for what he called my kindness to his daughter  he said that by this post he should write to endeavour to express some of his feelings to you annie went away with him the next day to a place he has bought near plymouth he has promised to let us have her for a month every year and we have promised to go down for the same time every summer to stay with her he asks numberless questions about you which neither i nor annie are ever tired of answering even with a mothers natural partiality i must own that her descriptions are almost too flattering and he must think that you are one of the most admirable of men  next as to the jewels your father took them to be valued by several diamond merchants and accepted the highest offer which was 16000 pounds of which he has already invested twelve in your name in shares in six ships four of these are indiamen the other two are privateers he said that he did not think you would object to a quarter of the money being put into a speculative venture and that they were both good craft well armed and well commanded with strong crews and would if successful earn as much in a year as a merchantman would in ten  since then the letters had been of a uniform character the shares in the indiamen were giving a good and steady return the privateers had been very fortunate and had captured some rich prizes annie had been up or they had been down at plymouth the letters during the last three years had reported her as having grown into a young woman and as his mother declared a very pretty one after that the allusions to her were less frequent but it was mentioned that she was as fond of them as ever and that she was still unmarried  she always asks when you are coming home dick mrs holland said in the last letter he had received before accompanying general harris to vellore i told her of course that your last letter said that war was certain with tippoo that you hoped this time to see seringapatam taken and the tyrants power broken and that after it was over you would come home on leave and perhaps would not go out again  during the six years that he had been in the army dick had very frequently been at tripataly as there was little difficulty in getting leave for a fortnight his cousins had now grown up into young men surajah commanded the troop and his stays there were always extremely pleasant the troop now numbered two hundred for with quiet times the population of the territory had largely increased and the rajahs income grown in proportion the troop was now dressed in uniform and in arms and discipline resembled the irregular cavalry in the companys service and when dick arrived at vellore he found his uncle and cousins there with their cavalry  i thought dick of only sending the boys the rajah said but when the time came for them to start i felt that i must go myself we have suffered enough at the hands of mysore and i do hope to see tippoos capital taken and his power of mischief put an end to for good and all  i am glad indeed that you are coming uncle you may be sure that whenever i can get away from my duties with the general i shall spend most of my time in your camp though i must occasionally drop in on my own regiment  the rajah had already been down to madras a month before and with his sons had been introduced to general harris by the latters chief of the staff as having been always like his father before him a faithful ally of the english and as having accompanied lord cornwallis on the occasion of the last campaign in mysore the general had thanked him heartily for his offer to place his two hundred cavalry at the disposal of the government and had expressed a hope that he as well as his sons would accompany it in the field  on the 11th of february 1799 the army moved from vellore but instead of ascending by the pass of amboor as had been expected it moved southwest ascended the pass of paliode and on the 9th of march was established without opposition in tippoos territory at a distance of eighty miles east of his capital they then marched north until they reached a village ten miles south of bangalore this route although circuitous was chosen as the roads were better the country more level and cultivation much more general affording far greater facilities for the collection of forage for the baggage animals  hitherto nothing had been seen of the mysorean army it had been confidently expected that tippoo would fight at least one great battle to oppose their advance against his capital but so far no signs had been seen of an enemy and even the mysore horse which had played so conspicuous a part in the last campaign in no way interfered with the advance of the army or even with the foraging parties  a despatch that reached them by a circuitous route explained why tippoo had suffered them to advance so far unmolested while the madras army had advanced from the southeast a bombay force 6500 strong was ascending the western ghauts as the advance brigade consisting of three native battalions under colonel montresor reached sedaseer tippoo with 12000 of his best troops fell upon it suddenly his force had moved through the jungle and attacked the brigade in front and rear  although thus surprised by an enemy nearly six times their superior in force the sepoys behaved with a calmness and bravery that could not have been surpassed by veteran troops maintaining a steady front they repulsed every attack until a brigade encamped eight miles in their rear came up to their assistance and tippoo was then forced to retreat having suffered a loss of 1500 men including many of his best officers  this proof of the inferiority of his troops even when enormously outnumbering the english and fighting with all the advantages of surprise profoundly impressed tippoo and from this time he appeared to regard the struggle as hopeless and displayed no signs whatever of the dash and energy that had distinguished him when leading one of the divisions of his fathers army he marched with his troops straight to seringapatam and then moved out with his whole force to give battle to the main body of the invaders the antagonists came within sight of each other at the village of malavilly thirty miles east of the capital for some time an artillery fire on both sides was kept up gradually the infantry became engaged and the mysoreans showed both courage and steadiness until a column of two thousand men moved forward to attack the 33rd regiment  the british troops reserved their fire until the column was within fifty yards of them then they poured in a withering volley and charged the column fell back in disorder general floyd at once charged them with five regiments of cavalry sabred great numbers of them and drove the remainder back in headlong rout the whole british line then advanced cheering loudly the first line of tippoos army fell back upon its second and the whole then marched away at a speed that soon left the british infantry far behind them  instead of continuing his march straight upon the capital general harris learning from spies that tippoo had wasted the whole country along that line moved southwest collecting as he went great quantities of cattle sheep and goats and an abundance of grain and forage crossed the cauvery at a ford at sosilay and on the 5th of april took up his position at a distance of two miles from the western face of the fort of seringapatam  this movement completely disconcerted tippoo he had imagined that the attack would as on the previous occasion take place on the northern side of the river and had covered the approaches there with a series of additional fortifications while on the other side he had done but little so despondent was he that he called together his principal officers and said to them  we have arrived at our last stage what is your determination  his advisers took no brighter view of the prospect than he did himself they had unanimously opposed the war had warned tippoo against trusting to the french and had been adverse to measures that could but result in a fresh trial of strength with the english the sultan however while not attempting to combat their opinion had gone on his own way and his officers now saw their worst fears justified they replied to his question  our determination is to die with you  on the day after arriving before seringapatam the british attacked the villages and rocky eminences held by the enemy on the south side of the river and drove them back under the shelter of their guns general floyd was sent with the cavalry to meet the bombay force and escort it to seringapatam this was accomplished and although the whole of the mysore cavalry and a strong force of infantry hovered round the column they did not venture to engage it and on the 14th the whole arrived at the camp before seringapatam  the bombay force which was commanded by general stuart crossed to the north bank of the river and took up a position there which enabled them to take in flank the outlying works and trenches with which tippoo had hoped to prevent any attack upon the western angle of the fort where the river was so shallow that it could be easily forded  tippoo now endeavoured to negotiate and asked for a conference general harris returned an answer enclosing the draft of a preliminary treaty with which he had been supplied before starting it demanded one half of tippoos territories a payment of two millions sterling and the delivery of four of his sons as hostages tippoo returned no reply and on the 22nd the garrison made a vigorous sortie and were only repulsed after several hours fighting  for the next five days the batteries of the besiegers kept up a heavy fire silenced every gun in the outlying works and compelled their defenders to retire across the river into the fort tippoo now sank into such a state of despondency that he would listen to none of the proposals of his officers for strengthening the position and would not even agree to the construction of a retrenchment which would cut off the western angle of the fort against which it was evident that the attack would be directed  he knew that if captured there was little chance of his being permitted to continue to reign and had indeed made that prospect more hopeless by massacring all the english prisoners who had by his order been brought in from the hill forts throughout the country on his return to seringapatam after the repulse he had suffered in his attack on the bombay force  on the 2nd of may the batteries opened on the wall of the fort near its northwest angle and so heavy was their fire that by the evening of the 3rd a breach of sixty yards long was effected general harris determined to assault on the following day general baird who had for four years been a prisoner in seringapatam volunteered to lead the assault and before daybreak 4376 men took their places in the advance trenches where they lay down  it was determined that the assault should not be made until one oclock at which time tippoos troops anticipating no attack would be taking their food and resting during the heat of the day the troops who were to make the assault were divided into two columns which after mounting the breach were to turn right and left fighting their way along the ramparts until they met at the other end a powerful reserve under colonel wellesley was to support them after they had entered  when the signal was given the troops leapt from the trenches and covered by the fire of the artillery which at the same moment opened on the ramparts dashed across the river scaled the breach and in six minutes from the firing of the signal gun planted the british flag on its crest  then the heads of the two columns at once started to fight their way along the ramparts at first the resistance was slight surprised and panic stricken the defenders of the strong works at this point offered but a feeble resistance some fled along the walls some ran down into the fort many threw themselves over the wall into the rocky bed of the river the right column in less than an hour had won its way along the rampart to the eastern face of the fort but the left column met with a desperate resistance for as each point was carried the enemy constantly reinforced made a fresh stand most of the officers who led the column were shot down and so heavy was the fire that several times the advance was brought to a standstill  it was not until the right column making their way along the wall to the assistance of their comrades took them in the rear that the mysoreans entirely lost heart taken between two fires they speedily became a disorganised mass many hundreds were shot down either in the fort or as pouring out through the river gate they endeavoured to cross the ford and escape to the north  as soon as the whole rampart was captured general baird sent an officer with a flag of truce to the palace to offer protection to tippoo and all its inmates on condition of immediate surrender two of tippoos younger sons assured the officer that the sultan was not in the palace the assurance was disbelieved and the princes being sent to the camp under a strong escort the palace was searched the officer in command on being strictly questioned declared that tippoo who had in person commanded the defence made against the left column had been wounded and that he had heard he was lying in a gateway on the north side of the fort  a search was immediately made and the information proved correct tippoo was found lying there not only wounded but dead he had indeed received several wounds and was endeavouring to escape in his palanquin when this had been upset by the rush of fugitives striving to make their way through the gate  the gateway was indeed almost choked up with the bodies of those who had been either suffocated in the crush or killed by their pursuers on his palanquin being overturned tippoo had evidently risen to his feet and had at the same moment been shot through the head by an english soldier ignorant of his rank in the evening he was buried with much state by the side of his father in the mausoleum of lal bang at the eastern extremity of the island  it was with great difficulty that when the british soldiers became aware of the massacre of their countrymen a few days before they were restrained from taking vengeance upon his sons and the inmates of the palace in the assault 8000 of the defenders were killed while the loss of the british during the siege and in the assault amounted to 825 europeans and 639 native troops an enormous quantity of cannon arms and ammunition was captured and the value of the treasure and jewels amounted to considerably over a million pounds besides the doubtless large amount of jewels that had in the first confusion fallen into the hands of the soldiers  as dick after the fighting had ceased went by order of the general to examine the prisoners and ascertain their rank his eye fell upon an old officer whose arm hung useless by his side broken by a musket ball he went up to him and held out his hand  mirzah mahomed buckshy he exclaimed i am glad to meet you again although sorry to see that you are wounded  the officer looked at him in surprise  you have spoken my name he said but i do not know that we have ever met before  we have met twice the first time i was with a friend dressed as one of tippoos officers and came to examine the state of savandroog the second time we were dressed as merchants and i succeeded in effecting the liberation of my father both times i received much kindness at your hands but far more grateful am i to you for your goodness to my father whose life you preserved  i see you still carry the pistols i left for you and doubtless you also received the letter i placed with them  thanks be to allah the old colonel said that we have thus met again truly i rejoiced when my first anger that i had been fooled passed away that your father had escaped and that without my being able to blame myself for carelessness your letter to me completed my satisfaction for i felt that heaven had rightly rewarded the efforts of a son who had done so much and risked his life for a father  is he alive is he here i should be glad to see him again and indeed i missed him sorely i have been here for two years having been appointed to a command among the troops here  my father is well and is in england he will i know be glad indeed to hear that i have met you for he will ever retain a grateful remembrance of your kindness now i must finish my work here and will then go to the general and beg him to give me an order for your release  an hour later dick returned with the order and carried mahomed buckshy off to the rajahs camp here his arm was set by one of the surgeons and he was so well cared for by the rajah dick and surajah that a fortnight later he was convalescent and was able to join his wife in the town  i am thankful he said on leaving that my life as a soldier is over and that i shall never more have to fight against the english tippoo was my master but it is he who by his cruelty and ambition has brought ruin upon mysore i have saved enough to live in comfort for the rest of my life and to its end i shall rejoice that i have again met the son of my friend jack  the capture of seringapatam was followed at once by the entire submission of the whole country a descendant of the old rajah of mysore was placed upon the throne his rule was however but a nominal one a very large amount of territory was annexed the island of seringapatam was permanently occupied as a british possession the new rajah was bound to receive and pay a large military force for the defence of his territories not to admit any european foreigners into his dominions to allow the company to garrison any fort in mysore that might seem advisable to them and to pay at all times attention to such advice as might be given him as to the administration of his affairs he was in fact to be but a puppet the british becoming the absolute rulers of mysore  the family of tippoo and the ladies of the harem were removed to vellore where they were to receive a palace suitable to their former rank and expectations and allowances amounting to 160000 pounds a year  thus mysore one of the most ancient and powerful of the kingdoms of india fell into the hands of the english owing to the ambition bigotry and besotted cruelty of the son of a usurper  dicks part in all these operations had been a busy although not a very dangerous one the only share he had taken in the active fighting had been in the battle at malavilly where having been sent with a message to colonel floyd just before he led the cavalry to the assault of the column that had attacked the 33rd he took his place by the side of the rajah and his cousins whose troop formed part of floyds command and joined in the charge on the enemy he had however rendered great services in the quartermasters department was very highly spoken of in the despatches of general harris and his name appeared as promoted to the rank of major in the list of honours promulgated by lord mornington at the termination of the campaign  his regiment was among those selected for the occupation of mysore and a month after the capture of the city he obtained leave to return to england he stayed for a week at tripataly and then took an affectionate farewell of his uncle the ranee his cousins and surajah and sailed from madras a fortnight later the ship in which he was a passenger was accompanied by two other indiamen and when a fortnight out they encountered a french frigate which however they beat off and arrived in england without further adventure  as soon as he landed dick drove to the house where his father and mother had taken up their residence on their arrival in england but he found to his surprise that eight months before they had moved to another in the village of hackney he proceeded there and found it to be a considerably larger one than that they had left and standing in its own grounds which were of some extent he had written to them after the fall of seringapatam and told them that he should probably sail for england about six weeks later as the vehicle drove to the door his father and mother ran out his father grasped his hand and his mother threw her aims round his neck with tears of joy  as soon as the first greeting was over dick saw a young lady in deep mourning standing on the steps he looked at her for a moment in surprise and then exclaimed  it is annie mansfield  annie held out her hand and laughed  we are both changed almost beyond recognition dick  then she added demurely the last time i had to ask you  you shant have to ask me again annie he said giving her a hearty kiss my first impulse was to do it but i did not know whether your sentiments on the subject had changed  i am not given to change she said  am i mrs holland  i dont think you are my dear i think there is a little spice of obstinacy in your composition  but come in dick dont let us stand talking here at the door when we have so much to say to each other  he went into the sitting room with his father and mother where annie presently left them to themselves  why father the privateers must have done well indeed dick said looking round the handsome room  i have nothing to grumble at on that score dick though they have not been so lucky the last two years but it is not their profits that induced us to move here you saw annie was in mourning her father died nearly a year ago and at her earnest request as he said in his will appointed us her guardians until she came of age which will be in a few months now as he had no near relations he left the whole of his property to her and having been in india in the days when under warren hastings there were good pickings to be obtained it amounted to a handsome fortune she said that she should come and live with us at any rate until she became of age and as that house of ours though a comfortable place was hardly the sort of house for an heiress she herself proposed that we should take a larger house between us  and so here we are we shall stay here through the winter and then we are going down to her place at plymouth for the summer what we shall do afterwards is not settled that must depend upon a variety of things  she has grown much prettier than i ever thought she would do dick said of course i knew she would have grown into a woman but somehow i never realised it until i saw her and i believe i have always thought of her as being still the girl i carried off from seringapatam  in a few minutes annie joined them and the talk then turned upon india and many questions were asked as to their friends at tripataly  i suppose by this time annieat least i hope i may still call you annie  if you call me anything else i shall not answer she said indignantly  well i was going to say i suppose you have got a good deal beyond words of two letters now  i regard the question as an impertinent one i have even mastered geography the meaning of which word you may remember you explained to me and i have a partial knowledge of history  the next day dick met an old friend ben birket dick had kept his promise and had written to him as soon as he returned to tripataly with his father and a few weeks after captain hollands return his old shipmate came to see him and his wife ben had for some time thought of retiring and he now left the sea and settled down in a little cottage near captain holland insisted upon settling a small pension upon him and he was always a welcome guest at the house his delight at dicks return was extreme  i never thought you would do it master dick never for a moment and when on coming home i got your letter and found that the captain and your mother were in england it just knocked me foolish for a bit  three weeks later dick told annie that he loved her he spoke without any circumlocution merely taking her hand one evening when they happened to be alone together and telling her so in plain words  i know nothing of women annie he said or their ways i have been bothering myself how to set about it but though i dont know how to put it i do know that i love you dearly all these years i have been thinking about younot like this you know but as the dear plucky little girl of the old days  the little girl of old days dick she said quietly is in no way changed i think you know what i thought of you then i have never for a moment wavered i gave you all the love of my heart and you have had it ever since  why you silly boy she said with a laugh a few minutes later i had begun to think that just as i had to ask you for a kiss in the old times and again when you met me i should have to take this matter in hand why i never thought of anything else directly i got old enough to look upon myself as a woman and young men began to come to the house i said to my dear father  it is of no use their coming here father my mind has been made up for years and i shall never change  he knew at once what i meant  i dont blame you my dear he said of course you are young at present but he has won you fairly and if he is at all like what you make him out to be i could not leave you in better hands he will be home in another three or four years and i shall have the comfort of having you with me until then but you must not make too sure of it he may fall in love out there you know that there is plenty of society at madras  i laughed at the idea  all the pretty ones either come out to be married or get engaged on the voyage or before they have been there a fortnight i have no fear father of his falling in love out there though i dont say he might not when he gets home for of course he thinks of me only as a little girl  well my dear he said we will get him and his father and mother to come down as soon as he gets home as you have made up your mind about it it is only right that you should have the first chance  it was not to be as he planned dick but you see i have had the first chance and it is well it was so for no one can say how matters would have turned out if i had not been on the spot do you know dick i felt that when you rescued me from slavery you became somehow straightway my lord and master as you carried me that night before you i said to myself i should always be your little slave and you see it has come quite true  i dont know about that annie we are in england now and there are no slaves you will be the mistress now and i your devoted servant  it will be as i say dick she said tenderly i feel that to the end of my life i shall remain your willing slave  there was nothing to prevent an early marriage it was settled that captain and mrs holland should retain the house which indeed they could well afford to do and that dick and annie should reside there whenever they were in town but that as a rule they would live at the estate her father had purchased near plymouth their means were ample for during the eight years he was in the service dicks 12000 pounds had as his father had predicted doubled itself and annies fortune was at least as large as his own  dick had good reason to bless to the end of his life his mothers plan that had resulted in the double satisfaction of restoring his father to her and in winning for himself the woman whom he ever regarded as the dearest and best wife in the world
