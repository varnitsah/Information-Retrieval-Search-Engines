69716185	a duet with an occasional chorus     to mrs maude crosse    dear maudeall the little twooared boats which put out into the great ocean have need of some chart which will show them how to lay their course  each starts full of happiness and confidence and yet we know how many founder for it is no easy voyage and there are rocks and sandbanks upon the way  so i give a few pages of your own private log which tell of days of peace and days of stormsuch storms as seem very petty from the deck of a high ship but are serious for the twooared boats  if your peace should help another to peace or your storm console another who is stormtossed then i know that you will feel repaid for this intrusion upon your privacy may all your voyage be like the outset and when at last the oars fall from your hands and those of frank may other loving ones be ready to take their turn of toiland so bon voyage  ever your friend the author jan 20 1899     chapter ithe overtureabout that date    these are the beginnings of some of the letters which they wrote about that time  woking may 20th  my dearest maudeyou know that your mother suggested and we agreed that we should be married about the beginning of september dont you think that we might say the 3rd of august  it is a wednesday and in every sense suitable  do try to change the date for it would in many ways be preferable to the other  i shall be eager to hear from you about it  and now dearest maude    the rest is irrelevant  st albans may 22nd  my dearest frankmother sees no objection to the 3rd of august and i am ready to do anything which will please you and her  of course there are the guests to be considered and the dressmakers and other arrangements but i have no doubt that we shall be able to change the date all right  o frank    what follows is beside the point  woking may 25th  my dearest maudei have been thinking over that change of date and i see one objection which had not occurred to me when i suggested it august the 1st is bank holiday and travelling is not very pleasant about that time  my idea now is that we should bring it off before that date  fancy for example how unpleasant it would be for your uncle joseph if he had to travel all the way from edinburgh with a bankholiday crowd  it would be selfish of us if we did not fit in our plans so as to save our relatives from inconvenience  i think therefore taking everything into consideration that the 20th of july a wednesday would be the very best day that we could select i do hope that you will strain every nerve my darling to get your mother to consent to this change  when i think    a digression follows  st albans may 27th  my dearest franki think that what you say about the date is very reasonable and it is so sweet and unselfish of you to think about uncle joseph  of course it would be very unpleasant for him to have to travel at such a time and we must strain every nerve to prevent it  there is only one serious objection which my mother can see uncle percival that is my mothers second brother comes back from rangoon about the end of july and will miss the wedding o frank think of its being our wedding unless we delay it  he has always been very fond of me and he might be hurt if we were married so immediately before his arrival  dont you think it would be as well to wait  mother leaves it all in your hands and we shall do exactly as you advise  o frank    the rest is confidential  woking may 29th  my own dearesti think that it would be unreasonable upon the part of your uncle percival to think that we ought to have changed the date of a matter so important to ourselves simply in order that he should be present  i am sure that on second thoughts your mother and yourself will see the thing in this light  i must say however that in one point i think you both show great judgment  it would certainly be invidious to be married immediately before his arrival i really think that he would have some cause for complaint if we did that  to prevent any chance of hurting his feelings i think that it would be far best if your mother and you agree with me that we should be married upon july 7th  i see that it is a thursday and in every way suitable  when i read your last letter    the remainder is unimportant  st albans june 1st  dearest franki am sure that you are right in thinking that it would be as well not to have the ceremony too near the date of uncle percivals arrival in england  we should be so sorry to hurt his feelings in any way  mother has been down to madame mortimers about the dresses and she thinks that everything could be hurried up so as to be ready by july 7th  she is so obliging and her skirts do hang so beautifully  o frank it is only a few weeks time and then     woking june 3rd  my own darling maudehow good you areand your mother alsoin falling in with my suggestions  please please dont bother your dear self about dresses  you only want the one travellingdress to be married in and the rest we can pick up as we go  i am sure that white dress with the black stripethe one you were playing tennis with at the arlingtonswould do splendidly  you looked simply splendid that day  i am inclined to think that it is my favourite of all your dresses with the exception of the dark one with the light green front  that shows off your figure so splendidly  i am very fond also of the grey quakerlike alpaca dress  what a little dove you do look in it  i think those dresses and of course your satin eveningdress are my favourites  on second thoughts they are the only dresses i have ever seen you in  but i like the grey best because you wore it the first time i everyou remember  you must never get rid of those dresses  they are too full of associations i want to see you in them for years and years and years  what i wanted to say was that you have so many charming dresses that we may consider ourselves independent of madame mortimer  if her things should be late they will come in very usefully afterwards  i dont want to be selfish or inconsiderate my own dearest girlie but it would be rather too much if we allowed my tailor or your dressmaker to be obstacles to our union  i just want youyour dainty little selfif you had only your wee coatie as burns says now look here  i want you to bring your influence to bear upon your mother and so make a small change in our plans  the earlier we can have our honeymoon the more pleasant the hotels will be  i do want your first experiences with me to be without a shadow of discomfort in july half the world starts for its holiday  if we could get away at the end of this mouth we should just be ahead of them  this month this very month  oh do try to manage this my own dearest girl  the 30th of june is a tuesday and in every way suitable they could spare me from the office most excellently  this would just give us time to have the banns three times beginning with next sunday  i leave it in your hands dear  do try to work it   st albans june 4th  my dearest frankwe nearly called in the doctor after your dear old preposterous letter  my mother gasped upon the sofa while i read her some extracts  that i the daughter of the house should be married in my old black and white tennisdress which i wore at the arlingtons to save my nice one  oh you are simply splendid sometimes  and the learned way in which you alluded to my alpaca as a matter of fact its a merino but that doesnt matter  fancy your remembering my wardrobe like that  and wanting me to wear them all for years  so i shall dear secretly when we are quite quite alone  but they are all out of date already and if in a year or so you saw your poor dowdy wife with tight sleeves among a roomful of puffshouldered young ladies you would not be consoled even by the memory that it was in that dress that you first    you know  as a matter of fact i must have my dress to be married in  i dont think mother would regard it as a legal marriage if i hadnt and if you knew how nice it will be you would not have the heart to interfere with it  try to picture it silvergreyi know how fond you are of greysa little white chiffon at neck and wrists and the prettiest pearl trimming  then the hat en suite palegrey lisse white feather and brilliant buckle  all these details are wasted upon you sir but you will like it when you see it  it fulfils your ideal of tasteful simplicity which men always imagine to be an economical method of dressing until they have wives and milliners bills of their own  and now i have kept the biggest news to the last  mother has been to madame and she says that if she works all night she will have everything ready for the 30th  o frank does it not seem incredible next tuesday three weeks  and the banns  oh my goodness i am frightened when i think about it  dear old boy you wont tire of me will you  whatever should i do if i thought you had tired of me and the worst of it is that you dont know me a bit  i have a hundred thousand faults and you arc blinded by your love and cannot see them  but then some day the scales will fall from your eyes and you will perceive the whole hundred thousand at once  oh what a reaction there will be  you will see me as i am frivolous wilful idle petulant and altogether horrid  but i do love you frank with all my heart and soul and mind and strength and youll count that on the other side wont you  now i am so glad i have said all this because it is best that you should know what you should expect it will be nice for you to look back and to say she gave me fair warning and she is no worse than she said  o frank think of the 30th  psi forgot to say that i had a grey silk cape lined with cream to go with the dress  it is just sweet  so that is how they arranged about the date    chapter iithe overture continuedin a minor key    woking june 7th  my own dearest maudehow i wish you were here for i have been down down down in the deepest state of despondency all day  i have longed to hear the sound of your voice or to feel the touch of your hand  how can i be despondent when in three weeks i shall be the husband of the dearest girl in england  that is what i ask myself and then the answer comes that it is just exactly on that account that my wretched conscience is gnawing at me  i feel that i have not used you well i owe you reparation and i dont know what to do  in your last dear letter you talk about being frivolous  you have never been frivolous  but i have been frivolousfor ever since i have learned to love you i have been so wrapped up in my love with my happiness gilding everything about me that i have never really faced the prosaic facts of life or discussed with you what our marriage will really necessitate  and now at this eleventh hour i realise that i have led you on in ignorance to an act which will perhaps take a great deal of the sunshine out of your life  what have i to offer you in exchange for the sacrifice which you will make for me  myself my love and all that i havebut how little it all amounts to  you are a girl in a thousand in ten thousandbright beautiful sweet the dearest lady in all the land  and i an average manor perhaps hardly thatwith little to boast of in the past and vague ambitions for the future  it is a poor bargain for you a most miserable bargain  you have still time  count the cost and if it be too great then draw back even now without fear of one word or inmost thought of reproach from me  your whole life is at stake how can i hold you to a decision which was taken before you realised what it meant  now i shall place the facts before you and then come what may my conscience will be at rest and i shall be sure that you are acting with your eyes open  you have to compare your life as it is and as it will be  your father is rich or at least comfortably off and you have been accustomed all your life to have whatever you desired  from what i know of your mothers kindness i should imagine that no wish of yours has ever remained ungratified  you have lived well dressed well a sweet home a lovely garden your collie your canary your maid  above all you have never had anxiety never had to worry about the morrow  i can see all your past life so well  in the mornings your music your singing your gardening your reading  in the afternoons your social duties the visit and the visitor  in the evening tennis a walk music again your fathers return from the city the happy familycircle with occasionally the dinner the dance and the theatre  and so smoothly on month after month and year after year your own sweet kindly joyous nature and your bright face making every one round you happy and so reacting upon your own happiness  why should you bother about money  that was your fathers business  why should you trouble about housekeeping that was your mothers duty  you lived like the birds and the flowers and had no need to take heed for the future  everything which life could offer was yours  and now you must turn to what is in store for you if you are still content to face the future with me  position i have none to offer what is the exact position of the wife of the assistantaccountant of the cooperative insurance office  it is indefinable  what are my prospects  i may become headaccountant  if dinton diedand i hope he wont for he is an excellent fellowi should probably get his berth  beyond that i have no career  i have some aspirations after literaturea few critical articles in the monthliesbut i dont suppose they will ever lead to anything of consequence  and my income 400 pounds a year with a commission on business i introduce  but that amounts to hardly anything  you have 50 pounds our total then is certainly under 500 pounds  have you considered what it will mean to leave that charming house at st albansthe breakfastroom the billiardroom the lawnand to live in the little 50 pounds a year house at woking with its two sittingrooms and pokey garden  have i a right to ask you to do such a thing  and then the housekeeping the planning the arranging the curtailing the keeping up appearances upon a limited income  i have made myself miserable because i feel that you are marrying me without a suspicion of the long weary uphill struggle which lies before you  o maude my darling maude i feel that you sacrifice too much for me if i were a man i should say to you forget meforget it all  let our relations be a closed chapter in your life  you can do better i and my cares come like a great cloudbank to keep the sunshine from your young life  you who are so tender and dainty  how can i bear to see you exposed to the drudgery and sordid everlasting cares of such a household  i think of your graces your pretty little ways the elegancies of your life and how charmingly you carry them off you are born and bred for just such an atmosphere as the one which you breathe  and i take advantage of my goodfortune in winning your love to drag you down to take the beauty and charm from your life to fill it with small and vulgar cares neverending and soul killing  selfish beast that i am why should i allow you to come down into the stress and worry of life when i found you so high above it  and what can i offer you in exchange  these are the thoughts which come back and back all day and leave me in the blackest fit of despondency  i confessed to you that i had dark humours but never one so hopeless as this  i do not wish my worst enemy to be as unhappy as i have been today  write to me my own darling maude and tell me all you think your very inmost soul in this matter  am i right  have i asked too much of you  does the change frighten you  you will have this in the morning and i should have my answer by the evening post  i shall meet the postman  how hard i shall try not to snatch the letter from him or to give myself away  wilson has been in worrying me with foolish talk while my thoughts were all of our affairs  he worked me up into a perfectly homicidal frame of mind but i hope that i kept on smiling and was not discourteous to him  i wonder which is right to be polite but hypocritical or to be inhospitable but honest  goodbye my own dearest sweetheartall the dearer when i feel that i may lose youever your devoted  frank  st albans june 8th  frank tell me for heavens sake what your letter means  you use words of love and yet you talk of parting  you speak as if our love were a thing which we might change or suppress  o frank you cannot take my love away from me  you dont know what you are to me my heart my life my all  i would give my life for you willingly gladlyevery beat of my heart is for you  you dont know what you have become to me  my every thought is yours and has been ever since that night at the arlingtons  my love is so deep and strong it rules my whole life my every action from morning to night  it is the very breath and heart of my lifeunchangeable  i could not alter my love any more than i could stop my heart from beating  how could you could you suggest such a thing  i know that you really love me just as much as i love you or i should not open my heart like this  i should be too proud to give myself away  but i feel that pride is out of place when any mistake or misunderstanding may mean lifelong misery to both of us  i would only say goodbye if i thought your love had changed or grown less  but i know that it has not  o my darling if you only knew what terrible agony the very thought of parting is you would never have let such an idea even for an instant on any pretext enter your mind  the very possibility is too awful to think of  when i read your letter just now up in my room i nearly fainted  i cant write  o frank dont take my love away from me  i cant bear it  oh no it is my everything  if i could only see you now i know that you would kiss these heart burning tears away  i feel so lonely and tired  i cannot follow all your letter  i only know that you talked of parting and that i am weary and miserable  maude  copy of telegram from frank crosse to miss maude selby the laurels st albans coming up eightfifteen arrive midnight  june 10th  how good of you dear old boy to come racing across two counties at a minutes notice simply in order to console me and clear away my misunderstandings  of course it was most ridiculous of me to take your letter so much to heart but when i read any suggestion about our parting it upset me so dreadfully that i was really incapable of reasoning about anything else  just that one word part seemed to be written in letters of fire right across the page to the exclusion of everything else  so then i wrote an absurd letter to my boy and the dear came scampering right across the south of england and arrived at midnight in the most demoralised state  it was just sweet of you to come dear and i shall never forget it  i am so sorry that i have been so foolish but you must confess sir that you have been just a little bit foolish also  the idea of supposing that when i love a man my love can be affected by the size of his house or the amount of his income  it makes me smile to think of it  do you suppose a womans happiness is affected by whether she has a breakfastroom or a billiardboard or a collie dog or any of the other luxuries which you enumerated  but these things are all the merest trimmings of life  they are not the essentials  you and your love are the essentials  some one who will love me with all his heart  some one whom i can love with all my heart  oh the difference it makes in life  how it changes everything  it glorifies and beautifies everything  i always felt that i was capable of a great loveand now i have it  fancy your imagining that you had come into my life in order to darken it  why you are my life  if you went out of it what would be left  you talk about my happiness before i met youbut oh how empty it all was  i read and played and sang as you say but what a void there was  i did it to please mother but there really seemed no very clear reason why i should continue to do it  then you came and everything was changed  i read because you are fond of reading and because i wanted to talk about books with you  i played because you are fond of music  i sang in the hope that it might please you whatever i did you were always in my mind  i tried and tried to become a better and nobler woman because i wanted to be worthy of the love you bore me  i have changed and developed and improved more in the last three months than in all my life before  and then you come and tell me that you have darkened my life  you know better now  my life has become full and rich for love fills my life  it is the keynote of my nature the foundation the motive power  it inspires me to make the most of any gift or talent that i have  how could i tell you all this if i did not know that your own feeling was as deep  i could not have given the one great and only love of my life in exchange for a halfhearted affection from you  but you will never again make the mistake of supposing that any material consideration can affect our love  and now we wont be serious any longer  dear mother was very much astounded by your tumultuous midnight arrival and equally precipitate departure next morning  dear old boy it was so nice of you  but you wont ever have horrid black humours and think miserable things any more will you  but if you must have dark days now is your time for i cant possibly permit any after the 30th ever your own  maude  woking june 11th  my own dearest girliehow perfectly sweet you are  i read and re read your letter and i understand more and more how infinitely your nature is above mine  and your conception of lovehow lofty and unselfish it is  how could i lower it by thinking that any worldly thing could be weighed for an instant against it  and yet it was just my jealous love for you and my keenness that you should never be the worse through me which led me to write in that way so i will not blame myself too much  i am really glad that the cloud came for the sunshine is so much brighter afterwards  and i seem to know you so much better and to see so much more deeply into your nature  i knew that my own passion for you was the very essence of my souloh how hard it is to put the extreme of emotion into the terms of human speechbut i did not dare to hope that your feelings were as deep i hardly ventured to tell even you how i really felt  somehow in these days of lawntennis and afternoon tea a strong strong passion such a passion as one reads of in books and poems seems out of place  i thought that it would surprise even frighten you perhaps if i were to tell you all that i felt  and now you have written me two letters which contain all that i should have said if i had spoken from my heart  it is all my own inmost thought and there is not a feeling that i do not share  o maude i may write lightly and speak lightly perhaps sometimes but there never was a woman never never in all the story of the world who was loved more passionately than you are loved by me  come what may while the world lasts and the breath of life is between my lips you are the one woman to me  if we are together i care nothing for what the future may bring  if we are not together all the world cannot fill the void  you say that i have given an impulse to your life  that you read more study more take a keener interest in everything  you could not possibly have said a thing which could have given me more pleasure than that  it is splendid  it justifies me in aspiring to you  it satisfies my conscience over everything which i have done it must be right if that is the effect  i have felt so happy and lighthearted ever since you said it  it is rather absurd to think that i should improve you but if you in your sweet frankness say that it is so why i can only marvel and rejoice  but you must not study and work too hard  you say that you do it to please me but that would not please me  ill tell you an anecdote as a dreadful example  i had a friend who was a great lover of eastern literature sanskrit and so on  he loved a lady  the lady to please him worked hard at these subjects also  in a month she had shattered her nervous system and will perhaps never be the same again  it was impossible  she was not meant for it and yet she made herself a martyr over it  i dont mean by this parable that it will be a strain upon your intellect to keep up with mine  but i do mean that a womans mind is different from a mans  a dainty rapier is a finer thing than a hatchet but it is not adapted for cutting down trees all the same  rupton hale the architect one of the few friends i have down here has some most deplorable views about women  i played a round of the byfleet golf links with him upon wednesday afternoon and we discussed the question of womens intellects  he would have it that they have never a light of their own but are always the reflectors of some other light which you cannot see  he would allow that they were extraordinarily quick in assimilating another persons views but that was all  i quoted some very shrewd remarks which a lady had made to me at dinner  those are the traces of the last man said he  according to his preposterous theory you could in conversation with a woman reconstruct the last man who had made an impression to her  she will reflect you upon the next person she talks to said he  it was ungallant but it was ingenious  dearest sweetheart before i stop let me tell you that if i have brought any happiness into your life you have brought far far more into mine  my soul seemed to come into full being upon the day when i loved you  it was so small and cramped and selfish beforeand life was so hard and stupid and purposeless  to live to sleep to eat for some years and then to dieit was so trivial and so material  but now the narrow walls seem in an instant to have fallen and a boundless horizon stretches around me  and everything appears beautiful  london bridge king william street abchurch lane the narrow stair the office with the almanacs and the shining desks it has all become glorified tinged with a golden haze  i am stronger  i step out briskly and breathe more deeply  and i am a better man too  god knows there was room for it  but i do try to make an ideal and to live up to it  i feel such a fraud when i think of being put upon a pedestal by you when some little hole where i am out of sight is my true place  i am like the man in browning who mourned over the spots upon his speckled hide but rejoiced in the swansdown of his lady  and so my own dear sweet little swansdown lady goodnight to you with my hearts love now and for ever from your true lover  frank  saturday  saturday  saturday oh how i am longing for saturday when i shall see you again  we will go on sunday and hear the banns together    chapter iiithe overture concluded    st albans june 14th  dearest frankwhat a dreadful thing it is to have your name shouted out in public  and what a voice the man had  he simply bellowed maude selby of this parish as if he meant all this parish to know about it  and then he let you off so easily  i suppose he thought that there was no local interest in frank crosse of woking  but when he looked round expectantly after asking whether there was any known cause or just impediment why we should not be joined together it gave me quite a thrill  i felt as if some one would jump up like a jackinthebox and make a scene in the church  how relieved i was when he changed the subject  i sank my face in my hands but i know that i was blushing all down my neck  then i looked at you between my fingers and there you were sitting quite cool and cheerful as if you rather liked it  i think that we shall go to eveningservice next week  papa has given up going altogether since the new organist came  he says he cannot face the music  what a sweet time we had together  i shall never never forget it o frank how good you are to me  and how i hope you wont regret what you are doing  it is all very well just now when i am young and you think that i am pretty  i love that you should think so but i am compelled to tell you that it is not really so  i cant imagine how you came to think it  i suppose it was from seeing me so often beside papa  if you saw me near nelly sheridan or any other really pretty girl you would at once see the difference  it just happens that you like grey eyes and brown hair and the other things but that does not mean that i am really pretty  i should be so sorry if there were any misunderstanding about this and you only found out when too late  you ought to keep this letter for reference as papa always says and then it will be interesting to you afterwards  i should like you to see me nowor rather i wouldnt have you see me for the world  i am so flushed and untidy for i have been cooking is it not absurd if you come to think of it that we girls should be taught the irregular french verbs and the geography of china and never to cook the simplest thing  it really does seem ridiculous  but it is never too late to mend so i went into the kitchen this morning and made a tart  you cant imagine what a lot of things one needs even for such a simple thing as that  i thought cook was joking when she put them all down in front of me  it was like a conjurer giving his performance  there was an empty bowl and a bowl full of sliced apples and a big board and a rollingpin and eggs and butter and sugar and cloves and of course flour  we broke eggs and put them into a bowlyou cant think what a mess an egg makes when it misses the bowl  then we stirred them up with flour and butter and things  i stirred until i was perfectly exhausted no wonder a cook has usually a great thick arm  then when it had formed a paste we rolled it out and put the apples in the dish and roofed it in and trimmed the edges and stuck flat leaves made of paste all over it and the dearest little crown in the middle  then we put it into the oven until it was brown  it looked a very nice tart and mamma said that i had made it very solidly  it certainly did feel very heavy for its size  mamma would not taste it because she said that she thought dr tristram would not approve of her doing so but i had a piece and really it was not so bad  mamma said the servants might have it at dinner but the servants said that the poor windowcleaner had a large family and so we gave it to him  it is so sweet to feel that one is of any use to any one  what do you think happened this morning  two weddingpresents arrived  the first was a very nice fish slice and fork in a case it was from dear old mrs jones beyrick on whom we really had no claim whatever  we all think it so kind of her and such a nice fishslice  the other was a beautiful travellingbag from uncle arthur  stamped in gold upon it were the letters mc i said oh what a pity  they have put the wrong initials  that made mamma laugh  i suppose one soon gets used to it  fancy how you would feel if it were the other way about and you changed your name to mine they might call you selby but you would continue to feel crosse  i didnt mean that for a joke but women make jokes without intending it  the other day the curate drove up in his donkeycart and mother said oh what a nice tandem  i think that she meant to say turn out but papa said it was the neatest thing he had heard for a long time so mamma is very pleased but i am sure that she does not know even now why it should be so funny  what stupid letters i write  doesnt it frighten you when you read them and think that is the person with whom i have to spend my life yet you never seem alarmed about it  i think it is so brave of you that reminds me that i never finished what i wanted to say at the beginning of this letter  even supposing that i am pretty and my complexion sometimes is simply awful you must bear in mind how quickly the years slip by and how soon a woman alters  why we shall hardly be married before you will find me full of wrinkles and without a tooth in my head  poor boy how dreadful for you  men seem to change so little and so slowly  besides it does not matter for them for nobody marries a man because he is pretty  but you must marry me frank not for what i look but for what i amfor my inmost inmost self so that if i had no body at all you would love me just the same  that is how i love you but i do prefer you with your body on all the same  i dont know how i love you dear  i only know that i am in a dream when you are near mejust a beautiful dream  i live for those momentsever your own little  maude  pspapa gave us such a fright for he came in just now and said that the windowcleaner and all his family were very ill  this was a joke because the coachman had told him about my tart  wasnt it horrid of him   woking june 17th  my own sweetest maudei do want you to come up to town on saturday morning  then i will see you home to st albans in the evening and we shall have another dear delightful week end  i think of nothing else and i count the hours  now please to manage it and dont let anything stop you  you know that you can always get your way  oh yes you can miss  i know  we shall meet at the bookstall at charing cross railway station at one oclock but if anything should go wrong send me a wire to the club  then we can do some shopping together and have some fun also tell your mother that we shall be back in plenty of time for dinner make another tart and i shall eat it  things are slack at the office just now and i could be spared for a few days  so you have had a fishslice  it is so strange because on that very day i had my first present and it was a fishslice also  we shall have fish at each end when we give a dinner  if we get another fish slice then we shall give a fishdinneror keep one of the slices to give to your friend nelly sheridan when she gets married  they will always come in useful  and i have had two more presents  one is a tantalus spiritstand from my friends in the office  the other is a pair of bronzes from the cricket club  they got it up without my knowing anything about it and i was amazed when a deputation came up to my rooms with them last night  may your innings be long and your partnership unbroken until you each make a hundred not out  that was the inscription upon a card  i have something very grave to tell you  ive been going over my bills and things and i owe ever so much more than i thought  i have always been so careless and never known exactly how i stood  it did not matter when one was a bachelor for one always felt that one could live quite simply for a few months and so set matters straight  but now it is more serious  the bills come to more than a hundred pounds the biggest one is fortytwo pounds to snell and walker the conduit street tailors  however i am ordering my marriagesuit from them and that will keep them quiet  i have enough on hand to pay most of the others  but we must not run short upon our honeymoonwhat an awful idea  perhaps there may be some cheques among our presents  we will hope for the best  but there is a more serious thing upon which i want to consult you you asked me never to have any secrets from you or else i should not bother you about such things  i should have kept it for saturday when we meet but i want you to have time to think about it so that we may come to some decision then  i am surety to a man for an indefinite sum of money  it sounds rather dreadful does it not  but it is not so bad as it sounds for there is no harm done yet  but the question is what we should do in the future about it and the answer is not a very easy one  he is a very pleasant fellow an insurance agent and he got into some trouble about his accounts last year  the office would have dismissed him but as i knew his wife and his family i became surety that he should not go wrong again and so i saved him from losing his situation  his name is farintosh  he is one of those amiable weak good fellows whom you cannot help loving although you never can trust them  of course we could give notice that we should not be responsible any longer but it would be a thunderbolt to this poor family and the man would certainly be ruined  we dont want to begin our own happiness by making any one else unhappy do we  but we shall talk it over and i shall do what you advise  you understand that we are only liable in case he defaults and surely it is very unlikely that he will do so after the lesson that he has already had  i think the house will do splendidly  the lindens is the name and it is on the maybury road not more than a quarter of a mile from the station  if your mother and you could come down on tuesday or wednesday i should get a halfday off and you would be able to inspect it  such a nice little lawn in front and garden behind  a conservatory if you please diningroom and drawingroom  you can never assemble more than four or five guests  on your athome days we shall put up little placards as they do outside the theatres drawingroom full diningroom full room in the conservatory there are two good bedrooms one large maids room and a lumber room  one cook and one housemaid could run it beautifully  rent 50 pounds on a three years leasewith taxes about 62 pounds  i think it was just built for us  rupton hale says that we must be careful not to brush against the walls and that it would be safer to go outside to sneezebut that is only his fun  what a dull stupid letter  i do hope that i shall be in good form on saturday  i am a man of moodsworse luck and they come quite regardless of how i wish to be or even of how i have cause to be  i do hope that i shall make your day bright for youthe last day that we shall have together before the day  there have been times when i have been such bad company to you just when i wished to be at my best  but you are always so sweet and patient and soothing  until saturday then my own darlingever your lover frank  psi open this to tell you that such a gorgeous fishknife with our monograms upon it has just arrived from mrs preston my fathers old friend  i went to the goldsmiths company in regent street yesterday afternoon and i boughtwhat do you think  it looks so beautiful upon its snowwhite cotton wadding  i like them very broad and rather flat  i do hope you will think it all right it fills me with the strangest feelings when i look at it  come what may foul weather or fair sorrow or joy that little strip of gold will still be with uswe shall see it until we can see no more  ppssaturday  saturday  saturday    chapter ivthe two solos    their tryst was at the charing cross bookstall at one oclock and so mr frank crosse was there at quarterpast twelve striding impatiently up and down and stopping dead whenever a woman emerged from the entrance like a pointer dog before a partridge  before he came he had been haunted by the idea that possibly maude might have an impulse to come earlyand what if she were to arrive and not find him there  every second of her company was so dear to him that when driving to meet her he had sometimes changed from one cab to another upon the way because the second seemed to have the faster horse but now that he was on the ground he realised that she was very exact to her word and that she would neither be early nor late  and yet in the illogical fashion of a lover he soon forgot that it was he who was too soon and he chafed and chafed as the minutes passed until at about quarter to one he was striding gloomily about with despondent features and melancholy forebodings imagining a thousand miserable reasons for her inexplicable delay  a good many people stared at him as they passed and we may do so among the number  in person frank crosse was neither tall nor short five feet eight and a half to be exact with the wellknit frame and springy step of a young man who had been an athlete from his boyhood  he was slim but wiry and carried his head with a halfdefiant backward slant which told of pluck and breed  his face was tanned brown in spite of his city hours but his hair and slight moustache were flaxen and his eyes which were his best features were of a delicate blue and could vary in expression from something very tender to something particularly hard  he was an orphan and had inherited nothing from his parents save a dash of the artist from his mother  it was not enough to help him to earn a living but it transformed itself into a keen appreciation and some ambitions in literature and it gave a light and shade to his character which made him rather complex and therefore interesting  his best friends could not deny the shade and yet it was but the shadow thrown by the light  strength virility emotional force power of deep feelingthese are traits which have to be paid for  there was sometimes just a touch of the savage or at least there were indications of the possibility of a touch of the savage in frank crosse  his intense love of the open air and of physical exercise was a sign of it  he left upon women the impression not altogether unwelcome that there were unexplored recesses of his nature to which the most intimate of them had never penetrated  in those dark corners of the spirit either a saint or a sinner might be lurking and there was a pleasurable excitement in peering into them and wondering which it was  no woman ever found him dull  perhaps it would have been better for him if they had for his impulsive nature had never been long content with a chilly friendship  he was as we may see a man with a past but it was a past now that maude selby had come like an angel of light across the shadowed path of his life  in age he was nearly twentyseven  there are one or two things which might be said for him which he would not have said for himself  he was an only child and an orphan but he had adopted his grandparents who had been left penniless through his fathers death and through all his struggles he had managed to keep them happy and comfortable in a little cottage in worcestershire  nor did he ever tell them that he had a struggle fearing lest it should make their position painful and so when their quarterly cheque arrived they took it as a kindly but not remarkable act of duty upon the part of their wealthy grandson in the city with no suspicion as to the difference which their allowance was making to him  nor did he himself look upon his action as a virtuous one but simply as a thing which must obviously be done  in the meantime he had stuck closely to his work had won rapid promotion in the insurance office in which he had started as junior clerk had gained the goodwill of his superiors through his frank unaffected ways and had been asked to play for the second surrey eleven at cricket  so without going the length of saying that he was worthy of maude selby one might perhaps claimif it could be done without endangering that natural modesty which was one of his charmsthat he was as worthy as any other young man who was available  that unfortunate artistic soul of his which had been in the tropics of expectation and was now in the arctic of reaction had just finally settled down to black despair with a grim recognition of the fact that maude had certainly and absolutely given him up when one boomed from the station clock and on the very stroke she hurried on to the platform  how could he have strained his eyes after other women as if a second glance were ever needed when it was really she the perfectly graceful figure the trimness and neatness of it the beautiful womanly poise of the head the quick elastic step he could have sworn to her among ten thousand  his heart gave a bound at the sight of her but he had the english aversion to giving himself away and so he walked quickly forward to meet her with an impassive face but with a look in his eyes which was all that she wanted  how are you  how do you do  he stood for a few moments looking at her in silence  she had on the dress which he loved so much a silvergrey merino skirt and jacket with a blouse of white pongee silk showing in front  some lighter coloured trimming fringed the cloth  she wore a grey toque with a dash of white at the side and a white veil which softened without concealing the dark brown curls and fresh girlish face beneath it her gloves were of grey suede and the two little pointed tan shoes peeping from the edge of her skirt were the only touches of a darker tint in her attire  crosse had the hereditary artists eye and he could only stand and stare and enjoy it  he was filled with admiration with reverence and with wonder that this perfect thing should really proclaim itself to be all his own  whatever had he done or could he do to deserve it  she looked up at him in a roguish sidelong way with the bright mischievous smile which was one of her charms  well sir do you approve  by jove it is splendidbeautiful  so glad  i hoped you would since you are so fond of greys besides it is cooler in this weather  i hope you have not been waiting  oh no thats all right  you looked so solemn when first i saw you  did i  and then you just jumped  did i  im sorry  why  i dont know  i like our feelings to be our very very own and never to show them to any one else at all  i dare say it is absurd but that is my instinct  never mind dear it wasnt such a big jump as all that  where are we going  come here maude into the waitingroom  she followed him into the gloomy smoky dingy room  bare yellow benches framed an empty square of brown linoleum  a labouring man with his wife and a child sat waiting with the stolid patience of the poor in one corner  they were starting on some saturday afternoon excursion and had mistimed their train  maude selby and frank crosse took the other corner  he drew a jewellers box from his pocket and removed the lid  something sparkled among the wadding  o frank  is that really it  do you like it  what a broad one it is  mothers is quite thin  they wear thin in time  it is beautiful  shall i try it on  no dont  there is some superstition about it  but suppose it wont fit  that is quite safe  i measured it with your sapphire ring  i havent half scolded you enough about that sapphire ring  how could you go and give twentytwo guineas for a ringoh yes sir that was the price for i saw a duplicate yesterday in the goldsmiths company  you dear extravagant old boy  i had saved the money  but not for that  for nothing half or quarter as important  but i had the other to the same size so it is sure to fit  maude had pushed up her veil and sat with the little golden circlet in her hand looking down at it while the dim watery london sunlight poured through the window and tagged all her wandering curls with a coppery gleam  it was a face beautiful in itself but more beautiful for its expressionsensitive refined womanly full of innocent archness and girlish mischief but with a depth of expression in the eyes and a tender delicacy about the mouth which spoke of a great spirit with all its capacities for suffering and devotion within the gross admirer of merely physical charms might have passed her over unnoticed  so might the man who is attracted only by outward and obvious signs of character  but to the man who could see to the man whose own soul had enough of spirituality to respond to hers and whose eye could appreciate the subtlety of a beauty which is of the mind as well as of the body there was not in all wide london upon that midsummer day a sweeter girl than maude selby as she sat in her grey merino dress with the london sun tagging her brown curls with that coppery glimmer  she handed back the ring and a graver expression passed over her mobile face  i feel as you said in your letter frank  there is something tragic in it  it will be with me for ever  all the future will arrange itself round that little ring  are you afraid of it  afraid her grey glove rested for an instant upon the back of his hand  i couldnt be afraid of anything if you were with me  it is really extraordinary for by nature i am so easily frightened  but if i were with you in a railway accident or anywhere it would be just the same  you see i become for the time part of you as it were and you are brave enough for two  i dont profess to be so brave as all that said frank  i expect i have as many nerves as my neighbours  maudes grey toque nodded up and down  i know all about that said she  you have such a false idea of me  it makes me happy at the time and miserable afterwards for i feel such a rank impostor  you imagine me to be a hero and a genius and all sorts of things while i know that i am about as ordinary a young fellow as walks the streets of london and no more worthy of you thanwell than any one else is  she laughed with shining eyes  i like to hear you talk like that said she  that is just what is so beautiful about you  it is hopeless to prove that you are not a hero when your disclaimers are themselves taken as a proof of heroism  frank shrugged his shoulders  i only hope youll find me out gradually and not suddenly said he now maude we have all day and all london before us  what shall we do  i want you to choose  i am quite happy whatever we do  i am content to sit here with you until evening  her idea of a happy holiday set them both laughing  come along said he we shall discuss it as we go  the workmans family was still waiting and maude handed the child a shilling as she went out  she was so happy herself that she wanted every one else to be happy also  the people turned to look at her as she passed  with the slight flush upon her cheeks and the light in her eyes she seemed the personification of youth and life and love  one tall old gentleman started as he looked and watched her with a rapt face until she disappeared  some cheek had flushed and some eye had brightened at his words once and sweet old days had for an instant lived again  shall we have a cab  o frank we must learn to be economical  let us walk  i cant and wont be economical today  there now  see what a bad influence i have upon you  most demoralising  but we have not settled yet where we are to go to  what does it matter if we are together  there is a good match at the oval the australians against surrey would you care to see that  yes dear if you would  and there are matinees at all the theatres  you would rather be in the open air  all i want is that you should enjoy yourself  never fear  i shall do that  well then first of all i vote that we go and have some lunch  they started across the station yard and passed the beautiful old stone cross  among the hansoms and the fourwheelers the hurrying travellers and the lounging cabmen there rose that lovely reconstruction of mediaevalism the pious memorial of a great plantagenet king to his beloved wife  six hundred years ago said frank as they paused and looked up that old stone cross was completed with heralds and armoured knights around it to honour her whose memory was honoured by the king  now the corduroyed porters stand where the knights stood and the engines whistle where the heralds trumpeted but the old cross is the same as ever in the same old place  it is a little thing of that sort which makes one realise the unbroken history of our country  maude insisted upon hearing about queen eleanor and frank imparted the little that he knew as they walked out into the crowded strand  she was edward the firsts wife and a splendid woman  it was she you remember who sucked the wound when he was stabbed with a poisoned dagger  she died somewhere in the north and he had the body carried south to bury it in westminster abbey  wherever it rested for a night he built a cross and so you have a line of crosses all down england to show where that sad journey was broken  they had turned down whitehall and passed the big cuirassiers upon their black chargers at the gate of the horse guards  frank pointed to one of the windows of the old banquetinghall  youve seen a memorial of a queen of england said he  that window is the memorial of a king  why so frank  i believe that it was through that window that charles the first passed out to the scaffold when his head was cut off  it was the first time that the people had ever shown that they claimed authority over their king  poor fellow said maude  he was so handsome and such a good husband and father  it is the good kings who may be the dangerous ones  o frank  if a king thinks only of pleasure then he does not interfere with matters of state  but if he is conscientious he tries to do what he imagines to be his duty and so he causes trouble  look at charles for example  he was a very good man and yet he caused a civil war george the third was a most exemplary character but his stupidity lost us america and nearly lost us ireland  they were each succeeded by thoroughly bad men who did far less harm  they had reached the end of whitehall and the splendid panorama of westminster abbey and the houses of parliament lay before them  the most stately of ancient english buildings was contrasted with the most beautiful of modern ones  how anything so graceful came to be built by this tasteless and utilitarian nation must remain a marvel to the traveller  the sun was shining upon the goldwork of the roof and the grand towers sprang up amid the light london haze like some gorgeous palace in a dream  it was a fit centre for the rule to whose mild sway onefifth of the human race acquiescesa rule upheld by so small a force that only the consent of the governed can sustain it  frank and maude stood together looking up at it  how beautiful it is she cried  how the gilding lights up the whole building  and how absurd it is not to employ it more in our gloomy london architecture said frank  imagine how grand a gilded dome of st pauls would look hanging like a rising sun over the city  but here is our restaurant maude and big ben says that it is a quarter to two    chapter vin britains valhalla    they had discussed the rooms in their new house and the bridesmaids dresses and maudes cooking and marriagepresents and the merits of brighton and the nature of love and volleying at tennis maude was the ladychampion of a tennis club and season tickets and the destiny of the universeto say nothing of a small bottle of perrier jouet  it was reprehensibly extravagant but this would be their last unmarried excursion and so they drank to the dear days of the past and the dearer ones of the future  good comrades as well as lovers they talked freely and with pleasure  frank never made the common mistake of talking down and maude justified his confidence by eagerly keeping up  to both of them silence was preferable to conventional small talk  well just get down there after lunch said frank as he paid his bill  you have not seen the australians have you  yes dear i saw them at clifton four years ago  but this is a new lot  there are nine of the present team who have never played in england before  they are very good are they not  very good indeed  and the dry summer has helped them  it is the sticky english wickets which put them off  the wickets are very fast over there  giffen is their best allround man but darling and iredale and young hill are good enough for anything  well theno lord what a pity  he had turned towards the window as he rose and saw one of those little surprises by which nature relieves the monotony of life in these islands  the sun had gone a ragged slatecoloured cloud was drifting up from over the river and the rain was falling with a soft persistency which is more fatal than the most boisterous shower there would be no more cricket that day  two coffees and two benedictines cried frank and they relapsed into their chairs  but a halfhour passed and the grey cloud was thicker and the rain more heavy  the cheerless leaden river flowed slowly under drifting skies  beyond an expanse of shining pavement the great black abbey towered amidst the storm  have you ever done the abbey maude  no frank i should love to  i have only been oncemore shame to me to say so  is it not a sin that we young englishmen should be familiar with every musichall in london and should know so little of this which is the centre of the british race the most august and tremendous monument that ever a nation owned  six hundred years ago the english looked upon it as their holiest and most national shrine and since then our kings and our warriors and our thinkers and our poets have all been laid there until there is such an accumulation that the huge abbey has hardly space for another monument  let us spend an hour inside it  they made for solomons porch since it was the nearest and they had but the one umbrella  under its shelter they brushed themselves dry before they entered  whom does the abbey belong to frank  to you and me  now you are joking  not at all  it belongs in the longrun to the british taxpayer you have heard the story of the scotch visitor who came on board one of our battleships and asked to see the captain  who shall i say said the sentry  one of the proprietors said the scotchman thats our position towards the abbey  let us inspect our property  they were smiling as they entered but the smile faded from their lips as the door closed behind them  in this holy of holies this inner sanctuary of the race there was a sense of serene and dignified solemnity which would have imposed itself upon the most thoughtless  frank and maude stood in mute reverence  the high arches shot up in long rows upon either side of them straight and slim as beautiful trees until they curved off far up near the clerestory and joined their sister curves to form the lightest most delicate tracery of stone  in front of them a great rosewindow of stained glass splendid with rich purples and crimsons shone through a subdued and reverent gloom  here and there in the aisles a few spectators moved among the shadows but all round along the walls two and three deep were ranged the illustrious dead the perishable body within the lasting marble without and the more lasting name beneath  it was very silent in the home of the great deadonly a distant footfall or a subdued murmur here and there  maude knelt down and sank her face in her hands  frank prayed also with that prayer which is a feeling rather than an utterance  then they began to move round the short transept in which they found themselvesa part of the abbey reserved for the great statesmen frank tried to quote the passage in which macaulay talks about the men worn out by the stress and struggle of the neighbouring parliamenthall and coming hither for peace and rest  here were the men who had been strong enough to grasp the helm and who sometimes wisely sometimes foolishly but always honestly had tried to keep the old ship before the wind  canning and peel were there with pitt fox grattan and beaconsfield  governments and oppositions moulder behind the walls  beaconsfield alone among all the statues showed the hardlined face of the selfmade man  these others look so plump and smooth one can hardly realise how strong they were but they sprang from those ruling castes to whom strength came by easy inheritance  frank told maude the little which he knew of each of themof grattan the noblest irishman of them all of castlereagh whose coffin was pursued to the gates of the abbey by a raging mob who wished to tear out his corpse of fox the libertine philosopher of palmerston the gallant sportsman who rode long after he could walk  they marvelled together at the realism of the sculptor who had pitted admiral warren with the smallpox and at the absurdity of that other one who had clad robert peel in a roman toga  then turning to the right at the end of the statesmens transept they wandered aimlessly down the huge nave  it was overwhelming the grandeur of the roof above and of the contents below  any one of hundreds of these tombs was worth a devout pilgrimage but how could one raise his soul to the appreciation of them all  here was darwin who revolutionised zoology and here was isaac newton who gave a new direction to astronomy  here were old ben jonson and stephenson the father of railways and livingstone of africa and wordsworth and kingsley and arnold  here were the soldiers of the mutinyclyde and outram and lawrenceand painters and authors and surgeons and all the good sons who in their several degrees had done loyal service to the old mother  and when their service was done the old mother had stretched out that long arm of hers and had brought them home and always for every good son brought home she had sent another forth and her loins were ever fruitful and her children loving and true  go into the abbey and think and as the nations past is borne in upon you you will have no fear for its future  frank was delighted with some of the monuments and horrified by others and he communicated both his joy and his anger to maude they noticed together how the moderns and the elizabethans had much in common in their types of face their way of wearing the hair and their taste in monuments while between them lie the intolerable affectationswhich culminated towards the end of last century  it all rings falsestatue inscription everything said frank these insufferable allegorical groups sprawling round a dead hero are of the same class as the pompous and turgid prose of doctor johnson  the greatest effects are the simplest effects and so it always was and so it always will be  but that little bit of latin is effective i confess  it was a very much defaced inscription underneath a battered elizabethan effigy whose feet had been knocked off and whose features were blurred into nothing  two words of the inscription had caught franks eye  moestissima uxor  it was his most sad wife who erected it  look at it now  the poor battered monument of a womans love  now maude come with me and we shall visit the famous poets corner  what an assembly it would be if at some supreme day each man might stand forth from the portals of his tomb  tennyson the last and almost the greatest of that illustrious line lay under the white slab upon the floor  maude and frank stood reverently beside it   sunset and evening star and one clear call for me   frank quoted  what lines for a very old man to write  i should put him second only to shakespeare had i the marshalling of them  i have read so little said maude  we will read it all together after next week  but it makes your reading so much more real and intimate when you have stood at the grave of the man who wrote  thats chaucer the big tomb there  he is the father of british poetry  here is browning beside tennyson united in life and in death  he was the more profound thinker but music and form are essential also  what a splendid face cried maude  it is a bust to longfellow the american  they read the inscription  this bust was placed among the memorials of the poets of england by english admirers of an american poet  i am so glad to have seen that  i know his poems so well said maude  i believe he is more read than any poet in england  who is that standing figure  it is dryden  what a clever face and what a modern type  here is walter scott beside the door  how kindly and humorous his expression was  and see how high his head was from the ear to the crown  it was a great brain  there is burns the other famous scot  dont you think there is a resemblance between the faces  and here are dickens and thackeray and macaulay  i wonder whether when macaulay was writing his essays he had a premonition that he would be buried in westminster abbey  he is continually alluding to the abbey and its graves  i always think that we have a vague intuition as to what will occur to us in life  we can guess what is probable  it amounts to more than that  i had an intuition that i should marry you from the first day that i saw you and yet it did not seem probable  but deep down in my soul i knew that i should marry you  i knew that i should marry you frank or else that i should never marry at all  there now  we both had it  well that is really wonderful  they stood among the memorials of all those great people marvelling at the mysteries of their own small lives  a voice at their elbows brought them back to the present  this way if you please for the kings said the voice  they are now starting for the kings  they proved to be a curiously mixed little group of people who were waiting at the entrance through the enclosure for the arrival of the official guide  there were a tall redbearded man with a very scotch accent and a small gentle wife also an american father with his two bright and enthusiastic daughters a pettyofficer of the navy in his uniform two young men whose attention was cruelly distracted from the monuments by the american girls and a dozen other travellers of various sexes and ages  just as maude and frank joined them the guide a young freshfaced fellow came striding up and they passed through the opening into the royal buryingground  this way ladies and gentlemen cried the hurrying guide and they all clattered over the stone pavement  he stopped beside a tomb upon which a lady with a sad worn face was lying  mary queen of scots said he the greatest beauty of her day  this monument was erected by her son james the first  isnt she just perfectly sweet said one of the american girls  well i dont know  i expected more of her than that the other answered  i reckon remarked the father that if any one went through as much as that lady did it would not tend to improve her beauty  now what age might the lady be sir  fortyfour years of age at the time of her execution said the guide  ah weel shes young for her years muttered the scotchman and the party moved on  frank and maude lingered to have a further look at the unfortunate princess the bright french butterfly who wandered from the light and warmth into that grim country a land of blood and of psalms  she was as hard as nails under all her gentle grace said frank she rode eighty miles and hardly drew rein after the battle of langside  she looks as if she were tired poor dear said maude i dont think that she was sorry to be at rest  the guide was narrating the names of the owners of the tombs at the further end of the chapel  queen anne is here and mary the wife of william the third is beside her  and here is william himself  the king was very short and the queen very tall so in the sculptures the king is depicted standing upon a stool so as to bring their heads level  in the vaults beyond there are thirtyeight stuarts  thirtyeight stuarts  princes bishops generals once the salt of the earth the mightiest of men and now lumped carelessly together as thirtyeight stuarts  so death the republican and time the radical can drag down the highest from his throne  they had followed the guide into another small chapel which bore the name of henry vii upon the door  surely they were great builders and great designers in those days  had stone been as pliable as wax it could not have been twisted and curved into more exquisite spirals and curls so light so delicate so beautiful twining and turning along the walls and drooping from the ceiling  never did the hand of man construct anything more elaborately ornate nor the brain of man think out a design more absolutely harmonious and lovely  in the centre with all the pomp of mediaeval heraldry starred and spangled with the tudor badges the two bronze figures of henry and his wife lay side by side upon their tomb  the guide read out the quaint directions in the kings will by which they were to be buried with some respect to their royal dignity but avoiding damnable pomp and outrageous superfluities  there was as frank remarked a fine touch of the hot tudor blood in the adjectives  one could guess where henry the eighth got his masterful temper  yet it was an ascetic and priestlike face which looked upwards from the tomb  they passed the rifled tombs of cromwell blake and iretonthe despicable revenge of the men who did not dare to face them in the fieldand they marked the grave of james the first who erected no monument to himself and so justified in death the reputation for philosophy which he had aimed at in his life  then they inspected the great tomb of villiers duke of buckingham as surprising and as magnificent as his history cast a glance at the covering of plucky little george the second the last english king to lead his own army into battle and so onwards to see the corner of the innocents where rest the slender bones of the poor children murdered in the tower  but now the guide had collected his little flock around him again with the air of one who has something which is not to be missed you will stand upon the step to see the profile said he as he indicated a female figure upon a tomb  it is the great queen elizabeth  it was a profile and a face worth seeingthe face of a queen who was worthy of her shakespeares upon the land and her drakes upon the sea had the spanish king seen her he would have understood that she was not safe to attackthis grim old lady with the eagle nose and the iron lips  you could understand her grip upon her cashbox you could explain her harshness to her lovers you could realise the confidence of her people you could read it all in that wonderful face  shes splendid said frank  shes terrible said maude  did i understand you to say sir asked the american that it was this lady who beheaded the other lady queen of scotland whom we saw way back in the other compartment  yes sir she did  well i guess if there was any beheading to be done this was the lady to see that it was put through with promptness and despatch not a married lady i gather  no sir  and a fortunate thing for somebody  that womans husband would have a mean time of it sir in my opinion  hush poppa said the two daughters and the procession moved on they were entering the inner chapel of all the oldest and the holiest in which amid the ancient plantagenet kings there lies that one old saxon monarch confessor and saint the holy edward round whose honoured body the whole of this great shrine has gradually risen  a singular erection once covered with mosaic work but now bare and gaunt stood in the centre  the body of edward the confessor is in a case up at the top said the guide  this hollow place below was filled with precious relics and the pilgrims used to kneel in these niches which are just large enough to hold a man upon his knees  the mosaic work has been picked out by the pilgrims  what is the date of the shrine asked frank  about 1250 sir  the early kings were all buried as near to it as they could get for it was their belief in those days that the devil might carry off the body and so the nearer they got to the shrine the safer they felt  henry the fifth who won the battle of agincourt is there  those are the actual helmet shield and saddle which he used in the battle upon the crossbeam yonder  that king with the grave face and the beard is edward the third the father of the black prince  the black prince never lived to ascend the throne but he was the father of the unfortunate richard the second who lies herethis cleanshaven king with the sharp features  now ladies and gentlemen if you will turn this way i will show you one of the most remarkable objects in the abbey  the object in question proved to be nothing more singular than a square block of stone placed under an old chair  and yet as the guide continued to speak they felt that he had justified his words  this is the sacred stone of scone upon which the kings of scotland have been crowned from time immemorial  when edward the first overran scotland 600 years ago he had it brought here and since then every monarch of england has also sat upon it when crowned  the present queen asked some one  yes she also  the legend was that it was the stone upon which jacob rested his head when he dreamed but the geologists have proved that it is red sandstone of scotland  then i understand sir that this other throne is the scottish throne said the american gentleman  no sir the scottish throne and the english throne are the same throne  but at the time of william and mary it was necessary to crown her as well as him and so a second throne was needed  but that of course was modern  only a couple of hundred years ago  i wonder they let it in  but i guess they might have taken better care of it  some one has carved his name upon it  a westminster boy bet his schoolfellows that he would sleep among the tombs and to prove that he had done it he carved his name upon the throne  you dont say cried the american  well i guess that boy ended pretty high up  as high as the gallows perhaps said frank and every one tittered but the guide hurried on with a grave face for the dignity of the abbey was in his keeping  this tomb is that of queen eleanor said he  frank twitched maude by the sleeve  eleanor of charing cross said he  see how one little bit of knowledge links on with another  and here is the tomb of her husband edward the first  it was he who brought the stone from scone  at the time of his death the conquest of scotland was nearly done and he gave orders that his burial should be merely temporary until scotland was thoroughly subdued  he is still as you perceive in his temporary tomb  the big scotchman laughed loudly and derisively  all the others looked sadly at him with the pitying gaze which the english use towards the more excitable races when their emotion gets the better of them  a stream from a garden hose could not have damped him more  they opened the grave last century said the guide  inside was an inscription which said here lies the hammer of the scots  he was a fine man six feet two inches from crown to sole  they wandered out of the old shrine where the great plantagenet kings lie like a bodyguard round the saxon saint  abbots lay on one side of them as they passed and dead crusaders with their legs crossed upon the other  and then in an instant they were back in comparatively modern times again  this is the tomb of wolfe who died upon the heights of abraham said the guide  it was due to him and to his soldiers that all america belongs to the englishspeaking races  there is a picture of his highlanders going up to the battle along the winding path which leads from wolfes cove  he died in the moment of victory  it was bewildering the way in which they skipped from age to age the history of england appeared to be not merely continuous but simultaneous as they turned in an instant from the georgian to the elizabethan the one monument as well preserved as the other  they passed the stately de vere his armour all laid out in fragments upon a marble slab as a proof that he died at peace with all men and they saw the terrible statue of the onslaught of death which viewed in the moonlight made a midnight robber drop his booty and fly panicstricken out of the abbey  so awful and yet so fascinating is it that the shuffling feet of the party of sightseers had passed out of hearing before maude and frank could force themselves away from it  in the base of the statue is an iron door which has been thrown open and the sculptors art has succeeded wonderfully in convincing you that it has been thrown open violently  the two leaves of it seem still to quiver with the shock and one could imagine that one heard the harsh clang of the metal  out of the black opening had sprung a dreadful thing something muffled in a windingsheet one bony hand clutching the edge of the pedestal the other upraised to hurl a dart at the woman above him  she a young bride of twenty seven has fallen fainting while her husband with horror in his face is springing forward his hand outstretched to get between his wife and her loathsome assailant  i shall dream of this said maude  she had turned pale as many a woman has before this monument  it is awful  frank walked backwards unable to take his eyes from it  what pluck that sculptor had  it is an effect which must be either ludicrous or great and he has made it great  roubillac is his name said maude reading it from the pedestal  a frenchman or a man of french descent  isnt that characteristic in the whole great abbey the one monument which has impressed us with its genius and imagination is by a foreigner  we havent got it in us  we are too much afraid of letting ourselves go and of giving ourselves away  we are heavyhanded and heavyminded  if we cant produce the monuments we can produce the men who deserve them said maude and frank wrote the aphorism down upon his shirtcuff  we are too severe both in sculpture and architecture said he more fancy and vigour in our sculptors more use of gold and more ornament in our architectsthat is what we want  but i think it is past praying for  it would be better to subdivide the work of the world according to the capacity of the different nations  let italy and france embellish us  we might do something in exchangeorganise the french colonies perhaps or the italian exchequer  that is our legitimate work but we will never do anything at the other  the guide had already reached the end of his round an iron gate corresponding to that by which they had entered and they found him waiting impatiently and swinging his keys  but maudes smile and word of thanks as she passed him brought content into his face once more  a ray of living sunshine is welcome to the man who spends his days among the tombs  they walked down the north transept and out through solomons porch the raincloud had swept over and the summer sun was shining upon the wet streets turning them all to gold  this might have been that fabled london of which young whittington dreamed  in front of them lay the lawns of vivid green with the sunlit raindrops gleaming upon the grass  the air was full of the chirping of the sparrows  across their vision from the end of whitehall to victoria street the black ribbon of traffic whirled and circled one of the great drivingbelts of the huge city  over it all to their right towered those glorious houses of parliament the very sight of which made frank repent his bitter words about english architecture  they stood in the old porch gazing at the scene  it was so wonderful to come back at one stride from the great country of the past to the greater country of the present  here was the very thing which these dead men lived and died to build  its not much past three said frank  what a gloomy place to take you to  good heavens we have one day together and i take you to a cemetery  shall we go to a matinee to counteract it  but maude laid her hand upon his arm  i dont think frank that i was ever more impressed or learned more in so short a time in my life  it was a grand houran hour never to be forgotten  and you must not think that i am ever with you to be amused  i am with you to accompany you in whatever seems to you to be highest and best  now before we leave the dear old abbey promise me that you will always live your own highest and never come down to me  i can very safely promise that i will never come down to you said frank  i may climb all my life and yet there are parts of your soul which will be like snowpeaks in the clouds to me  but you will be now and always my own dear comrade as well as my sweetest wife and now maude what shall it be the theatre or the australians  do you wish to go to either very much  not unless you do  well then i feel as if either would be a profanation  let us walk together down to the embankment and sit on one of the benches there and watch the river flowing in the sunshine and talk and think of all that we have seen    chapter vitwo solos and a duet    the night before the wedding frank crosse and his best man rupton hale dined at the raleigh club with maudes brother jack selby who was a young lieutenant in a hussar regiment  jack was a horsy slangy young sportsman who cared nothing about franks worldly prospects but had given the match his absolute approval from the moment that he realised that his future brother had played for the surrey second  what more can you want said he  you wont exactly be a mrs w g but you will be on the edge of firstclass cricket  and maude who rejoiced in his approval without quite understanding the grounds for it kissed him and called him the best of brothers  the marriage was to be at eleven oclock at st monicas church and the selbys were putting up at the langham  frank stayed at the metropole and so did rupton hale  they were up early their heads and nerves none the better for jack selbys hospitality of the night before  frank could eat no breakfast and he shunned publicity in his weddinggarments so they remained in the upstairs sittingroom  he stood by the window drumming his fingers upon the pane and looking down into northumberland avenue  he had often pictured this day and associated it with sunshine and flowers and every emblem of joy  but nature had not risen to the occasion  a thick vapour half smoke half cloud drifted along the street and a thin persistent rain was falling steadily  it pitpatted upon the windows splashed upon the sills and gurgled in the waterpipes  far down beneath him on the drabcoloured slimy road stood the lines of wet cabs looking like beetles with glistening backs  round black umbrellas hurried along the shining pavements  a horse had fallen at the door of the constitutional club and an oilskinned policeman was helping the cabman to raise it  frank watched it until the harness had been refastened and it had vanished into trafalgar square  then he turned and examined himself in the mirror  his trim black frockcoat and pearl grey trousers set off his alert athletic figure to advantage  his glossy hat too his lavender gloves and darkblue tie were all absolutely irreproachable  and yet he was not satisfied with himself  maude ought to have something better than that  what a fool he had been to take so much wine last night  on this day of all days in their lives she surely had a right to find him at his best  he was restless and his nerves were all quivering he would have given anything for a cigarette but he did not wish to scent himself with tobacco  he had cut himself in shaving and his nose was peeling from a hot day on the cricketfield  what a silly thing to expose his nose to the sun before his wedding  perhaps when maude saw it she wouldwell she could hardly break it off but at least she might be ashamed of him  he worked himself into a fever over that unfortunate nose  you are off colour crosse said his best man  i was just thinking that my nose was  its very kind of you to come and stand by me  thats all right  we shall see it through together  hale was a despondent man though the most loyal of friends and he spoke in a despondent way  his gloomy manner the london drizzle and the nervousness proper to the occasion were all combining to make frank more and more wretched  fortunately jack selby burst like a gleam of sunshine into the room  the sight of his freshcoloured smiling faceor it may have been some reminder of maude which he found in itbrought consolation to the bridegroom  how are you crosse  how do hale  excuse my country manners  the old christmastree in the hall wanted to send for you but i knew your number  youre looking rather green about the gills old chap  i feel a little chippy today  thats the worst of these cheap champagnes  late hours are bad for the young  have a whisky and soda with me  no  hale you must buck him up for theyll all be down on you if you dont bring your man up to time in the pink of condition  we certainly did ourselves up to the top hole last night  couldnt face your breakfast eh  neither could i  a strawberry and a bucket of sodawater  how are they all at the langham asked frank eagerly  oh splendid  at least i havent seen maude  shes been getting into parade order  but mother is full of beans  we had to take her up one link in the curb or there would have been no holding her  franks eyes kept turning to the slowmoving minutehand  it was not ten oclock yet  dont you think that i might go round to the langham and see them  good lord no  clean against regulations  stand by his head hale wo boy steady  it wont do crosse it really wont said hale solemnly  what rot it is  here am i doing nothing and i might be of some use or encouragement to her  lets get a cab  wo laddie wo then boy  keep him in hand hale  get to his head  frank flung himself down into an armchair and muttered about absurd conventions  it cant be helped my boy  it is correct  buck up crosse buck up  well make the thing go with a buzz when we do begin  two of our johnnies are coming regular fizzers and full of blood both of them  well paint the langham a fine bright solferino when the church parade is over  frank sat rather sulkily watching the slow minutehand and listening to the lighthearted chatter of the boylieutenant and the more deliberate answers of his best man  at last he jumped up and seized his hat and gloves  halfpast said he  come on  i cant wait any longer  i must do something  it is time we went to the church  fall in for the church cried jack  wait a bit  i know this game for i was best man myself last month  inspect his kit hale see that hes according to regulations  ring  all right  parsons money  right oh  small change  good  by the right quick march  frank soon recovered his spirits now that he had something to do even that drive through the streaming streets with the rain pattering upon the top of their fourwheeler could not depress him any longer  he rose to the level of jack selby and they chattered gaily together  aint we bringing him up fighting fit cried jack exultingly shows that all the care we have taken of him in the last twentyfour hours has not been wasted  thats the sort i likegame as a pebble you cant buy em you have to breed em  a regular fizzer he is and full of blood  and here we are on the ground  it was a low oldfashioned grey church with a gothic entrance and two niches on either side which spoke of prelutheran days  cheap modern shops which banked it in showed up the quaint dignity of the ancient front  the sidedoor was open and they passed into its dim lit interior with high carved pews and rich old stained glass huge black oak beams curved over their heads and dim inscriptions of mediaeval latin curled and writhed upon the walls  a single step seemed to have taken them from the atmosphere of the nineteenth to that of the fifteenth century  what a ripping old church jack whispered  you cant buy em  but its as festive as an icehouse  theres a friendly native coming down the aisle  hes your man hale if you want the news  the verger was not in the best of tempers  its at a quarter to four said he as hale met him  no no at eleven  quarter to four i tell you  the vicar says so  why its not possible  we have them at all hours  have what  buryins  but this is a marriage  im sure i beg your pardon sir  i thought when i looked at you as you was the party about the childs funeral  good heavens no  it was something in your expression sir but now that i can see the colour of your clothes why of course i know better  theres three marriageswhich was it  crosse and selby are the names  the verger consulted an old crumpled notebook  yes sir i have it here  mr or miss crosse to mr or miss selby eleven oclock sir sharp  the vicars a terrible punctual man and i should advise you to take your places  any hitch asked frank nervously as hale returned  no no  what was he talking about  oh nothing  some little confusion of ideas  shall we go up  yes i think that we had better  their steps clattered and reverberated through the empty church as they passed up the aisle  they stood in an aimless way before the altar rails  frank fidgeted about and made sure that the ring was in his ticketpocket  he also took a fivepound note and placed it where he knew he could lay his hands upon it easily  then he sprang round with a flush upon his cheeks for one of the sidedoors had been flung open with a great bustle and clanging  a stout charwoman entered with a tin pail and a mop  put up the wrong bird that time whispered jack and sniggered at franks change of expression  but almost at the same instant the selbys entered the church at the further end  mr selby with his red face and fluffy sidewhiskers had maude upon his arm  she looked very pale and very sweet with downcast eyes and solemn mouth while behind her walked her younger sister mary and her pretty friend nelly sheridan both in pink dresses with broad pink hats and white curling feathers  the bride was herself in the grey travellingdress with which frank was already familiar by its description in her letter  its gentle tint and her tenderly grave expression made a charming effect  behind them was the mother still young and elegant with something of maudes grace in her figure and carriage  as the party came up the aisle frank was to be restrained no longer  get to his head cried jack to hale in an excited whisper but their man was already hurrying to shake hands with maude  he walked up on her right and they took their position in two little groups the happy couple in the centre at the same moment the clang of the churchclock sounded above them and the vicar shrugging his shoulders to get his white surplice into position came bustling out of the vestry  to him it was all the most usual commonplace and unimportant thing in the world and both frank and maude were filled with amazement at the nonchalant way in which he whipped out a prayerbook and began to rapidly perform the ceremony  it was all so new and solemn and allimportant to them that they had expected something mystic and overpowering in the function and yet here was this brisk little man with an obvious cold in his head tying them up in as businesslike a fashion as a grocer uniting two parcels  after all he had to do it a thousand times a year and so he could not be extravagant in his emotions  the singular service was read out to them the exhortations and the explanations sometimes stately sometimes beautiful sometimes odious  then the little vicar turned upon frankwilt thou have this woman to thy wedded wife to live together after gods ordinance in the holy estate of matrimony  wilt thou love her comfort her honour her in sickness and in health and forsaking all other keep thee only unto her as long as ye both shall live  i will cried frank with conviction  and wilt thou have this man to thy wedded husband to live together after gods ordinance in the holy estate of matrimony  wilt thou obey him and serve him love honour and keep him in sickness and in health and forsaking all other keep thee only unto him so long as ye both shall live  i will said maude from her heart  who giveth this woman to be married to this man  i do  mr john selbyher father you know  and then in turn they repeated the fateful wordsi take thee to have and to hold from this day forward for better for worse for richer for poorer in sickness and in health to love cherish and obey till death us do part according to gods holy ordinance and thereto i give thee my troth  ring  ring said hale  ring you juggins whispered jack selby  frank thrust his hands frantically into all his pockets  the ring was in the last one which he attempted  but the banknote was not to be found  he remembered that he had put it in some safe place where could it have been  was it in his boot or in the lining of his hat  no surely he could not have done anything so infatuated again he took his pockets two at a time while a dreadful pause came in the ceremony  vestryafterwards whispered the clergyman  here you are gasped frank  he had come upon it in a last desperate dive into his watchpocket in which he never by any chance kept anything  of course it was for that very reason that it might be alone and accessible that he had placed it there  ring and note were handed to the vicar who deftly concealed the one and returned the other  then maudes little white hand was outstretched and over the third finger frank slipped the circlet of gold  with this ring i thee wed said frank and with my body i thee worship he paused and made a mental emendation of with my soul also and with all my worldly goods i thee endow  there was a prayer and then the vicar joined the two hands the muscular sunburned one and the dainty white one with the new ring gleaming upon it  those whom god hath joined together let no man put asunder said he  forasmuch as francis crosse and maude selby have consented together in holy wedlock and have witnessed the same before god and this company and thereto have given and pledged their troth either to other and have declared the same by giving and receiving of a ring and by joining of hands i pronounce that they be man and wife together  there now it was done  they were one never more to part until the coffinlid closed over one or the other  they were kneeling together now and the vicar was rapidly repeating some psalms and prayers but franks mind was not with the ritual  he looked slantwise at the graceful girlish figure by his side  her hair hung beautifully over her white neck and the reverent droop of her head was lovely to his eyes  so gentle so humble so good so beautiful and all his his sworn lifecompanion for ever  a gush of tenderness flowed through his heart for her  his love had always been passionate but for the instant it was heroic tremendous in its unselfishness  might he bring her happiness the highest which woman could wish for  god grant that he might do so  but if he were to make her unhappy or to take anything from her beauty and her goodness then he prayed that he might die now at this supreme moment kneeling at her side before the altar rails  so intense was his prayer that he looked up expectantly at the altar as if in the presence of an imminent catastrophe  but every one had risen to their feet and the service was at an end  the vicar led the way and they all followed him into the vestry  there was a general murmur all round them of congratulation and approval  heartiest congratulations crosse said hale  bravo maude you looked ripping cried jack kissing his sister by jove it simply went with a buzz from the word go  you sign it here and here said the vicar and the witnesses here and here  thank you very much  i am sure that i wish you every happiness  i need not detain you by any further formality  and so with a curious dreamlike feeling frank crosse and maude found themselves walking down the aisle he very proud and erect she very gentle and shy while the organ thundered the weddingmarch carriages were waiting  he handed in his wife stepped in after her and they drove off amidst a murmur of sympathy from a little knot of idlers who had gathered in the porch partly from curiosity and partly to escape the rain  maude had often driven alone with frank before but now she felt suddenly constrained and shy  the marriageservice with all its halfunderstood allusions and exhortations had depressed and frightened her  she hardly dared to glance at her husband  but he soon led her out of her graver humour  name please said he  o frank  name if you please  why you know  say it  maude  that all  maude crosseo frank  you blessing  how grand it sounds  o maude what a jolly old world it is  isnt it pretty to see the rain falling  and arent the shining pavements lovely  and isnt everything splendid and am i not the luckiestthe most incredibly lucky of men  dear girlie give me your hand  i can feel it under the glove  now sweetheart you are not frightened are you  not now  you were  yes i was a little  o frank you wont tire of me will you  i should break my heart if you did  tire of you  good heavens  now youll never guess what i was doing while the parson was telling us about what saint paul said to the colossians and all the rest of it  i know perfectly well what you were doing  and you shouldnt have done it  what was i doing then  you were staring at me  oh you saw that did you  i felt it  well i was  but i was praying also  were you frank  when i saw you kneeling there so sweet and pure and good i seemed to realise how you had been given into my keeping for life and i prayed with all my heart that if i should ever injure you in thought or word or deed i might drop dead now before i had time to do it  o frank what a dreadful prayer  but i felt it and i wished it and i could not help it  my own darling there you are just a living angel the gentlest most sensitive and beautiful living creature that walks the earth and please god i shall keep you so and ever higher and higher if such a thing is possible and if ever i say a word or do a deed that seems to lower you then remind me of this moment and send me back to try to live up to our highest ideal again  and i for my part will try to improve myself and to live up to you and to bridge more and more the gap that is between us that i may feel myself not altogether unworthy of our love  and so we shall act and react upon each other ever growing better and wiser and dating what is best and brightest in our minds and souls from the day that we were married and thats my idea of a marriageservice and here endeth the first lesson and the windows are blurred with rain and hang the coachman and its hard lines if a man may not kiss his own wifeyou blessing  a broadbrimmed hat with a curling feather is not a good shape for driving with an ardent young bridegroom in a discreetly rainblurred carriage  frank demonstrated the fact and it took them all the way to the langham to get those pins driven home again  and then after an abnormal meal which was either a very late breakfast or a very early lunch they drove on to victoria station from which they were to start for brighton  jack selby and the two regimental fizzers who had secured immortality for the young couple if the deep and constant drinking of healths could have done it had provided themselves with packages of rice old slippers and other time honoured missiles  on a hint from maude however that she would prefer a quiet departure frank coaxed the three back into the luncheonroom with a perfectly guileless face and then locking the door on the outside handed the key and a halfsovereign to the head waiter with instructions to release the prisoners when the carriage had gonean incident which in itself would cause the judicious observer to think that given the opportunity mister frank crosse had it in him to go pretty far in life  and so quietly and soberly they rolled away upon their first journeythe journey which was the opening of that lifes journey the goal of which no man may see    chapter viikeeping up appearances    it was in the roomy diningroom of the hotel metropole at brighton maude and frank were seated at the favourite small round table near the window where they always lunched  their immediate view was a snowywhite tablecloth with a shining centre dish of foppish little cutlets each with a wisp of ornamental paper and a surrounding bank of mashed potatoes  beyond from the very base of the window as it seemed there stretched the huge expanse of the deep blue sea its soothing mass of colour broken only by a few white leaning sails upon the furthest horizon  along the skyline the white clouds lay in carelessly piled cumuli like snow thrown up from a clearing  it was restful and beautiful that distant view but just at the moment it was the near one which interested them most  though they lose from this moment onwards the sympathy of every sentimental reader the truth must be told that they were thoroughly enjoying their lunch  with the wonderful adaptability of womena hereditary faculty which depends upon the fact that from the beginning of time the sex has been continually employed in making the best of situations which were not of their own choosingmaude carried off her new character easily and gracefully  in her trim blue serge dress and sailor hat with the warm tint of yesterdays sun upon her cheeks she was the very picture of happy and healthy womanhood  frank was also in a blue serge boatingsuit which was appropriate enough for they spent most of their time upon the water as a glance at his hands would tell their conversation was unhappily upon a very much lower plane than when we overheard them last  ive got such an appetite  so have i frank  capital  have another cutlet  thank you dear  potatoes  please  i always thought that people on their honeymoon lived on love  yes isnt it dreadful frank  we must be so material  good old mother nature  cling on to her skirt and you never lose your way  one wants a healthy physical basis for a healthy spiritual emotion  might i trouble you for the pickles  are you happy frank  absolutely and completely  quite quite sure  i never was quite so sure of anything  it makes me so happy to hear you say so  and you  o frank i am just floating upon golden clouds in a dream  but your poor hands  oh how they must pain you  not a bit  it was that heavy oar  i get no practice at rowing  there is no place to row in at woking unless one used the canal  but it was worth a blister or two  by jove wasnt it splendid coming back in the moonlight with that silver lane flickering on the water in front of us  we were so completely alone  we might have been up in the interstellar spaces you and i travelling from sirius to arcturus in one of those profound gulfs of the void which hardy talks about  it was overpowering  i can never forget it  well go again tonight  but the blisters  hang the blisters  and well take some bait with us and try to catch something  what fun  and well drive to rottingdean this afternoon if you feel inclined have this last cutlet dear  no thank you  well it seems a pity to waste it  here goes  by the way maude i must speak very severely to you  i cant if you look at me like that  but really joking apart you must be more careful before the waiters  why dear  well we have carried it off splendidly so far  no one has found us out yet and no one will if we are reasonably careful  the fat waiter is convinced that we are veterans  but last night at dinner you very nearly gave the thing away  did i frank  dont look so sweetly penitent you blessing  the fact is that you make a shocking bad conspirator  now i have a kind of talent for that as i have for every other sort of depravity so it will be pretty safe in my hands  you are as straight as a line by nature and you cant be crooked when you try  but what did i say  oh i am so sorry  i tried to be so careful  well about the curry you know  it was an error of judgment to ask if i took chutnee  and then      something else  about the boots  did i get them in london or woking  oh dear dear  and then      not another  o frank  well the use of the word my  you must give that word up  it should be our  i know i know  it was when i said that the salt water had taken the curl out of the feather in myno in ourwell in the hat  that was all right  but it is our luggage you know and our room and so on  of course it is  how foolish i am  then the waiter knows  o frank what shall we do  not he  he knows nothing  i am sure of it  he is a dull sort of person  i had my eye on him all the time  besides i threw in a few remarks just to set the thing right  that was when you spoke about our travels in the tyrol  yes  o frank how could you  and you said how lonely it was when we were the only visitors at the swiss hotel  that was an inspiration  that finished him  and about the closeness of the atlantic staterooms  i blushed to hear you  but he listened eagerly to it all  i could see it  i wonder if he really believed it  i have noticed that the maids and the waiters seem to look at us with a certain interest  my dear girlie you will find as you go through life that every man will always look at you with a certain interest  maude smiled but was unconvinced  cheese dear  a little butter please  some butter waiter and the stilton  you know the real fact is that we make the mistake of being much too nice to each other in public  veterans dont do that  they take the small courtesies for grantedwhich is all wrong but it shows that they are veterans that is where we give ourselves away  that never occurred to me  if you want to settle that waiter for ever and remove the last lingering doubt from his mind the thing is for you to be rude to me  or you to me frank  sure you wont mind  not a bit  oh hang it i cantnot even for so good an object  well then i cant either  but this is absurd  it is only acting  quite so  it is only fun  then why wont you do it  why wont you  hell be back before we settle it  look here  ive a shilling under my hand  heads or tails and the loser has to be rude  do you agree  very well  your call  heads  its tails  oh goodness  youve got to be rude  now mind you are  here he comes  the waiter had come up the room bearing the pride of the hotel the grand green stilton with the beautiful autumn leaf heart shading away to rich plumcoloured cavities  he placed it on the table with a solemn air  its a beautiful stilton frank remarked  maude tried desperately to be rude  well dear i dont think it is so very beautiful was the best that she could do  it was not much but it had a surprising effect upon the waiter  he turned and hurried away  there now youve shocked him cried frank  where has he gone frank  to complain to the management about your language  no frank  please tell me  oh i wish i hadnt been so rude  here he is again  all right  sit tight said frank  a sort of procession was streaming up the hall  there was their fat waiter in front with a large covered cheesedish  behind him was another with two smaller ones and a third with some yellow powder upon a plate was bringing up the rear  this is gorgonzola main said the waiter with a severe manner and theres camembert and gruyere behind and powdered parmesan as well  im sorry that the stilton dont give satisfaction  maude helped herself to gorgonzola and looked very guilty and uncomfortable  frank began to laugh  i meant you to be rude to me not to the cheese said he when the procession had withdrawn  i did my best frank  i contradicted you  oh it was a shocking display of temper  and i hurt the poor waiters feelings  yes youll have to apologise to his stilton before he will forgive you  and i dont believe he is a bit more convinced that we are veterans than he was before  all right dear leave him to me  those reminiscences of mine must have settled him  if they didnt then i feel it is hopeless  it was as well for his peace of mind that frank could not hear the conversation between the fat waiter and their chambermaid for whom he nourished a plethoric attachment  they had half an hour off in the afternoon and were comparing notes  nicelookin couple aint they john said the maid with the air of an expert  i dont know as weve ad a better since the spring weddins  i dont know as id go as far as that said the fat waiter critically  ed pass all right  es an upstandin young man with a good sperrit in im  whats wrong with er then  its a matter of opinion said the waiter  i likes em a bit more fullflavoured myself  and as to er taste why there if you ad seen er turn up er nose

im tonight at dinner as sure as my names john  and a good lesson to them too  if you didnt say youd eard it from their own lips john i never could ave believed it  its things like that as shakes your trust in uman nature  maude and frank were lingering at the table dhote over their walnuts and a glass of port wine when their waiter came softly behind them  beg pardon sir but did you see it in the times  see what  that sir  i thought that it might be of interest to you and to your good lady to see it  he had laid one page of the paper before them with his forefinger upon an item in the lefthand top corner  then he discreetly withdrew  frank stared at it in horror  maude your people have gone and put it in  our marriage  here it is  listen  crosseselby  30th june at st monicas church by the rev john tudwell ma vicar of st monicas frank crosse of maybury road woking to maude selby eldest daughter of robert selby esq of st albans  great scot maude what shall we do  well dear does it matter

burst out laughing  you old dear she cried i dont believe you are a bit better as a conspirator than i am  theres only one thing you can do  give the waiter half a crown tell him the truth and dont conspire any more  and so ignominiously ended the attempt which so many have made and at which so many have failed  take warning gentle reader and you also gentler reader still when your own turn comes    chapter viiithe homecoming    the days of holiday were over and for each of them the duties of life were waiting  for him it was his work and for her her housekeeping  they both welcomed the change for there was a rush and a want of privacy about the hotel life which had been amusing at first but was now becoming irksome  it was pleasant as they rolled out of waterloo station that summer night to know that their cosy little home was awaiting them just fiveandtwenty miles down the line  they had a firstclass carriage to themselvesit is astonishing how easy it is for two people to fit into one of those armchair partitionsand they talked all the way down about their plans for the future  golden visions of youth how they can glorify even a suburban villa and four hundred a year  they exulted together over the endless vista of happy days which stretched before them  mrs watson franks trusty housekeeper had been left in charge of the lindens and he had sent her a telegram the evening before to tell her that they were coming  she had already engaged the two servants so everything would be ready for them  they pictured her waiting at the door the neat little rooms with all their useful marriagepresents in their proper places the lamplight and the snowy cloth laid for supper in the diningroom  it would be ten oclock before they got there and that supper would be a welcome sight  it was all delightful to look forward to and this last journey was the happiest of all their wanderings  maude wanted to see her kitchen frank wanted to see his books  both were eager for the fight  but they found a small annoyance waiting for them at woking  a crowded train had preceded them and there was not a single cab left at the station  some would be back soon but nobody could tell when  you dont mind walking maude  i should prefer it  so a friendly porter took charge of their trunks and promised to send them up when a conveyance had arrived  in the meantime they started off together down an illlit and illkept road which opened into that more important thoroughfare in which their own villa was situated  they walked quickly full of eager anticipations  its just past the third lamppost on the right said frank  now its only the second lamppost  you see it will not be far from the station  those windows among the trees are where hale livesmy best man you know  now it is only one lamppost  they quickened their pace almost to a run and so arrived at the gate of the lindens  it was a white gate leading into a short pathcarriage sweep the houseagent called itand so to a low but comfortablelooking little house  the night was so dark that one could only see its outline  to their surprise there was no sign of a light either above the door or at any of the windows  well im blessed cried frank  never mind dear  they live at the back no doubt  but i gave them the hour  this is too bad  i am so sorry  it will be all the more cosy inside  what a dear little gate this is  the whole place is perfectly charming  but in spite of her brave attempts at making the best of it it could not be denied that this black house was not what they had pictured in their dreams  frank strode angrily up the path and pulled at the bell  there was no answer so he knocked violently  then he knocked with one hand while he rang with the other but no sound save that of the clanging bell came from the gloomy house  as they stood forlornly in front of their own halldoor a soft rain began to rustle amidst the bushes  at this climax of their troubles maude burst into such a quiet hearty irresistible fit of laughter that the angry frank was forced to laugh also  my word it will be no laughing matter for mrs watson if she cannot give a good reason for it said he  perhaps the poor woman is ill  but there should be two other people the cook and the housemaid it is just as well that we did not bring up our trunks or we should have had to dump them down in the front garden  you wait here dear under the shelter of the porch and i will walk round and see if i can burgle it  he tried the back but it was as dark as the front and the kitchen door was locked  then he prowled unhappily in the rain from window to window  they were all fastened  he came back to the kitchen door poked his stick through the glass which formed the upper panel and then putting his hand through the hole he turned the key and so stumbled into the obscurity of his own hall  he passed through it unlocked the front door and received maude into his open arms  welcome to your home my own darling girl  may you never have one sad hour under this roof  what a dismal homecoming  what can i do to make amends  but good comes out of evil you see for in no other possible way could i have been inside to welcome you when you entered  they stayed in the hall in the dark some time these wet and foolish young people  then frank struck a match and tried to light the halllamp  there was no oil in it  he muttered something vigorous and carried his burning vesta into the diningroom  two candles were standing on the sideboard  he lit them both and things began to look a little more cheerful  they took a candle each and began to explore their own deserted house  the diningroom was excellentsmall but very snug  the tantalus spiritstandstood upon the walnut sideboard and the bronzes from the cricketclub looked splendid upon each side of the mantelpiece beside the clock in the centre lay an open telegram  frank seized it eagerly  there now he cried  listen to this  expect us on thursday evening about ten  it was tuesday evening i said  thats the telegraphic clerk  weve come two days before our time  it was good to have any sort of explanation although it left a great deal unexplained  they passed through the hall with its shining linoleum and into the drawingroom  it was not a very good room too square for elegance but they were in no humour for criticism and it was charming to see all the old knickknacks and the photographs of friends in their frames  a big wroughtiron and brasswork standing lamp towered up near the fireplace but again there was no oil  i think that mrs watson has arranged it all splendidly said maude whose active fingers were already beginning to reconstruct but where can she be  she must be out for of course she lives in the house  but it is the absence of the servants which amazes me for i understood that they had arrived  what would you like to do  arent you hungry frank  simply starving  so am i  well then let us forage and see if we cannot find something to eat  so hand in hand and each with a candle in the other hand like a pair of young penitents they continued their explorations with more purpose than before  the kitchen into which they penetrated had clearly been much used of late for there were dirty dishes scattered about and the fire had been lighted though it was now out  in one corner was what seemed to be a pile of drabcoloured curtains  in the other an armchair lay upon its side with legs projecting  a singular disorder very alien to mrs watsons habits pervaded the apartment  a dresser with a cupboard over it claimed the first attention of the hungry pair  with a cheer from frank and hand clapping from maude they brought out a new loaf of bread some butter some cheese a tin of cocoa and a bowl full of eggs  maude tied an apron over her pretty russet dress seized some sticks and paper and had a fire crackling in a very few minutes  put some water in the kettle frank  here you are  anything else  some in the small saucepan for the eggs  i believe they are cookers said he sniffing at them suspiciously  hold them up to the light sir  there they are quite bright and nice  in with them  now if you will cut some bread and butter it we shall soon have our supper ready  its too new to cut cried frank sawing away upon the kitchen table  besides new bread is better in chunks  here are some cloths and knives and forks in the dresser drawer  i will go and lay the table  and leave me here alone  no please frank if i am cook you must be scullerymaid  get the cups down and put the cocoa in them  what fun it all is  i think it is simply splendid to be mistress of a house  with one scullerymaid  and she perfectly incompetent and much given to embracing her mistress  i must take my hat off  get the sugar for the cocoa out of the cupboard  the kettle is singing so it wont be long  do you know frankshe paused listening with the eggsaucepan in her hands  theres a dog or something in the room  they had both become aware of a sort of sibilant breathing and they looked round them in bewilderment  where is it asked maude  frank i believe its a mouse  hope for the best  dont frighten yourself unnecessarily  i fancy it comes from under these curtains  he approached them with his candle and was suddenly aware of a boot which was projecting from them  great scot he cried theres a woman here asleep  reassured as to the mouse maude approached with her saucepan still clutched in her hand  there could be no doubt either as to the woman or the sleep  she lay in an untidy heap her head under the table and her figure sprawling  she appeared to be a very large woman  hullo cried frank shaking her by the shoulder  hullo you there  but the woman slumbered peacefully on  heh wake up wake up he shouted and pulled her up into a sitting position  but she slept as soundly sitting as lying  the poor thing must be ill said maude  o frank shall i run for a doctor  wake up woman wake up frank yelled and danced her up and down she flopped about like a sawdust doll with her arms swinging in front of her  he panted with his exertions but she was serenely unconscious  at last he had to lower her on to the floor again putting a footstool under her head  its no go said he  i can make nothing of her  she will sleep it off  you dont mean to say frank that she is  indeed i do  how horrible  that kettle is boiling now  suppose we have our supper  dear frank i could not enjoy my supper with that unfortunate woman lying there  o frank i know that you could not either  bless her said frank bitterly as he gazed at the inert lump  i really dont see why we should put ourselves out for her  she is quite comfortable  oh i couldnt frank  it would seem inhuman  what are we to do then  we must put her to bed  great heavens  yes dear it is our duty to put her to bed  but look here my dear girl we must be practical  the woman weighs half a ton and the bedrooms are at the top of the house  its simply impossible  dont you think frank that if you took her head and i took her feet we might get her up  not up the stair dear  she is enormous  well then on to the drawingroom sofa said maude  i could have my supper if i knew that she was safe upon the sofa  so frank seeing that there was no help for it seized her under the arms and maude took her ankles and they bore her bulging but serene down the passage  they staggered exhausted into the drawing room and the new sofa groaned beneath the weight  it was a curious and unsavoury inaugural ceremony  maude put a rug over the prostrate form and they returned to their boiling kettle and their uncooked eggs  then they laid the table and served the supper and enjoyed this picnic meal of their own creating as no conventional meal could ever have been enjoyed  everything seemed beautiful to the young wifethe wallpaper the pictures the carpet the rug but to him she was so beautiful in mind and soul and body that her presence turned the little room into an enchanted chamber  they sat long together and marvelled at their own happinessthat pure serene happiness of mere companionship which is so much more intimate and deeper than all the transports of passion  but suddenly he sprang from his chair  there was the sound of steps of several steps outside upon the gravel path  then a key clicked and a burst of cold air told them that the door was open  its agin the law for me to enter said a gruff voice  i tell you shes very strong and violent said a second voice which frank recognised as that of mrs watson  she chased the maid out of the house and i can do nothing with her  very sorry mum but its clean agin the law of england  give me a warrant and in i come  if you will bring her to the doorstep i will be answerable for her removal  shes in the diningroom  i can see the lights said mrs watson and then good lord mr crosse what a fright you gave me  oh dear me that you should have come when i was out and i not expecting you for another two days yet  well now i shall never forgive myself for this  but all the mistakes and misfortunes were very quickly explained the telegram was the root of the evil  and then the new cook had proved to be a violent intermittent drunkard  she had chased the other maid out of the house and then while mrs watson rushed for the police she had drunk herself into the stupor in which she had been found  but now in the nick of time the station cab came up with the luggage and so the still placidly slumbering culprit was carried out to it and sent off in the charge of the policeman  such was the first entry of mr and mrs crosse into their home at the lindens    chapter ixlaying a course    frank crosse was a methodical young manhis enemies might sometimes have called him pedanticand he loved to reduce his life to rule and order  it was one of his peculiarities  but how about this new life into which he was entering  it took two to draw up the rules for that  the little twooared craft who put out upon that voyage have to lay their own course each for itself and all round them as they go they see the floating timbers and broken keels of other little boats which had once started out full of hope and confidence there are currents and eddies low sandbanks and sunken reefs and happy the crews who see them ahead and trim their course to avoid them  frank brooded over it all  he had seen something of life for his years  he was observant and reflective  he had watched his friends who were happy and he had watched his friends who were not and now as a result of all this wise cogitation he sat down at a table one evening with a solemn face and a sheet of foolscap  now maude said he i want to have a serious talk  maude looked up in surprise from the linen which she was marking  oh dear she cried  why oh dear  theres something wrong  nothing in the world  you looked so solemn frank  i thought you had been looking at the tradesmans books  what is it dear  well maude i have been thinking of married life in general  dont you think it would be a good thing if we were to make some resolutions as to how it should be conductedsome fundamental principles as it were  oh do dear do  what fun it will be  but its serious maude  yes dear i am quite serious  it seemed to me that if we could reduce it to certain rules then whatever came upon us in the future we should always know exactly how to act  what are the rules dear  well we can only arrive at them by talking it over between ourselves  i could not draw up a set of rules and ask you to submit to them  that is not my idea of a partnership  but if we found that we were agreed upon certain points then we could both adopt them by mutual consent  how charming frank  do please tell me some of the points  i have a few in my mind and i should like to hear any which you may haveany ideas you know how to get the very highest and best out of our life  now first of all there is the subject of quarrelling  o frank how horrid  dear girl we must look into the future  we are going to live all our lives together  we must foresee and prepare for all the chances of life  but that is absurd  you cant live all your life and never be in a bad temper  but not with you frank  oh i can be very aggravating sometimes  now my idea is this illhumour passes and hurts nobody  but if two people are ill humoured then each excites the other and they say ever so much more than they mean  let us make a compact never both to be illhumoured at the same time  if you are cross then it is your turn and i stand clear  if i am cross you let me work it off  when either hoists the dangersignal the other is on guard  what do you think of that  i think you are the funniest old boy  do you agree  yes dear of course i agree  article number one said frank and scribbled upon his paper  your turn now  no dear i have not thought of anything  well then here is another point  never take each other for granted  what do you mean by that  never relax those attentions which one lover shows to another  some husbands seem to forget that their wives are ladies  some wives speak to their husbands with less courtesy and consideration than to any casual male visitor  they mean no harm but they get into a slack way  we must not do that  i dont think we are likely to  people get into it unconsciously  pull me up sharply at the first sign  yes sir i will  the next point that i have noted is an extension of the last  let each strive to be worthy of the love of the other  people get slovenly and slipshoddy as if it didnt matter now that they were married  if each were very keen to please the other that would not be so  how many women neglect their music after marriage  my goodness i havent practised for a week cried maude  and their dress and their hairmaudes hand flew up to her curls my darling yours is just perfect  but you know how often a woman grows careless  he will love me anyhow she says to herself and perhaps she is right but still it is not as it should be  why frank i had no idea you knew so much  i have heard my friends experiencesand the man too  he should consider his wifes feelings as much as he did his sweethearts  if she dislikes smoke he should not smoke  he should not yawn in her presence  he should keep himself wellgroomed and attractive  look at that dirty cuff  i have no business to have it  as if it could make any difference to me  there now  that is what is so demoralising  you should stand out for the highest  when i came to you at st albans i had not dirty cuffs  you forgive me the music frank and ill forgive you the cuff  but i agree to all you say  i think it is so wise and good  now ive got something to add  good  what is it  each should take an interest in the others department  why of course they should  but it is not done  why naturally dear you take an interest in my city work  yes sir but do you take as keen an interest in my housekeeping  perhaps i have been a little thoughtless  no no dear you havent  you are always full of consideration but i have noticed it with mother and with others also  the husband pulls out his chequebook at the end of the week or month and he says well this is rather more than we can afford or this is less than i expected but he never really takes any interest in his wifes efforts to keep things nice on a little  he does not see it with her eyes and try to realise her difficulties  oh i wish i could express myself better but i know that the interest is one sided  i think what you say is quite right  ill try to remember that how shall we enter it upon our list  that interests should be mutual  quite right  i have it down  well any more points  it is your turn  well there is this and i feel that it is just the holiest thing in matrimony and its greatest justificationthat love should never degenerate into softness that each should consciously stimulate the better part of the other and discourage the worse that there should be a discipline in our life and that we should brace each other up to a higher ideal  the love that says i know it is wrong but i love him or her so much that i cant refuse is a poor sort of love for the permanent use of married life  the selfrespect which refuses to let the most lofty ideal of love down by an inch is a far nobler thing and it wears better too  how will you express all that  mutual respect is necessary for mutual love  yes i am sure that that is right  it sounds obvious but the very intensity of love makes love soft and blind  now i have another which i am convinced that you will not agree with  let me hear it  i have put it in this way the tight cord is the easiest to snap  what do you mean  well i mean that married couples should give each other a certain latitude and freedom  if they dont one or other will sooner or later chafe at the restriction  it is only human nature which is an older and more venerable thing than marriage  i dont like that at all frank  i feared you wouldnt dear but i believe youll see it with me when i explain what i mean  if you dont then i must try to see it with you  when one talks of freedom in married life it means as a rule freedom only for the man  he does what he likes but still claims to be a strict critic of his wife  that i am sure is wrong to take an obvious example of what i mean has a husband a right to read his wifes letters  certainly not any more than she has a right to read his without his permission  to read them as a matter of course would be stretching the chain too tight  chain is a horrid word frank  well it is only a metaphor  or take the subject of friendships is a married man to be debarred from all friendship and intimacy with another woman  maude looked doubtful  i should like to see the woman first she said  or is a married woman to form no friendship with another man who might interest or improve her  there is such a want of mutual confidence in such a view  people who are sure of each other should give each other every freedom in that  if they dont they are again stretching it tight  if they do it may become so slack that it might as well not be there at all  i felt sure that we should have an argument over this  but i have seen examples  look at the wardrops  there were a couple who were never apart  it was their boast that everything was in common with them  if he was not in she opened his letters and he hers  and then there came a most almighty smash  the tight cord had snapped now i believe that for some people it is a most excellent thing that they should take their holidays at different times  o frank  yes i do  no not for us by jove  i am generalising now  but for some couples i am sure that it is right  they reconsider each other from a distance and they like each other the better  yes but these rules are for our guidance not for that of other people  quite right dear  i was off the rails  as you were as your brother jack would say  but i am afraid that i am not going to convince you over this point  maude looked charmingly mutinous  no frank you are not  i dont think marriage can be too close  i believe that every hope and thought and aspiration should be in common  i could never get as near to your heart and soul as i should wish to do  i want every year to draw me closer and closer until we really are as nearly the same person as it is possible to be upon earth  when you have to surrender it is well to do so gracefully  frank stooped down and kissed his wifes hand and apologised  the wisdom of the heart is greater than the wisdom of the brain said he  but the love of man comes from the brain far more than the love of woman and so it is that there will always be some points upon which they will never quite see alike  then we scratch out that item  no dear  put the cord which is held tight is the easiest to snap  that will be all right  the cord of which i speak is never held at all  the moment it is necessary to hold it it is of no value  it must be voluntary natural unavoidable  so frank amended his aphorism  anything more dear  yes i have thought of one other said she  it is that if ever you had to find fault with me about anything it should be when we are alone  and the same in your case with me  that is excellent  what can be more vulgar and degrading than a public difference of opinion people do it half in fun sometimes but it is wrong all the same duly entered upon the minutes  anything else  only material things  yes but they count also  now in the matter of money i feel that every husband should allow his wife a yearly sum of her own to be paid over to her and kept by her so that she may make her own arrangements for herself  it is degrading to a woman to have to apply to her husband every time she wants a sovereign  on the other hand if the wife has any money she should have the spending of it if she chooses to spend part of it in helping the establishment that is all right but i am sure that she should have her own separate account and her own control of it  if a woman really loves a man frank how can she grudge him everything she has  if my little income would take one worry from your mind what a joy it would be to me to feel that you were using it  yes but the man has his selfrespect to think of  in a great crisis one might fall back upon ones wifesince our interests are the same but only that could justify it  so much for the wifes money  now for the question of housekeeping  that terrible question  it is only hard because people try to do so much upon a little  why should they try to do so much  the best pleasures of life are absolutely inexpensive  books music pleasant intimate evenings the walk among the heather the delightful routine of domestic life my cricket and my golfthese things cost very little  but you must eat and drink frank  and as to jemima and the cook it is really extraordinary the amount which they consume  but the tendency is for meals to become much too elaborate  why that second vegetable  there now  i knew that you were going to say something against that poor vegetable  it costs so little  on an average i have no doubt that it costs threepence a day  come now confess that it does  do you know what threepence a day comes to in a year  there is no use in having an accountant for a husband if you cant get at figures easily  it is four pounds eleven shillings and threepence  it does not seem very much  but for that money and less one could become a member of the london library with the right to take out fifteen books at a time and all the worlds literature to draw from  now just picture it on one side all the books in the world all the words of the wise and great and witty on the other side a lot of cauliflowers and vegetablemarrows and french beans  which is the better bargain  good gracious we shall never have a second vegetable again  and pudding  my dear you always eat the pudding  i know i do  it seems an obvious thing to do when the pudding is there in front of me  but if it were not there i should neither eat it nor miss it and i know that you care nothing about it  there would be another five or six pounds a year  well have a compromise dear  second vegetable one day pudding the next  very good  i notice that it is always after you have had a substantial meal that you discuss economy in food  i wonder if you will feel the same when you come back starving from the city tomorrow  now sir any other economy  i dont think money causes happiness  but debt causes unhappiness and so we must cut down every expense until we have a reserve fund to meet any unexpected call  if you see any way in which i could save or any money i spend which you think is unjustifiable i do wish that you would tell me  i got into careless ways in my bachelor days  that red golfingcoat  i know  it was idiotic of me  never mind dear  you look very nice in it  after all it was only thirty shillings  can you show me any extravagance of mine  well dear i looked at that dressmakers bill yesterday  o frank it is such a pretty dress and you said you liked it and you have to pay for a good cut and you said yourself that a wife must not become dowdy after marriage and it would have cost double as much in regent street  i didnt think the dress dear  what was it then  the silk lining of the skirt  you funny boy  it cost thirty shillings extra  now what can it matter if it is lined with silk or not  oh doesnt it  just you try one and see  but no one can know that it is lined with silk  when i rustle into a room dear every woman in it knows that my skirt is lined with silk  frank felt that he had ventured out of his depth so he struck out for land again  theres only one economy which i dont think is justifiable said he and that is to cut down your subscriptions to charities  it is such a very cheap way of doing things  not that i do much in that linetoo little perhaps  but to say that because we want to economise therefore some poor people are to suffer is a very poor argument  we must save at our own expense  so now frank in his methodical fashion had all his results tabulated upon his sheet of foolscap  it was not a very brilliant production but it might serve as a chart for the little twooared boats until a better one is forthcoming  it ran in this way    maxims for the married  1  since you are married you may as well make the best of it  2  so make some maxims and try to live up to them  3  and dont be discouraged if you fail  you will fail but perhaps you wont always fail  4  never both be cross at the same time  wait your turn  5  never cease to be lovers  if you cease some one else may begin  6  you were gentleman and lady before you were husband and wife dont forget it  7  keep yourself at your best  it is a compliment to your partner  8  keep your ideal high  you may miss it but it is better to miss a high one than to hit a low one  9  a blind love is a foolish love  encourage the best in each others nature  10  permanent mutual respect is necessary for a permanent mutual love  a woman can love without respect but a man cannot  11  the tight cord is the easiest to snap  12  let there be one law for both  13  there is only one thing worse than quarrels in public  that is caresses  14  money is not essential to happiness but happy people usually have enough  15  so save some  16  the easiest way of saving is to do without things  17  if you cant then you had better do without a wife  18  the man who respects his wife does not turn her into a mendicant  give her a purse of her own  19  if you save save at your own expense  20  in all matters of money prepare always for the worst and hope for the best   such was their course as far as this ambitious young couple could lay it  they may correct it by experience and improve it by use but it is good enough to guide them safely out to sea    chapter xconfessions    tell me frank did you ever love any one before me  how badly trimmed the lamp is tonight said he  it was so bad that he went off instantly into the diningroom to get another  it was some time before he returned  she waited inexorably until he had settled down again  did you frank she asked  did i what  ever love any one else  my dear maude what is the use of asking questions like that  you said that there were no secrets between us  no but there are some things better left alone  that is what i should call a secret  of course if you make a point of it  i do  well then i am ready to answer anything that you ask  but you must not blame me if you do not like my answers  who was she frank  which  o frank more than one  i told you that you would not like it  oh i wish i had not asked you  then do let us drop it  no i cant drop it now frank  you have gone too far  you must tell me everything  everything  yes everything frank  i am not sure that i can  is it so dreadful as that  no there is another reason  do tell me frank  there is a good deal of it  you know how a modern poet excused himself to his wife for all his prematrimonial experiences  he said that he was looking for her  well i do like that she cried indignantly  i was looking for you  you seem to have looked a good deal  but i found you at last  i had rather you had found me at first frank  he said something about supper but she was not to be turned  how many did you really love she asked  please dont joke about it frank  i really want to know  if i choose to tell you a lie  but you wont  no i wont  i could never feel the same again  well then how many did you love  dont exaggerate what i say maude or take it to heart  you see it depends upon what you mean by love  there are all sorts and degrees of love some just the whim of a moment and others the passion of a lifetime some are founded on mere physical passion and some on intellectual sympathy and some on spiritual affinity  which do you love me with  all three  sure  perfectly sure  she came over and the crossexamination was interrupted  but in a few minutes she had settled down to it again  well nowthe first said she  oh i cant maudedont  come sirher name  no no maude that is going a little too far  even to you i should never mention another womans name  who was she then  please dont let us go into details  it is perfectly horrible  let me tell things in my own way  she made a little grimace  you are wriggling sir  but i wont be hard upon you  tell it your own way  well in a word maude i was always in love with some one  her face clouded over  your love must be very cheap said she  its almost a necessity of existence for a healthy young man who has imagination and a warm heart  it was allor nearly allquite superficial  i should think all your love was superficial if it can come so easily  dont be cross maude  i had never seen you at the time  i owed no duty to you  you owed a duty to your own selfrespect  there i knew we should have trouble over it  what do you want to ask such questions for  i dare say i am a fool to be so frank  she sat for a little with her face quite cold and set  in his inmost heart frank was glad that she should be jealous and he watched her out of the corner of his eye  well said she at last  must i go on  yes i may as well hear it  youll only be cross  weve gone too far to stop  and im not cross frank  only pained a little  but i do appreciate your frankness  i had no idea you were such asuch a mormon  she began to laugh  i used to take an interest in every woman  take an interest is good  that was how it began  and then if circumstances were favourable the interest deepened until at last naturallywell you can understand  how many did you take an interest in  well in pretty nearly all of them  and how many deepened  oh i dont know  twenty  wellrather more than that i think  thirty  quite thirty  forty  not more than forty i think  maude sat aghast at the depths of his depravity  let me see  you are twentyseven now so you have loved four women a year since you were seventeen  if you reckon it that way said frank i am afraid that it must have been more than forty  its dreadful said maude and began to cry  frank knelt down in front of her and kissed her hands  she had sweet little plump hands very soft and velvety  you make me feel such a brute said he  anyhow i love you now with all my heart and mind and soul  fortyfirstly and lastly she sobbed half laughing and half crying  then she pulled his hair to reassure him  i cant be angry with you said she  besides it would be ungenerous to be angry when you tell me things of your own free will you are not forced to tell me  it is very honourable of you  but i do wish you had taken an interest in me first  well it was not so fated  i suppose there are some men who are quite good when they are bachelors  but i dont believe they are the best men  they are either archangels upon earthyoung gladstones and newmansor else they are cold calculating timid unvirile creatures who will never do any good  the first class must be splendid  i never met one except in memoirs  the others i dont want to meet  women are not interested in generalities  were they nicer than me she asked  who  those forty women  no dear of course not  why are you laughing  well it came into my head how funny it would be if the forty were all gathered into one room and you were turned loose in the middle of them  funny frank ejaculated  women have such extraordinary ideas of humour  maude laughed until she was quite tired  it doesnt strike you as comic she cried at last  no it doesnt he answered coldly  of course it wouldnt said she and went off into another ripple of pretty contralto laughter  there is a soft deep rich laugh which some women have that is the sweetest sound in nature  when you have quite finished said he huffily  her jealousy was much more complimentary than her ridicule  all right now  dont be cross  if i didnt laugh i should cry im so sorry if i have annoyed you  he had gone back to his chair so she paid him a flying visit  satisfied  not quite  now  all right  i forgive you  thats funny too  fancy you forgiving me after all these confessions  but you never loved one of them all as you love me  never  swear it  i do swear it  morally and what do you call it and the other  not one of them  and never will again  never  good boy for ever and ever  for ever and ever  and the forty were horrid  no hang it maude i cant say that  she pouted and hung her head  you do like them better then  how absurd you are maude  if i had liked one better i should have married her  well yes i suppose you would  you must have taken a deeper interest in me than in the others since you married me  i hadnt thought of that  silly old girl  of course i liked you best  let us drop the thing and never talk about it any more  have you their photographs  no  none of them  no  what did you do with them  i never had most of them  and the others  i destroyed some when i married  that was nice of you  arent you sorry  no i thought it was only right  were you fondest of dark women or fair  oh i dont know  i was never pernickety in my tastes  you know those lines i read you from henley  handsome uglyall are women thats a bachelors sentiment  but do you mean to say sirnow you are speaking on your honour that out of all these forty there was not one who was prettier than i am  do let us talk of something else  and not one as clever  how absurd you are tonight maude  come answer me  ive answered you already  i did not hear you  oh yes you did  i said that i had married you and that shows that i liked you best  i dont compare you quality for quality against every one in the world  that would be absurd  what i say is that your combination of qualities is the one which is most dear to me  oh i see said maude dubiously  how nice and frank you are  now ive hurt you  oh no not in the least  i like you to be frank  i should hate to think that there was anything you did not dare to tell me  and you maudewould you be equally frank with me  yes dear i will  i feel that i owe it to you after your confidence in me  i have had my little experiences too  you  perhaps you would rather that i said nothing about them  what good can there be in raking up these old stories  no i had rather you told me  you wont be hurt  no nocertainly not  you may take it from me frank that if any married woman ever tells her husband that until she saw him she never felt any emotion at the sight of another man it is simple nonsense  there may be women of that sort about but i never met them  i dont think i should like them for they must be dry cold unsympathetic unemotional unwomanly creatures  maude you have loved some one else  i wont deny that i have been interested deeply interested in several men  several  it was before i had met you dear  i owed you no duty  you have loved several men  the feeling was for the most part quite superficial  there are many different sorts and degrees of love  good god maude  how many men inspired this feeling in you  the truth is frank that a healthy young woman who has imagination and a warm heart is attracted by every young man  i know that you wish me to be frank and to return your confidence  but there is a certain kind of young man with whom i always felt my interest deepen  oh you did discriminate  now you are getting bitter  i will say no more  you have said too much  you must go on now  well i was only going to say that dark men always had a peculiar fascination for me  i dont know what it is but the feeling is quite overpowering  is that why you married a man with flaxen hair  well i couldnt expect to find every quality in my husband could i  it would not be reasonable  i assure you dear that taking your tout ensemble i like you far the best of all  you may not be the handsomest and you may not be the cleverestone cannot expect ones absolute idealbut i love you far far the best of any  i do hope i havent hurt you by anything i have said  i am sorry i am not your ideal maude  it would be absurd to suppose myself anybodys ideal but i hoped always that the eyes of love transfigured an object and made it seem all right  my hair is past praying for but if you can point out anything that i can mend   no no i want you just as you are  if i hadnt liked you best i shouldnt have married you frank should i  but those other experiences  oh we had better drop them  what good can it possibly do to discuss my old experiences  it will only annoy you  not at all  i honour you for your frankness in speaking out although i acknowledge that it is a little unexpected  go on  i forget where i was  you had just remarked that before your marriage you had loveaffairs with a number of men  how horrid it sounds doesnt it  well it did strike me in that way  but thats because you exaggerate what i said  i said that i had been attracted by several men  and that dark men thrilled you  exactly  i had hoped that i was the first  it was not fated to be so  i could easily tell you a lie frank and say that you were but i should never forgive myself if i were to do such a thing  you see i left school at seventeen and i was twentythree when i became engaged to you  there are six years imagine all the dances picnics parties visitings of six years  i could not help meeting young men continually  a good many were interested in me and i  you were interested in them  it was natural frank  oh yes perfectly natural  and then i understand that the interest deepened  sometimes  when you met a young man who was interested several times running at a dance then in the street then in the garden then a walk home at nightof course your interest began to deepen  yes  and then  well what was the next stage  sure youre not angry  no no not at all  why dont you keep the key in the spirit stand  it might tempt jemima  shall i get it  no no go on  the next stage was  well when you have been deeply interested some time then you begin to have experiences  ah  dont shout frank  did i shout  never mind  go on  you had experiences  why go into details  you must go on  you have said too much to stop  i insist upon hearing the experiences  not if you ask for them in that way frank  maude had a fine dignity of her own when she liked  well i dont insist  i beg you to have confidence in me and tell me some of your experiences  she leaned back in her armchair with her eyes half closed and a quiet retrospective smile upon her face  well if you would really like to hear frank as a proof of my confidence and trust i will tell you  you will remember that i had not seen you at the time  i will make every excuse  i will tell you a single experience  it was my first of the sort and stands out very clearly in my memory  it all came through my being left alone with a gentleman who was visiting my mother  yes  well we were alone in the room you understand  yes yes go on  and he paid me many little compliments  kept saying how pretty i was and that he had never seen a sweeter girl and so on  you know what gentlemen would say  and you  oh i hardly answered him but of course i was young and inexperienced and i could not help being flattered and pleased at his words  i may have shown him what i felt for he suddenly  kissed you  exactly  he kissed me  dont walk up and down the room dear  it fidgets me  all right  go on  dont stop  after this outrage what happened next  you really want to know  i must know  what did you do  i am so sorry that i ever began for i can see that it is exciting you  light your pipe dear and let us talk of something else  it will only make you cross if i tell you the truth  i wont be cross  go on  what did you do  well frank since you insisti kissed him back  youyou kissed him back  youll have jemima up if you go on like that  you kissed him back  yes dear it may be wrong but i did  good god why did you do that  well i liked him  a dark man  yes he was dark  o maude  maude  well dont stop  what then  then he kissed me several times  of course he would if you kissed him  what else could you expect and then  o frank i cant  go on  i am ready for anything  well do sit down and dont run about the room  i am only agitating you  there i am sitting  you can see that i am not agitated  for heavens sake go on  he asked me if i would sit upon his knee  yek  maude began to laugh  why frank you are croaking like a frog  i am glad you think it a laughing matter  go on  go on  you yielded to his very moderate and natural request  you sat upon his knee  well frank i did  good heavens  dont be so excitable dear  it was long before i ever saw you  you mean to sit there and tell me in cold blood that you sat upon this ruffians knee  what else could i do  what could you do  you could have screamed you could have rung the bell you could have struck himyou could have risen in the dignity of your insulted womanhood and walked out of the room  it was not so easy for me to walk out of the room  he held you  yes he held me  oh if i had been there  and there was another reason  what was that  well i wasnt very good at walking at that time  you see i was only three years old  frank sat for a few minutes absorbing it  you little wretch he said at last  oh you dear old goose  i feel so much better  you horror  i had to get level with you over my forty predecessors  you old bluebeard  but i did harrow you a littledidnt i  harrow me  im raw all over  its a nightmare  o maude how could you have the heart  oh it was lovelybeautiful  it was dreadful  and how jealous you were  oh i am so glad  i dont think said frank as he put his arms round her that i ever quite realised before  and just then jemima came in with the tray    chapter xiconcerning mrs beeton    frank crosse had only been married some months when he first had occasion to suspect that his wife had some secret sorrow  there was a sadness and depression about her at times for which he was unable to account  one saturday afternoon he happened to come home earlier than he was expected and entering her bedroom suddenly he found her seated in the basketchair in the window with a large book upon her knees  her face as she looked up at him with a mixed expression of joy and of confusion was stained by recent tears  she put the book hastily down upon the dressingstand  maude youve been crying  no frank no  o maude you fibber  remove those tears instantly  he knelt down beside her and helped  better now  yes dearest i am quite happy  tears all gone  quite gone  well then explain  i didnt mean to tell you frank  she gave the prettiest most provocative little wriggles as her secret was drawn from her  i wanted to do it without your knowing  i thought it would be a surprise for you  but i begin to understand now that my ambition was much too high  i am not clever enough for it  but it is disappointing all the same  frank took the bulky book off the table  it was mrs beetons book of household management  the open page was headed general observations on the common hog and underneath was a single large teardrop  it had fallen upon a woodcut of the common hog in spite of which frank solemnly kissed it and turned maudes trouble into laughter  now you are all right again  i do hate to see you crying though you never look more pretty  but tell me dear what was your ambition  to know as much as any woman in england about housekeeping  to know as much as mrs beeton  i wanted to master every page of it from the first to the last  there are 1641 of them said frank turning them over  i know  i felt that i should be quite old before i had finished but the last part you see is all about wills and bequests and homeopathy and things of that kind  we could do it later  it is the early part that i want to learn nowbut it is so hard  but why do you wish to do it maude  because i want you to be as happy as mr beeton  ill bet i am  no no you cant be frank  it says somewhere here that the happiness and comfort of the husband depend upon the housekeeping of the wife  mrs beeton must have been the finest housekeeper in the world  therefore mr beeton must have been the happiest and most comfortable man  but why should mr beeton be happier and more comfortable than my frank  from the hour i read that i determined that he shouldnt beand he wont be  and he isnt  oh you think so  but then you know nothing about it  you think it right because i do it  but if you were visiting mrs beeton you would soon see the difference  what an awkward trick you have of always sitting in a window said frank after an interval  ill swear that the wise mrs beeton never advocates thatwith half a dozen other windows within point blank range  well then you shouldnt do it  well then you shouldnt be so nice  you really still think that i am nice  fishing  after all these months  nicer and nicer every day  not a bit tired  you blessing  when i am tired of you i shall be tired of life  how wonderful it all seems  does it not  to think of that first day at the tennisparty  i hope you are not a very good player mr crosseno miss selby but i shall be happy to make one in a set  thats how we began  and now  yes it is wonderful  and at dinner afterwards  do you like irvings actingyes i think that he is a great genius  how formal and precise we were and now i sit curling your hair in a bedroom window  it does seem funny  but i suppose if you come to think of it something of the same kind must have happened to one or two people before  but never quite like us  oh no never quite like us  but with a kind of family resemblance you know  married people do usually end by knowing each other a little better than on the first day they met  what did you think of me frank  ive told you often  well tell me again  whats the use when you know  but i like to hear  well its just spoiling you  i love to be spoiled  well then i thought to myselfif i can only have that woman for my own i believe i will do something in life yet  and i also thoughtif i dont get that woman for my own i will never never be the same man again  really frank the very first day you saw me  yes the very first day  and then  and then day by day and week by week that feeling grew deeper and stronger until at last you swallowed up all my other hopes and ambitions and interests  i hardly dare think maude what would have happened to me if you had refused me  she laughed aloud with delight  how sweet it is to hear you say so  and the wonderful thing is that you have never seemed disappointed  i always expected that some day after marriagenot immediately perhaps but at the end of a week or soyou would suddenly give a start like those poor people who are hypnotised and you would say why i used to think that she was pretty  i used to think that she was sweet  how could i be so infatuated over a little insignificant ignorant selfish uninteresting  o frank the neighbours will see you  well then you mustnt provoke me  what will mrs potter think  you should pull down the blinds before you make speeches of that sort  now do sit quiet and be a good boy  well then tell me what you thought  i thought you were a very good tennisplayer  anything else  and you talked nicely  did i  i never felt such a stick in my life  i was as nervous as a cat  that was so delightful  i do hate people who are very cool and assured  i saw that you were disturbed and i even thought  yes  well i thought that perhaps it was i who disturbed you  and you liked me  i was very interested in you  well that is the blessed miracle which i can never get over  you with your beauty and your grace and your rich father and every young man at your feet and i a fellow with neither good looks nor learning nor prospects nor  be quiet sir  yes you shall  now  by jove there is old mrs potter at the window  weve done it this time  let us get back to serious conversation again  how did we leave it  it was that hog i believe  and then mr beeton  but where does the hog come in  why should you weep over him  and what are the ladys observations on the common hog  read them for yourself  frank read out aloud  the hog belongs to the order mammalia the genus sus scrofa and the species pachydermata or thickskinned its generic characters are a long flexible snout fortytwo teeth cloven feet furnished with four toes and a tail which is small short and twisted while in some varieties this appendage is altogether wanting but what on earth has all this to do with housekeeping  thats what i want to know  it is so disheartening to have to remember such things  what does it matter if the hog has fortytwo toes  and yet if mrs beeton knew it one feels that one ought to know it also  if once i began to skip there would be no end to it but it really is such a splendid book in other ways  it doesnt matter what you want you will find it here  take the index anywhere  cream  if you want cream its all there  croup  if you wanti mean if you dont want croup it will teach you how not to get it  crumpetsall about them  crullersim sure you dont know what a cruller is frank  no i dont  neither do i  but i could look it up and learn  here it is paragraph 2847  it is a sort of pancake you see  thats how you learn things  frank crosse took the book and dropped it  it fell with a sulky thud upon the floor  nothing that it can teach you dear can ever make up to me if it makes you cry and bothers youyou bloated pedantic thing he cried in sudden fury aiming a kick at the squat volume  it is to you i owe all those sad tired looks which i have seen upon my wifes face  i know my enemy now  you pompous fussy old humbug ill kick the red cover off you  but maude snatched it up and gathered it to her bosom  no no frank i dont know what i should do without it  you have no idea what a wise old book it is  now sit there on the footstool at my feet and i will read to you  do dear its delightful  sit quiet then and be good  now listen to this pearl of wisdom as with the commander of an army so it is with the mistress of a house  her spirit will be seen through the whole establishment and just in proportion as she performs her duties thoroughly so will her domestics follow in her path  from which it follows said her husband that jemima must be a perfect paragon  on the contrary it explains all jemimas shortcomings  listen to this  early rising is one of the most essential qualities  when a mistress is an early riser it is almost certain that her house will be orderly and well managed  well you are down at ninewhat more do you want  at nine  i am sure that mrs beeton was always up at six  i have my doubts about mrs b  methinks the lady doth protest too much  i should not be very much surprised to learn that she had breakfast in bed every morning  o frank  you have no reverence for anything  let us have some more wisdom  frugality and economy are home virtues without which no household can prosper  dr johnson says frugality may be termed  oh bother dr johnson  who cares for a mans opinion  now if it had been mrs johnson  johnson kept house for himself for yearsand a queer job he made of it  so i should think  maude tossed her pretty curls  mrs beeton is all right but i will not be lectured by dr johnson  where was i oh yeswe must always remember that to manage a little well is a great merit in housekeeping  hurrah  down with the second vegetable  no pudding on fish days vive la biere de pilsen  what a noisy boy you are  this book excites me  anything more  friendships should not be hastily formed nor the heart given at once to every newcomer  well i should hope not  dont let me catch you at it  you dont mind my cigarette  has mrs beeton a paragraph about smoking in bedrooms  such an enormity never occurred to her as a remote possibility  if she had known you dear she would have had to write an appendix to her book to meet all the new problems which you would suggest  shall i go on  please do  she next treats conversation  in conversation trifling occurrences such as small disappointments petty annoyances and other everyday incidents should never be mentioned to friends  if the mistress be a wife never let a word in connection with her husbands failings pass her lips  by jove this book has more wisdom to the square inch than any work of man cried frank in enthusiasm  i thought that would please you  good temper should be cultivated by every mistress as upon it the welfare of the household may be said to turn  excellent  in starting a household it is always best in the longrun to get the very best articles of their kind  that is why i got you maude  thank you sir  we have a dissertation then upon dress and fashion another upon engaging domestics another about daily duties another about visiting another about fresh air and exercise  the most essential of any cried frank jumping up and pulling his wife by the arms out of her low wickerchair  there is just time for nine holes at golf before it is dark if you wilt come exactly as you are  but listen to this young lady  if ever again i see you fretting or troubling yourself about your household affairs  no no frank i wont  well if you do mrs beeton goes into the kitchenfire  now remember  you are sure you dont envy mr beeton  i dont envy a man upon earth  then why should i try to be mrs beeton  why indeed  o frank what a load off my mind  those sixteen hundred pages have just lain upon it for months  dear old boy come on  and they clattered downstairs for their golfclubs    chapter xiimr samuel pepys    there were few things which maude liked so much as a long winter evening when frank and she dined together and then sat beside the fire and made good cheer  it would be an exaggeration to say that she preferred it to a dance but next to that supreme joy and higher even than the theatre in her scale of pleasures were those serene and intimate evenings when they talked at their will and were silent at their will within their home brightened by those little jokes and endearments and allusions which make up that inner domestic masonry which is closetiled for ever to the outsider  five or six evenings a week she with her sewing and frank with his book settled down to such enjoyment as men go to the ends of the earth to seek while it awaits them if they will but atune their souls to sympathy beside their own hearthstones  now and again their sweet calm would be broken by a ring at the bell when some friend of franks would come round to pay them an evening visit  at the sound maude would say bother and frank something shorter and stronger but as the intruder appeared they would both break into well really now it was good of you to drop in upon us in this homely way  without such hypocrisy the world would be a hard place to live in  i may have mentioned somewhere that frank had a catholic taste in literature  upon a shelf in their bedrooma relic of his bachelor daysthere stood a small line of his intimate books the books which filled all the chinks of his life when no new books were forthcoming they were all volumes which he had read in his youth and many times since until they had become the very tiebeams of his mind  his tastes were healthy and obvious without being fine  macaulays essays holmes autocrat gibbons history jefferies story of my heart carlyles life pepys diary and borrows lavengro were among his inner circle of literary friends  the sturdy east anglian half prizefighter half missionary was a particular favourite of his and so was the garrulous secretary of the navy  one day it struck him that it would be a pleasant thing to induce his wife to share his enthusiasms and he suggested that the evenings should be spent in reading selections from these old friends of his  maude was delighted  if he had proposed to read the rigvedas in the original sanskrit maude would have listened with a smiling face  it is in such trifles that a womans love is more than a mans  that night frank came downstairs with a thick wellthumbed volume in his hand  this is mr pepys said he solemnly  what a funny name cried maude  it makes me think of indigestion why  oh yes pepsine of course  we shall take a dose of him every night after dinner to complete the resemblance  but seriously dear i think that now that we have taken up a course of reading we should try to approach it in a grave spirit and endeavour to realiseoh i say dont  i am so sorry dear  i do hope i didnt hurt you  you didconsiderably  it all came from my having the needle in my hand at the timeand you looked so solemnandwell i couldnt help it  little wretch  no dear jemima may come in any moment with the coffee  now do sit down and read about mr pepys to me  and first of all would you mind explaining all about the gentleman from the beginning and taking nothing for granted just as if i had never heard of him before  i dont believe  never mind sir  be a good boy and do exactly what you are told now begin  well maude mr pepys was born  what was his first name  samuel  oh dear im sure i should not have liked him  well its too late to change that  he was borni could see by looking but it really doesnt matter does it  he was born somewhere in sixteen hundred and something or other and i forget what his father was  i must try to remember what you tell me  well it all amounts to this that he got on very well in the world that he became at last a high official of the navy in the time of charles the second and that he died in fairly good circumstances and left his library which was a fine one to one of the universities i cant remember which  there is an accuracy about your information frank  i know dear but it really does not matter  all this has nothing to do with the main question  go on then  well this library was left as a kind of dustcatcher as such libraries are until one day more than a hundred years after the old boys death some enterprising person seems to have examined his books and he found a number of volumes of writing which were all in cipher so that no one could make head or tail of them  dear me how very interesting  yes it naturally excited curiosity  why should a man write volumes of cipher  imagine the labour of it  so some one set to work to solve the cipher  this was about the year 1820  after three years they succeeded  how in the world did they do it  well they say that human ingenuity never yet invented a cipher which human ingenuity could not also solve  anyhow they did succeed  and when they had done so and copied it all out clean they found they had got hold of such a book as was never heard of before in the whole history of literature  maude laid her sewing on her lap and looked across with her lips parted and her eyebrows raised  they found that it was an inner diary of the life of this man with all his impressions and all his doings and all his thoughtsnot his oughttobe thoughts but his real real thoughts just as he thought then at the back of his soul  you see this man and you know him very much better than his own wife knew him  it is not only that he tells of his daily doings and gives us such an intimate picture of life in those days as could by no other means have been conveyed but it is as a piece of psychology that the thing is so valuable remember the dignity of the man a high government official an orator a writer a patron of learning and here you have the other side the little thoughts the mean ideas which may lurk under a bewigged head and behind a solemn countenance  not that he is worse than any of us  not a bit  but he is frank  and that is why the book is really a consoling one for every sinner who reads it can say to himself well if this man who did so well and was so esteemed felt like this it is no very great wonder that i do  maude looked at the fat brown book with curiosity  is it really all there she asked  no dear it will never all be published  a good deal of it is i believe quite impossible  and when he came to the impossible places he doubled and trebled his cipher so as to make sure that it should never be made out  but all that is usually published is here  frank turned over the leaves which were marked here and there with pencilings  why are you smiling frank  only at his way of referring to his wife  oh he was married  yes to a very charming girl  she must have been a sweet creature he married her at fifteen on account of her beauty  he had a keen eye for beauty had old pepys  were they happy  oh yes fairly so  she was only twentynine when she died  poor girl  she was happy in her lifethough he did blacken her eye once  not really  yes he did  and kicked the housemaid  oh the brute  but on the whole he was a good husband  he had a few very good points about him  but how does he allude to his wife  he has a trick of saying my wife poor wretch  impertinent  frank you said tonight that other men think what this odious mr pepys says  yes you did  dont deny it  does that mean that you always think of me as poor wretch  we have come along a little since then  but how these passages take you back to the homely life of those days  do read some  well listen to this and then to bed without prayers tomorrow being washingday  fancy such a detail coming down to us through two centuries  why no prayers  i dont know  i suppose they had to get up early on washingdays and so they wanted to go to sleep soon  im afraid dear you do the same without as good an excuse  read another  he goes to dine with some onehis uncle i think  he says an excellent dinner but the venison pasty was palpable beef which was not handsome  how beautiful  mrs hunt mortimers sole last week was palpable plaice  mr pepys is right  it was not handsome  heres another grand entry  talked with my wife of the poorness and meanness of all that the people about us do compared with what we do  i dare say he was right for they did things very well when he dined out he says that his host gave him the meanest dinner of beef shoulder and umbles of venison and a few pigeons and all in the meanest manner that ever i did see to the basest degree  what are umbles dear  i have no idea  well whatever they are it sounds to me a very good dinner  people must have lived very well in those days  they habitually overate and overdrank themselves  but pepys gives us the menu of one of his own entertainments  ive marked it somewhere  yes here it is  fricassee of rabbits and chickens a leg of mutton boiled three carps in a dish a great dish of a side of lamb a dish of roasted pigeons a dish of four lobsters three tarts a lamprey pie a most rare pie a dish of anchovies good wine of several sorts and all things mighty noble and to my great content  good gracious  i told you that i associated him with indigestion  he did them pretty well that time  who cooked all this  the wife helped in those days  no wonder she died at twentynine  poor dear  what a splendid kitchenrange they must have had  i never understood before why they had such enormous grates in the old days  naturally if you have six pigeons and a lamprey and a lobster and a side of lamb and a leg of mutton and all these other things cooking at the same time you would need a huge fire  the wonderful thing about pepys said frank looking thoughtfully over the pages is that he is capable of noting down the mean little impulses of human nature which most men would be so ashamed of that they would hasten to put them out of their mind  his occasional shabbiness in money matters his jealousies his envies all his petty faults which are despicable on account of their pettiness fancy any man writing this  he is describing how he visited a friend and was reading a book from his library  a very good book says he especially one letter of advice to a courtier most true and good which made me once resolve to tear out the two leaves that it was writ in but i forbore it  imagine recording such a vile thought  but what you have never explained to me yet dear or if you did i didnt understandyou dont mind my being a little stupid do you is what object mr pepys had in putting down all this in such a form that no one could read it  well you must bear in mind dear that he could read it himself besides he was a fellow with a singularly methodical side to his mind  he was for example continually adding up how much money he had or cataloguing and indexing his library and so on  he liked to have everything shipshape  and so with his life it pleased him to have an exact record which he could turn to  and yet after all i dont know that that is a sufficient explanation  no indeed it is not  my experience of man  your experience indeed  yes sir my experience of menhow rude you are franktells me that they have funny little tricks and vanities which take the queerest shapes  indeed  have i any  youyou are compounded of them  not vanityno i dont mean that but prideyou are as proud as lucifer and much too proud to show it  that is the most subtle form of pride  oh yes i know perfectly well what i mean  but in this mans case it took the form of wishing to make a sensation after his death  he could not publish such a thing when he lived could he  rather not  well then he had to do it after his death  he had to write it in cipher or else some one would have found him out during his lifetime  but very likely he left a key to the cipher so that every one might read it when he was gone but the key and his directions were in some way lost  well it is very probable  the fire had died down so maude shipped off her chair and sat on the black fur rug with her back against franks knees  now dear read away said she  but the lamp shone down upon her dainty head and it gleamed upon her white neck and upon the fluffy capricious untidy adorable little curlets which broke out along the edges of the gathered strands of her chestnut hair  and so after the fashion of men his thoughts flew away from mr pepys and the seventeenth century and all that is lofty and instructive and could fix upon nothing except those dear little wandering tendrils and the white column on which they twined alas that so small a thing can bring the human mind from its empyrean flights  alas that vague emotions can drag down the sovereign intellect  alas that even for an hour a man should prefer the material to the spiritual  but the man who doesnt misses a good deal    chapter xiiia visit to mr samuel pepys    there are several unjustifiable extravagances which every normal man commits  there are also several unjustifiable economies  among others there is that absurd eagerness to save the striking of a second match which occasions so many burned fingers and such picturesque language  and again there is the desire to compress a telegraphic message into the minimum sixpennyworth and so send an ambiguous and cryptic sentence when sevenpence would have made it as clear as light  we all tend to be stylists in our telegrams  a week after the conversation about mr pepys when some progress had been made with the reading of the diary maude received the following wire from frank    mrs crosse  wokingpepys buttered toast suede gloves four monument wait late  as a sixpennyworth it was a success but as a message it seemed to leave something to be desired  maude puzzled over it and tried every possible combination of the words  the nearest approach to sense was when it was divided in this waypepysbuttered toast suede glovesfourmonument wait late  she wrote it out in this form and took it section by section pepys that was unintelligible  buttered toast no sense in that  suede gloves yes she had told frank that when she came to town she would buy some suede gloves at a certain shop in the city where she could get for three and threepence a pair which would cost her three and ninepence in woking  maude was so conscientiously economical that she was always prepared to spend two shillings in railway fares to reach a spot where a sixpence was to be saved and to lavish her nerve and energy freely in the venture  here then in the suede gloves was a central point of light  and then her heart bounded with joy as she realised that the last part could only mean that she was to meet frank at the monument at four and that she was to wait for him if he were late  so now returning to the opening of the message with the light which shone from the ending she realised that buttered toast might refer to a queer little city hostel remarkable for that luxury where frank had already taken her twice to tea  and so leaving mr pepys to explain himself later maude gave hurried orders to jemima and the cook and dashed upstairs to put on her new fawncoloured walkingdressa garment which filled her with an extraordinary mixture of delight and remorse for it was very smart cost seven guineas and had not yet been paid for  the rendezvous was evidently a sudden thought upon the part of frank for he had left very little time for her to reach the trystingplace however she was fortunate in catching a train to waterloo and another thence to the city and so reached the monument at five minutes to four  the hour was just striking when frank with his wellbrushed tophat and immaculate business frockcoat came rushing from the direction of king william street  maude held out her hand and he shook it and then they both laughed at the formality  i am so glad you were able to come dearest  how you do brighten up the old city  do i  i felt quite lonely until you came  nothing but droves of menand all staring  its your dress  oh thank you sir  entirely that pretty brown  brown  fawn colour  well thats brown  anyhow it looks charming  and so do youby jove you do maude  come this way  where are we going  by underground  here we aretwo second singles mark lane pleaseno thats for the westend trains  down here  next train the man says  they were in the mephitic cellar with the two long wooden platforms where the subterranean trains land or load their freights  a strangling gas tickled their throats and set them coughing  it was all dank and dark and gloomy  but little youth and love care for that  they were bubbling over with the happiness of this abnormal meeting  both talked together in their delight and maude patted franks sleeve with every remark  they could even illuminate all that was around them by the beauty and brightness of their own love it went the length of open praise for their abominable surroundings  isnt it grand and solemn said maude  look at the black shadows  when they come to excavate all this some thousands of years hence they will think it was constructed by a race of giants frank answered  the modern works for the benefit of the community are really far greater than those which sprang from the caprice of kings  the london and northwestern railway is an infinitely grander thing than the pyramids  look at the two headlights in the dark  two sullen crimson discs glowed in the black arch of the tunnel with a menacing and sinister speed they grew and grew until roaring they sprang out of the darkness and the long dingy train with a whining of brakes drew up at the platform  heres one nearly empty said frank with his hand on the handle  dont you think said maude  yes i do cried frank  and they got into one which was quite empty  for the underground railway is blessed as regards privacy above all other lines and where could a loving couple be more happy who have been torn apart by cruel fate for seven long hours or so  it was with a groan that frank remarked that they had reached mark lane  bother said maude and wondered if there were any shop near where she could buy hairpins  as every lady knows or will know there is a very intimate connection between hairpins and a loving husband  now frank about your telegram  all right dear  come along where i lead you and you will understand all about it  they passed out of mark lane station and down a steep and narrow street to the right  at the bottom lay an old smokestained church with a square tower and a small open churchyard beside it  thats the church of saint olave said frank  we are going into it  he pushed open a folding oaken door and they found themselves inside it  rows of modern seats filled the body of it but the walls and windows gave an impression of great antiquity  the stained glass especially that which surmounted the altarcontained those rich satisfying purples and deep deep crimsons which only go with age  it was a bright and yet a mellow light falling in patches of vivid colour upon the brown woodwork and the grey floors  here and there upon the walls were marble inscriptions in the latin tongue with pompous allegorical figures with trumpets for our ancestors blew them in stone as well as in epitaphs over their tombs  they loved to die as they had lived with dignity and with affectation  white statues glimmered in the shadows of the corners  as frank and his wife passed down the sideaisle their steps clanged through the empty and silent church  here he is said frank and faced to the wall  he was looking up at the modern representation of a gentleman in a full and curly wig  it was a wellrounded and comely face with shrewd eyes and a sensitive mouth  the face of a man of affairs and a good fellow with just that saving touch of sensuality about it which makes an expression human and lovable  underneath was printed    samuel pepys erected by public subscription 1883   oh isnt he nice said maude  hes not a badlooking chap is he  i dont believe that man ever could have struck his wife or kicked the maid  thats calling him a liar  oh dear i forgot that he said so himself  then i suppose he must have done it  what a pity it seems  cheer up  we must say what the old heathen lady said when they read the gospels to her  what did she say  she said well it was a long time ago and well hope that it wasnt true  o frank how can you tell such stories in a church  do you really suppose that mr pepys is in that wall  i presume that the monument marks the grave  theres a little bit of plaster loose  do you think i might take it  it isnt quite the thing  but it cant matter and it isnt wrong and we are quite alone she picked off the little flake of plaster and her heart sprang into her mouth as she did so for there came an indignant snort from her very elbow and there was a queer little smokedried blackdressed person who seemed to have risen like the eastern genii or a modern genius in a single instant  a pair of black list slippers explained the silence of his approach  put that back young lady said he severely  poor maude held out her guilty relic on the palm of her hand  i am so sorry said she  i am afraid i cannot put it back  well ave the ole church picked to pieces at this rate said the clerk  you shouldnt ave done it and it was very wrong  he snorted and shook his head  its of no consequence said frank  the plaster was hanging and must have fallen in any case  dont make a fuss about a trifle  the clerk looked at the young gentleman and saw defiance in one of his eyes and half a crown in the other  well well he grumbled  it shows as the young lady takes an interest and thats more than most  why sir if youll believe me theres not one in a hundred that comes to this church that ever eard of pepys  pepys says they  oos pepys  the diarist says i  diarist says they wots a diarist  i could sit down sometimes an cry  but maybe miss you thought as you were picking that plaster off is grave  yes i thought so  the clerk chuckled  well it aint so  ill tell you where e really lies if youll promise you wont pick another chunk off that  well then its therebeside the communion  i saw im lyin there with these very eyes and is wife in the coffin beneath im  you saw him  yes sir i saw im an thats more than any livin man could say for there were only four of us and the other three are as dead as pepys by now  oh do tell us about it cried maude  well it was like this miss  we ad to examine to see ow much room there was down there and so we came upon them  and what did you see  well miss is coffin lay above and is wifes below as might be expected seeing that she died thirty years or so before im  the coffins was very much broken an we could see im as clear us i can see you  when we first looked in i saw im lying quite plaina short thick figure of a manwith is ands across is chest  and then just as we looked at im e crumbled in as you might say across is breast bone an just quietly settled down into a uddle of dust  its a way they as when the fresh air strikes em  an she the same an is dust just fell through the chinks o the wood and mixed itself with ers  o frank  maudes ready tears sprang to her eyes  she put her hand upon her husbands and was surprised to find how cold it was  women never realise that the male sex is the more sensitive  he had not said o maude because he could not  they used some powder like pepper for embalmin in those days said the clerk  and the vicarit was in old bellamys timee took a sniff into the grave an e sneezed an sneezed till we thought we should ave to fetch a doctor  ave you seen mrs pepys tomb  no we have only just come  thats it on the left of the common  with the woman leaning forward  yes sir  thats mrs pepys herself  it was an arch laughing face the face of a quite young woman the sculptor had depicted her as leaning forward in an animated and natural attitude  below was engraved    obiit xo novembris aetatis 29 conjugii 15 anno domini 1669   poor dear whispered maude  it was hard that she should die just as her husband was becoming famous and successful said frank  she who had washed his shirts and made up the coal fires when they lived in a garret together what a pity that she could not have a good time  ah well if she loved him dear she had a good time in the garret  maude was leaning forward with her face raised to look at the bust of the dead woman which also leaned forward as if to look down upon her  a pair of marble skulls flanked the ladys grave  a red glow from the evening sun struck through a sidewindow and bathed the whole group in its ruddy light  as frank standing back in the shadow ran his eyes from the face of the dead young wife to that of his own sweet girlish bride with those sinister skulls between there came over him like a wave a realisation of the horror which lies in things the grim close of the passing pageant the black gloom which swallows up the neverending stream of life  will the spirit wear better than the body and if not what infernal practical joke is this to which we are subjected  it will  it must he said  why frankfrank dear what is the matter  you are quite pale  come out into the air maude  i have had enough of this stuffy old church  stuffy said the clerk  well weve ad the lord mayor ere at least once a year an e never found it stuffy  a cleaner fresher church you wont find in the city of london  its ad its day ill allow  there was a timeand i can remember itwhen folk used to spend their money where they made it and the plate would be full of paper and gold where now we find it ard enough to get coppers that was fifty year ago when i was a young clerk  you might not think it but ive seen a lord mayor a past lord mayor and a lord mayor elect of the city of london all sitting on one bench in this very church  and you call it stuffy  frank soothed the wounded feelings of the old clerk and explained that by stuffy he meant interesting  he also shook hands with him in a peculiar way as he held his palm upturned in the small of his back then maude and he retraced their steps up the narrow street which is called seething lane  poor old boy  what was it then asked maude looking up with her sympathetic eyes  it is at such moments that a man realises what the companionship of women means  the clouds melted before the sun  what an ass i was  i began to think of all sorts of horrible things  never mind maude  we are out for a holiday  hang the future  let us live in the present  i always do said maude and she spoke for her sex  well what now  buttered toast or suede gloves  business first said maude primly and so proceeded to save her sixpence on the gloves  as she was tempted however such a civil obliging shopman frank to buy four yards of socalled astrakhan trimming a frill of torchon lace six dear little festooned handkerchiefs and four pairs of openwork stockingsnone of which were contemplated when she entered the shopher sixpenny saving was not as brilliant a piece of finance as she imagined  and then they finished their excursion in the dark wainscotted low ceilinged coffeeroom of an oldfashioned inn once the mother of many coaches and now barren and deserted but with a strange cunning in the matter of buttered toast which had come down from more prosperous days  it was a new waiter who served them and he imagined them to be lovers and scented an intrigue but when they called for a second plate of toast and a jug of boiling water he recognised the healthy appetite of the married  and then instead of going home like a good little couple maude suddenly got it into her head that it would cheer away the last traces of franks gloom if they went to see charleys aunt at the globe  so they loitered and shopped for a couple of hours and then squeezed into the back of the pit and wedged in among honest hearty folk who were not ashamed to show their emotions they laughed until they were tired  and so home as their friend pepys would have said after such a day as comes into the memory shining golden among the drab when old folk look back and think of the dear dead past  may you and i reader if ever we also come to sit in our final armchairs in the chimney corners have many such to which our minds may turn sweet and innocent and fragrant to cheer us in those darksome hours to come    chapter xivtrouble    one evening frank came home with a clouded face  his wife said nothing but after dinner she sat on a footstool beside his chair and waited  she knew that if it were for the best he would tell her everything and she had confidence enough in his judgment to acquiesce in his silence if he thought it best to be silent  as a matter of fact it was just this telling her which made his trouble hard to bear  and yet he thought it wiser to tell  ive had something to worry me dear  poor old boy i know you have  what was it  why should i bother you with it  a nice wife i should be if i shared all your joys and none of your sorrows  anyhow i had rather share sorrow with you than joy within any one else  she snuggled her head up against his knee  tell me about it frank  you remember my telling you just before our marriage that i was surety for a man  i remember perfectly well  his name was farintosh  he was an insuranceagent and i became surety for him in order to save his situation  yes dear it was so noble of you  well maude he was on the platform this morning and when he saw me he turned on his heel and hurried out of the station  i read guilt in his eyes  i am sure that his accounts are wrong again  oh what an ungrateful wretch  poor devil i dare say he has had a bad time  but i was a fool not to draw out of that  it was all very well when i was a bachelor but here i am as a married man faced with an indefinite liability and nothing to meet it with  i dont know what is to become of us maude  how much is it dearest  i dont know  that is the worst of it  but surely your own office would not be so hard upon you  it is not my own office  it is another officethe hotspur  oh dear  what have you done about it frank  i called at their office in my lunchhour and i requested them to send down an accountant to examine farintoshs books  he will be here tomorrow morning and i have leave of absence for the day  and so they were to spend an evening and a night without knowing whether they were merely crippled or absolutely ruined  franks nature was really a very proud one and the thought of failing in his engagements wounded his selfrespect most deeply  his nerves winced and quivered before it  but her sweet strong soul rose high above all fear and bore him up with her into the serenity of love and trust and confidence  the really precious things the things of the spirit were permanent and could not be lost  what matter if they lived in an eightroomed villa or in a tent out on the heath  what matter if they had two servants or if she worked for him herself all this was the merest trifle the outside of life  but the intimate things their love their trust their pleasures of mind and soul these could not be taken away from them while they had life to enjoy them  and so she soothed frank with sweet caresses and gentle words until this night of gloom had turned to the most beautiful of all his life and he had learned to bless the misfortune which had taught him to know the serene courage and the wholehearted devotion which can only be felt like the scent of a fragrant leaf when fate gives us a crush between its iron fingers  shortly after breakfast mr wingfield the accountant from london arriveda tall gentlemanly man with a formal manner  im sorry about this business mr crosse said he  frank made a grimace  it cant be helped  we will hope that the amount is not very serious  we have warned mr farintosh that his books will be inspected today  when you are ready we shall go round  the agent lived in a sidestreet not far off  a brass plate outside a small brick house marked it out from the line of other small brick houses  a sadfaced woman opened the door and farintosh himself haggard and white was seated among his ledgers in the little front room  a glance at the mans helpless face turned all franks resentment to pity  they sat down at the table the accountant in the centre farintosh on the right and frank on the left  there was no talk save an occasional abrupt question and answer  for two hours the swish and rustle of the great blue pages of the ledgers were the chief sound with the scratching of mr wingfields pen as he totalled up long columns of figures  franks heart turned to water as he saw the huge sums which had passed through this mans hands  how much had remained there  his whole future depended upon the answer to that question  how prosaic and undramatic are the moments in which a modern career is made or marred  in this obscure battlefield the squire no longer receives his accolade in public for his work well done nor do we see the butchers cleaver as it hacks off the knightly spurs but failure and success come strangely and stealthily determined by trifles and devoid of dignity  here was the crisis of franks young life in this mean front room amongst the almanacs and the accountbooks  can i rely upon these figures asked wingfield at last  you can sir  in that case i congratulate you mr crosse  i can only find a deficiency of fifty pounds  only enough to swallow the whole of their little savings which they had carefully invested  however it was good news and frank shook the proffered hand of the accountant  i will stay for another hour to check these figures said wingfield  but there is no need to detain you  you will come round and lunch with us  with pleasure  au revoir then  frank ran all the way home and burst in upon his wife  it is not so very bad dearonly fifty pounds  they danced about in their joy like two children  but wingfield came to his lunch within a solemn face  i am very sorry to disappoint you he said but the matter is more serious than i thought  we have entered some sums as unpaid which he has really received but the receipts for which he has held back they amount to another hundred pounds  maude felt inclined to cry as she glanced at frank and saw his resolute effort to look unconcerned  then its a hundred and fifty  certainly not less  i have marked the items down upon this paper for your inspection  frank glanced his practised eyes over the results of the accountants mornings work  you have credited him within a hundred and twenty pounds in the bank i see  yes his bankbook shows a balance of that amount  when was it made out  last saturday  he may have drawn it since them  it is certainly possible  we might go round after lunch and make sure  very good  and in any case as it is the companys money dont you think we had better take it out of his hands  yes i think you are right  it was a miserable meal and they were all glad when it was finished maude drew frank into the other room before he started  i could not let you go without that dearest  keep a brave heart my own laddie for i know so well that we shall come through it all right  so frank set out with a higher courage and they both returned to the agents house  his white face turned a shade whiter when he understood their errand  is this necessary mr wingfield he pleaded  wont you take my word for this money  i am sorry to have to say it sir but we have trusted in your word too often  but the money is there i swear it  it is the companys money and we must have it  it will ruin my credit locally if i draw out my whole account under compulsion  then let him keep ten pounds in said frank  farintosh agreed with an ill grace to the compromise and they all started off for the bank  when they reached the door the agent turned upon them with an appealing face  dont come in with me gentlemen  i could never hold up my head again  it is for mr crosse to decide  i dont want to be unreasonable farintosh  go in alone and draw the money  they could never understand why he begged for that extra five minutes  perhaps it was that he had some mad hope of persuading the bank manager to allow him to overdraw to that amount  if so the refusal was a curt one for he reappeared with a ghastly face and walked up to frank  i may as well confess to you mr crosse i have nothing in the bank  frank whistled and turned upon his heel  he could not by reproaches add to the wretched mans humiliation  after all he had himself to blame  he had incurred a risk with his eyes open and he was not the man to whine now that the thing had gone against him  wingfield walked home with him and murmured some words of sympathy  at the gate the accountant left him and went on to the station  so their liability had risen from fifty to two hundred and seventy pounds  even maude was for an instant daunted by the sum  the sale of their furniture would hardly meet it  it was the blackest hour of their lives and yet always a strange sweet undercurrent of joy was running through it for it is only sorrow fairly shared and bravely borne which can weld two human souls together  dinner was over when there came a ring at the bell  if you please sir mr farintosh would like to see you said the maid jemima  show him in here  dont you think frank that i had better go  no i dont  i never asked him to come  if he comes let him face us both  i have not made much of my dealings with him alone  he was shown in downcast shiftyeyed and ill at ease  he laid his hat upon the floor and crept humbly towards the chair which frank pushed towards him  well farintosh  well mr crosse i have come round to tell you and you too missus the sorrow i feel that i have brought this trouble upon you i hoped all would have gone right after that last time but ive had to pay up back debts and thats what has put me wrong  ive never had what one may call a fair chance  but im really sorry sir that you who have as one might say befriended me should have to suffer for it in this way  words wont mend it farintosh  i only blame you for not coming to me when first things began to go wrong  well sir i was always hoping that i could turn them right again so as you wouldnt need to be troubled at all  and so it went from bad to worse until we find ourselves here  but what i wanted to ask you mr crosse was what you meant to do about it  frank writhed before this home question  well i suppose i am responsible said he  you mean to pay the money sir  well somebody must pay it  do you remember the wording of the bond mr crosse  not the exact wording  well sir i should advise you to get your lawyer to read it  in my opinion sir you are not liable at all  not liable  frank felt as if his heart had turned suddenly from a roundshot to an airballoon  why not liable  you were a little slapdashy if one might say so in matters of business sir and perhaps you read that bond less carefully than i did  there was a clause in it by which the company agreed frequently and periodically to audit my accounts so as to prevent your liability being at any time a very high one  so there was cried frank  well didnt they  no sir they didnt  by jovemaude do you hear thatif that is right they brought their own misfortunes upon themselves  do you mean to say they never audited you  yes sir they did so four times  in how long  in fourteen months  the airballoon was gone and the cannonball back in its place once more  that will be held to exonerate them  no sir i think not  frequently and periodically does not mean four times in fourteen months  a jury might take it so  consider sir that the object was that your liability should be limited  thousands of pounds were passing through my hands in that time and therefore these four audits were as one might say insufficient for the object of the bond  so i think cried maude with conviction  frank well have the best advice upon the subject tomorrow  and meanwhile mr crosse said farintosh rising from his chair i am your witness whether the company prosecutes me or not  and i hope that this will be some humble atonement for the trouble that i have brought you  and so a first rift of light began to shine in the dark place  but it was not broadened by the letter which he found waiting upon his breakfasttable    re farintoshs accounts  hotspur insurance office  dear siron arriving in london i came here at once and checked farintoshs accounts from the books of the head office  i am sorry to say that i find a further discrepancy of seventy pounds  i am able however to assure you that we have now touched bottom  the total amount is three hundred and forty pounds and a cheque for that sum at your early convenience would oblige us as we are anxious to bring so unpleasant a business to a conclusionyours truly  james wingfield   to which frank and maude in collaboration    dear siri note your claim for 340 pounds on account of the affairs of your agent farintosh  i am advised however that there have been certain irregularities in the matter about which i must make some investigation before paying the claimyours truly  frank crosse   to which the hotspur insurance office    sirhad your letter been a plea for more time to fulfil your engagement we should have been content to wait but since you appear disposed to dispute your liability we have no alternative but to take immediate steps to enforce payment   yours truly john waters secretary   to which frank and maude    sirmy solicitor a c r owen of 14 shirley lane ec will be happy to accept service   which is the correct legal english for you may go to the devil  but this is an anticipation  in the meantime having received the original letter and answered it frank went up to town as usual while maude played the more difficult part of waiting quietly at home  in his lunchhour frank went to see his friend and solicitor who in turn obtained leave to see the bond and came back with a grave face  you have a case said he but by no means a certainty  it all depends upon how the judge might read the document  i think that it would strengthen our case very materially if we had counsels opinion  ill copy the bond and show it to manners and have his opinion before you go back tonight  so frank went round again after officehours and found owen waiting in very low spirits for their relations were closer than those of mere solicitor and client  very sorry said he  opinion against us  dead against us  frank tried to look as if he didnt mind  let me see it  it was a long blue document with the heading the hotspur insurance company limited v frank crosse  i have perused the case submitted to me and the papers accompanying the same said the learned counsel and in my opinion the hotspur insurance company limited are entitled to recover from mr crosse under his guarantee the sum of 340 pounds being monies received by mr farintosh and not paid over by him to the said company  there was a great deal more but it was anticlimax  well what shall we do asked frank helplessly  the british law makes one feel so  well i should stand out if i were you  there is certainly a chance  look here old chap said frank i may as well be honest with you if this thing goes against me i am stony broke  i dont know where your costs are coming from  dont bother about that said owen kindly  after all manners is not infallible  let us have holland and see what he can make of it  so twentyfour hours later frank found owen radiant with another opinion in his hand  dead for us this time  look here  and he read out i have carefully considered the case submitted to me for my opinion and the documents sent therewith  in my opinion the hotspur insurance company limited are not entitled to recover against mr crosse the sum claimed by them or any part thereof as there has been a breach on their part of an essential condition of the guarantee  he reads frequently and periodically as we do continued owen glancing over the long document and he is very clear as to our case  suppose we have another and try the best of three said frank  its too expensive a game  no holland is a sound man and his opinion would weigh with any judge  i think we have enough to go on with  and you think it is safe  no no nothing is ever safe in the law  but we can make a fight of it now  and now frank was to learn what it meant to be entangled in an intricate clumsy old machine incredibly cumbrous and at the same time incredibly powerful jolting along with its absurd forms and abominable english towards an end which might or might not be just but was most certainly ruinously expensive  the game began by a direct letter from the queen of all people an honour which frank had never aspired to before and certainly never did again  victoria by the grace of god of the united kingdom of great britain and ireland queen defender of the faith remarked abruptly to frank crosse of woking in the county of surrey we command you that within eight days of the service of this writ on you inclusive of the day of such service you cause an appearance to be entered for you in an action at the suit of the hotspur insurance company limited  if he didnt do so her majesty remarked that several very unpleasant things might occur and hardinge stanley earl of halsbury corroborated her majesty  maude was frightened to death when she saw the document and felt as if unawares they must have butted up against the british constitution but owen explained that it was only a little legal firework which meant that there might be some trouble later  well at any rate said frank it means that in eight days it will all be over  owen laughed heartily at the remark  it means said he that in eight days we must promise that at some future date we will begin to make preparations for something to happen in the future  that is about the meaning of it  all you can do now is to be perfectly philosophic and leave the rest to me  but how is a man with a capital of fifty pounds going to be philosophic when he is fighting an opponent whose assets as a certain hoarding near clapham junction told him every morning exceeded three millions of pounds  he treated it lightly to maude and she to him but each suffered horribly and each was well aware of the others real feelings  sometimes there was a lull and they could almost believe that the whole thing was over  and then the old machine gave a creak and the rusty cogwheels took one more turn and they both felt the horrid thing which held them  first of all they had to enter appearances which meant that they would dispute the action  then the other side had to make an affidavit verifying their claim  then a master had to pronounce whether the action should be treated offhand or whether he would listen to what they had to say about it  he decided to listen to what was to be said  then each side claimed to see the others documents discovery they called it as if the documents were concealed and they had to hunt for them stealthily with lanterns then each made remarks about the others documents and claimed to see the remarks so made  then the lawyers of the company made a statement of their claim and when she read it maude burst into tears and said that it was all over and they must make the best of it and she should never forgive herself for that new dress in the spring  and then franks lawyer drew up a defence and when frank heard it he said why what a silly business it seems  they have not got a leg to stand upon  and so after all these flourishes and prancings the two parties did actually begin to show signs of coming to a hearing after all and a day was fixed for the trial  by a coincidence it was franks birthday  theres a good omen cried maude  the first herald of the approaching conflict was a seedy person who thrust a paper into franks hand as he emerged from the lindens in the morning  it was another letter from her majesty in which sub poena her majesty has not a gracious way of putting things in these documents mr frank crosse had to attend at the royal courts of justice strand at the sittings of the queens bench division of our high court of justice to give evidence on behalf of the hotspur company  this seemed to frank to be a most unexpected and fearsome stroke but owen simply laughed  that is mere bluff said he  it makes me think that they are weakening  they want to frighten you  they did said frank  two can play at that game  we must keep a bold front  what do you mean to do  to subpoena all their crowd  capital cried frank  so a clerk was sent across to the hotspur office with a whole bundle of subpoenas and served them liberally out  and in two days time was the day of battle    chapter xva rescue    as the day fixed for the hearing drew near ruin lived with them by day and slept with them by night  its dark shadow covered their lives and they moved in the gloom of its presence  if the trial went against them and owen in his most hopeful moods did not disguise from them that it might they would have to pay the double costs as well as the original claim  all that they possessed would not cover it  on the other hand if they won this rich company might carry the matter to a higher appeal court and so involve them in a fresh succession of anxieties and expenses  do what they would there was always danger  frank said little and he slept little also  one night just before the trial wingfield the accountant of the society came down to woking  he had managed the case all through for the directors  his visit was a sort of ultimatum  we are still ready to pay our own lawcosts said he if you will allow the original claim  i cant do that said frank doggedly  the costs are piling up at a furious rate and some one will have to pay them  i hope that it will be you  well dont say afterwards that i did not warn you  my dear crosse i assure you that you are being misled and that you have not really got a leg to stand upon  thats what the trial is about said frank  he kept a bold face to the enemy but after wingfields departure maude saw that his confidence was greatly shaken  he seemed very sure of their case said he  he would not speak like that if he did not know  but maude took quite another view  if they know that they can recover their money in court why should they send mr wingfield down in this way  he is such a good chaphe wants to save us expense  maude was less trusting  he is doing the best for his own side said she  it is his duty and we cant blame him  but if he thought it best to get behind his own lawyers and come down here then he must have some doubts about going into court  perhaps he would be willing to consider some compromise  but frank only shook his head  we have drawn the cork and we must drink the wine said he  we have gone too far to stop  any compromise which they would accept would be as much out of our power to pay as the whole sum would be and so we may just as well see it through  but for once maude did not take his opinion as final but lay awake all night and thought it over  she had determined to begin acting upon her own account and she was so eager to try what she could do that she lay longing for the morning to break  when she came down to breakfast her plan of campaign was formed  i am coming up to town with you frank  delighted to hear it dear  when she had shopping to do she frequently went up with him so it did not surprise him  what would have surprised him was to know that she had despatched three telegrams by means of jemima before he was up   to john selby 53 fenchurch street ec  will call eleven oclock important business  maude  to lieutenant selby the depot canterbury  please come up next train meet me fenchurch street eleven thirty  important  maude  to owen 14 shirley lane ec  will call twelve oclock importantmrs crosse   so she had opened her campaign  by the way frank said she as they travelled up together to morrow is your birthday  yes dear it is he answered lugubriously  dear me  what shall i give my boy for a birthday present  nothing you particularly want  i have all i want said he looking at her  oh but i think i could find something  i must look round when i am in town  she began her looking round by a visit to her father in fenchurch street  it was something new for him to get telegrams from maude upon business and he was very much surprised  looking remarkably well my dear  your appearance is a certificate of character to your husband  well and how is all at woking  i hope the second cook proved to be a success  but maude was not there for small talk  dear dad said she i want you to stand by me for i am in trouble  now my dear good dad please see things from my point of view and dont make objections and do exactly what i ask you  she threw her arms round his neck and gave him a hearty squeeze  now i call that exerting undue pressure said he extricating his white head  if this sort of thing is allowed in the city of london there is an end of all business  however his eyes twinkled and looked as if he liked it  now madame what can i do for you  im going to be perfectly businesslike said she and gave him another squeeze before sitting down  look here dad  you give me an income of fifty pounds a year dont you  my dear girl i cant raise it  jacks expenses in the hussars  i dont want you to raise it  what do you want  i seem to remember dad that you told me that this fifty pounds was the interest on a thousand pounds which was invested for me  so it isfive per cent debentures  well dad if i were content with an income of twentyfive pounds a year instead of fifty pounds then i could take five hundred pounds out of my money and nobody would be the worse  except yourself  maude laughed at that  i want the use of the money just for one day  i certainly wont need it all  i just want to feel that i have as much as that in case i need it  now my dear old daddy do please not ask any questions but be very nice and good and tell me how i can get these five hundred pounds  and you wont tell me why you want them  i had rather notbut i will if you insist  old selby looked into the brave clear eyes of his daughter and he did not insist  look here  youve got your own little banking account have you not  yes dad  thats right  never mix it up with your husbands  he scribbled a cheque  pay that in  it is for five hundred pounds  i will sell half your debentures and charge you with brokerage  i believe in strict business between relatives  when you pay back the five hundred pounds your allowance will be fifty a year once more  maude then and there endorsed the cheque and posted it to her bank then with a final embrace to her father she hastened out to further victories  jack selby was smoking a cigarette upon the doorstep  hullo maude  calling up the reserves  whats the matter  jolly lucky it wasnt my day on duty  you girls think a soldier has nothing to do  it was so once but we are all scientific blokes now no thank you i wont see the dad  hed think i had come for money and it would upset him for the day  maude took her brother in the cab with her and told him the whole story of franks misfortune with some account of her own intentions jack was vastly interested  what did dad say about it  i didnt tell him  i thought frank would rather not  quite right  he wont mind me  he knows im a bit of a business man myself  only signed a paper once in my life and quite a small paper too and i havent heard the last of it yet  the thing wasnt much bigger than a postcard but the fuss those people made afterwards  i suppose theyve been worrying frank  we have had no peace for months  worry is bad for the young  but he should not mind  he should go on fizzing like i did  now well put this thing through together maude  i see your line and ill ride it with you  they found mr owen at home and maude did the talking  i am convinced mr owen that they dont want to go into court mr wingfield coming down like that proves it  my husband is too proud to bargain with them but i have no scruples  dont you think that i might go to mr wingfield myself and pay the three hundred and forty pounds and so have done with the worry for ever  speaking as a lawyer said owen i think that it is very irregular  speaking as a man i think no harm could come of it  but i should not like you to offer the whole sum  simply say that you are prepared for a reasonable compromise and ask them to suggest what is the lowest sum which the office would accept to close the business  you leave it with me said jack winking at the lawyer  i am seeing her through  ill keep her on the rails  i am number 1 class a at business  well take em up one link in the curb if they try any games with us  come on maude and get it over  he was an excellent companion for her for his buoyancy turned the whole thing into fun  she could not take it too seriously in his company  they called at the hotspur office and asked to see mr wingfield  he was engaged but mr waters the secretary a very fat pompous man came in to them  i am very sorry said he very sorry indeed mrs crosse but it is too late for any compromise of the sort  we have our costs to consider and there is no alternative but for the case to go into court  poor maude nearly burst into tears  but suppose that we were to offer  to give you an hour to think it over cried jack  mr waters shook his head despondently  i do not think that we should alter our decision  however mr wingfield will be here presently and he will of course listen to any representations which you may have to make  in the meantime you must excuse me as i have matters of importance to attend to  why maude you little juggins cried jack when the door was shut you were just going to offer to pay their costs  i only just headed you off in time  well i was going to inquire about it  great scot its lucky youve got a business man at your elbow  i couldnt stand that chap at any price  a bit too hairy in the fetlocks for my taste  couldnt you see that he was only bluffing  how do you know jack  it was shining all over him  do you suppose a man has bought as many hairies as i have and cant tell when a dealer is bluffing  he was piling it on so that when the next christmastree comes along he may find a soft job waiting for him  i tell you you want a friendly native like me when you get into this kind of country  now ride this one on the curb and dont let him have his head for a moment  mr wingfield had entered and his manner was very different to that of the secretary  he had great sympathy with the crosses and no desire to wash the companys dirty linen in public  he was therefore more anxious than he dared to show to come to some arrangement  it is rather irregular for me to see you  i should refer you to our solicitors said he  well we saw you when you came to woking said maude  i believe that we are much more likely to come to an arrangement if we talk it over ourselves  i am sure i earnestly hope so wingfield answered  i shall be delighted to listen to anything which you may suggest  do you in the first place admit your liability  to some extent said maude if the company will admit that they are in the wrong also  well we may go so far as to say that we wish the books had been inspected more often and that we regret our misplaced confidence in our agent  that should satisfy you mrs crosse  and now that you admit some liability that is a great step in advance  we have no desire to be unreasonable but as long as no liability was admitted we had no course open to us but litigation  we now come to the crucial point which is how much liability should fall upon you  my own idea is that each should pay their own costs and that you should in addition pay over to the company  forty pounds said jack firmly  maude expected mr wingfield to rise up and leave the room  as he did not do so nor show any signs of violence she said yes forty pounds  he shook his head  dear me mrs crosse this is a very small sum  forty pounds is our offer said jack  but on what is this offer based  we have worked it out said jack and we find that forty pounds is right  mr wingfield rose from his chair  well said he of course any offer is better than no offer  i cannot say what view the directors may take of this proposal but they will hold a board meeting this afternoon and i will lay it before them  and when shall we know  i could send you round a line by hand to your solicitor  no hurry about it  quite at your own convenience said jack  when he got outside in the privacy of their hansom he was convulsed with the sense of his own achievements  class a number 1 and mentioned at the agricultural hall he cried hugging himself in his delight  his sister hugged him also so he was a muchembraced young man  am i not a man of business maude  you cant buy emyou must breed em  one shilling with the basket  i shook him in the first round and he never rallied after  you are a dear good boy  you did splendidly  thats the way to handle em  he saw that i was a real fizzer and full of blood  one business man can tell another at a glance  maude laughed for jack with his cavalry swagger and a white weal all round his sunburned face to show where his chinstrap hung looked the most unbusinesslike of mortals  why did you offer forty pounds she asked  well you have to begin somewhere  but why forty  because it is what we offer when we are buying the hairies troopers chargers you know  its a great thing to have a fixed rule in business  i never go higher than fortyrule one section one and no exceptions in the margin  they lunched together at the holborn and jack took maude afterwards to what he called a real instructive show which proved to be a horsesale at tattersalls  they then drove back to the lawyers and there they found a letter waiting addressed to mrs crosse maude tore it open  dear mrs crosse said this delightful note i am happy to be able to inform you that the directors have decided to stop the legal proceedings and to accept your offer of forty pounds in full satisfaction of all claims due against your husband  maude jack and the good owen performed a triumphant pas de trois  you have done splendidly mrs crosse splendidly cried owen  i never heard a better days work in my life  now if you will give me your cheque and wait here i will go over and settle everything  and please bring the bond back with you said maude   so it was that frank coming down upon the morning of his birthday perceived a pretty silver cigarettebox laid in front of his plate  is this for me my darling  yes frank a wee present from your wife  how sweet of you  i never saw such a lovely case  why theres something inside it  cigarettes i suppose  no it is a paper of some kind  hotspur insurance company  good lord i never seem for one instant to be able to shake that infernal thing off  how on earth did it get in there  whats thisi hereby guarantee to you  whats this  maude maude what have you been doing  dear old boy she cried as she put her arms round him  dear old boy  oh i do feel so happy    chapter xvithe browning society    it all began by mrs hunt mortimer the smart little uptodate wife of the solicitor saying to mrs beecher the young bride of the banker that in a place like woking it was very hard to get any mental friction or to escape from the same eternal grooves of thought and conversation  the same idea it seemed had occurred to mrs beecher fortified by a remark from the ladys journal that an internal intellectual life was the surest method by which a woman could preserve her youth  she turned up the articlefor the conversation occurred in her drawingroomand she read extracts from it  shakespeare as a cosmetic was the title  maude was very much struck and before they separated they had formed themselves into a literary society which should meet and discuss classical authors every wednesday afternoon at each others houses  that one hour of concentrated thought and lofty impulse should give a dignity and a tone to the whole dull provincial week  what should they read  it was well that they should decide it before they separated so as to start fair upon the next wednesday  maude suggested shakespeare but mrs hunt mortimer thought that a good deal of it was improper  does it matter said mrs beecher  we are all married  still i dont think it would be quite nice said mrs hunt mortimer  she belonged to the extreme right on matters of propriety  but surely mr bowdler made shakespeare quite respectable mrs beecher argued  he did his work very carelessly  he left in much that might be dispensed with and he omitted a good deal which was quite innocent  how do you know  because i once got two copies and read all the omissions  why did you do that asked maude mischievously  because i wanted to make sure that they had been omitted said mrs hunt mortimer severely  mrs beecher stooped and picked an invisible hairpin out of the rug mrs hunt mortimer continued  there is byron of course  but he is so very suggestive  there are passages in his works  i could never see any harm in them said mrs beecher  that is because you did not know where to look said mrs hunt mortimer  if you have a copy in the house mrs beecher i will undertake to make it abundantly clear to you that he is to be eschewed by those who wish to keep their thoughts unsullied  not  i fancy that even quoting from memory i could convince you that it is better to avoid him  pass byron said mrs beecher who was a very pretty little kittenish person with no apparent need of any cosmetics literary or otherwise  how about shelley  frank raves about shelley observed maude  mrs hunt mortimer shook her head  his work has some dreadful tendencies  he was i am informed either a theist or an atheist i cannot for the moment recall which i think that we should make our little course as improving as possible  tennyson maude suggested  i have been told that his meaning is too clear to entitle him to rank among the great thinkers of our race  the lofty thought is necessarily obscure  there is no merit in following a poem which is perfectly intelligible  which leads us to  browning cried the other ladies  exactly  we might form a little browning society of our own  charming  charming  and so it was agreed  there was only one other point to be settled at this their inaugural meeting which was to choose the other ladies who should be admitted into their literary circle  there were to be no men  they do distract one so said mrs hunt mortimer  the great thing was to admit no one save those earnest spirits who would aspire to get the full benefit from their studies  mrs fortescue could not be thought of she was much too talkative  and mrs jones had such a frivolous mind  mrs charles could think and talk of nothing but her servants  and mrs pattbeatson always wanted to lay down the law  perhaps on the whole it would be better to start the society quietly among themselves and then gradually to increase it  the first meeting should be next wednesday at mrs crosses house and mrs hunt mortimer would bring her complete two volume edition with her  mrs beecher thought that one volume would be enough just at first but mrs hunt mortimer said that it was better to have a wide choice  maude went home and told frank in the evening  he was pleased but rather sceptical  you must begin with the simpler things first said he  i should recommend herve riel and gold hair  but maude put on the charming air of displeasure which became her so well  we are serious students sir said she  we want the very hardest poem in the book  i assure you frank that one of your little faults is that you always underrate a womans intelligence  mrs hunt mortimer says that though we may be less original than men we are more assimmore assmun  assimulative  thats what i sayassimulative  now you always talk as ifoh yes you do  no you mustnt  how absurd you are frank  whenever i try to speak seriously to you you always do that and spoil everything  how would you like to discuss browning if at the end of every sentence somebody came and kissed you  you wouldnt mind  no i dare say not  but you would feel that you were not being taken seriously  wait till the next time you are in earnest about anythingyoull see   the meeting was to be at three oclock and at ten minutes to the hour mrs hunt mortimer arrived with two large brown volumes under her arm  she had come early she said because there was to be a rehearsal of the amateur theatricals at the dixons at a quarterpast four  mrs beecher did not appear until five minutes after the hour her cook had quarrelled with the housemaid and given instantaneous notice with five people coming to dinner on saturday  it had upset the lady very much and she explained that she would not have come if she had not promised  it was so difficult to follow poetry when you were thinking about the entree all the time  why the entree asked mrs hunt mortimer looking up from the book which she held open in front of her  my dear said mrs beecher who had the art of saying the most simple things as if they were profoundly confidential secretsmy dear my parlourmaid is really an excellent cook and i shall rely upon her if martha really goes  but she is limited very limited and entrees and savouries are the two things in which i cannot entirely trust her  i must therefore find some dish which is well within her capacity  mrs hunt mortimer prided herself upon her housekeeping so the problem interested her  maude also began to feel the meeting less dull than she had expected  of course there are many things to be considered said mrs hunt mortimer with the air of a qc giving an opinion  oyster patties or oyster volauvents  oysters are out of season said maude  i was about to say mrs hunt mortimer continued with admirable presence of mind that these entrees of oysters are inadmissible because they are out of season  now curried prawns  my husband loathes them  well well  what do you say to sweetbreads en caisse  all you want are chopped mushrooms shalots parsley nutmeg pepper salt breadcrumb bacon fat  no no cried mrs beecher despairingly  anne would never remember all that  cutlets a la constance said mrs hunt mortimer  i am sure that they are simple enough  cutlets butter fowls livers cocks combs mushrooms  my dear my dear remember that she is only a parlourmaid  it is unreasonable  ragout of fowl chicken patties croquettes of veal with a little browning  weve got back to browning after all cried maude  dear me said mrs beecher it is all my fault and i am so sorry now mrs hunt mortimer do please read us a little of that delightful poetry  you can always get small entrees sent down from the stores cried maude as a happy thought  you dear good girl how sweet of you to think of it  of course one can  that is really an admirable idea  there now we may consider the entree as being removed so we proceed to  the piece de resistance said mrs hunt mortimer solemnly glancing down the index of the first volume  i confess that my acquaintance with the poet has up to now been rather superficial  our ambition must be to so master him that he becomes from this time forward part and parcel of ourselves  i fancy that the difficulties in understanding him have been very much exaggerated and that with goodwill and perseverance we shall manage to overcome them  it was a relief to mrs beecher and to maude to realise that mrs hunt mortimer knew no more about the matter than themselves  they both ventured upon a less diffident air now that it was clear that it might be done in safety  maude frowned thoughtfully and mrs beecher cast up her pretty brown eyes at the curtainrod as if she were running over in her memory the whole long catalogue of the poets works  i will tell you what we should do said she  we must make a vow that we shall never pass a line until we understand it  we will go over it again and again until we grasp its meaning  what an excellent idea cried maude with one of her little bursts of enthusiasm  now that is really splendid mrs beecher  my friends always call me nellie said the little brunette  how nice of you to say so  i should love to call you so if you dont mind  it is such a pretty name too  only you must call me maude  you look like a maude said mrs beecher  i always picture a maude as bright and pretty and blonde  isnt it strange how names associate themselves with characters  mary is always domestic and rose is a flirt and elizabeth is dutiful and evelyn is dashing and alice is colourless and helen is masterful  and matilda is impatient said mrs hunt mortimer laughing matilda has reason to be seated here with an index in front of her while you two are exchanging compliments  why we were waiting for you to begin said mrs beecher reproachfully  do let us have something for really the time is slipping away  it would be a pity to begin at the beginning because that represents his immature genius remarked mrs hunt mortimer  i think that on this the opening day of the society we should have the poet at his best  how are we to know which is his best maude asked  i should be inclined to choose something with a title which suggests profunditya pretty woman love in a life any wife to any husband  oh what did she say to him cried maude  well i was about to say that all these subjects rather suggested frivolity  besides it really is a very absurd title remarked mrs beecher who was fond of generalising from her six months experience of matrimony  a husband to a wife would be intelligible but how can you know what any husband would say to any wife  no one can really foretell what a man will do  they really are such extraordinary creatures  but mrs hunt mortimer had been married for five years and felt as competent to lay down the law about husbands as about entrees  when you have had a larger experience of them dear you will find that there is usually a reason or at least a primitive instinct of some sort at the root of their actions  but seriously we must really concentrate our attention upon the poet for my other engagement will call me away at four which only leaves me ten minutes to reach maybury  mrs beecher and maude settled down with anxious attention upon their faces  do please go on they cried  here is the pied piper of hamelin  now that interests me more than i can tell cried maude with her eyes shining with pleasure  do please read us everything there is about that dear piper  why so asked her two companions  well the fact is said maude frankmy husband you knowcame to a fancydress at st albans as the pied piper  i had no idea that it came from browning  how did he dress for it asked mrs beecher  we are invited to the astons dress ball and i want something suitable for george  it was a most charming dress  red and black all over something like mephistopheles you know and a peaked hat with a bell at the top  then he had a flute of course and a thin wire from his waist with a stuffed rat at the end of it  a rat  how horrid  well that was the story you know  the rats all followed the pied piper and so this rat followed frank  he put it in his pocket when he danced but once he forgot and so it got stood upon and the sawdust came out all over the floor  mrs hunt mortimer was also invited to the dress ball and her thoughts flew away from the book in front of her  how did you go mrs crosse she asked  i went as night  what you with your brown hair  well father said that i was not a very dark night  i was in black you know just my ordinary black silk dinnerdress  then i had a silver halfmoon over my head and black veils round my hair and stars all over my bodice and skirt with a long comet right across the front  father upset a cup of milk over me at supper and said afterwards that it was the milky way  it is simply maddening how men will make jokes about the most important subjects said mrs hunt mortimer  but i have no doubt dear that your dress was an exceedingly effective one  now for my own part i had some idea of going as the duchess of devonshire  charming cried mrs beecher and maude  it is not a very difficult costume you know  i have some old point dalencon lace which has been in the family for a century  i make it the startingpoint of my costume  the gown need not be very elaborate  silk asked mrs beecher  well i thought that perhaps a whiteflowered brocade  oh yes with pearl trimming  no no dear with my lace for trimming  of course  you said so  and then a muslin fichu coming over here  how perfectly sweet cried maude  and the waist cut high and ruffles at the sleeves  and of course a picture hatyou know what i meanwith a curling ostrich feather  powdered hair of course said mrs beecher  powdered in ringlets  it will suit you admirablybeautifully  you are tall enough to carry it off and you have the figure also  how i wish i was equally certain about my own  what had you thought of dear  well i had some idea about ophelia  do you think that it would do  certainly  had you worked it out at all  well my dear said mrs beecher relapsing into her pleasant confidential manner  i had some views but of course i should be so glad to have your opinion about it  i only saw hamlet once and the lady was dressed in white with a gauzy light nunsveiling over it  i thought that with white pongee silk as an underdress and then some sort of delicate  crepe de chine maude suggested  but in ophelias day such a thing had never been heard of said mrs hunt mortimer  a net of silver thread  exactly cried mrs beecher with some sort of jewelling upon it that was just what i had imagined  of course it should be cut classically and drapedmy dressmaker is such a treasureand i should have a gold embroidery upon the white silk  crewel work said maude  or a plain crossstitch pattern  then a tiara of pearls on the head  shakespeare  at the name of the poet their three consciences pricked simultaneously  they looked at each other and then at the clock with dismay  we mustwe really must go on with our reading cried mrs hunt mortimer  how did we get talking about these dresses  it was my fault said mrs beecher looking contrite  no dear it was mine said maude  you remember it all came from my saying that frank had gone to the ball as the pied piper  i am going to read the very first poem that i open said mrs hunt mortimer remorselessly  i am afraid that it is almost time that i started but we may still be able to skim over a few pages  now then  there  setebos  what a funny name  what does it mean asked maude  we shall find out no doubt as we proceed said mrs hunt mortimer  we shall take it line by line and draw the full meaning from it  the first line is    will sprawl now that the heat of day is best   who will asked mrs beecher  i dont know  thats what it says  the next line will explain no doubt   flat on his   dear me i had no idea that browning was like this  do read it dear  i couldnt possibly think of doing so  with your permission we will pass on to the next paragraph  but we vowed not to skip  but why read what cannot instruct or elevate us  let us begin this next stanza and hope for something better  the first line isi wonder if it really can be as it is written  do please read it   setebos and setebos and setebos   the three students looked sadly at each other  this is worse than anything i could have imagined said the reader  we mast skip that line  but we are skipping everything  its a persons name said mrs beecher  or three persons  no only one i think  but why should he repeat it three times  for emphasis  perhaps said mrs beecher it was mr setebos and mrs setebos and a little setebos  now if you are going to make fun i wont read  but i think we were wrong to say that we would take it line by line  it would be easier sentence by sentence  quite so  then we will include the next line which finishes the sentence  it is thinketh he dwelleth in the cold of the moon  then it was only one setebos cried maude  so it appears  it is easy to understand if one will only put it into ordinary language  this person setebos was under the impression that his life was spent in the moonlight  but what nonsense it is cried mrs beecher  mrs hunt mortimer looked at her reproachfully  it is very easy to call everything which we do not understand nonsense said she  i have no doubt that browning had a profound meaning in this  what was it then  mrs hunt mortimer looked at the clock  i am very sorry to have to go said she but really i have no choice in the matter  just as we were getting on so nicelyit is really most vexatious  youll come to my house next wednesday mrs crosse wont you  and you also mrs beecher  goodbye and thanks for such a pleasant afternoon  but her skirts had hardly ceased to rustle in the passage before the browning society had been dissolved by a twothirds vote of the total membership  what is the use cried mrs beecher  two lines have positively made my head ache and there are two volumes  we must change our poet  his verbosity cried mrs beecher  his setebosity cried maude  and dear mrs hunt mortimer pretending to like him  shall we propose tennyson next week  it would be far better  but tennyson is quite simple is he not  perfectly  then why should we meet to discuss him if there is nothing to discuss  you mean that we might as well each read him for herself  i think it would be easier  why of course it would  and so after one hour of precarious life mrs hunt mortimers mutual improvement society for the elucidation of browning came to an untimely end    chapter xviian investment    i want your advice maude  she was looking very sweet and fresh in the morning sunlight  she wore a flowered french print blouselittle sprigs of roses on a white backgroundand a lace frill round her pretty white smooth throat  the buckle of her brown leather belt just gleamed over the edge of the tablecloth  in front of her were a litter of correspondence a white cup of coffee and two empty eggshellsfor she was a perfectly healthy young animal with an excellent appetite  well dear what is it  i shall take the later train  then i need not hurry and can walk down at my ease  how nice of you  i am not sure that dinton will think so  only one little hour of differencewhat can it matter  they dont run offices on those lines  an hour means a good deal in the city of london  oh i do hate the city of london  it is the only thing which ever comes between us  i suppose that it separates a good many loving couples every morning  he had come across and an eggcup had been upset  then he had been scolded and they sat together laughing upon the sofa  when he had finished admiring her little shining patentleather louis shoes and the two charming curves of openwork black stocking she reminded him that he had asked for her advice  yes dear what was it  she knitted her brows and tried to look as her father did when he considered a matter of business  but then her father was not hampered by having a young mans arm round his neck it is so hard to be businesslike when any one is curling ones hair round his finger  i have some money to invest  o frank how clever of you  it is only fifty pounds  never mind dear it is a beginning  that is what i feel  it is the foundationstone of our fortunes and so i want her majesty to lay itmustnt wrinkle your brow thoughthat is not allowed  but it is a great responsibility frank  yes we must not lose it  no dear we must not lose it  suppose we invest it in one of those modern fiftyguinea pianos  our dear old broadwood was an excellent piano when i was a girl but it is getting so squeaky in the upper notes  perhaps they would allow us something for it  he shook his head  i know that we want one very badly dear  and such a musician as you are should have the best instrument that money can buy  i promise you that when we have a little to turn round on you shall have a beauty  but in the meantime we must not buy anything with this moneyi mean nothing for ourselveswe must invest it  we cannot tell what might happen  i might fall ill  i might die  o frank how horrid you are this morning  well we have to be ready for anything  so i want to put this where we can get it on an emergency and where in the meantime it will bring us some interest  now what shall we buy  papa always bought a house  but we have not enough  not a little house  no not the smallest  a mortgage then  the sum is too small  government stock frankif you think it is safe  oh it is safe enough  but the interest is so low  how much should we get  well i suppose the fifty pounds would bring us in about thirty shillings a year  thirty shillings  o frank  rather less than more  fancy a great rich nation like ours taking our fifty pounds and treating us like that  how mean of them  dont let them have it frank  no i wont  if they want it they can make us a fair offer for it  i think well try something else  well they have only themselves to thank  but you have some plan in your head frank  what is it  he brought the morning paper over from the table  then he folded it so as to bring the financial columns to the top  i saw a fellow in the city yesterday who knows a great deal about goldmining  i only had a few minutes talk but he strongly advised me to have some shares in the el dorado proprietary gold mine  what a nice name  i wonder if they would let us have any  oh yes they are to be bought in the open market  it is like this maude  the mine was a very good one and paid handsome dividends then it had some misfortunes  first there was no water and then there was too much water and the workings were flooded  so of course the price of the shares fell  now they are getting the mine all right again but the shares are still low  it certainly seems a very good chance to pick a few of them up  are they very dear frank  i looked them up in the mining register before i came home yesterday  the original price of each share was ten shillings but as they have had these misfortunes one would expect to find them rather lower  ten shillings  it does not seem much to pay for a share in a thing with a name like that  here it is said he pointing with a pencil to one name in a long printed list  this one between the royal bonanza and the alabaster consols  you seeel dorado proprietary  then after it you have printed 4754875  i dont profess to know much about these things but that of course means the price  yes dear it is printed at the top of the columnyesterdays prices  quito so  well we know that the original price of each share was ten shillings and of course they must have dropped with a flood in the mine so that these figures must mean that the price yesterday was four shillings and ninepence or thereabouts  what a clear head for business you have dear  i think we cant do wrong in buying at that price  you see with our fifty pounds we could buy two hundred of them and then if they went up again we could sell and take our profit  how delightful  but suppose they dont go up  well they cant go down  i should not think that a share at four shillings and ninepence could go down very much  there is no room but it may go up to any extent  besides your friend said that they would go up  yes he seemed quite confident about it  well what do you think maude  is it good enough or not  o frank i hardly dare advise you  just imagine if we were to lose it all  do you think it would be wiser to get a hundred shares and then we could buy twentyfive pounds worth of royal bonanza as well it would be impossible for them both to go wrong  the royal bonanza shares are dear and then we have had no information about it  i think we had better back our own opinion  all right frank  then that is settled  i have a telegraphform here  could you not buy them yourself when you are in town  no you cant buy things yourself  you have to do it through a broker  i always thought a broker was a horrid man who came and took your furniture away  ah thats another kind of broker  he comes afterwards  i promised harrison that he should have any business which i could put in his way so here goes  how is that    harrison 13a throgmorton street ecbuy two hundred el dorado proprietaries  crosse woking   doesnt it sound rather peremptory frank  no no that is mere business  i hope he wont be offended  i think i can answer for that  you have not said the price  one cannot say the price because one does not know it  you see it is always going up and down  by this time it may be a little higher or a little lower than yesterday  there cannot be much change that is certain  great scot maude it is tenfifteen  three and a half minutes for a quarter of a mile  goodbye darling  i just love you in that bodice  o lordgoodbye   well has anything happened  yes you have come back  oh i am so glad to see you you dear old boy  take care of that window darling  oh my goodness i hope he didnt see  no its all right  he was looking the other way  we have the gold shares all right  harrison has telegraphed  yes here it is    crosse the lindens wokingbought two hundred el dorados at 475  harrison   that is capital  i rather expected to see harrison in the train  i shouldnt be surprised if he calls on his way from the station  he has to pass our door you know on his way to maybury  he is sure to call  what are you holding there  its a paper  what paper  who is it who talks about womans curiosity  let me see it  well sir if you must know it is the financial whisper  where in the world did you get it  i knew that the montresors took a financial paper  i remember mrs montresor saying once how dreadfully dry it was  so when you were gone i sent jemima round and borrowed it and i have read it right through to see if there was anything about our mine in itour mine frank does it not sound splendid  well is there anything  she clapped her hands with delight  yes there is  this prosperous mine that is what it says  look here it is under the heading of australian notes she held out the paper and pointed but his face fell as he looked  o maude its preposterous  what is preposterous  the word is preposterous and not prosperousthis preposterous mine  frank  she turned her face away  never mind dear  whats the odds  o frank our first investmentour fifty pounds  and to think that i should have kept the paper as a surprise for you  well the print is a little slurred and it was a very natural mistake  after all the paper may be wrong  oh dont maude please dont  its not worth itall the gold on the earth is not worth it theres a sweet girlie  now are you better  oh damn those open curtains  a tall and brisk young man with a glossy hat was coming through the garden  an instant later jemima had ushered him in  hullo harrison  how do you do crosse  how are you mrs crosse  how do you do  ill just order tea if you will excuse me  ordering tea seemed to involve a good deal of splashing water  maude came back with a merrier face  is this a good paper mr harrison  what is it  financial whisper  no the most venal rag in the city  oh i am so glad  why  well you know we bought some shares today and it calls our mine a preposterous one  oh is that all  who cares what the financial whisper says  it would call the bank of england a preposterous institution if it thought it could bear consols by doing so  its opinion is not worth a halfpenny  by the way crosse it was about those shares that i called  i thought you might  i have only just got back myself and i saw by your wire that you had bought them all right  yes i thought i had better let you have your contract at once settling day is on monday you know  all right  thank you  i will let you have a cheque  whatwhats this  the contract had been laid face upwards upon the table  frank crosses face grew whiter and his eyes larger as he stared at it  it ran in this way    13a throgmorton street  bought for francis crosse esq  subject to the specific rules and regulations of the stock exchange                           pounds 200 el dorado proprietaries at 475    950   0   0 stamps and fees                          4  17   6 commission                               7  10   0                                        962   7   6  for the 7th inst   i fancy there is some mistake here harrison said he speaking with a very dry pair of lips  a mistake  yes this is not at all what i expected  o frank  nearly a thousand pounds gasped maude  harrison glanced from one of them to the other  he saw that the matter was serious  i am very sorry if there has been any mistake  i tried to obey your instructions  you wanted two hundred el dorados did you not  yes at four and ninepence  four and ninepence  they are four pound fifteen each  but i read that they were only ten shillings originally and that they had been falling  yes they have been falling for months  but they were as high as ten pounds once  they are down at four pound fifteen now  why on earth could the paper not say so  when a fraction is used it always means a fraction of a pound  good heavens  and i have to find this sum before monday  monday is settling day  i cant do it harrison  it is impossible  then there is the obvious alternative  no i had rather die  i will never go bankruptnever  harrison began to laugh and then turned stonily solemn as he met a pair of reproachful grey eyes  it strikes me that you have not done much at this game crosse  never beforeand by heaven never again  you take it much too hard  when i spoke of an alternative i never dreamed of bankruptcy  all you have to do is to sell your stock to morrow morning and pay the difference  can i do that  rather  why not  what would the difference be  harrison took an evening paper from his pocket  we deal in rails chiefly and i dont profess to keep in touch with the mining market well find the quotation here  by jove  he whistled between his teeth  well said frank and felt his wifes little warm palm fall upon his hand under the table  the difference is in your favour  in my favour  yes listen to this  the mining markets both the south african and the australian opened dull but grew more animated as the day proceeded prices closing at the best  out crops upon the rand mark a general advance of onesixteenth to oneeighth  the chief feature in the australian section was a sharp advance of fiveeighths in el dorados upon a telegram that the workings had been pumped dry crosse i congratulate you  i can really sell them for more than i gave  i should think so  you have two hundred of them and a profit of ten shillings on each  maude well have the whisky and the soda  harrison you must have a drink  why thats a hundred pounds  more than a hundred  without my paying anything  not a penny  when does the exchange open tomorrow  the rattle goes at eleven  well be there at eleven harrison  sell them at once  you wont hold on and watch the market  no noi wont have an easy moment until they are sold  all right my boy  you can rely upon me  you will get a cheque for your balance on tuesday or wednesday  good evening  i am so glad that it has all ended well  and the joke of it is maude said her husband after they had talked over the whole adventure from the beginning  the joke of it is that we have still to find an investment for our original fifty pounds  i am inclined to put it into consols after all  well said maude perhaps it would be the patriotic thing to do  two days later the poor old broadwood with the squeaky treble and the wheezy bass was banished for ever from the lindens and there arrived in its place a ninetyfiveguinea cottage grand all dark walnut and gilding with notes in it so deep and rich and resonant that maude could sit before it by the hour and find music enough in simply touching one here and one there and listening to the soft sweet reverberant tones which came swelling from its depths  her el dorado piano she called it and tried to explain to lady visitors how her husband had been so clever at business that he had earned it in a single day  as she was never very clear in her own mind how the thing had occurred she never succeeded in explaining it to any one else but a vague and solemn impression became gradually diffused abroad that young mr frank crosse was a very remarkable man and that he had done something exceedingly clever in the matter of an australian mine    chapter xviiia thundercloud    blue skies and shining sun but far down on the horizon one dark cloud gathers and drifts slowly upwards unobserved  frank crosse was aware of its shadow when coming down to breakfast he saw an envelope with a wellremembered handwriting beside his plate  how he had loved that writing once how his heart had warmed and quickened at the sight of it how eagerly he had read itand now a viper coiled upon the white tablecloth would hardly have given him a greater shock  contradictory incalculable whimsical life  a year ago how scornfully he would have laughed what contemptuous unbelief would have filled his soul if he had been told that any letter of hers could have struck him cold with the vague apprehension of coming misfortune  he tore off the envelope and threw it into the fire but before he could glance at the letter there was the quick patter of his wifes feet upon the stair and she burst full of girlish health and high spirits into the little room  she wore a pink crepon dressinggown with cream guipure lace at the neck and wrists pink ribbon outlined her trim waist  the morning sun shone upon her and she seemed to him to be the daintiest sweetest tiling upon earth  he had thrust his letter into his pocket as she entered  you will excuse the dressinggown frank  i just love you in it  no you mustnt pass  now you can go  i was so afraid that you would breakfast without me that i had no time to dress  i shall have the whole day to finish in when you are gone  there nowjemima has forgotten to warm the plates again  and your coffee is cold  i wish you had not waited  better cold coffee with maudes society  i always thought men gave up complimenting their wives after they married them  i am so glad you dont  i think on the whole that womens ideas of men are unfair and severe  the reason is that the women who have met unpleasant men run about and make a noise but the women who are happy just keep quiet and enjoy themselves  for example i have not time to write a book explaining to every one how nice frank crosse is but if he were nasty my life would be empty and so of course i should write my book  i feel such a fraud when you talk like that  that is part of your niceness  oh dont maude  it really hurts me  why frank what is the matter with you today  nothing dear  oh yes there is  i can tell easily  perhaps i am not quite myself  no i am sure that you are not  i believe that you have a cold coming on  o frank do take some ammoniated quinine  good heavens no  please  please  my dear girlie there is nothing the matter with me  but it is such splendid stuff  yes i know  but really i dont want it  have you had any letters frank  yes one  anything important  i have hardly glanced at it yet  glance at it now  oh i will keep it for the train  goodbye dearest  it is time that i was off  if you would only take the ammoniated quinine  you men are so proud and obstinate  goodbye darling  eight hours and then i shall begin to live again  he had a quiet corner of a carriage to himself so he unfolded his letter and read it  then he read it again with frowning brows and compressed lips  it ran in this way    my dearest frankiei suppose that i should not address you like this now that you are a good little married man but the force of custom is strong and after all i knew you long before she did  i dont suppose you were aware of it but there was a time when i could very easily have made you marry me in spite of all you may know about my trivial life and adventures but i thought it all over very carefully and i came to the conclusion that it was not good enough you were always a dear good chap yourself but your prospects were not quite dashing enough for your festive violet  i believe in a merry time even if it is a short one  but if i had really wanted to settle down in a humdrum sort of way you are the man whom i should have chosen out of the whole batch of them  i hope what i say wont make you conceited for one of your best points used to be your modesty  but for all that my dear frankie i by no means give you up altogether and dont you make any mistake about that  it was only yesterday that i saw charlie scott and he told me all about you and gave me your address  dont you bless him  and yet i dont know perhaps you have still a kindly thought of your old friend and would like to see her  but you are going to see her whether you like or not my dear boy so make up your mind to that  you know how you used to chaff me about my whims  well ive got a whim now and ill have my way as usual i am going to see you tomorrow and if you wont see me under my conditions in london i shall call at woking in the evening  oh my goodness what a bombshell  but you know that i am always as good as my word  so look out  now ill give you your orders for the day and dont you forget them tomorrow thursday 14th no excuses about the date you will leave your office at 330  i know that you can when you like  you will drive to marianis and you will find me at the door  we shall go up to our old private room and we shall have tea together and a dear old chat about all sorts of things  so come  but if you dont there is a train which leaves waterloo at 610 and reaches woking at 7  i will come by it and be just in time for dinner  what a joke it will be  goodbye old boy  i hope your wife does not read your letters or this will rather give her fits   yours as ever violet wright   at the first reading this letter filled him with anger  to be wooed by a very pretty woman is pleasant even to the most austere of married men and never again trust the one who denies it but to be wooed with a very dangerous threat mixed up with the wooing is no such pleasant experience  and it was no empty threat  violet was a woman who prided herself upon being as good as her word  she had laughingly said with her accustomed frankness upon one occasion that it was her sole remaining virtue  if he did not go to marianis she would certainly come to woking  he shuddered to think of maude being annoyed by her  it was one thing to speak in a general way to his wife of prematrimonial experiences and it was another to have this woman forcing herself upon her and making a scene  the idea was so vulgar  the sweet pure atmosphere of the lindens would never be the same again  no there was no getting out of it  he must go to marianis  he was sufficiently master of himself to know that no harm could come of that  his absolute love for his wife shielded him from all danger the very thought of infidelity nauseated him  and then as the idea became more familiar to him other emotions succeeded that of anger there was an audacity about his old flame a spirit and devilment which appealed to his sporting instincts  besides it was complimentary to him and flattering to his masculine vanity that she should not give him up without a struggle  merely as a friend it would not be disagreeable to see her again  before he had reached clapham junction his anger had departed and by the time that he arrived at waterloo he was surprised to find himself looking forward to the interview  marianis is a quiet restaurant famous for its lachryma christi spumante and situated in the network of sombre streets between drury lane and covent garden  the fact of its being in a bystreet was not unfavourable to its particular class of business  its customers were very free from the modern vice of selfadvertisement and would even take some trouble to avoid publicity  nor were they gregarious or luxurious in their tastes  a small simple apartment was usually more to their taste than a crowded salon and they were even prepared to pay a higher sum for it  it was five minutes to four when frank arrived and the lady had not yet appeared  he stood near the door and waited  presently a hansom rattled into the narrow street and there she sat framed in its concavity  a pretty woman never looks prettier than in a hansom with the shadows behind to give their rembrandt effect to the face in front  she raised a yellow kid hand and flashed a smile at him  just the same as ever said she as he handed her down  so are you  so glad you think so  i am afraid i cant quite agree with you thirtyfour yesterday  its simply awful  thank you i have some change  all right cabby  well have you got a room  no  but youll come  oh yes i should like to have a chat  the cleanshaven roundfaced manager a man of suave voice and diplomatic manner was standing in the passage  his strange life was spent in standing in the passage  he remembered the pair at once and smiled paternally  not seen you for some time sir  no i have been engaged  married said the lady  dear me said the proprietor  tea sir  and muffins  you used to like the muffins  oh yes muffins by all means  number ten said the proprietor and a waiter showed them upstairs all meals nine shillings each he whispered as frank passed him at the door  he was a new waiter and so mistook every one for a new customer which is an error which runs through life  it was a dingy little room with a round table covered by a soiled cloth in the middle  two windows discreetly blinded let in a dim london light  an armchair stood at each side of the empty fireplace and an uncomfortable oldfashioned horsehair sofa lined the opposite wall  there were pink vases upon the mantelpiece and a portrait of garibaldi above it  the lady sat down and took off her gloves  frank stood by the window and smoked a cigarette  the waiter rattled and banged and jingled with the final effect of producing a teatray and a hotwater dish youll ring if you want me sir said he and shut the door with ostentatious completeness  now we can talk said frank throwing his cigarette into the fireplace  that waiter was getting on my nerves  i say i hope youre not angry  what at  well my saying i should come down to woking and all that  i should have been angry if i thought you had meant it  oh i meant it right enough  but with what object  just to get level with you frankie if you threw me over too completely  hang it all she has three hundred and sixtyfive days in the year  am i to be grudged a single hour  well violet we wont quarrel about it  you see i came all right pull up your chair and have some tea  you havent even looked at me yet  i wont take any tea until you do  she stood up in front of him and pushed up her veil  it was a face and a figure worth looking at  hazel eyes dark chestnut hair a warm flush of pink in her cheeks the features and outline of an old grecian goddess but with more of juno than of venus for she might perhaps err a little upon the side of opulence  there was a challenge and defiance dancing in those dark devilmaycare eyes of hers which might have roused a more coldblooded man than her companion  her dress was simple and dark but admirably cut  she was clever enough to know that a pretty woman should concentrate attention upon herself and a plain one divert it to her adornments  well  by jove violet you look splendid  well  the muffins are getting cold  frankie what is the matter with you  nothing is the matter  well  she put out her two hands and took hold of his  that wellremembered sweet subtle scent of hers rose to his nostrils  there is nothing more insidious than a scent which carries suggestions and associations  frankie you have not kissed me yet  she turned her smiling face upwards and sideways and for an instant he leaned forward towards it  but he had himself in hand again in a moment  it gave him confidence to find how quickly and completely he could do it  with a laugh still holding her two hands he pushed her back into the chair by the table  theres a good girl said he  now well have some tea and ill give you a small lecture while we do so  you are a nice one to give lectures  oh theres no such preacher as a converted sinner  you really are converted then  rather  two lumps if i remember right  you ought to do this not i  no milk and very stronghow you keep your complexion i cant imagine  but you do keep it my word you do  now please dont look so crossly at me  her flushed cheeks and resentful eyes had drawn forth the remonstrance  you are changed she said with surprise as well as anger in her voice  why of course i am  i am married  for that matter charlie scott is married  dont give charlie scott away  i think i give myself away  so you have lost all your love for me i thought it was to last for ever  now do be sensible violet  sensible  how i loathe that word  a man only uses it when he is going to do something coldblooded and mean  it is always the beginning of the end  what do you want me to do  i want you to be my own frankiejust the same as before  ah do franckdont leave me  you know i would give any of them up for you  and you have a good influence over meyou have really  you callt think how hard i am with other people  ask charlie scott  he will tell you  ive been so different since i have lost sight of you  now frankie dont be horrid to me  kiss and be nice  again her soft warm hand was upon his and the faint sweet smell of violets went to his blood like wine  he jumped up lit another cigarette and paced about the room  you shant have a cigarette frankie  why not  because you said once it helped you to control yourself  i dont want you to control yourself  i want you to feel as i feel  do sit down like a good girl  cigarette out  dont be absurd violet  come out with it sir  no no leave it alone  she had snatched it from his lips and thrown it into the grate  what is the use of that  i have a case full  they shall all follow the first  well then i wont smoke  ill see that you dont  well what the better are you for that  now be nice  go back to your chair and have some more tea  oh bother the tea  well i wont speak to you unless you sit down and behave yourself  there now  speak away  look here dear violet you must not talk about this any more  some things are possible and some are impossible  this is absolutely finally impossible  we can never go back upon the past  it is finished and done with  then what did you come here for  to bid you goodbye  a platonic goodbye  of course  in a private room at marianis  why not  she laughed bitterly  you were always a little mad frankie  he leaned earnestly over the table  look here violet the chances are that we shall never meet again  it takes two to say that  well i mean that after today i should not meet you again  if you were not quite what you are it would be easier  but as it is i find it a little too much of a test  no dont mistake me or think that i am weakening  that is impossible  but all the same i dont want to go through it again  so sorry if i have upset you  he disregarded her irony  we have been very good friends violet  why should we part as enemies  why should we part at all  we wont go back over that  now do please look facts in the face and help me to do the right thing for it would be so much easier if you would help me  if you were a very good and kind girl you would shake my hand like any other old pal and wish me joy of my marriage  you know that i should do so if i knew that you were going to be married  but the lady was not to be so easily appeased  she took her tea in silence or answered his remarks with monosyllables while the occasional flash of her dark eyes as she raised them was like the distant lightning which heralds the storm  suddenly with a swift rustle of skirts she was between the door and his chair  now frankie we have had about enough of this nonsense said she dont imagine that you are going to get out of this thing so easily ive got you and ill keep you  he faced round in his chair and looked helplessly at her with a hand upon each knee  o lord  dont begin it all over again said he  no i wont she answered with an angry laugh  ill try another line this time master frank  im not the sort of woman who lets a thing go easily when once i have set my heart upon it  i wont try coaxing any longer  so glad he murmured  you may say what you like but you cant do it my boy  i knew you before she did and ill keep you or else ill make such a row that you will be sorry that you ever put my back up  its all very fine to sit there and preach but it wont do frankie  you cant slip out of things as easily as all that  why should you turn nasty like this violet  what do you think you will gain by it  i mean to gain you  i like you frankie  im not sure that i dont really love youreal real love you know  any way i dont intend to let you go and if you go against my will i give you my word that i shall make it pretty sultry for you down at woking  he stared moodily into his teacup  besides what rot it all is she continued laying her hand upon his shoulder  when did you begin to ride the high moral horse  you were just as cheerful as the rest of them when last i saw you  you speak as if a man ceased to live just because he is married  what has changed you  ill tell you what has changed me said he looking up  my wife has changed me  oh bother your wife  a look which was new to her came over his face  stop that said he sharply  oh no harm  how has your wife made this wonderful change  his mood softened as his thoughts flew back to woking  by her own goodnessthe atmosphere that she makes round her  if you knew how wholesome she was how delicate in her most intimate thoughts how fresh and how sweet and how pure you would understand that the thought of being false to her is horrible  when i think of her as she sat at breakfast this morning so loving and so innocent   he would have been more discreet if he had been less eloquent  the ladys temper suddenly overflowed  innocent she cried  as innocent as i am  he sprang to his feet with eyes which were more angry than her own  hold your tongue  how dare you talk against my wife  you are not fit to mention her name  ill go to woking she gasped  you can go to the devil said he and rang the bell for his bill she stared at him with a surprise which had eclipsed her anger while she pulled on her gloves with little sharp twitches  this was a new frank crosse to her  as long as a woman gets on very well with a man she is apt at the back of her soul to suspect him of weakness it is only when she differs from him that she can see the other side and it always comes as a surprise  she liked him better than ever for the revelation  im not joking she whispered as they went down the stair  ill go as sure as fate  he took no notice but passed on down the street without a word of farewell  when he came to the turning he looked back  she was standing by the curb with her proud head high in the air while the manager screamed loudly upon a whistle  a cab swung round a distant corner  crosse reached her before it did  i hope i havent hurt your feelings said he  i spoke too roughly  trying to coax me away from woking she sneered  im coming all the same  thats your affair said he as he handed her into the cab    chapter xixdanger    again the bright little diningroom with the morning sun gleaming upon the high silver coffee pot and the electroplated toastrack everything the same down to the plates which jemima had once again forgotten to warm  maude with the golden light playing upon the fringes of her curls and throwing two little epaulettes of the daintiest pink across her shoulders sat in silence glancing across from time to time with interrogative eyes at her husband  he ate his breakfast moodily for he was very ill at ease  there was a struggle within him for his conscience was pulling him one way and his instincts the other  instincts are a fine old conservative force while conscience is a thing of yesterday so it is usually safe to prophesy which will sway the other  the matter at issue was whether he should tell maude about violet wright  if she were going to carry out her threat then certainly it would be better to prepare her  but after all his arguments of yesterday might prevail with her when her first impetuous fit of passion was over  why should he go halfway to meet danger  if it came nothing which he could say would ward it off  if it did not come there was no need for saying anything  conscience told him that it would be better to be perfectly straight with his wife instinct told him that though she would probably be sweet and sympathetic over it yet it would rankle in her mind and poison her thoughts  and perhaps for once instinct may have been better than conscience  do not ask too many questions you young wife  do not be too free with your reminiscences you young husband  there are things which can be forgiven but never never can they be forgotten  that highest thing on earth the heart of a loving woman is too tender too sacred to be bruised by a wanton confidence  you are hers  she is yours  the future lies with both of you  it is wiser to leave the past alone  the couples who boast that they have never had a secret are sometimes happy because the boast is sometimes untrue  you wont be late today frank said maude at last peeping round the tall coffeepot  no dear i wont  you were yesterday you know  yes i know i was  were you kept at the office  no i had tea with a friend  at his house  no no at a restaurant  where has jemima put my boots  i wonder if she has cleaned them  i can never tell by looking  here they are  and my coat  anything i can get you in town  well goodbye dear goodbye  maude had never seen him make so hurried an exit  it is always a mystery to the city man how his wife puts in the seven hours a day of loneliness while the ec has claimed him for its own she cannot explain it to him for she can hardly explain it to herself  it is frittered away in a thousand little tasks each trivial in itself and yet making in their sum the difference between a wellordered and a neglected household  under the illustrious guidance of the omniscient mrs beeton there is the usual routine to be gone through  the cook has to be seen the larder examined the remains cunningly transformed into new and attractive shapes the dinner to be ordered anything will do for lunch and the new supplies to be got in  the husband accepts the excellent little dinner the fried sole the ris de veau en caisse the lemon pudding as if they had grown automatically out of the tablecloth  he knows nothing of the care the judgment the prevision which ring the changes with every season which never relax and never mistake  he enjoys the fruits but he ignores the work which raised them  and yet the work goes cheerfully and uncomplainingly on  then when every preparation has been made for the dinnerthat solemn climax of the british day there is plenty for maude to do  there is the white chiffon to be taken out of the neck of that dress and the pink to be put in  amateur dressmaking is always going on at the lindens and frank has become more careful in his caresses since he found one evening that his wife had a row of pins between her lips which is not a pleasant discovery to make with your own  then there are drawers to be tidied and silver to be cleaned and the leaves of the guttapercha plant to be washed and the feather which was damped yesterday to be recurled before the fire  that leaves just time before lunch to begin the new novel by glancing at the last two pages to see what did happen and then the three minutes lunch of a lonely woman  so much for business now for the more trying social duties the pink dressinggown is shed and a trim little walking dress french grey cloth with white lisse in front and a grey zouave jacket takes its place  visiting strangers is not nearly so hard when you are pleased with your dress and even entertaining becomes more easy when your costumiere lives in regent street  on tuesdays maude is at home  every other day she hunts through her plate of cards and is overwhelmed by the sense of her rudeness towards her neighbours  but her task is never finished though day after day she comes back jaded with her exertions  strangers still call upon herhope it is not too late to do the right thing and to welcome etc etcand they have to be revisited  while she is visiting them other cards appear upon her hall table and so the foolish and tiresome convention continues to exhaust the time and the energies of its victim  those original receptions were really very difficult  jemima announced a name which might or might not bear some relation to the visitors  the lady entered  her name might perhaps be mrs baker maude had no means of knowing who mrs baker might be  the visitor seldom descended to an explanation  ten minutes of desultory and forced conversation about pinewoods and golf and cremation  a cup of tea and a departure  then maude would rush to the cardtray to try to find out whom it was that she had been talking to and what it was all about  maude did not intend to go visiting that particular day and she had hoped that no one might visit her  the hours of danger were almost past and it was close upon four oclock when there came a brisk pull at the bell  mrs white said jemima opening the drawingroom door  wright said the visitor as she walked inmrs violet wright  maude rose with her pleasant smile  it was a peculiarly sweet and kindly smile for it was inspired by a gentle womanly desire to make things pleasant for all who were around her  amiability was never artificial with her for she had the true instincts of a ladythose instincts so often spoken of so seldom so very seldom seen  like a gentleman or a christian or any other ideal it is but a poor approximation which is commonly attained  but the visitor did not respond to the pretty gesture of welcome nor did her handsome face return that sympathetic smile  they stood for an instant looking at each other the one tall masterful mature the other sweet girlish and selfdistrustful but each beautiful and engaging in her own way  lucky master frank whose past and present could take such a form but luckier still if he could have closed the past when the present opened  the visitor was silent but her dark eyes looked critically and fixedly at her rival  maude setting the silence down to the shyness of a first visit tried to make matters easier  please try this armchair  no doubt you have had a tiring walk  it is still very warm in the afternoons  i think it was so kind of you to call  a faint smile flickered upon the dark face  kind of me to call said she  yes for in a rising place like woking with so many new arrivals it must be quite a task for the older inhabitants to welcome them  i have been so surprised by the kindness which every one has shown  oh i see said her visitor you think that i live here  i have really just come down from london  indeed said maude and awaited an explanation  as none was forthcoming she added you will find woking a very nice place  a nice place to be buried in alive or dead said her visitor  there was something peculiarly ungracious in her tone and manner  it seemed to maude that she had never before been alone with so singular a person  there was in the first place her striking and yet rather sinister and voluptuous beauty  then there was the absolute carelessness of her manner the quiet assumption that she was outside the usual conventionalities of life it is a manner only to be met in english life among some of the highest of the high world and some of the highest of the half world it was new to maude and it made her uncomfortable while mingled with it there was something else which made her feel for the first time in her life that she had incurred the hostility of a fellow mortal  it chilled her and made her unhappy  the visitor made no effort to sustain the conversation but leaned back in her chair and stared at her hostess with a very critical and searching glance  those two questioning dark eyes played eagerly over her from her brown curls down to the little shining shoetips which peeped from under the grey skirt  especially they dwelt upon her face reading it and rereading it  never had maude been so inspected and her instinct told her that the inspection was not altogether a friendly one  violet wright having examined her rival proceeded now with the same cool attention to take in her surroundings  she looked round deliberately at the furniture of the room and reconstructed in her own mind the life of the people who owned it  maude ventured upon one or two conventional remarks but her visitor was not to be diverted to the weather or to the slowness of the southwestern train service  she continued her quiet and silent inspection  suddenly she rose and swept across to the sidetable  a photograph of frank in his volunteer uniform stood upon it  this is your husband mr frank crosse  yes do you know him  slightly  we have mutual friends  an ambiguous smile played across her face as she spoke  this must have been taken after i saw him  it was taken just after our marriage  quite so  he looks like a good little married man  the photograph is flattering  oh you think so said maude coldly  my own impression is that it fails to do him justice  her visitor laughed  of course that would be your impression said she  maudes gentle soul began to rise in anger  it is the truth she cried  it is right that you should think so the other answered with the same irritating laugh  you must have known him very slightly if you cant see that it is the truth  then i must have known him very slightly  maude was very angry indeed  she began to find sides to her own nature the very existence of which she had never suspected  she tapped her little shoe upon the ground and she sat with a pale face and compressed lips and bright eyes quite prepared to be very rude indeed to this eccentric woman who ventured to criticise her frank in so free and easy a style  her visitor watched her and a change had come over her expression  maudes evident anger seemed to amuse and interest her  her eyes lost their critical coldness and softened into approval  she suddenly put her hand upon the others shoulder with so natural and yet masterful a gesture that maude found it impossible to resent it  he is a lucky man to have such a warm little champion said she  her strong character and greater knowledge of the world gave her an ascendency over the girlish wife such as age has over youth  there were not ten years between them and yet maude felt that for some reason the conversation between them could not quite be upon equal terms  the quiet assurance of her visitor whatever its cause made resentment or remonstrance difficult  besides they were a pair of very kindly as well as of very shrewd eyes which now looked down into hers  you love him very much then  of course i love him  he is my husband  does it always follow  you are married yourself  dont you love yours  oh never mind mine  hes all right  did you ever love any one else  no not really  maude was astonished at herself and yet the questions were so frankly put that a frank answer came naturally to them  it pleased her to lose that cold chill of dislike and to feel that for some reason her strange visitor had become more friendly to her  you lucky girl you actually married the one love of your life  maude smiled and nodded  what a splendid thing to do  i thought it only happened in books how happy you must be  i am very very happy  well i dare say you deserve to be  besides you really are very pretty  if ever you had a rival i should think that it must be some consolation to her to know that it was so charming a person who cut her out  maude laughed at the thought  i never had a rival said she  my husband never really loved until he met me  did heoh yes quite so  that is so nice that you should both start with a clean sheet  i thought you were very handsome just now when you were angry with me but you are quite delightful with that little flush upon your cheeks  if i had been a man your husband would certainly have had one rival in his wooing  and so he really never loved any one but you  i thought that also only happened in books  there was a hard and ironic tone in the last sentences which jarred upon maudes sensitive nature  she glanced up quickly and was surprised at the look of pain which had come upon her companions face  it relaxed into a serious serenity  that fits in beautifully said she  but theres one bit of advice which i should like to give you if you wont think it a liberty dont be selfish in your married life  selfish  yes there is a kind of family selfishness which is every bit as badi am not sure that it is not worsethan personal selfishness people love each other and they shut out the world and have no thought for any one else and the whole universe can slide to perdition so long as their love is not disturbed  that is what i call family selfishness  its a sin and a shame  maude looked at this strange woman in amazement  she was speaking fast and hotly like one whose bitter thoughts have been long penned up for want of a suitable listener  remember the women who have been less fortunate than you  remember the thousands who are starving dying for want of love and no love comes their way whose hearts yearn and faint for that which nature owes them but nature never pays her debt  remember the plain women remember the lonely women  above all remember your unfortunate sisters they the most womanly of all who have been ruined by their own kindliness and trust and loving weakness  it is that family selfishness which turns every house in the land into a fort to be held against these poor wanderers  they make them evil and then they revile the very evil which they have made  when i look back  she stopped with a sudden sob  her forearm fell upon the mantelpiece and her forehead upon her forearm  in an instant maude was by her side the tears running down her cheeks for the sight of grief was always grief to her and her nerves were weakened by this singular interview  dear mrs wright dont cry she whispered and her little white hand passed in a soothing hesitating gesture over the coil of rich chestnut hair  dont cry  i am afraid you have suffered  oh how i wish i could help you  do tell me how i can help you  but violets occasional fits of weakness were never of a very long duration  she dashed her hand impatiently across her eyes straightened her tall figure and laughed as she glanced at herself in the mirror  madame celandine would be surprised if she could see how i have treated one of her masterpieces said she as she straightened her crushed hat and arranged her hair with those quick little deft pats of the palm with which women can accomplish so much in so short a time  rumpled finery sets the hands of every woman within sight of it fidgeting so maude joined in at the patting and curling and forgot all about her tears  there that will have to do said violet at last  i am so sorry to have made such a fool of myself  i dont err upon the sentimental side as a rule  i suppose it is about time that i thought of catching my train for town  i have a theatre engagement which i must not miss  how strange it is said maude looking at her own pretty tear marked face in the mirror  you have only been here a few minutes as time goes and yet i feel that in some things i am more intimate with you than with any woman i have ever met  how can it be  what bond can there be to draw us together like this  and it is the more extraordinary because i felt that you disliked me when you entered the room and i am sure that you wont be offended if i say that when you had been here a little i thought that i disliked you  but i dont  on the contrary i wish you could come every day  and i want to come and see you also when i am in town  maude for all her amiability was not gushing by nature and this long speech caused her great astonishment when she looked back upon it  but at the moment it came so naturally from her heart that she never paused to think of its oddity  her enthusiasm was a little chilled however by the way in which her advances were received violet wrights eyes were more kindly than ever but she shook her head  no i dont suppose we shall ever meet again  i dont think i could ask you to visit me in london  i wanted to see you and i have seen you but that i fear must be the end of it  maudes lip trembled in a way which it had when she was hurt  why did you wish to see me then she asked  on account of that slight acquaintance with your husband  i thought it would be interesting to see what sort of wife he had chosen  i hope you are not disappointed said maude making a roguish face  he has done very wellbetter than i expected  you had not much respect for his taste then  oh yes i always thought highly of his taste  you have such a pretty way of putting things  you know my husband very slightly but still i can see that you know the world very well i often wonder if i am really the best kind of woman that he could have married  do you think i am mrs wright  her visitor looked in silence for a little at the gentle grace and dainty sympathetic charm of the woman before her  yes she said slowly as one who weighs her words  i think you are  you are a lady with a ladys soul in you  a woman can draw a man down very low or she can make him live at his very highest dont be soft with him  dont give way when you know that your way is the higher way  pull him up dont let him ever pull you down then his respect for you will strengthen his love for you and the two together are so much greater than either one apart  your instinct would be to do this and therefore you are the best sort of woman for him  her opinion was given with so much thought and yet so much decision that maude glowed with pride and with pleasure  there was knowledge and authority behind the words of this unaccountable woman  how sweet you are she cried  i feel that what you say is true i feel that that is what a wife should be to her husband  please god i will be so to frank  and one other piece of advice before i leave you said violet wright  dont ever take your husband for granted  dont ever accept his kiss or caress as a routine thing  dont ever relax those little attentions which you showed him in the earliest days  dont let the freshness go out of love for the love may soon follow it even when duty keeps the man true  it is the commonest mistake which married women make  it has caused more unhappiness than any other they do not realise it until it is too late  be keenly watchful for your husbands wants and comforts  it is not the comfort but the attention which he values  if it is not there he will say nothing if he is a good fellow but he notices it all the same  she has changed he thinks  and from that moment he will begin to change also  be on your guard against that  it is very unselfish of me to give you all this wise counsel  it is very good of you and i feel that it is all so true  but why is it unselfish of you  i only meant that i had no interest in the matter  what does it matter to me whether you keep his love or not  and yet i dont know  she suddenly put her arms round maude and kissed her upon the cheek  you are a good little sort and i hope you will be happy   frank crosse had disentangled himself from the rush of city men emerging from the woking station and he was walking swiftly through the gathering gloom along the vile deeplyrutted road which formed a short cut to the lindens  suddenly with a sinking heart he was aware of a tall graceful figure which was sweeping towards him there could not be two women of that height who carried themselves in that fashion  violet  hullo frankie  i thought it might be you but those tall hats and black overcoats make every one alike  your wife will be glad to see you  violet  you have ruined our happiness  how could you have the heart to do it  it is not for myself i speak god knows  but to think of her feelings being so abused her confidence so shaken  all right frankie there is nothing to be tragic about  havent you been to my house  yes i have  and seen her  yes  well then  i didnt give you away my boy  i was a model of discretion  i give you my word that it is all right  and shes a dear little soul frankie  youre not worthy to varnish those pretty patent leathers of hers  you know youre not  and by jove frankie if you had stayed with me yesterday i should never have forgiven youno never ill resign in her favour  i will  but in no one elses and if ever i hear of your going wrong my boy or doing anything but the best with that sweet trusting woman ill make you curse the day that ever you knew mei will by the living jingo  do violetyou have my leave  all right  the least said the soonest mended  give me a kiss before we part  she raised her veil and he kissed her  he was wearing some withered flower in his overcoat and she took it from him  its a souvenir of our friendship frankie and rather a good emblem of it also  solong said she as she turned down the weary road which leads to the station  a young golfer getting in at byfleet was surprised to see a handsome woman weeping bitterly in the corner of a secondclass carriage  comm up from roastin somebody at that damned crematory place was his explanation to his companion  frank had a long and animated account from maude of the extraordinary visitor whom she had entertained  its such a pity dear that you dont know her well for i should really like to hear every detail about her  at first i thought she was mad and then i thought she was odious and then finally she seemed to be the very wisest and kindest woman that i had ever known  she made me angry and frightened and grieved and grateful and affectionate one after the other and i never in my life was so taken out of myself by any one  she is so sensible  sensible is she  and she said that i wasoh  i cant repeat iteverything that is nice  then she is sensible  and such a high opinion of your taste  had she indeed  do you know frank i really believe that in a quiet secret retiring sort of way she has been fond of you herself  o maude what funny ideas you get sometimes  i say if we are going out for dinner it is high time that we began to dress    chapter xxno 5 cheyne row    frank had brought home the life of carlyle and maude had been dipping into it in the few spare halfhours which the many duties of a young housekeeper left her  at first it struck her as dry but from the moment that she understood that this was among other things an account of the inner life of a husband and a wife she became keenly interested and a passionate and unreasonable partisan for frederick and cromwell and the other great issues her feelings were tolerant but lukewarm  but the great sexquestions of how did he treat her and of how did she stand it filled her with that eternal and personal interest with which they affect every woman her gentle nature seldom disliked any one but certainly amongst those whom she liked least the gaunt figure of the chelsea sage began to bulk largely  one night as frank sat reading in front of the fire he suddenly found his wife on her knees upon the rug and a pair of beseeching eyes upon his face  frank dear i want you to make me a promise  well what is it  will you grant it  how can i tell you when i have not heard it  how horrid you are frank  a year ago you would have promised first and asked afterwards  but i am a shrewd old married man now  well let me hear it  i want you to promise me that you will never be a carlyle  no no never  really  really and truly  you swear it  yes i do  o frank you cant think what a relief that is to me  that dear good helpful little ladyit really made me cry this morning when i thought how she had been used  how then  i have been reading that greencovered book of yours and he seemed so cold and so sarcastic and so unsympathetic  he never seemed to appreciate all that she did for him  he had no thought for her  he lived in his books and never in hersuch a harsh cruel man  frank went upstairs and returned with a volume in his hand  when you have finished the life you must read this dear  what is it  it is her letters  they were arranged for publication after her death while her husband was still alive  you know that  please take it for granted darling that i know nothing  it is so jolly to have some one before whom it is not necessary to keep up appearances  now begin at the beginning and go ahead  she pillowed her head luxuriously against his knees  theres nothing to tellor very little  as you say they had their troubles in life  the lady could take particularly good care of herself i believe  she had a tongue like a lancet when she chose to use it  he poor chap was all liver and nerves porridgepoisoned in his youth  no children to take the angles off them  half a dozen little buffer states would have kept them at peace  however to hark back to what i was about to say he outlived her by fifteen years or so  during that time he collected these letters and he has annotated them  you can read those notes here and the man who wrote those notes loved his wife and cherished her memory if ever a man did upon earth  the graceful head beside his knee shook impatiently  what is the use of that to the poor dead woman  why could not he show his love by kindness and thought for her while she was alive  i tell you maude there were two sides to that  dont be so prejudiced  and remember that no one has ever blamed carlyle as bitterly as he has blamed himself  i could read you bits of these notes  well do  heres the first letter in which she is talking about how they first moved into the house at cheyne row  they spent their early years in scotland you know and he was a man going on to the forties when he came to london  the success of sartor resartus encouraged them to the step  her letter describes all the incoming  here is his comment written after her death  in about a week all was swept and garnished fairly habitable and continued incessantly to get itself polished civilised and beautified to a degree that surprised one  i have elsewhere alluded to all that and to my little jeannies conduct of it heroic lovely pathetic mournfully beautiful as in the light of eternity that little scene of time now looks to me  from birth upwards she had lived in opulence and now became poor for meso nobly poor  no such house for beautiful thrift quiet spontaneous nay as it were unconscious minimum of money reconciled to human comfort and human dignity have i anywhere looked upon where i have been  now maude did that man appreciate his wife  but the obstinate head still shook  words words said she  yes but words with the ring of truth in them  cant you tell real feeling from sham  i dont believe women can or they would not be so often taken in  heres the heading of the next letter mournfully beautiful is this letter to me a clear little household light shining pure and brilliant in the dark obstructive places of the pasta little later comes the note  oh my poor little woman become poor for me  i like to hear him talk like that  yes i do like him better after what you have said frank  you must remember two things about him maude  the first that he was a scotchman who are of all men the least likely to wear their hearts upon their sleeves the other that his mind was always grappling with some faraway subject which made him forget the smaller things close by him  but the smaller things are everything to a woman said maude  if ever you forget those smaller things sir to be as courteous to your wife as you would be to any other lady to be loving and thoughtful and sympathetic it will be no consolation to me to know that you have written the grandest book that ever was  i should just hate that book and i believe that in her inmost heart this poor lady hated all the books that had taken her husband away from her  i wonder if their house is still standing  certainly it is  would you like to visit it  i dont think there is anything i should like more  why maude we are getting quite a distinguished circle of acquaintances  mr pepys last monthand now the carlyles  well we could not spend a saturday afternoon better so if you will meet me tomorrow at charing cross we shall have a cosy little lunch together at gattis and then go down to chelsea   maude was a rigid economist and so was frank in his way for with the grand selfrespect of the middle classes the thought of debt was unendurable to them  a cab in preference to a bus gave both of them a feeling of dissipation but none the less they treated themselves to one on the occasion of this their little holiday  it is a delightful thing to snuggle up in is a hansom but in order to be really trim and comfortable one has to put ones arm round ones companions waist  no one can observe it there for the vehicle is built upon intelligent principles  the cabman it is true can overlook you through a hole in the roof  this cabman did so and chuckled in his cravat  if that coves wife could see himhuddup then said the cabman  he was an intelligent cabman too for having heard frank say thomas carlyles house after giving the address 5 cheyne row he pulled up on the thames embankment  right ahead of them was chelsea bridge seen through a dim soft london hazemonstrous cyclopean giant arches springing over a vague river of molten metal the whole daintily blurred as though out of focus  the glamour of the london haze what is there upon earth so beautiful  but it was not to admire it that the cabman had halted  i beg your pardin sir said he in the softly insinuating way of the cockney but i thought that maybe the lidy would like to see mr carlyles statue  thats im sir asittin in the overcoat with the book in is and  frank and maude got out and entered the small railed garden in the centre of which the pedestal rose  it was very simple and plainan old man in a dressinggown with homely wornout boots a book upon his knee his eyes and thoughts far away  no more simple statue in all london but human to a surprising degree  they stood for five minutes and stared at it  well said frank at last small as it is i think it is worthy of the man  it is so natural  you can see him think  by jove it is splendid  frank had enough of the true artist to be able to feel that rush of enthusiasm which adequate work should cause  that old man with his head shamefully defiled by birds was a positive joy to him  among the soulless pompous unspeakable london statues here at last there was one over which it is pleasant to linger  what other one is there  gordon in trafalgar square  well gordon perhaps  but our nelsons and napiers and havelocks to think that we could do no better than that for them  now dear we have seen the manlet us look at the house  it had evidently been an oldfashioned building when first they came to it  1708 was the date at the corner of the street  six or seven drabcoloured flatchested dimwindowed houses stood in a line theirs wedged in the middle of them  a poor medallion with a profile head of him had been clumsily let into the wall  several worn steps led to the thin high door with an oldfashioned fanlight above it frank rang the bell and a buxom cheerful matron came at the call  names in this book sirand address if you please said the cheery matron  one shilling eachthank you sir  first door to the left sir  this was the diningroom sir  but frank had come to a dead stop in the dim dull woodpanelled hall  in front of them rose the stairs with oldfashioned banisters cracked warped and dusty  its awful to think of maudeawful  to think that she ran up those stairs as a youngish womanthat he took them two at a time as an active man and then that they hobbled and limped down them old and weary and broken and now both dead and gone for ever and the stairs standing the very rails the very treadsi dont know that i ever felt so strongly what bubbles of the air we are so fragile so utterly dissolved when the prick comes  how could they be happy in such a house said maude  i can feel that there have been sorrow and trouble here  there is an atmosphere of gloom  the matronattendant approved of emotion but in its due order  one should be affected in the diningroom first and then in the hall and so at her summons they followed her into the long low quaint room in which this curious couple had lived their everyday life little of the furniture was left and the walls were lined with collected pictures bearing upon the life of the carlyles  theres the fireplace that he smoked his pipe up said frank  why up the fireplace  she did not like the smell in the room  he often at night took his friends down into the kitchen  fancy my driving you into the kitchen  well the habit of smoking was looked upon much less charitably at that time  and besides he smoked clay pipes said the matron  this is considered a good print of mrs carlyle  it was a peaky eager face with a great spirit looking out of it and possibilities of passion both for good and evil in the keen alert features  just beside her was the dour grim outline of her husband their lifehistories were in those two portraits  poor dear said maude  ay you may say so said the matron whose accent showed that she was from the north of the tweed  he was gey ill to live wi  his own mither said so  now what think you that room was for  it was little larger than a cupboard without window or skylight opening out of the end of the diningroom  i cant imagine  well sir it was the powderingroom in the days when folk wore wigs  the powder made such a mess that they just had a room for nothing else  there was a hole in the door and the man put his head through the hole and the barber on the other side powdered him out of the flourdredger  it was curious to be brought back in this fashion to those faroff days and to suddenly realise how many other people had played their tragicomedies within these walls  wigs  only the dressy people wore wigs  so people of fashion in the days of the early georges trod these same rooms where carlyle grumbled and his wife fretted and they too had grumbled and frettedor worse perhaps  it was a ghostly old house  this said the matron when they had passed up the stair used to be the drawingroom  thats their sofa  not the sofa said frank  yes sir the sofa that is mentioned in the letters  she was so proud of it maude  gave eighteen shillings for it and covered and stuffed it herself  and that i suppose is the screen she was a great housekeeperbrought up a spoiled child according to her own account but a great housekeeper all the same  whats that writing in the case  it is the history that he was at work on when he diedsomething about the kings of norway sir  those are his corrections in blue  i cant read them  no more could any one else sir  perhaps thats why the book has never been published  those are the portraits of the kings of prussia about whom he wrote a book  frank looked with interest at the old engravings one of the schoolmaster face of the great frederick the other of the froglike features of frederick william the halfmad recruiter of the big potsdam grenadiers  when he had finished the matron had gone down to open the door and they were alone  maudes hand grasped his  is it not strange dear she said  here they lived the most talented couple in the world and yet with all their wisdom they missed what we have gotwhat perhaps that good woman who showed us round has gotthe only thing as it seems to me that is really worth living for  what are all the wit and all the learning and all the insight into things compared to love  by jove little woman in all this house of wise sayings no wiser or deeper saying has been said than that  well thank god we have that anyhow  and he kissed his wife while six grand electors of brandenburg and kings of prussia looked fiercely out upon them from the wall  they sat down together in two old chairs in the window and they looked out into the dingy street and frank tried to recount all the great menthe other great men as maude said half chaffing and half earnestwho had looked through those panes  tennyson ruskin emerson mill froude mazzini leigh hunthe had got so far when the matron returned  there was a case in the corner with some of the wreckage from those vanished vessels  notes from old goethe in a singularly neat boyish writing inscribed upon little ornamented cards  here too were small inscriptions which had lain upon presents from carlyle to his wife  it was pleasant among all that jangling of the past to think of the love which had written them and that other love which had so carefully preserved them  on one was written  all good attend my darling through this gulf of time and through the long ocean it is leading to  amen  amen  t c  on another dated 1850 and attached evidently to some birthday present was  many years to my poor little jeannie and may the worst of them be past  no good that is in me to give her shall ever be wanting while i live  may god bless her  how strange that this apostle of reticence should have such privacies as these laid open before the curious public within so few years of his death  this is her bedroom said the matron  and here is the old red bed cried frank  it looked bare and gaunt and dreary with its uncurtained posts  the bed belonged to mrs carlyles mother the matron explained its the same bed that mrs carlyle talks about in her letters when she says how she pulled it to pieces  why did she pull it to pieces asked maude  better not inquire dear  indeed youre right sir  if you get them into these old houses it is very hard to get them out  a cleaner woman than mrs carlyle never came out of scotland  this little room behind was his dressingroom  theres his stick in the corner  look whats written upon the window   decidedly it was a ghostly house  scratched upon one of the panes with a diamond was the following piece of informationjohn harbel knowles cleaned all the windows in this house and painted part in the eighteenth year of age  march 7th 1794   who was he asked maude  nobody knows miss  it was characteristic of maude that she was so gentle in her bearing that every one always took it for granted that she was miss  frank examined the writing carefully  he was the son of the house and a young aristocrat who had never done a stroke of work before in his life said he  the matron was surprised  what makes you say that sir  what would a workman do with such a name as john harbel knowles or with a diamond ring for that matter  and who would dare to disfigure a window so if he were not of the family  and why should he be so proud of his work unless work was a new and wondrous thing to him to paint part of the windows also sounds like the amateur and not the workman  so i repeat that it was the first achievement of the son of the house  well indeed i dare say you are right though i never thought of it before said the matron  now this up here is carlyles own room in which he slept for fortyseven years  in the case is a cast of his head taken after death  it was strange and rather ghastly to see a plaster head in this room where the head of flesh had so often lain  maude and frank stood beside it and gazed long and silently while the matron halfbored and halfsympathetic waited for them to move on  it was an aquiline face very different from any picture which they had seen sunken cheeks an old mans toothless mouth a hawk nose a hollow eyethe gaunt timbers of what had once been a goodly house  there was repose and something of surprise also in the featuresalso a very subtle serenity and dignity  the distance from the ear to the forehead is said to be only equalled by napoleon and by gladstone  thats what they say said the matron with scotch caution  its the face of a noble man when all is said and done said frank i believe that the true thomas carlyle without the dyspepsia and the true jane welsh without the nerves are knowing and loving each other in some further life  it is sweet to think so cried maude  oh i do hope that it is so  how dear death would be if we could only be certain of that  the matron smiled complacently in the superior wisdom of the shorter catechism  there is neither marriage nor giving in marriage said she shaking her head  this is the spare bedroom sir where mr emerson slept when he was here  and now if you will step this way i will show you the study  it was the singular room which carlyle had constructed in the hopes that he could shut out all the noises of the universe the crowing of cocks and the jingling of a young ladys fivefinger exercise in particular  it had cost him a hundred odd pounds and had ended in being unendurably hot in summer impossibly cold in winter and so constructed acoustically that it reverberated every sound in the neighbourhood  for once even his wild and whirling words could hardly match the occasionnot all his kraft sprachen would be too much  for the rest it was at least a roomy and lofty apartment with space for many books and for an irritable man to wander to and fro prints there were of many historical notables and slips of letters and of memoranda in a long glass case  that is one of his clay pipes said the matron  he had them all sent through to him from glasgow  and that is the pen with which he wrote frederick  it was a worn stubby old quill much the worse for its monstrous task  it at least of all quill pens might rest content with having done its work in the world  some charred paper beside it caught franks eye  oh look maude he cried  this is a little bit of the burned french revolution  oh i remember  he lent the only copy to a friend and it was burned by mistake  what a blow  what a frightful blow  and to think that his first comment to his wife was well mill poor fellow is very much cut up about this  there is carlyle at his best  and here is actually a shred of the old manuscript  how beautifully he wrote in those days  read this sir said the matron  it was part of a letter from carlyle to his publisher about his ruined work  do not pity me said he forward me rather as a runner that is tripped but will not lie there but run and run again  see what positive misfortune can do for a man said frank  it raised him to a hero  and yet he could not stand the test of a crowing cock  how infinitely complex is the human soulhow illimitably great and how pitiably small  now if ever i have a study of my own this is what i want engraved upon the wall  this alone is well worth our pilgrimage to chelsea  it was a short exclamation which had caught his eye  rest  rest  shall i not have all eternity to rest in  that serene plaster face down yonder gave force to the brave words  frank copied them down onto the back of one of maudes cards  and now they had finished the rooms but the matron catching a glow from these enthusiastic pilgrims had yet other things to show them there was the back garden  here was the green pottery seat upon which the unphilosophic philosopher had smoked his pipea singularly cold and uncomfortable perch  and here was where mrs carlyle had tried to build a tent and to imagine herself in the country  and here was the famous walnut treeor at least the stumpy bole thereof and here was where the dog nero was buried best known of small white mongrels  and last of all there was the subterranean and gloomy kitchen in which there had lived that long succession of servingmaids of whom we gain shadowy glimpses in the letters and in the journal  poor souls dwellers in the gloom working so hard for others so bitterly reviled when by chance some weakness of humanity comes to break for an instant the routine of their constant labour so limited in their hopes and in their pleasures they are of all folk upon this planet those for whom a mans heart may most justly soften  so said frank as he gazed around him in the darkcornered room  and never one word of sympathy for them or of anything save scorn in all his letters  his pen upholding human dignity but where was the dignity of these poor girls for whom he has usually one bitter line of biography in his notes to his wifes letters  its the worst thing i have against him  jemima wouldnt have stood it said maude  it was pleasant to be out in the open air once more but they were in the pine groves of woking before maude had quite shaken off the gloom of that dark ghosthaunted house  after all you are only twenty seven she remarked as they walked up from the station  she had a way of occasionally taking a subject by the middle in that way  what then dear  when carlyle was only twentyseven i dont suppose he knew he was going to do all this  no i dont suppose so  and his wifeif he were married thenwould feel as i do to you  no doubt  then what guarantee have i that you wont do it after all  do what  why turn out a second carlyle  hear me swear cried frank and they turned laughing into their own little gateway at the lindens    chapter xxithe last note of the duet    our young married couples may feel that two is company and three is none but there comes a little noisy intruder to break into their sweet intimacy  the coming of the third is the beginning of a new life for them as well as for ita life which is more useful and more permanent but never so concentrated as before  that little pink thing with the blinking eyes will divert some of the love and some of the attention and the very trouble which its coming has caused will set its mothers heart yearning over it  not so the man  some vague resentment mixes with his pride of paternity and his wifes sufferings rankle in his memory when she has herself forgotten them his pity his fears his helplessness and his discomfort give him a share in the domestic tragedy  it is not without cause that in some societies it is the man and not the woman who receives the condolence and the sympathy  there came a time when maude was bad and there came months when she was better and then there were indications that a day was approaching the very thought of which was a shadow upon her husbands life  for her part with the steadfast gentle courage of a woman she faced the future with a sweet serenity  but to him it was a nightmarean actual nightmare which brought him up damp and quivering in those gray hours of the dawn when dark shadows fall upon the spirit of man  he had a steady nerve for that which affected himself a nerve which would keep him quiet and motionless in a dentists chair but what philosophy or hardihood can steel one against the pain which those whom we love have to endure  he fretted and chafed and always with the absurd delusion that his fretting and chafing were successfully concealed  a hundred failures never convince a man how impossible it is to deceive a woman who loves him maude watched him demurely and made her plans  do you know dear said she one evening if you can get a week of your holidays now i think it would be a very good thing for you to accept that invitation of mr mildmays and spend a few days in golfing at norwich  frank stared at her openeyed  what  now  yes dear nowat once  but now of all times  maude looked at him with that glance of absolute obvious candour which a woman never uses unless she has intent to deceive  yes dearbut only next week  i thought it would brace you up for well for the week afterwards  you think the week afterwards  yes dear  it would help me so if i knew that you were in your best form  i  what can it matter what form i am in  but in any case it is out of the question  but you could get leave  oh yes easily enough  then do go  and leave you at such a time  no no you would be back  you cant be so sure of that  no maude i should never forgive myself  such an idea would never enter my head  but for my sake  thats enough maude  it is settled  master frank had a heavy foot when he did bring it down and his wife recognised a decisive thud this time  with a curious double current of feeling she was pleased and disappointed at the same time but more pleased than disappointed so she kissed the marrer of her plots  what an obstinate old boy it is  but of course you know best and i should much rather have you at home  as you say one can never be certain  in a conflict of wits the woman may lose a battle but the odds are that she will win the campaign  the man dissipates over many things while she concentrates upon the one  maude had made up her mind absolutely upon one point and she meant to attain it  she tried here she tried there through a friend through her mother but frank was still immovable  the ordeal coming upon herself never disturbed her for an instant  but the thought that frank would suffer was unendurable  she put herself in his place and realised what it would be to him if he were in the house at such a time  with many cunning devices she tried to lure him off but still in his stubborn way he refused to be misled  and then suddenly she realised that it was too late  it was early one morning that the conviction came home to her but he at her side knew nothing of it  he came up to her before he left for the city  you have not eaten anything dear  no frank i am not hungry  perhaps after you get up  well dear i thought of staying in bed  you are not  what nonsense dear  i want to keep very quiet until next week when i may need all my strength  dear girl i would gladly give ten years of my life to have next week past  silly old boy  but i do think it would be wiser if i were to keep in bed  yes yes do  i have a little headache  nothing to speak of but just a little  dont you think dr jordan had better give you something for it  do you think so  well just as you like  you might call as you pass and tell him to step up  and so upon a false mission the doctor was summoned to her side but found a very real mission waiting for him when he got there  she had written a note for frank the moment that he had left the house and he found both it and a conspiracy of silence waiting for him when he returned in the late afternoon  the note was upon the halltable and he eagerly tore it open  my dear boy said this mendacious epistle my head is still rather bad and dr jordan thought that it would be wiser if i were to have an undisturbed rest but i will send down to you when i feel better until then i had best perhaps remain alone  mr harrison sent round to say that he would come to help you to pot the bulbs so that will give you something to do  dont bother about me for i only want a little restmaude  it seemed very unnatural to him to come back and not to hear the swift rustle of the dress which followed always so quickly upon the creak of his latchkey that they might have been the same sound  the hall and diningroom seemed unhomely without the bright welcoming face  he wandered about in a discontented fashion upon his tiptoes and then looking through the window he saw harrison his neighbour coming up the path with a straw basket in his hand  he opened the door for him with his finger upon his lips  dont make a row harrison said he my wifes bad  harrison whistled softly  not  no no not that  only a headache but she is not to be disturbed we expect that next week  come in here and smoke a pipe with me  it was very kind of you to bring the bulbs  i am going back for some more  wait a little  you can go back presently  sit down and light your pipe  there is some one moving about upstairs  it must be that heavyfooted jemima  i hope she wont wake maude up  i suppose one must expect such attacks at such a time  yes my wife was just the same  no thank you ive just had some tea  you look worried crosse  dont take things too hard  i cant get the thought of next week out of my head  if anything goes wrongwell there what can i do  i never knew how a mans nerves may be harrowed before  and she is such a saint harrison such an absolutely unselfish saint  youll never guess what she tried to do  what then  she knew what it would mean to mewhat it will mean to meto sit here in impotence while she goes through this horrible business  she guessed in some extraordinary way what my secret feelings were about it  and she actually tried to deceive me as to when it was to occur tried to get me out of the house on one pretext or another until it was all over  that was her plot and by jove she tried it so cleverly that she would have managed it if something had not put me on my guard  she was a little too eager unnaturally so and i saw through her game  but think of it the absolute unselfishness of it to consider me at such a time and to face her trouble alone and unsupported in order to make it easier for me  she wanted me to go to norwich and play golf  she must have thought you pretty guileless crosse to be led away so easily  yes it was a hopeless attempt to deceive me on such a point or to dream for an instant that my instincts would not tell me when she had need of me  but none the less it was beautiful and characteristic you dont mind my talking of these things harrison  my dear chap it is just what you need  you have been bottling things up too much  your health will break down under it  after all it is not so serious as all that  the danger is very much exaggerated  you think so  ive had the experience twice now  youll go to the city some fine morning and when you come back the whole thing will be over  indeed it wont  i have made arrangements at the office and from the hour that she first seems bad i will never stir from the house for all she may say i know very well that it gives her strength and courage to feel that i am there  you may not know that it is coming on  frank laughed incredulously  well see about that said he  and you think from your experience harrison that it is not so very bad after all  oh no  it soon passes  soon  what do you mean by soon  jordan was there six hours the first time  good god  six hours  frank wiped his forehead  they must have seemed six years  they were rather long  i kept on working in the garden  thats the tip  keep on doing something and it helps you along wonderfully  thats a good suggestion harrison  what a curious smell there is in the air  do you notice a sort of low sweetish spirity kind of scent  well perhaps its my imagination  i dare say that my nerves are a bit strung up these days  but that is a capital idea of yours about having some work to do  i should like to work madly for those hours  have everything up out of the back garden and plant it all again in the front  harrison laughed  ill tell you something less heroic said he you could keep all these bulbs and pot them then  by the way ill go round and get the others  dont bother about the door  i shall leave it open for i wont be five minutes  and ill put these in the greenhouse said frank  he took the basket of bulbs and he laid them all out on the wooden shelf of the tiny conservatory which leaned against the back of the house  when he came out there was a kitten making a noise somewhere  it was a low sound but persistent coming in burst after burst  he took the rake and jabbed with the handle amongst the laurel bushes under their bedroom window  the beast might waken maude and so it was worth some trouble to dislodge it  he could not see it but when he had poked among the bushes and cried skat several times the crying died away and he carried his empty basket into the diningroom there he lit his pipe again and waited for harrisons return  there was that bothersome kitten again  he could hear it mewing away somewhere  it did not sound so loud as in the garden so perhaps it would not matter  he felt very much inclined to steal upstairs upon tiptoe and see if maude were stirring yet  after all if jemima or whoever it was could go clumping about in heavy boots over his head there was no fear that he could do any harm  and yet she had said that she would ring or send word the moment she could see him and so perhaps he had better wait where he was  he put his head out of the window and cried shoo into the laurel bushes several times  then he sat in the armchair with his back to the door  steps came heavily along the hall and he saw dimly with the back corner of his eye that some one was in the doorway carrying something  he thought that really harrison might have brought the bulbs in more quietly and so he treated him with some coldness and did not turn round to him  put it in the outhouse said he  why the outhouse  we keep them there  but you can put it under the sideboard or in the coalscuttle or where you like as long as you dont make any more noise  why surely crosse  but frank suddenly sprang out of his chair  im blessed if that infernal kitten isnt somewhere in the room  and there when he turned was the grim kindly face of old doctor jordan facing him  he carried in the crook of his arm a brown shawl with something round and small muffled up in it  there was one slit in front and through this came a fist about the size of a marble the thumb doubled under the tiny fingers and the whole limb giving circular waves as if the owner were cheering lustily at his own successful arrival  here am i good people hurrah hurrah hurrah cried the waving hand  then as the slit in the shawl widened frank saw that behind the energetic fist there was a huge open mouth a little button of a nose and two eyes which were so resolutely screwed up that it seemed as if the owner had made a resolution never under any circumstances to take the least notice of this new world into which it had been transported  frank dropped his pipe and stood staring at this apparition  what  whats that  the baby  baby  whose baby  your baby of course  my baby  wherewhere did you get it  doctor jordan burst out laughing  you are like a man who has just been wakened out of his sleep said he  why crosse your wife has been bad all day but shes all right now and heres your son and heira finer lad of the age i never sawfighting weight about seven pounds  frank was a very proud man at the roots of his nature  he did not readily give himself away  perhaps if he had been quite alone he might at that moment as the great wave of joy washed through his soul bearing all his fears and forebodings away upon its crest have dropped upon his knees in prayer  but prayer comes not from the knee but from the heart and the whole strength of his nature breathed itself out in silent thanks to that great fate which goes its way regardless either of thanks or reproaches  the doctor saw a pale selfcontained young man before him and thought him strangely wanting in emotion  well said he impatiently  is she all right  yes  wont you take your son  could she see me  i dont suppose five minutes would do any harm  dr jordan said afterwards that it was three steps which took frank up the fifteen stairs  the nurse who met him at the corner looks back on it as the escape of her lifetime  maude lay in bed with a face as pale as the pillow which framed it  her lips were bloodless but smiling  frank  my own dear sweet girlie  you never knew  did you frank  tell me that you never knew  and at that anxious question the foolish pride which keeps the emotions of the strong man buried down in his soul as though they were the least honourable part of his nature fell suddenly to nothing and frank dropped with his head beside the white face upon the pillow and lay with his arm across the woman whom he loved and sobbed as he had not sobbed since his childhood  her cheek was wet with his tears  he never saw the doctor until he came beside him and touched him on the shoulder  i think you had better go now said he  sorry to be a fool doctor said frank blushing hotly in his clumsy english fashion  its just more than i can stand  sir the doctor answered i owe you an apology for i had done you an injustice  meanwhile your son is about to be dressed and there is hardly room for three men in one bedroom  so frank went down into the darkening room below and mechanically lighting his pipe he sat with his elbows upon his knees and stared out into the gathering gloom where one bright evening star twinkled in a violet sky  the gentle hush of the gloaming was around him and some late bird was calling outside amongst the laurels  above he heard the shuffling of feet the murmur of voices and then amid it all those thin glutinous cries his voice the voice of this new man with all a mans possibilities for good and for evil who had taken up his dwelling with them  and as he listened to those cries a gentle sadness was mixed with his joy for he felt that things were now for ever changedthat whatever sweet harmonies of life might still be awaiting him from this hour onwards they might form themselves into the subtlest and loveliest of chords but it must always be as a trio and never as the dear duet of the past    chapter xxiithe trio    extract from a letter to the author from mrs frank crosse  it is very singular that you should say with such confidence that you know that our baby is a splendid one and further on you say that in some ways it differs from any other baby  it is so true but neither frank nor i can imagine how you knew  we both think it so clever of you to have found it out  when you write to us do please tell us how you discovered it  i want to tell you something about baby since you so kindly ask me but frank says there is no use my beginning as there is only one quire of paper in the house  as a matter of fact i shall be quite short which is not because i have not plenty to sayyou cannot think what a dear he isbut because he may wake up at any moment after that happens i can only write with one hand while i wave a feather fan with the other and it is so difficult then to say exactly what you mean  in any case you know that i have not the habit of collecting and writing down my ideas so please forgive me if this seems a stupid letter  frank could have done it splendidly but he has so many sweet and quite remarkable ways that i ought to be able to put some of them down for you  it will be easier perhaps if i imagine a day of himand one of his days is very much like another  no one could ever say that he was irregular in his habits  first thing in the morning i go over to his cot to see if he is awake yetthough of course i know that he cant be for he always lets us knowthe darling  however i go over all the same and i find everything quiet and nothing visible of baby but a tiny turnedup nose  it is so exactly franks nose only that his is curved the other way  then as i bend over his cot there is a small sigh such a soft comfortable sound  then a sort of earthquake takes place under the eider down and a tightly clenched fist appears and is waved in the air  he has such a pleasant cheerful way of waving his fists  then one eye is half opened as if he were looking round to see if it were safe to open the other one and then he gives a long sorrowful wail as he realises that his bottle is not where he left it when he went to sleep  in a moment he is in my arms and quite happy again playing with the lace round the neck of my pink dressinggown  when he finds that his nice warm bath is all ready for him he becomes quite jovial and laughs and chuckles to himself  something awfully funny must have happened to him before ever he came into this world at all for nothing that has occurred since could account for the intense expression of amusement that one can often see in his eyes  when he laughs frank says that he looks like some jolly old cleanshaven toothless friarso chubby and goodhumoured  he takes the greatest interest in everything in the room watches the nurse moving about looks out of the window and examines my hair and my dress very critically  he loves to see untidy hair and a bright tie or a brooch will often catch his eye and make him smile  his smile is the most wonderful thing  as he lies gazing with his great serious blue eyes his whole face suddenly lights up his mouth turns up at one corner in the most irresistible way and his cheeks all go off into dimples  he looks so sweet and innocent and at the same time so humorous and wicked that his foolish mother wants to laugh at him and to weep over him at the same time  then comes his bath and there is a sad display of want of faith upon his part  he enjoys the process but he is convinced that only his own exertions keep him from drowning so his little fists are desperately clenched his legs kick up and down the whole time and he watches every movement of mother and nurse with suspicion  he enjoys being dressed and smiles at first and then he suddenly remembers that he has not had his breakfast  then the smiles vanish the small round face grows so red and angry and all covered with little wrinkles and there is a dismal wailingpoor darling  if the bottle is not instantly forthcoming he will howl loudly and beat the air with his fists until he gets it  he does remind me so of his father sometimes  he is always hunting for his bottle and will seize my finger or a bit of my dress or anything and carry it to his mouth and when he finds it isnt what he wants he throws it away very angrily  when finally he does get the bottle he becomes at once the most contented being in the whole world and sucks away with such great long pulls and such dear little grunts in between then afterwards a wellwashed wellfed atom he is ready to look about him and observe things  i am sure that he has his fathers brains and that he is storing up all sorts of impressions and observations for future use for he notices everything  i used to think that babies were stupid and indifferentand perhaps other babies arebut he is never indifferent  sometimes he is pleased and amused and sometimes angry and sometimes gravely interested but he is always wide awake and taking things in  when i go into his room he always looks at my head and if i have my garden hat with the flowers he is so pleased  he much prefers chiffon to silk  almost the first thing that struck me when i saw him and it strikes me more and more was how could any one have got the idea of original sin  the people who believe in it can never have looked into a babys eyes  i love to watch them and sometimes fancy i can see a faint shade of reminiscence in them as if he had still some memories of another life and could tell me things if he could only speak  one day as i sat beside his cotoh dear  i hear his majesty calling  so sorry  goodbyeyours very truly  maude crosse  psi have not time to read this over but i may say in case i omitted it before that he really is a very remarkable baby
