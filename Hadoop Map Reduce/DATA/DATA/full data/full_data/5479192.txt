the macdermots of ballycloran    chapter i  ballycloran house as first seen by the author   in the autumn 184 business took me into the west of ireland and amongst other places to the quiet little village of drumsna which is in the province of connaught county leitrim about 72 miles wnw of dublin on the mailcoach road to sligo i reached the little inn there in the morning by the said mail my purpose being to leave it late in the evening by the day coach and as my business was but of short duration i was left after an early dinner to amuse myself now in such a situation to take a walk is all the brightest man can do and the dullest always does the same there is a kind of gratification in seeing what one has never seen before be it ever so little worth seeing and the gratification is the greater if the chances be that one will never see it again now drumsna stands on a bend in the shannon the street leads down to a bridge passing over which one finds oneself in the county roscommon and the road runs by the wellwooded demesne of sir g k moreover there is a beautiful little hill from which the demesne river bridge and village can all be seen and what farther agremens than these could be wanted to make a pretty walk but alas i knew not of their existence then one cannot ask the maid at an inn to show one where to find the beauties of nature so trusting to myself i went directly away from river woods and allalong as dusty ugly and disagreeable a road as is to be found in any county in ireland  after proceeding a mile or so taking two or three turns to look for improvement i began to perceive evident signs on the part of the road of retrograding into laneism the county had evidently deserted it and though made for cars and coaches its traffic appeared to be now confined to donkeys carrying turf home from the bog in double kishes on their back presently the fragments of a bridge presented themselves but they too were utterly fallen away from their palmy days and in their present state afforded but indifferent steppingstones over a bog stream which ran or rather crept across the road these however i luckily traversed and was rewarded by finding a broken down entrance to a kind of wood on the right hand in ireland particularly in the poorer partsto rank among which county leitrim has a right which will not be disputeda few trees together are always the recognised sign of a demesne of a gentlemans seat or the place where a gentlemans seat has been and i directly knew that this must be a demesne but ah how impoverished if one might judge from outward appearances two brick pillars from which the outside plaster had peeled off and the coping fallen gave evidence of former gates the space was closed up with a loose built wall but on the outer side of each post was a little well worn footpath made of soft bog mould i of course could not resist such temptation and entered the demesne the road was nearly covered with that short dry grass which stones seem to throw up when no longer polished by the wealthier portion of man or brute kind  about thirty feet from the gap a tall fir had half fallen and lay across the road so that a man should stoop to walk under it it was a perfect barrier to any equipage however humble and the roots had nearly refixed themselves in their reversed position showing that the tree had evidently been in that fallen state for years  the usual story thought i of connaught gentlemen an extravagant landlord reckless tenants debt embarrassment despair and ruin well i walked up the deserted avenue and very shortly found myself in front of the house oh what a picture of misery of useless expenditure unfinished pretence and premature decay  the house was two stories high with large stone steps up to the front door with four windows in the lower and six in the upper story and an area with kitchens c below the entire roof was off one could see the rotting joists and beams some fallen some falling the rest ready to fall like the skeleton of a felon left to rot on an open gibbet the stone steps had nearly dropped through into the area the rails of which had been wrenched up the knocker was still on the doora large modern lionheaded knocker but half the door was gone on creeping to the doorsill i found about six feet of the floor of the hall gone alsostolen for fire wood but the joists of the flooring were there and the whitewash of the walls showed that but a few a very few years back the house had been inhabited i leaped across the gulf at great risk of falling into the cellar and reached the bottom of the stairs here my courage failed me all that was left was so damp and so rotten so much had been gradually taken away that i did not dare to go up the doors on the ground floor would not open the ceiling above me was all gone and i could see the threatening timbers of the roof which seemed only hanging till they had an opportunity of injuring some one by their fall i crept out of the demidoor again and down the ruined steps and walked round the mansion not only was there not a pane of glass in the whole but the window frames were all gone everything that wanted keeping was gone everything that required care to preserve it had perished time had not touched it time had evidently not yet had leisure to do his work he is sure but slow ruin works fast enough unaided where once he puts his foot time would have pulled down the chimneysruin had taken off the slates time would have bulged the wallsruin brought in the rain rotted the timbers and assisted the thieves poor old time will have but little left him at ballycloran the gardens had been large half were now covered by rubbish heaps and the other half consisted of potato patches and round the outhouses i saw clustering a lot of those wretched cabins which the poor irish build against a deserted wall when they can find one as jackdaws do their nests in a superannuated chimney in the front there had been i presume a tolerably spacious lawn with a drive through it surrounded on all sides except towards the house by thick trees the trees remained but the lawn the drive and the flower patches which of course once existed there were now all alike equally prolific in large brown dock weeds and sorrels there were two or three narrow footpaths through and across the space up to the cabins behind the house but other marks of humanity were there none  a large ash apparently cut down years ago with the branches still on it was stretched somewhat out of the wood on this i sat lighted a cigar and meditated on this characteristic specimen of irish life the sun was setting beautifully behind the trees and its imperfect light through the foliage gave the unnatural ruin a still stronger appearance of death and decay and brought into my mind thoughts of the wrong oppression misery and despair to which some one had been subjected by what i saw before me  i had not been long seated when four or five ragged boys and girls came through the wood driving a lot of geese along one of the paths when they saw me they all came up and stood round me as if wondering what i could be i could learn nothing from themthe very poor irish children will never speak to you but a middle aged man soon followed them he told me the place was called ballycloran he did not know who it belonged to a gintleman in dublin recaved the rints and a very stiff gintleman he was too and hard it was upon them to pay two pound tin an acre for the garden there and that half covered with the ould house and the bricks and rubbish only on behalf of the bog that was convaynient and plinty of the timber tho that was rotten and illigant outhouses for the pigs and the geese and the ould bricks of the wall wor good manure for the praties this in all my farming i had never dreamt of but times was very hard on the poor the praties being ninepence a stone in carrick all last summer god help the poor the crayturs for the gintlemin their raal frinds that should be couldnt help thimselves now let alone othersand so on now speaking of his sorrow and poverty and again descanting on the illigance of his abode i could only learn that a family called the macdermots had lived there some six or seven years back that they were an unfortunate people he had heard tell but he had not been in the country then and it was a bloody story c c c the evening was drawing on and the time for my coach to come was fast approaching so i was obliged to leave ballycloran unsatisfied as to its history and to return to drumsna  here i had no time to make further inquiries as mr hartleys servants always keep their time and very shortly the four horses clattered down the hill into the village i got up behind for mcc the guard was an old friend of mine and after the usual salutations and strapping of portmanteaus and shifting down into places as mcc knows everything i began to ask him if he knew anything of a place called ballycloran  deed then sir and i do said he and good reason have i to know and well i knew those that lived in it ruined and black and desolate as ballycloran is now and between drumsna and boyle he gave me the heads of the following story and reader if i thought it would ever be your good fortune to hear the history of ballycloran from the guard of the boyle coach i would recommend you to get it from him and shut my book forthwith     chapter ii  the macdermot family   mccs story runs thus about sixty years ago a something macdermot true milesian pious catholic and descendant of king somebody died somewhere having managed to keep a comfortable little portion of his ancestors royalties to console him for the loss of their sceptre he having two sons and disdaining to make anything but estated gentlemen of them made over in some fictitious manner for in those righteous days a roman catholic could make no legal will to his eldest the estate on which he lived and to the youngest that of ballycloranabout six hundred as bad acres as a gentleman might wish to call his own but thaddeus otherwise thady macdermot being an estated gentleman must have a gentlemans residence on his estate and the house of ballycloran was accordingly built had thady macdermot had ready money it might have been well built but though an estated gentleman he had none he had debts even when his father died and though he planned ordered and agreed for a house such as he thought the descendant of a connaught prince might inhabit without disgrace it was ill built half finished and paid for by long bills this however is so customary in poor ireland that it but little harassed thady he had a fine showy house with stables c gardens an avenue and a walk round his demesne and his neighbours had no more it was little he cared for comfort but he would not be the first of the macdermots that would not be respectable when his house was finished thady went into county galway and got himself a wife with two thousand pounds fortune for which he had to go to law with his brotherinlaw the lawsuit the continual necessity of renewing the bills with which the builder in carrick on shannon every quarter attacked him the fruitless endeavour to make his tenants pay thirty shillings an acre for halfreclaimed bog and a somewhat strongly developed aptitude for potheen sent poor thady to another world rather prematurely and his son and heir lawrence came to the throne at the tender age of twelve the galway brotherinlaw compromised the lawsuit the builder took a mortgage on the property from the boys guardian the mother gave new leases to the tenants larry went to school at longford and mrs mac kept up the glory of ballycloran  at the age of twenty lawrence or larry married a milesian damsel portionless but of true descent the builder from carrick had made overtures about a daughter he had at home and offered poor larry his own house as her fortune but the blood of the macdermots could not mix with the lime and water that flowed in a builders veins he therefore made an enemy where he most wanted a friend and brought his wife home to live with his mother in order that we may quickly rid ourselves of encumbrances it may be as well to say that during the next twentyfive years his mother and wife died he had christened his only son thaddeus after his grandfather and his only daughter had been christened euphemia after her grandmother he had never got over that deadly builder with his horrid percentage coming out of the precarious rents twice indeed had writs been out against him for his arrears and once he had received notice from mr hyacinth keegan the oily attorney of carrick that mr flannelly meant to foreclose rents were greatly in arrear his credit was very bad among the dealers in mohill with carrick he had no other dealings than those to which necessity compelled him with mr flannelly the builder and larry macdermot was anything but an easy man  thady was at this time about twentyfour as had been the case with his father he had been educated at a country school he could read and write but could do little more he was brought up to no profession or business he acted as his fathers agent over the propertyby which i mean to signify that he occupied himself in harrowing the tenantry for money which they had no means of paying he was occasionally head driver and ejector and he considered as irish landlords are apt to do that he had an absolute right over the tenants as feudal vassals still they respected and to a certain extent loved him for why wasnt he the masthers son and wouldnt he be the masther hisself and he had a regard perhaps an affection for the poor creatures against any one else he would defend them and would they but coin their bones into pounds shillings and pence he would have been as tender to them as a man so nurtured could be with all his faults thady was perhaps a better man than his father he was not so indomitably idle had he been brought up to anything he would have done it he was more energetic and felt the degradation of his position he felt that his family was sinking lower and lower daily but as he knew not what to do he only became more gloomy and more tyrannical beyond this he had acquired a strong taste for tobacco which he incessantly smoked out of a dhudheen and was content to pass his dull life without excitement or pleasure  euphemia or feemy was about twenty she was a tall dark girl with that bold upright wellpoised figure which is so peculiarly irish she walked as if all the blood of the old irish princes was in her veins her step at any rate was princely feemy also had large bright brown eyes and long soft shining dark hair which was divided behind and fell over her shoulders or was tied with ribands and she had a wellformed nose as all coming of old families have and a bright olive complexion only the olive was a little too brown the skin a little too coarse and then feemys mouth was oh half an inch too long but her teeth were white and good and her chin was well turned and short with a dimple on it large enough for any finger venus might put there in all feemy was a fine girl in the eyes of a man not too much accustomed to refinement her hands were too large and too red but if feemy got gloves sufficient to go to mass with it was all she could do in that way and though feemy had as fine a leg as ever bore a pretty girl she was never well shodher shoes were seldom clean often slipshod usually in holes and her stockingsbut no i will not further violate the mysteries of feemys wardrobe but if the beautiful girls of this poor country knew but half the charms which neatness has they would not so often appear as poor feemy too usually appeared  like her brother she was ardent and energetic if she had aught to be ardent about she was addicted to novels when she could get them from the dirty little circulating library at mohill she was passionately fond of dancing which was her chief accomplishment she played on an old spinnet which had belonged to her mother and controlled the motions and actions of the two barefooted damsels who officiated as domestics at ballycloran  such was the family at ballycloran in the summer of 183 and though not perfect i hope they have charms enough to make a further acquaintance not unacceptable     chapter iii  the tenantry of ballycloran   thady said old macdermot as he sat eating stirabout and thick milk over a great turf fire one morning about the beginning of october thady will you be getting the money out of them born divils this turn and they owing it some two some three years this november bad cess to them for tenants thady i say shouted or rather screamed the old man as his son continued silently eating his breakfast thady i say have they the money at all at all any of them or is it stubborn they are theres flannelly and keegan with their dd papers and bills and costs will you be making out the £142 7s 6d before christmas for the hellhounds or its themll be masters in ballycloran then let the boys see the landlord theyll have over them that time  well larry said the son unless in a passion he always called his father by his baptismal name or rather by its abbreviation whats the use going on that way before the girls there and feemy too feemy however was reading the mysterious assassin and paying little heed to her fathers lamentations when were done and the things is out well have a look at the rentbook and send for the boys to come in and if they havent it why pat brady must go round agin and see what he can do with the potatoes and oats and the pigs but the times larry is very hard on them too hard entirely so it is poor things  poor things said the father and aint i a poor thing and wont you and feemy be poor things hard times too who is the times hardest on see that sneaking ould robber flannelly that cozened my fathergood father for himwith such a house as this thats falling this day over his sons head and it not hardly fifty years built bad luck to it for a house see that ould robber flannelly who has been living and thriving on it for all them years and a stone or stick not as good as paid for yet and he getting two hundred a year off the land from the crayturs of tenants  true enough it was that mr joe flannelly of carrickonshannon whatever might have been the original charge of building the ballycloran mansion now claimed £200 a year from that estate to which his ingenious friend and legal adviser mr hyacinth keegan usually managed to add certain mysterious costs and ceremonious expenses which made each half years rent of larry macdermots own house about £140 before the poor man had managed to scrape it together to add to this annoyance mr macdermot had continually before his eyes the time which he could not but foresee was not distant when this hated flannelly would come down on the property itself insist on being paid his principal and probably not only sell but buy ballycloran itself and whither then would the macdermots betake themselves  often and often did larry in his misfortunes regret the slighted offers of sally flannellys charms and cash oh had he but then condescended to have married the builders daughter he would not now have been the builders slave but sally flannelly was now sally keegan the wife of hyacinth keegan esq attorney who if he had not the same advantages as larry in birth and blood had compensation for his inferiority in cash and comforts when the poor man thought of these thingsand he did little else now but think of thembitterly though generally in silence he cursed him whom he looked upon as his oppressor and incubus it never occurred to him that if mr flannelly built the house he lived in he should be paid for it he never reflected that he had lived to the extent of and above his precarious income as if his house had been paid for that instead of passing his existence in hating the carrick tradesman he should have used his industry in finding the means to pay him he sometimes blamed his father having an indefinite feeling that he ought not to have permitted flannelly to have anything to do with ballycloran after building it but himself he never blamed people never do it is so much easier to blame othersand so much more comfortable mr macdermot thus regarded his creditor as a vulgar lowborn bloodsucker who having by chicanery obtained an unwarrantable hold over him was determined if possible to crush him the builder on the other hand who had spent a long life of constant industry but doubtful honesty in scraping up a decent fortune looked on his debtor as one who gave himself airs to which his poverty did not entitle him and was determined to make him feel that though he could not be the father he could be the master of a rale gintleman  after the short conversation between father and son the breakfast passed over in silence the father finished his stirabout and turned round to the blazing turf to find consolation there feemy descended into the kitchen to scold the girls give out the dinnerif there was any to give out and to do those offices whatever they be in performing which all irish ladies bred born and living in moderate countryhouses pass the first two hours after breakfast in the kitchen thady took his rentbook and went into an outhouse which he complimented by the name of his office at the door of which he was joined by pat brady now pat was an appendage unfortunately very necessary in ireland to such an estate as macdermots and his business was not only to assist in collecting the rents by taking possession of the little crops and driving the cows or the pig but he was moreover expected to know who could and who could not make out the money to have obtained and always have ready that secret knowledge of the affairs of the estate which is thought to be and is so necessary to the managing of the irish peasantry in the way they are managed pat brady was all this moreover he had as little compunction in driving the cow or the only pig from his neighbour or cousin and in selling off the oats or potatoes of his uncle or brotherinlaw as if he was doing that which would be quite agreeable to them but still he was liked on the estate he had a manner with him which had its charms to them he was a kind of leader to them in their agrarian feelings and troubles and though the tenants of ballycloran half feared they all liked and courted pat brady  the most remarkable feature in his personal appearance was a broken nose not a common ordinary broken nose such as would give it an apparent partiality to the right or left cheek nor such as would by indenting it give the face that goodnatured look which irish broken noses usually possess pat bradys broken nose was all but flattened on to his face as if it had never lifted its head after the fatal blow which had laid it low he was strongbuilt roundshouldered bowlegged about five feet six in height and he had that kind of external respectability about him which a tolerably decent hat strong brogues and worsted stockings give to a man when those among whom he lives are without such luxuries when i add to the above particulars that pat was chief minister adviser and confidential manager in young macdermots affairs i have said all that need be said the development of his character must be left to disclose itself  well pat began his master seating himself on the solitary old chair which with a still older looking desk on four shaking legs comprised the furniture of macdermots rentoffice what news from mohill today was there much in the fair at all  well yer honor then for them as had money to buy the fair was good enough but for them as had money to get it was as bad as them that wor afore it and as them as is likely to come afther it  were the boys in it pat  they wor yer honor the most of em  well pat  oh they wor just there thats all  tim brady should have got the top price for that oats of his pat  maybe he might masther thady  what did he get there should be twelve barrels there  eleven or thereabouts yer honor  did he sell it all yesterday  divil a grain then at all at all he took to the fair yesterday  bad manners to him and why didnt he why he owes and thady turned over the old book five half years this gale and theres no use gammoning father must get the money off the land or flannelly will help himself  i knows masther thady i knows all about it tim has between five and six acres and he owes twentytwo pound tin his oats is worth maybe five pound fifteenfrom that to six pound and his cow about six pound more thats all tim has barring the brats and the mother of them an he knows right well yer honor if he brings you the price of the oats you wouldnt let him off that way for the cow should folly the oats as is nathural the cabin would be saized next so tim ses if you choose to take the corn yourself you can do sowell an good and save him the throuble of bringin it to mohill  did the widow reynolds sell her pig  she did yer honor for two pound tin  and she owes seven pound and dan coulahan  dan didnt cut the oats good or bad  ill cut it for him then was ould tierney there  he war yer honor and i was tellin him yer honor id be wantin the money this week an i axed him to stip up o friday mornin an sis i misthur tierneyfor since he made out the mare and the ould car its misthur tierney he goes byits a fine saison any way for the corn sis i the lord be praised an the hay all saved on thim illigant bottoms of yours misthur tierney the masther was glad to hear the cocks was all up afore the heavy rain was come well pat sis he ill be at ballycloran o friday plase god but its little ill have with me but myself an if the masthur likes the corn an the hay he may just take them av its plazin to him for the divil a cock or grain will i sell an the prices so bad  obstinate ould fool why pat he must have the money  money to be shure he has the money misthur thady but maybe hed be the bigger fool if he gave it to your father  do the boys mane to say they wont pay the rent at all  they mane to say they cant an its nearly thrue for them  was joe reynolds at the fair pat  he wor not thats to say he wor not at the fair but i seen him in the evening with the other boys from drumleesh at mrs mulreadys  them boys has always the money when they want a drop of whiskey by dad if they go to mulreadys with the money in their pockets on a tuesday wheres the wonder they come here with them empty on a friday fetch me a coal for the pipe pat  whilst pat walked into the kitchen for a lighted piece of turf hibernice coal to kindle his patrons pipe thady stuck the said pipe in his jaw and continued poring over the unsatisfactory figures of the ballycloran rentbook  i tell you what it is pat said he after finishing the process of blowing and drawing and throwing the coal on the earthen floor and pressing down the hot burning tobacco with the top of his forefinger repeatedly misthur joe reynolds will out of that i told him so last april and divil a penny of his weve seen since he dont do the best he can for us and my belief is he hinders the others eh brady and he looked up into bradys face for confirmation or refutation of this opinion but that gentleman contrary to his usual wont seemed to have no opinion on the matter he continued scratching his head and swinging one leg while he stood on the other thady finding that his counsellor said nothing continued  joe reynolds will out of that this time dyou hear what has he on that bit of land of his  pratees mostly misthur thady he had half an acre of whate he parted that on the ground to ould tierney he owed tierney money  an so the tenants buy the crops from one another and yet wont pay their own rents well my fathers to blame himself av hed put a man like keegan over them or have let the land to some rough hand as would make them pay divil a much he need care for flannelly this day  an youd be for puttin a stranger over thim misthur thady an they that would stand between you an all harum or the masthur or the old masthur afore him becaze of the dirthy money and becaze a blagguard and a black ruffian like flannelly has an ould paper signed by the masthur or the like an as for mr hyacinth keeganim thinking the first time he goes collectin on the lands of drumleesh its a warm welcome hell be gettin at any rate hed have more recates in his carcass than in his pocket that day  thats very fine talk pat but if keegan had them hed tame them as he has others before not but id be sorry they should be in his hands the robber bad as they are but itll come to that whether or no hows my father to get this money for flannelly  dn flannelly was bradys easy solution of the family difficulties let him take the house he built and be dd to him and if we cant build a betther one for the masthur and miss feemy and you without his help may praties choke me  by dad if hed take the house and leave the ground hes my welcome and ceade mille faltha pat but the land will stick to the house and mark me when ould flannelly dies an the divil die along with him mr keegan of carrick will write himself hyacinth keegan esquire of ballycloran  may i nivir see that day an he an i alive amen said brady as he crossed himself in sign of the sacred truth of his wish but i think masthur thady when you come to consider of it youll find plenty of manes of keepin mr keegan and mrs keegan out of the parlour of ballycloran but about joe reynolds yer honor was sayin  i was saying that divil another potato he should dig in drumleesh nor another grain of corn shall he sow or rape thats what i was saying  well misthur thady youre the masthur thank god an if you say so it must be done but joe reynolds is not that bad either he was sayin tho at mrs mulreadys that he expected little from yer honor but just leave to go where he liked and lave the cow and the praties behind him  what wor they saying at mulreadys pat  they were only jist passin their remarks yer honor about how thick you war this time back with captain ussher an miss feemy too an the masthur an that when the likes of him wor as one of the family its little the likes of them would be gettin now from ballycloran only hard words and maybe a help to carrick gaol  because captain ussher visits at ballycloran is that any reason why he should interfere between my father and his tenants  sorra a one av me knows then misthur thady only that the tenants is no good frinds to the captain nor why should they an he going through the counthry with a lot of idle blagguards with arms an guns sazin the poor divils for nothin at all only for thryin to make out the rint for yer honor with a thrifle of potheen thats quare friendship ay an its the truth im tellin you misthur thady for hes no frind to you or yours shure isnt pat reynolds in ballinamore bridewell on his account an two other boys from the mountains behind drumleesh becaze they found a thrifle of half malted barley up there among them an be the same token joe was sayin if the frind of the family war parsecuting them that way an puttin his brother in gaol whilst the masthur wouldnt rise a finger barrin for the rint the sooner he an his were off the estate the betther hed like it for joe sed hed not be fightin agin his own masthur but whin you war not his masthur any morethen let every one look to hisself  whilst brady was giving this short exposé of the feelings displayed at the little whiskey shop in mohill on the previous fair day young macdermot was pulling hard at the dhudheen as if trying to hide his embarrassment in smoke brady paused for some time and then added  joe mostly leads those boys up at drumleesh an hard to lead they are im thinking captain ussher with all his revenue of peelers an his guns may meet his match there yit theyll hole him av he goes on much farthur as shure as my names pat  theyll get the worst of that bradynot that i care a thrawneen for him and his company its true for you he is persecuting them too far what with revenue police constabulary police and magistrates warrants they wont let them walk to mass quietly next i didnt care what they did to master myles but theyd have the worst of it in the end  and its little you ought to care for the same captain misthur thady av you heard all its little hes making of miss feemys name with the police captain and the young gauger and young james fitzsimon when theyre over there at ballinamore togetherand great nights they have of it too though they all have it in mohill hes to marry miss feemy if so indeed but then isnt he a black protestant sorrow take them for protestants theres hyacinth keegan calls himself a protestant now his father warnt ashamed of the ould religion when he sarved processes away to drumshambo  and what wor the gentlemen saying about feemy pat  oh yer honor how could i know what gentlemin is saying over their punch together only they do be sayin in ballinamore that the captain doesnt spake that dacently of miss feemy as if they wor to be man and wife sorrow blister his tongue the day hed say a bad word of her  faith hed better take care of himself if its my sister hes playing his game with hell find out though there aint much to be got worth having at ballycloran now as long as theres a macdermot in it he may still get the traitment a blackguard desarves if he plays his tricks with feemy  pat saw that his object had been gained he suspected that no warm feelings of friendship existed in his master towards the aforesaid captain and he was determined there should be none if he could help it he was not wrong in his surmises for from the constant visits of myles ussher to ballycloran people had for some time been saying that he meant to marry feemy they now began to say that he ought to do so  while her brother and his minister are discussing that subject and otherssettling who could pay or who should pay at the convocation of the tenants to be held on the coming friday and who couldnt and who should be ejected and who notwe will obtain a little insight into captain usshers affairs and account for the residence of so gallant a gentleman in the little town of mohill     chapter iv  myles ussher   every one knows that ireland for her sins maintains two distinct regularly organised bodies of police the duties of the one being to prevent the distillation of potheen or illicit whiskey those of the other to check the riots created by its consumption these forces for they are in fact military forces have each their officers subofficers and privates as the army has their dress full dress and half dress their arms field arms and house arms their barracks stations and military regulations their captains colonels and commanderinchief but called by other names and in fact each body is a regularly disciplined force only differing from the standing army by being carried on in a more expensive manner  the first of thesethat for preventing the distillation of potheen commonly called the revenue policewas at the time of our story honoured by the services of myles ussher he held the office of one of the subinspectors in the county of leitrim and he resided in the town of mohill he had a body of about fiveandtwenty men under him with a sergeant and his duty was as i have before said to prevent the distillation of potheen this was only to be done by seizing it when made or in the process of making and as a considerable portion of the fine levied in all cases possible from the dealers in the trade became the perquisite of the subinspector or officer effecting the seizure the situation in a wild lawless district was one of considerable emolument consequently gentlemen of repute and good family were glad to get their sons into the service and at the present time a commission in the revenue police is considered if not a more fashionable at any rate a more lucrative appointment than a commission in the army among these officers some of course would be more active than others and would consequently make more money but it will be easily imagined that however much the activity of a subinspector of revenue police might add to his character and standing at headquarters it would not be likely to make him popular in the neighbourhood in which he resided  myles ussher was most active in the situation which he filled whether an impartial judge would have said that he was too much so would be a question difficult to settle as i have no impartial judge on the subject to whom i can refer but the persons among whom he lived thought that he was at the time i allude to about ten years ago a great deal of whiskey was distilled in the mountains running between the counties of leitrim and cavan and in different parts of the county leitrim father mathews pledge was then unknown the district is a wild country not much favoured by gentlemens residences and very poor and though it may seem to be an anomaly it will always be found to be the case that the poorer the people are the more they drink and consequently captain ussher as he was usually called in the neighbourhood found sufficient occupation for himself and his men  now the case is different the revenue police remain but their duties have in most districts gone and they may be seen patrolling the roads with their officers accompanying them being bound to walk so many miles a day it is very seldom one hears of their effecting a seizure and their inactivity is no doubt owing to the prevalence of father mathews pledge of total abstinence  myles ussher was a protestant from the county antrim in the north of ireland the illegitimate son of a gentleman of large property who had procured him the situation which he held he had been tolerably well educated that is he could read and write sufficiently understood somewhat of the nature of figures and had learnt and since utterly forgotten the latin grammar he had natural abilities somewhat above par was goodlooking strongly made and possessed that kind of courage which arises more from animal spirits and from not having yet experienced the evil effects of danger than from real capabilities of enduring its consequences myles ussher had never yet been hit in a duel and would therefore have no hesitation in fighting one he had never yet been seriously injured in riding and would therefore ride any horse boldly he had never had his head broken in a row and therefore would readily go into one he cared little for bodily pain if it did not incapacitate himlittle at least for any pain he had as yet endured and his imagination was not strong enough to suggest any worse evil and this kind of courage which is the species by far most generally met with was sufficient for the life he had to lead  but the quality in which ussher chiefly excelled and which was most conducive to give him the character which he certainly held in the country for courage talent and gallantry was his selfconfidence and assurance he believed himself inferior to none in powers of body and mind and that he could accomplish whatever he perseveringly attempted he had moreover an overwhelming contempt for the poor amongst whom his duties so constantly brought him and it is not therefore wonderful that he was equally feared and execrated by them i should also state that myles ussher had had sagacity enough to keep some of the money which he had received and this added not a little both to his reputation and standing in the country and also to the real power which he possessed for in connaught ready money is scarce and its scarcity creates its importance  this then was feemys lover and she certainly did love him dearly he had all the chief ornaments of her novel heroeshe was handsome he carried arms was a man of danger and talked of deeds of courage he wore a uniform he rode more gracefully talked more fluently and seemed a more mighty personage than any other one whom feemy usually met besides he gloried in the title of captain and would not that be sufficient to engage the heart of any girl in feemys position let alone any irish girl to whom the ornaments of arms are always dear but whether he loved her as truly might i fear be considered doubtful if so why were they not married  larry macdermot was too brokenhearted a man and too lowspirited to have objected to myles on the ground of his being a protestant it was not that he was indifferent about his religion but he had not heart enough left to be energetic on any subject in other respects myles was more than a match for his daughter in the present fallen condition of the family but the matter had not even been mentioned to him by his daughter or her lover ussher was constantly at ballycloranwas in the habit of riding over from mohill only three miles almost daily when disengaged giving his horse to patsy the only male attendant at ballycloran and staying the whole morning or the evening there without invitation and larry if he never seemed particularly glad at any rate never evinced any dislike to his visits  whatever war the subinspector might wage against run spirits in the mountains and bogs he always appeared on good terms with it at ballycloran and as the macdermots had but little else to give in the way of hospitality this was well  young thady could not but see that his sister was attached to ussher but he knew that she could not do better than marry him and if he considered much about it he thought that she was only taking her fun out of it as other girls did and that it would all come right thady was warmly attached to his sister he had had no one else really to love he was too sullen at his prospects too gloomy from his situation to have chosen for himself any loved one on whom to expend his heart he was of a disposition too saturnine though an irishman to go and look for love when it did not fall in his way and all that he had to give he gave to his sister but it must be remembered that poor thady had no refinement how should he and though he would let no one injure feemy if he could help it he hardly knew how effectually to protect her his suspicions were now aroused by his counsellor pat brady but the effect was rather to create increased dislike in him against ussher than to give rise to any properly concerted scheme for his sisters welfare  on the evening previous to the fair at mohill mentioned in the last chapter captain ussher with a party of his men had succeeded in making a seizure of some halfmalted barley in a cabin on the margin of a little lake on the low mountains which lay between mohill and cashcarrigan he had as in these cases was always his practice received information from a spy in his pay who accompanied him dressed as one of his own men to prevent any chance of his being recognised this mans name was cogan and he had been in the habit of buying illicit whiskey from the makers at a very cheap rate and carrying it round to the farmers houses and towns for sale whereby he obtained considerable profitbut at considerable risk with this employment captain ussher had made himself acquainted and instead of seizing the man whilst in possession of the whiskey he had sounded him and finding him sufficiently a villain had taken him into his pay as a spy this trade cogan found more lucrative even than the former but also more dangerous as if detected he might reckon on his death as certain he still continued to buy the spirits from the people but in smaller quantities he offered lower prices and though he nominally kept up the trade it was more for the purpose of knowing where the potheen was than of buying and selling it  it was not wonderful therefore that more seizures than ever had been lately made and that the men were getting more cautious and at the same time more irate and violent in their language in the present instance the party had come on the cabin in question unawares not that they might not have been noticed but that the people were confident of not being suspected no whiskey had been run there and the barley had only lately been brought in turf kishes from another cabin where it was not thought to be safe  three men and an old woman were found in the cabin when captain ussher entered with three of his own men on being questioned they denied the existence of either whiskey malt or barley but on searching the illicit article was found in the very kishes in which it had been brought they were easily discovered shoved into the dark chimney corner farthest from the door  dat i may never see the light began the old woman if i thought it wor anything but the turf and jist the kishes that barney smith left there the morn and he to say nothing of the barley and bring all these throubles on me and yer honerthe like of him the spalpeen  never mind my trouble my dear said ussher it is little we think of the trouble of easing you and whos barney smith maam  oh then barneys jist my daughters own son and he coming down from the mountains with turf and said he must lave the kishes here till he just went back round loch sheen with the ass hed borrowed from paddy byrne and hed be  and very good natured it was of him to leave you the malt instead of the turf and who are you my good men  the men had continued smoking their pipes quietly at the fire without stirring  we be sthrangers here yer honer said one that is not sthrangers jist but we dont live here yer honer  where do you live and whats your names  i and joe smith live down away jist on the road to cash about half a mile out of this and tim reynolds he lives away at drumleesh on mr macdermots land and my names paddy byrne  oh oh so one of you is father of the lad who brought the donkey and the other the owner of it and you neither of you knew what was in the kishes  sorrow a know yer honer ye see barney brought them down here from the mountains when we warnt in it and it war some of the boys up there was getting him to get away the malt unknownst hearing of yer honer maybe  ah yes i seewhose land is this on  counseller webbs yer honer  who holds the cabin and potato garden  i do your honer jist for my wifes mother ye see but i live down towards cash  ah very goodnatured of you to your wifes mother i hope the three of you have no objection to take a walk to mohill this evening  ochone ochone and its ruined well be yer honer and that i may never see the light if the boys knew it and yer honer wouldnt have the death of an ould woman on ye the old woman was exclaiming while the police began seizing the malt and making prisoners of the men  carol see and get an ass to put these kishes on said ussher killeen pass a rope across these fellows arms i suppose theyll go quiet  it was now full time for the men to arise when they found that the rope was to be fastened across their arms which meant that a rope was to be fastened on the right arm of one passed behind his back fastened to the arm of the second and so behind his back to the third smith and byrne the former of whom in spite of his protestations to the contrary was the inhabitant of the cabin had given the matter up as lost but as the other tim reynolds did in fact reside at drumleesh he thought he might still show some cause why he should not be arrested for visiting his friend joe smith  yer honer wont be afther taking an innocent boy like me began tim that knows nothing at all at all about it shure yer honer knows the masther mr thady down at ballycloran he will tell yer honer id nothing in life to do in it then dont you know yourself i live with joe reynolds down at drumleesh and war only up here jist gagging with the ould woman and the boys and knew nothing in lifehow could iabout the malt captain ussher  oh no mr reynolds of course you could not how could you as you justly observeparticularly being the brother of that inoffensive character mr joe reynolds and you living too on mr macdermots property you and your brother never ran whiskey at drumleesh i suppose why should a tenant of the macdermots escape any more than one of counsellor webbs  no yer honer in course not only you being so thick with the masther and that like and av hed spake a good word for meas why shouldnt heand i knowing nothing at all at all about it perhaps yer honer  im sorry mr reynolds i cannot oblige you in this little matter but thats not the way i do business come along killeen hurry its getting dd cold here by the water  with this captain ussher walked out of the cabin and the two men followed each having an end of the rope smith and byrne followed doggedly but silently but poor reynolds though no lawyer could not but feel that he was unjustly treated  and will i go to gaol then jist for coming up to see ould widow byrne captain  yes mr reynolds as far as i can foresee you will  then captain ussher its youll be sorry for the day you were trating that way an innocent boy that knows nothing at all at all about it  do you mean to be threatening me you ruffian  no captain ussher i doesnt threaten you but there is them as does and its this days work or this nights thats all the same will be the black night work to you its the like of you that makes ruffians of the boys about they isnt left the manes of living not even of getting the dhry pratees and when they tries to make out the rint with the whiskey which is not for themselves but for them as is your own friends you hunts them through the mountains and bogs like worried foxes and not that only but for them as does it and them as does not be doing it is all the same and its little the masther or for the like of that the masthers daughter either will be getting from being so thick with sich as youharrowing and sazing his tenants jist for your own fun and divarsion mind i am not threatening you captain ussher but its little good you or them as is in ballycloran will be getting for the work youre now doingwhat are you pulling at misther dye think i cant walk av myself without your hauling and pulling like a gossoon at a pigs hind leg  the last part of tims eloquence was addressed to the man who held the foremost end of the rope and who was following his officer at a rapid pace  captain ussher made no further answer to his remonstrating prisoner but marched on rapidly towards carrick after the advanced party with whom was cogan the informer he after having pointed out the cabin of course did not wait to be recognised by its occupiers this capture was the subject of the discussion held on the fairday at mulreadys whiskeyshop in mohill at which joe reynolds the prisoners brother had presided as brady informed thady macdermotor at any rate had taken the most noisy part to tell the truth our friend pat himself had been present all the evening at mulreadys and if he did not talk so loud he had said full as much as joe the latter was naturally indignant at the capture of his brother who in fact at the time was living in his cabin though he did hold an acre or two of ground in the same townland as joe smith and the widow byrne he was not however engaged in the potheen making there and though at the moment of the entrance of the police the party were all talking of the malt which had in fact been brought from byrnes cabin to that of his mother and brotherinlaw reynolds had really nothing to do with the concern  his known innocence made the party more indignant and they consequently swore that among them theyd put an end to our poor friend ussher or as joe reynolds expressed it well hole him till there arnt a bit left in him to hole now for the benefit of the ignorant i may say that holing a man means putting a bullet through him  the injuries done by the police were not however the only subject discussed at mulreadys that night  ribbonism about 183 was again becoming very prevalent in parts of ireland at any rate so said the stipendiary magistrates and the inspectors of police and if they said true county leitrim was full of ribbonmen and no town so full as mohill consequently the police subinspector at ballinamore captain greenough had his spies as well as captain ussher and joe reynolds was a man against whom secret information had been given joe was aware that he was a marked man and consequently if not actually a ribbonman was very well inclined to that or anything else which might be inimical to gaols policemen inspectors gaugers or any other recognised authority in fact he was a reckless man originally rendered so by inability to pay high rent for miserably bad land and afterwards becoming doubly so from having recourse to illegal means to ease him of his difficulties  he and many others in the neighbourhood of mohill somewhat similarly situated had joined together bound themselves by oaths and had determined to become ribbonmen their chief objects however at present were to free themselves from the terrors of captains ussher and greenough and to prevent their landlords ejecting them for nonpayment of rent it would be supposed a man of pat bradys discernment station and character would not have wished to belong to or have been admitted by so desperate a society but he nevertheless was not only of them but one of their leaders and it can only be supposed that he had his rasons  all these things were fully talked over at mulreadys that night the indignities offered to humanity by police of every kind the iniquities of all protestants the benefits likely to accrue to mankind from an unlimited manufacture of potheen and the injustice of rents were fully discussed on the latter head certainly brady fought the battle of his master and not unsuccessfully but not on the head that he had a right to his own rents but what he was to do about flannelly if he did not get them  and shure boys what would the ould masther do and what would mr thady do without the rint among yean ould flannelly dunning about him with his bonds and his bills and morgidges howd ye like to see the good ould blood thats in it now driven out by the likes of flannelly and keegan and them to be masthers in ballycloran  thats all very well pat and wed be sorry to see harum come to mr larry and the young masther along of such born robbers as them but is them dearer to us than our own flesh and blood as long as they and the like of themd stand between us and want the divil a keegan of them alld dare put a foot in ballycloran but who is it now rules all at ballycloran who but that bloody robber ussher theyd go through the country for him the born ruffianmay food choke himand he making little of them all the time bad manners to the like of him they say he never called an honest woman his mother will i mr brady be giving my blood for them and he putting my brother in gaol and all for sitting up warming his shins at loch sheen no may this be my curse if i do and joe reynolds swallowed a glass of whiskey and you may tell mr thady pat if he wants the boys to stick to him let him stick to them and not be helping a dd ruffian to be dhriving the lives out of them he should befriend and maybe he will want us and that soon and if hell stick to us now as his fathers always did sure its little he need be fearing flannelly and keegan by g the first foot they set in ballycloran they shall leave there forever if thady macdermot will help rid his fathers land of that bloody ruffian  its little mr thady loves the captain joe and its little he ever will i think however you can come up you know on friday and say your own say about your brother and the rint and all  and so i will come pat but theres all the rint i have and mrs mulready i think ll have the best part of that and he jingled a few halfpence in his pocket so ended the meeting previous to the conversation in macdermots rentoffice     chapter v  father john   the rev john mcgrath was priest of the parish of drumsna at the time of which we write this parish contains the post town of drumsna and the country adjacent including the townland and demesne of ballycloran at this time the spacious chapel which now stands on the hill about two miles out of drumsna had not been built and father johns chapel was situated on the road from drumsna to ballycloran near this he had built himself a small cottage in the quasigothic style for father john was a man of taste he rented also about twenty acres of land half of this being on the macdermots estate  the rev mr mcgrath is destined to appear somewhat prominently in this history and i must therefore be excused in giving a somewhat elaborate description of him  he had been like many of the present parish priests in ireland educated in france he had been at college at st omer and afterwards at paris and had officiated as a curé there he had consequently seen more of french manners and society than usually falls to the lot of irish theological students in that capital he was also which is equally unusual a man of good family and from his early avocations was more fitted than is generally the case with those of his order to mix in society he possessed also very considerable talents and much more than ordinary acquirements great natural bonhommie and perpetual good temper he was a thorough french scholar and had read the better portion of their modern literature on leaving paris he had gone to rome on a begging expedition to raise funds for building chapels in his own country and there too he had been well received and from thence he had returned to take possession of a populous parish in one of the very poorest parts of ireland  with all his acquirements however in many things father john was little better than a child though his zeal had enabled him to raise money for the church he could never keep any of his own he had always his little difficulties and though he sedulously strove to live within his income and never really much outstripped it he was always in want of money he had built his house and unlike his neighbour had managed to pay for it but he was always in trouble about it the rats were in the roof and his flooring was all warped and his windows would neither open nor shut and the damp would get to his books therefore though his cottage was exteriorly the prettiest house in his parish interiorly it was discomfort personified  a more hospitable man than father mcgrath never lived even in connaught he took a look in at dinner time as a personal favour and whatever might be the state of his larder his heart was always full and the emptiness of the former never troubled him he had not the slightest shame at asking any one to eat potatoes and cold mutton they all knew him and what they were likely to get at his house and if they did not choose they need not come whoever did come had as good as he had himself a more temperate man never lived but he had as much pleasure in seeing another man drink a tumbler of punch as any one else would in drinking it himself he kept under his own bed a great stone jar always partly at least full of whiskey of native manufacture and though were he alone the jar would long have remained untouched as it was it very often had to be refilled tumblers he had only two when his guests exceeded that the teacups made their appearance and he would naïvely tell his friends that he meant to buy tumblers when he got any money but heaven help them if he got in debt the people would never be paid  his whole domestic arrangements were on a par his crockery was of a most heterogeneous and scanty description his furniture of the most common kind put in bit by bit as it was found indispensable in two things only did father john show his extravagance in the first too his expenditure was only so to be called in comparison with that of others round him of the same profession it was thishe was always dressed like a gentleman father johns black coat was always black never rusty brown his waistcoat his trowsers his garters even shoes the same and not only did his clothes always look new but they were always well made as far as his figure would allow his hat was neat and his linen clean his hands too were always clean and when he was from home always gloved even his steady cob whom he called paul it was rumoured that he had called him st paul but the bishop objected together with his saddle and bridle was always neat this particular was nearly all that the polish of french society had left him and those who are accustomed to see irish priests will know that this peculiarity would be striking his other expensive taste was that of books he could not resist the temptation to buy books books of every sort from voluminous editions of st chrysostom to nicholas nicklebys and charles omalleys and consequently he had a great many but alas he had no bookshelves not one some few volumes those of every day use were piled on the top of one another in his little sittingroom the others were closely packed in great boxes in different parts of the cottagehis bedroom his little offertory his parlour and many in a little drawingroom as he called it but in which was neither chair nor table nor ever appeared the sign of fire no wonder the poor man complained the damp got to his books  in all other respects father john was a fair specimen of the irish priesthood he must have been an eloquent man for he had been sent on different foreign missions to obtain money for building chapels by preaching sermons but his appearance was anything but dignified he was very short and very fat and had little or no appearance of neck his face however was intelligent he had bright small black eyes a fine high forehead very white teeth and short thick curling dark hair  as i am on the subject of the church i might as well say now that his curate father cullen was unlike him in everything but his zeal for the church he was educated at maynooth was the son of a little farmer in the neighbourhood was perfectly illiteratebut chiefly showed his dissimilarity to the parish priest by his dirt and untidiness he was a violent politician the catholic emancipation had become law and he therefore had no longer that grievance to complain of but he still had national grievances respecting which he zealously declaimed when he could find a hearer repeal of the union was not at that time the common topic morning and night at work and at rest at table and even at the altar as it afterwards became but there were even then some who maintained that ireland would never be herself till the union was repealed and among these was father cullen he was as zealous for his religion as for his politics and he could become tolerable intimate with no protestant without thinking he was specially called on to convert him a disciple less likely to make converts than father cullen it would be difficult to imagine seeing that in language he was most violent and ungrammaticalin appearance most uncouthin argument most unfair he was impatient if any one spoke but himself he relied in all such arguments on his power of proving logically that his own church was the true church and as his education had been logical he put all his arguments into syllogisms if you could not answer him in syllogisms he conceived that you must be evidently to yourself in the wrong and that obstinacy alone prevented you from owning it father cullens redeeming point was his earnestnesshis reality he had no humbug about him whatever was there was real he had no possible appreciation for a joke and he understood no ridicule you might gull him and dupe him for ever he would never find you out his heart and mind were full of the roman catholic church and of his countrys wrongs he could neither think nor speak of aught beside  ussher was the only protestant whom this poor man was in the habit of meeting and he was continually attempting to convert him in which pursuit ussher rather encouraged him with the purpose of turning him into ridicule  such were the spiritual guides of the inmates of ballycloran and its neighbourhood  on the wednesday morning after the fair father john was sitting eating his breakfast in his little parlour attending much more to a book on the table before him than to the large lumps of bread and butter which he unconsciously swallowed when the old woman servant judy mccan opened the door and said  father john plase theres denis mcgovery wanting to see yer riverence below then  people in connaught always call the hall door and passage below the parlour or sittingroom above though in nine cases out of ten they are on the same floor  why then judy said father john with his mouth full bad manners to them maynt i eat a bit of breakfast in peace and quiet there was i at the widow byrnes all night destroyed with the cold and nothing the matter with her at last and now i must lose my breakfast as well as my sleep  its nothing of that sort im thinking father john but denis mcgovery is afther going to get married i hear  oh exclaimed father john thats a horse of another colour going to get married is he and why shouldnt he and he able to support a wife let him come in judy  it will be remembered that the above and below in the priests house were only terms of compliment and as denis mcgovery was standing in the hallthat is at the open door of the very room in which judy mccan had been announcing his attendancehe of course had heard what had passed therefore when father john said let him come in he wanted no further introduction but thrusting himself just through the door and taking hold of a scanty lock of hair on his forehead by way of reverential salutation he said iss yer honor  now laconic as this was it was intended to convey and did convey a full assent not only to judys assertion that he was afther going to get married but also to the priests remark that there was no good reason on earth why he shouldnt seeing that he was able to support a family  iss yer honor said denis mcgovery  well denisthatll do judy meaning that judy need not listen any longer at any rate within the roomso you are going to get married are you  didnt father cullen say anything to your riverence about it then  oh yes he did then i didnt remember it just at first when judy mentioned your name  iss yer riverence if ye plaze i am going to be married  the bridegroom in this case was a man about forty years of age who seemed certainly never to have eaten the bread of idleness for he was all gristle and muscle nor had he he was a smith living in drumsna and the reputed best shoer of horses in the neighbourhood and consequently was as the priest had said able to maintain a family in fact denis had the reputation of hoarded wealth for it was said he had thirty or forty pounds in the loan fund office at carrickonshannon he was a hardworking illfavoured saving man but as he was able to keep a comfortable home over a wife he had no difficulty in getting one  oh then it pleases me entirely because you are the boy thats both able and willing to pay your clergyman respectably as you should  in course your riverence though the likes of a poor boy like me hasnt much i wouldnt not be married dacently father john and in course i couldnt expect yer riverence to be doing it for nothing  for nothing indeed where would i be getting the coat on my back and the roof over my headno the poor themselves always make out something for me and you denis that are comfortable would of course be sorry to set a bad example to those that are not so  oh then yer riverence is poking yer fun at me  no fun at all denis if you that have the money dont pay your priest who is to id like to know fun indeed no but its good earnest im talking and if you have a character that you wish to support and to give your children after you its now you should be looking to it  denis mcgovery began twirling his hat round in his hand and bending his knees as if nonplussed he had known well enough beforehand what the priest would say to him and the priest too what answer he would get the question in these cases is which would cajole the other the best and of course the priest would have the best of it this may seem odd to those who do not know the country but did he not do so the roman catholic clergyman could not get even the moderate remuneration which he does receive for his laborious services  oh yer riverence continued denis attempting a grim smile you know its the young woman or her friends as always pays the priest mostly  and who is the young woman denis betsy cane isnt it  no father john said denis blushing almost black through his dark skin it aint betsy  not betsy cane why she told me three weeks ago you were to be married to her  and so i was yer riverence only ye see for a mistake as happened  a mistake was it she made the mistake or you  why it warnt exactly herself thin as did it it war her mother  her mother made a mistake what mistake did her mother make  along of the cow yer riverence denis seemed very slow of explaining and father john began to be impatient  what cow denis how did the mothers making a mistake about the cow prevent your marrying her daughter  why yer riverence then if youll let me ill jist explain the matter ould betsy canethats her mother you knowpromised me the brown cow yer riverence may know as is in the little garden behint the cabin for her daters fortin and says i to her well may be she may be worth four pound tin mrs cane four pound tin says she mr mcgovery and you to know no better than that and she to calve before christmas well then four pound tin indeedjist in that manner yer riverence well then i looks at the cow and she seemed a purty sort of a cow and i agreed to the bargain yer honer purviding the cow turned out to be with calf well yer honer now its no such thing but its sticking me she was entirely about the cow so now she got the cow and her daughter both at home and likely to for me  and so denis you broke your promise and refused to marry the girl you were engaged to because a cow was not in calf  no i didnt yer honer that is i did refuse to marry the girl why wouldnt i but i didnt break my promise becase i only promised purviding and you see father john they was only decaving me  well denis and who is it after all that you are going to have  well then its jist mary brady  what pat bradys sister is it  iss yer honer  and is her cow really in the family way  now yer riverence ll make a handle of that agin me  never mind denis how i handle the cow so long as you handle the calf but has mary a cow  no father john she aint got a cow then as i knows on  well denis and what fortune are you to get you are not the man would take a wife unless she brought something with her  well then its only jist a pair of young pigs and a small thrifle of change  a trifle of change eh then mr mcgovery i take it it wasnt only along of the mistake about a cow that you left poor betsy cane but you found you could do better i suppose  well then it might be jist a little of both but you see father john they war the first to decave me  well denis and whens the wedding to be  ohthen tomorrow evening if yer riverence plazes  what so soon denis take care perhaps after all betsy canes cow may calve see would you be too much in a hurry after the pigs  sorrow to the tongue of me then that i tould yer riverence a word about it  but what are you in such a hurry about wont the pigs do as well at pat bradys as

might be an excuse for your poverty but denis ill take care and if any one should say anything about the price of cows or the like ill tell them all it isnt betsy canes cow who wouldnt have the calf though she was engaged  denis mcgovery now hurried off father john called for judy to take away the cold tea and prepared to sally forth to some of his numerous parochial duties  but father mcgrath was doomed to still further interruptions he had not walked above a mile on his roadhe was going by ballycloranwhen coming down the avenue he saw pat brady with his master mr thady and of course he didnt pass without waiting to speak to them  well thady and well father john as they shook hands and well pat brady and well yer riverence as the latter made a motion with his hand towards his hat was the first salutation  it will be remembered that thady and the other had just been talking over affairs in the rentoffice and thady did not seem as though he were exactly in a good humour  so pat your sister is getting married to denis mcgovery ill tell you whatshe might do a deal worse  she might do what she plased for me father john but faix i was tired enough of her myself so you see denis is welcome to his bargain  what are you going to bring a wife of your own home then  devil a wife then axing your riverences pardon whatd i be doing with a wife  wholl keep the house over you now pat your sisters as good as gone  i wont be axing a woman to keep the house over me so marys welcome to go or she wor welcome to stay too for me i didnt ax her to have him and by the postles when denis is tired of his bargain hell be recollecting i wasnt axing him to have her  well thady i suppose you and feemy ll be at the wedding eh and pat you must make them bring captain ussher mrs mcgovery as is to be must have the captain at her wedding youll be there thady  oh pats been telling me about it and i suppose i and feemy must go down if brady chooses to ask the captain ive nothing to say its not for me to ask him and as hed only be quizzing at all he saw i think he might as well be away  ah thady but you never think of your priest think of the halfcrown it would be to me never mind pat you ask him hell come anywhere where miss feemy is likely to be eh thady  then i wish feemy had never set eyes on him father john and cant you be doing better than coupling her name with that of his that way and he a black ruffian and a protestant and filling her head up with nonsense i thought you had more respect for the family well pat jist go down to them boys and do as i was telling youand pat walked off  and what more respect for the family could i have thady than to wish to see your sister decently married and father john turned round to walk back with young macdermot the way he was going what better respect could i have if captain ussher were not a proper young man in general your father and you thady wouldnt be letting him be so much with feemy and now were on it if you did not mean it to be a match and if you did not mean they should marry why have you let him be so much at ballycloran seeing your father doesnt meddle much in anything now  thats just the reason father john i couldnt be seeing all day who was in it and who was not besides feemys grown now shes no mother and must learn to care for herself  no thady shes no mother and no father poor girl that can do much for her and isnt that the reason you should care the more for her mind im not blaming you thady for i know you do care for her and you only want to know how to be a better brother to her and what could she do better than marry captain ussher  but isnt he a black protestant father john and dont the country hate him for the way hes riding down the poor  he may be protestant thady and yet not black mind im not saying i wouldnt rather see feemy marry a good catholic but if shes set her heart on a protestant i wouldnt have you be against him for that thats not the way to show your religion its only nursing your pride and sure mightnt she make a catholic of him too  oh father cullen has tried that  well i wouldnt tell him so but i think your sister would show more power in converting a young fellow like ussher than poor cullen and then as to his riding down the poor you know every one must do his duty and if the boys will be acting against the laws why of course they must bear the consequences not but that i think captain ussher is too hard upon them but thady are you telling me the truth in this is it not that you fear the young man wont marry feemy rather than that he will  why father john  ill tell you why thady this captain ussher has been the intimate friend in your house now for more than six months back he has been received there willingly by your father and willingly by yourself but still more willingly by feemy all the country knows this of course they all said feemy was to be married to him and who could say why she shouldnt if her father and brother agreed i always thought it would be a match and though as i said before i would sooner have married feemy to a good catholic i should have thought myself much exceeding my duty as her priest had i said a word to persuade her against it now people begin to sayand you know what they say in the parish always comes to my earsthat captain ussher thinks too much of himself to take a wife from ballycloran and that he has only been amusing himself with your sister and i must tell you thady if you didnt know more of captain ussher and his intentions than you seem to do it isnt today you should be thinking what you ought to do  thady walked on with his head down and the priest went on  ive been meaning to speak to you of this some days back for your poor father is hardly capable to manage these things now and its the respect i have for the family and the love i have for feemyand for the matter of that for you toothat makes me be mentioning it you aint angry with your priest are you thady for speaking of the welfare of your sister if you are ill say no more  oh no angry father john in course i aint angry but what can i do then bad luck to the day that ussher darkened the door of ballycloran by dad if he plays feemy foul hell shortly enter no door barring that of hell fire  whisht thady whisht its not cursing ll do you any good in life or feemy eitherand then continued the priest seeing that poor macdermot still appeared miserably doubtful what to say or do come in here awhile they had just got to the gate of father johns gothic cottage just come in here awhile and well talk over what will be best to do  they entered the little parlour in which mcgovery had shortly before been discussing his matrimonial engagements and having closed the door and this time taking care that judy mccan was not just on the other side of it and making macdermot sit down opposite to him the priest began in the least disagreeable manner he could to advise him on the very delicate subject in question  you see thady theres not the least doubt in life poor feemys very fond of him and how could she not be poor thing and she seeing no one else and mewed up there all day with your fatherno blame to herand in course she thinks he means all right only she doesnt like to be asking him to be naming the day or talking to you or larry or the like and thats natural too but what i fear is that hes taking advantage of her ignorance and quietness you see and though i dont think she would do anything really wrong nor would he lead her astray altogether  and av he did father john id knock the brains out of the scoundrel though they hung me in carrick gaol for it i would by g  whisht now thady i dont mean that at allbut you get so hotbut what i really mean is this though no actual harm might come of it it doesnt give a girl a good name through the country for her to be carrying on with a young man too long and that all for nothing and feemys too pretty and too good to have a bad word about her and so to make a long story short i think youd better just speak to her and tell her if you like what i say and then you know if you find things not just as they should be ask her not to be seeing the captain any more except just as she cant help and do you tell him that hes not so welcome at ballycloran as he was or ask him at once what he means about your sister its making too little of any girl to be asking a man to marry her but better that than let her break her heart and get ill spoken of through the country too  i dont think they dare do that yet poor as the macdermots now are or by heaven  theres your pridebad pride again thady poor or rich high or low dont let your sister leave it to any one to speak bad of her or put it in any mans power to hurt her character at any rate by following my advice youll find how the land lies  but you see father john she mightnt exactly mind what i say feemy has had so much of her own way and up to this i havent looked after her waysnot so much as i should perhaps though for the matter of that theres been little need i believe but shes been left to herself and if she got cross upon me when i spoke of ussher it would only be making ill blood between us id sooner a deal be speaking to captain ussher  nonsense thady do you mean to say you are afraid to speak to your sister when you see the necessity by speaking to captain ussher you mean quarrelling with him and thats not whatll do feemy any good  well then im sure ill do anything you tell me father john but if she dont mind me will you speak to her  of course i will thady if you wish it but go and see her now at once while its on your mind and though feemy may be a little headstrong i think youll find her honest with you  ill tell you another thing father john father is so taken up with ussher andto out with it at oncehes trying to borrow a thrifle of money from him not that that should stand in my way but the ould man gets obstinate you know  oh then thatd be very bad thady why doesnt he go to his natural friends for money and not to be borrowing it of a false friend and a stranger  nathural friends and who is his nathural friends is it flannelly and hyacinth keegan i tell you what it is father john feemy and her father and i wont have the roof over our heads shortly with such nathural friends as we have god knows where im to make out the money by next november even let alone whats to come after  anything better than borrowing from ussher my boy but sure bad as the time is the rints more than pay flannellys interest money any how  i wish you had to collect them then father john and then youd see how plentiful they are besides little as is spent or as there is to spend up above there we cant live altogether for nothing  no thady the lord knows we can none of us do thatand tell the truth now only i stopped the words in your throat about poor feemys business werent you just going to be dunning me for the bit of rent out with it now  its little heart i have now to be saying to you what i was going to do for my souls sick within me with all the throubles that are on me an av it warnt for feemy then father john bad as i know ive been to her laving her all alone there at ballycloran with her novels and her trashav it warnt for her its little id mind about ballycloran there is them still as wouldnt let the ould man want his stirabout and his tumbler of punch bad as they all are to us and for me id sthrike one blow for the counthry and then if i war hung or shot or murthered any way devil a care but i couldnt bear to see the house taken off her and she to lose the rispect of the counthry entirely and the name of macdermot still on her  oh nonsense thady about blows for your country and getting hung and murthered youre very fond of being hung in theory but wait till youve tried it in practice my boy  may be i may there be many things to try me  oh bother thady stop with your nonsense now go up to your sister and have your talk well out with her and then come down to me judy mccan has got the best half of a goose and theres as fine a bit of cold hamor any way there ought to beas ever frightened a jew and when you get a tumbler of punch in you and have told me all youve said to feemy and all feemys said to you why then you can begin to dun in earnest and well talk over how well make out the rint  no father john id rather not be coming down  but its yes father john and im not saying what youd rather do but showing you your duty so at five thady youll be down and see what sort of a mess judy makes of the goose  there was no gainsaying this so thady started off for ballycloran and father john once more set about performing his parochial duties     chapter vi  the brother and sister   at the time that the priest and young macdermot were talking over feemys affairs at the cottage she and her lover were together at ballycloran  nothing that her brother or father john had said about her either for her or against would give a fair idea of her character  she was not naturally what is called strongminded but her feelings and courage were strong and they stood to her in the place of mind  she would have been a fine creature had she been educated but she had not been educated and consequently her ideas were illformed and her abilities were exercised in a wrong direction  she was by far the most talented of her family but she did not know how to use what god had given her and therefore abused it her mother had died before she had grown up and her grandmother had soon followed her mother whatever her feelings wereand for her mother they were strongthe real effect of this was that she was freed from the restraint and constant scolding of two stupid women at a very early age consequently she was left alone with her father and her brother neither of whom were at all fitting guides for so wayward a pupil by both she was loved more than any other living creature but their very love prevented them taking that care of her they should have taken  her father had become almost like the tables and chairs in the parlour only much less useful and more difficult to move what little natural power he had ever had could not be said to have been impaired by age for lawrence macdermot was not in years an old manhe was not above fifty but a total want of energy joined to a despairing apathy had rendered him by this time little better than an idiot  very soon after his coming to his property flannelly had become a daily and intolerant burthen to him he had in his prime made some ineffectual fight again this manhe had made some faint attempts rather to parry blows than overcome his foe but from the time that keegans cunning had been added to flannellys weight poor lawrence macdermot had as it were owned himself thoroughly vanquished for this world since that time he had done nothing but complain  joined to all thisand no wonderhe had taken to drinknot drinking in the wouldbejolly rollicking old irish style as his father had done before him but a slow desperate solitary continual melancholy kind of suction which left him never drunk and never sober it had come to that that if he were left throughout the morning without his whiskey and water he would cry like a child whatever power he had of endurance would leave him and he would sit over the fire whining the names of flannelly and keegan and slobbering over his wrongs and persecutions till he had again drank himself into silence and passive tolerance  not only his hair and his whiskers but his very face had become grey from the effect of the miserable torpid life he led he looked as if he were degenerating into the grub even before he died  the only visible feeling left to him was a kind of stupid family pride which solely or chiefly showed itself in continual complaints that the descendants and the present family of the macdermots should be harrowed and brought to the ground by such lowborn ruffians as flannelly and keegan  it is odd that though feemy often thwarted him and thady rarely didand though thady was making the best fight he could poor fellow for the macdermots and ballycloranthe old man always seemed cross to him and never was so to her may be he spent more of his time with her and was more afraid of her but so it was and though he certainly loved her better than anything excepting ballycloran and his own name it will be owned that he was no guide for a girl like feemy possessed of strong natural powers stronger passions and but very indifferent education  and from circumstances her brother was not much better he had been called on at a very early age to bear the weight of the family from the time of his leaving school he had been subjected to constant vexation on the contrary his pleasures were very few and far between his constant occupation for many years had been hunting for money which was not to be got if his heart could have been seen the word rent would have been found engraved on it collecting the rent and managing the few acres of land which the macdermots kept in their own hands were his employments and hard he laboured at them he was therefore constantly out of the house and of an evening after his punch he spent his hours in totting and calculating adding and subtracting at his old greasy book till he would turn into bed to forget another days woes and dream of punctual tenants and unembarrassed properties alas it was only in his dreams he was destined to meet such halcyon things what could such a man have to say to a young girl that would attract or amuse her poor thady had little to say to any one except in the way of business and on that subject feemy would not listen to him she constantly heard her father growling about his carrick foes and her brother cursing the tenants but she had so long been used to it that now she did not think much of it she knew they were very poor and that it was with difficulty she now and again got the price of a new dress from her brother and when she did it was usually somewhat in this fashion pat kelly owed two years rent or so may be five pounds mrs brennan the mohill haberdasher took pats pig or his oats in liquidation of the small bill then due to her from ballycloran and feemys credit at the shop was good again about to the amount of another pig it was very rarely ready money found its way to ballycloran  on the whole therefore she paid little or no attention to the family misfortunes she had used to confine her desires to occasional visits to carrick or mohill for they still possessed an old car and sometimes she could take the old mare destined to perform the whole farming work of ballycloran and sometimes she coaxed the loan of paul for a day from father john and if she could do that could always have a novel from mohill and see her friends the miss mckeons at drumsna two or three times a week she was tolerably contented and goodhumoured but of late things were altered feemy had got a lover her novels ceased to interest her she did not care about going to carrick and the miss mckeons were neglected it was only quite lately however that feemy had begun to show signs of petulance and ill temper when her father grumbled she left him to grumble alone and if her brother asked her to do any ordinary little thing about the house she would show her displeasure she did not attend either so closely as she used to do to biddy and katty the two kitchen girls and consequently the fare at ballycloran grew worse than ever  larry always grumbled but no one marked his grumbling more than heretofore thady had too many causes of real suffering to grumble much at trifles and usually passed over his sisters petulance in silence but the truth was her lover was sometimes cross to her  soon after father john and young macdermot had turned their backs on ballycloran pat brady who stood smoking his pipe and idly leaning against the gatepost from which even then the gate was half wrenched heard the sounds of captain usshers horse on the road from mohill as soon as he came up brady very civilly touched his hat well then long life to you captain ussher and its you enjoys a fine horse and itd be a pity you shouldnt have one you war with the carrick harriers last monday ill go bail  no doubt mr brady you would go bail for that or anything else but i was not there  you war not faix but you war in the wrong then captain for they had fine sport right away behind lord lortons new farmsright to boyle i wonder yer honer warnt in it  seeing you know very well i was arresting prisoners up at loch sheen mr brady your wonder is wonderful  sorrow a taste i knew then captain i did hear at the fair poor paddy smith was in throuble about a thrifle of sperits or the like but i didnt know yer honerd been at it yerself if the boys ye know will be going agin the laws why in course theyd be the worse of it when they is took  a very true and moral reflection was it a note you were taking to mr keegans at carrick from the master about the money perhaps on monday evening  me in carrick monday evening said pat a little confused so i war shure enough yer honer jist to buy the mate for the supper as is to be for mcgoverys marriage youve heard in course captain that marythats my sisteris to be married to denis mcgovery tomorrow night  why i didnt see it in the dublin newspapers  oh yer honer the newspapers indeed perhaps captain youd not think it too much throuble to come down miss feemy of course has promised mary to be thereand pat attempted a facetious grin  i shall be most proud mr brady and the captain made a mock bow but do they sell mutton at mr keegans little office door  here brady again seemed confused and muttered something about keegans boy and messages but he was evidently annoyed  shall i take yer honers horse round then said he and ussher dismounted without saying anything further and ran up the stone steps at the top of which feemy opened the hall door for him  there were two sittingrooms at ballycloran one at each side of the hall in that on the right as you entered the family breakfasted dined and in fact lived and here also larry sat throughout the day sipping his grog and warming his shins over the fire from morning to night he would every now and again walk to the hall door and if it were warm he would slowly creep down the steps and stand looking at the trees and the lawn till he was cold when he would creep back again  the other room seemed to be the exclusive property of feemy here she made and mended her clothes and sometimes even washed and ironed them too here she read her novels received the two miss mckeons and thought of captain ussher and here also it was that he would tell her all the soft things which had filled her young heart and made her dislike ballycloran  well myles she said as soon as he was in the room and before the door was shut where were you all this time since sunday and she stood on tiptoe to give him the kiss which she rather offered than he asked who have you got in mohill then that keeps you away from feemy its mary cassidy now what business had you shopping with mary cassidy  and was i shopping with mary cassidy feemy deed then i forget it oh yes it was fairday yesterday and i saw them all in at brennans  and what did you want at brennans myles said she playfully shaking his shoulder with her hand its talking to that pretty girl in the shop youre after  oh of course feemy i was making love to the three miss cassidys and jane thompson and old widow brennan at once but why was i there you say why then i was just buying this for mary cassidy and i wanted your opinion my pet and he took from his pocket some article of finery he had bought for his mistress  oh myles how good of you but why do you be squandering your money but it is very pretty and feemy put the collar over her shoulders  dont toss it now or mary cassidy wont take it from me and then it would be left on my hands for mrs brennan wouldnt take it back anyhow and he put out his hand for the article  no fear myles no fear said the laughing girl running round the table it wont be left on your hands ill wear it tomorrow at mary bradys wedding  but you wont keep it from me without paying me feemy  oh paying you captain ussher oh ill pay you bring in your billand she came round to him and he took her in his arms and kissed her then at least he seemed fondly attached to her  her lover was evidently in one of his best humours and feemy was quite happy i wont further violate their conversation as it is not essential to the tale and was much such as those conversations usually are  feemy told her lover of the wedding and he told her that he had already been invited and had promised to go and then she was more happy for feemy dearly loved a dance though it was only a jig at a country wedding but a dance with her lover would be delightful she had only danced with him twice on the first of these occasions she had met him at a grand gala party at mrs cassidys the wife of lord birminghams agent in mohill where first captain ussher had made up his mind that feemy macdermot was a finer girl than pretty little mary cassidy though perhaps not so well educated and once again at a little teaparty at mrs mckeons which had been got up on purpose by feemys friends to ask her husband as was to bewhen first people said it was a settled thing oh that was a happy night to feemy for her friends then all thought that her intimacy with ussher was as good a thing as could be wished for and when feemy danced the whole night with him the miss mckeons all thought what a happy girl she wasand that night she was happy then he first told her she should be his wife and swore that he never had loved and never would love any but her and oh how truly she believed him why should she not was not she happy to love him and why should not he be as much so to love her if any one had whispered a word of caution to her how she would have hated the whisperer but there was no one to whisper caution to feemy and she had given all she hadher heart her love her obedience her very soulto him without having any guarantee that she really had aught in return  it was not because she began to doubt her lover that she was now occasionally fretful and uneasy no the idea to doubt him never reached her but nevertheless she felt that things were not quite as they should be  he seldom talked of marriage though he said enough of love and when he did it was with vague promises saying how happy they would be when she was his wife how much more comfortable her home would be how nicely she would receive her friends in mohill these and little jokes about their future ménage in a married state were all he had ever said she never asked himindeed she did not dare to ask she did not like to press him and captain ussher had a frown about him which somehow feemy had already learnt to fear  he treated her too a little cavalierly and her father and brother not a little he ridiculed openly all that with her hitherto had been most sacredher priest and her religion she was not angry at this she was hardly aware of it and in fact was gradually falling into his way of thinking but the effect upon her was the sameit made her uncomfortable a girl should never obey her lover till she is married to him she may comply with his wishes but she should not allow herself to be told with authority that this or that should be her line of conduct  now feemy had so given herself up to her lover that she was obedient to him in all things to him even in opposition to her brother or her priest and consequently she was to a degree humiliated even in his eyes she did not feel the degradation herself but there was still a feeling within which she could not define which usually destroyed her comfort  now however myles was in so good a temper and seemed so kind to her that that and her little prospect of pleasure did make her happy  she was sitting in this humour on the old sofa close to him leaning on his arm which was round her waist when she heard her brothers footstep at the hall door  heres thady myles sit off a bit  myles got up and walked to the window and thady entered with anything but a gay look he had just left father john  well thady said feemy  how are you thady this morning said the captain offering his hand which the other reluctantly took  good morning captain ussher  did you hear thady i caught another of your boys with malt up at loch sheen last mondayjoe reynolds or tim reynolds or something hes safe in carrick  i did hear you got a poor boy up there who was in it by chance and took him off just for nothing but hes no tenant of ours so i have nothing to do with it his brother joe lives on our land  do you mean to tell me thady you believe all that dd nonsense about knowing nothing about it and he sitting there in the cabin and the malt hadnt been in it half an hour  i dont know what you call dd nonsense captain ussher but i suppose i may believe what i please without going to carrick gaol too for it  believe what you please for me master thady why you seem to have got out of bed the wrong side this morning or have you and keegan been striking up some new tiff about the rints  mr keegans affairs with me arnt any affairs of yours captain ussher when i ask you to set them right then you can talk to me about them  hoity toity mr macdermot your affairs and mr keegans affairs and my affairs why i suppose youll be calling me out next for taking up a dd whining thief of a fellow because his brother is a tenant of your fathers and send me the challenge by mr brady who invited me to a party at his house just now  thady said nothing to this but stood with his back to the fire looking as grim as death  oh captain ussher said feemy you wouldnt be quarrelling with thady about nothing you know he has so much to bother him with the rents and things will you come to marys wedding tomorrow thady  quarrelling with him deed then and i will not but it seems he wants to quarrel with me  when i do want to quarrel with you captain ussherthat is should i ever wantyou may be quite certain its not in a round about way ill be telling you of it  no dont my boy for ten to one i shouldnt understand what youd be after didnt you say youd walk up to aughermore miss macdermot  im sorry to baulk feemy of her walk captain ussher if she did say so its not very often i ask her to put herself out for me but this afternoon i shall feel obliged to her not to go  captain ussher stared and feemy opened wide her large bright eyes for what reason could her brother desire her to stay in doors  what can you want me in the house for thady this time of day  well never mind feemy i do want you and youll oblige me by staying  feemy still had on the new collar and she pulled it off and threw it on the table she evidently imagined that it had something to do with her brothers unusual request she certainly would not have put it on in that loose way had she thought he would have seen it but then he so seldom came in there  well captain ussher she at last said slowly i suppose then i cant go to aughermore today  captain ussher had turned to the window as if not to notice thadys request and now came back into the middle of the room as if feemys last sentence had been the first he had heard on the subject  oh you have changed your mind then said he and his face acquired the look that feemy dreaded ladies you know are at liberty to think twice  but thady i did wish to go to aughermore particularly today wouldnt this evening or tomorrow do  no feemy and thady looked still blacker than myles this evening wont do nor tomorrow  well captain ussher you see we must put it off and she looked deprecatingly at her lover  his answering look gave her no comfort far from it but he said i see no must about it but thats for you to judge perhaps you should ask your fathers leave to go so far from home  this was a cruel cut at all the fallen family the fathers incapacity the sisters helplessness and the brothers weak authority feemy did not feel it so she felt nothing to be cruel that came from ussher but thady felt it strongly he was as indignant as if he had lived all his life among those who thought and felt nobly but poor fellow he could not express his indignation as well  my sister captain ussher has long been left her own misthress to go in and out as she plazes without lave from father mother or brother better perhaps for her that she had not god knows i have seldom stopped her wishes though may be not often able to forward them if she likes she may go now to aughermore but if a brothers love is anything to her shell stay this day with me  feemy looked from one to the other she knew well by myles look that he still expected her to go and strange as it may be she hardly dared to disobey him but then her brother looked determined and sadly resolute and it was so unusual in him to speak in that way  well miss macdermot said ussher seeing he could not prevail without causing an absolute break with thady your brother wants you to count the rent for him im glad he has received so much it must be that i presume for he seldom troubles himself on much else i believe  i do what i have to do and must do god knows its throuble enough do you go and do the same even that bad as it is is better than amusing my sister by laughing at me  oh thady how can you be saying such things you see i am staying for you and why cant you be quiet  thady made no reply the captain twirled his hat and ceremoniously bowing to the lady took his leave  thady had screwed his courage to the sticking point while the captain was the foe with whom he had to contend and he had carried on the battle manfully while he spoke to feemy in the captains presence but to tell the truth when he heard the clatter of his horses feet he almost wished him back again or that feemy was away with him to aughermore he was puzzled how to begin he could not think what he was to say was he to quarrel with his sister for having a lover without telling him was he to put it on the ground that her lover was a protestant that would have been the easiest line but then father john had especially barred that was he to scold her because her lover would not marry her at once that seemed unreasonable it had never occurred to him in his indignation to think of these difficulties and he now stood with his back to the fire looking awfully black but saying nothing  well thady what is it ill be doing for you instead of going to aughermore this morning at last said feemy the first to begin the disagreeable conversation  when thady looked up thinking what to answer to this plain speech his eye luckily for him fell on the new mohill collar  where were you getting that collar feemy  and are you afther making me stay at home all the blessed day and sending captain ussher all the way back to mohill and he having come over here by engagement to walk with methis was a fib of feemysand all to ask me where i got a new collar  may be i was feemy and may be i wasnt but i suppose there isnt any harum in my asking the question or in you answering it  oh no not the laist only it aint usual in you to be asking such questions  but if theres no harum i ask it now where were you getting the collar  well youre very queer but if you must know captain ussher brought it with him from mohill  and if you wanted a parcel from mohill why couldnt you let brady bring it who is in it constantly instead of that upstart policeman whod think it more condescension to bring that from mohill than i would to be carrying a sack of potatoes so far  there then youre wrong the policeman as youre pleased to call him thinks no such thing  well feemy but did you bid him bring it or did he bring it of his own accord  feemy could now shuffle no longer so blushing slightly she said well if you must know then it was a present and theres no such great harm in that i suppose  here thady was again bothered he really did not know whether there was any harm in it or not a week ago he certainly would have thought not but he was now inclined to think that there was but he was not sure and he sadly wished for father john to tell him what to do  well thady now what was it you were wanting of meand then after a pause she added her courage rising as she saw her brothers falling was it anything about captain ussher  yes it was  well  is there anything between you and he feemy  what do you mean by between us thady and feemy made a little fruitless attempt to laugh  well then youre in love with him aint you there now thats the long and the short  supposing i was why shouldnt i  only this feemy hes not in love with you  this put feemys back up deed then its little you know about it for he just is and i love him too with all my heart and thats all about it and you might have found that out without sending him back to mohill  i wish then hed stay at mohill and that i might never see him over the door at ballycloran again  thats kind of you thady after what i just told you but dont tell him so thats all  but its just what i mane to tell him and what i shall go over to mohill on purpose to tell him tomorrow  good gracious thady and for why  for why feemy becase i still want to see my fathers daughter an honest woman though she may be soon a beggar becase i dont want to see my sister crouching under a blackguards foot becase i dont want the worst disgrace that can happen a family to blacken the name of macdermot  feemy was now really surprised fear at her brothers strange words brought out at once what was ever most present in her mind  oh heavens thady sure were to be married  it must be remembered that this was not an interview between a fashionable brother and an elegant sister both highly educated in which the former had considered himself called upon to remonstrate with the latter for having waltzed too often with the same gentleman and in which any expression of actual blame would highly offend the delicacy of the lady thady and his sister had not been accustomed to delicacy and though she was much shocked at his violence she hardly felt the strong imputation against herself as she had so good an answer for it she therefore exclaimed  oh heavens thady sure were to be married  well now feemy jist listen to me if captain ussher manes to marry you under all circumstances i dont know you could do better i dont like him as how should i for isnt he a protestant and a lowborn impudent ruffian but you do like him and i suppose if he marries you its becase he likes you if not why should he do it and when once married youll have to fight your own battles and no joke itll be for either of you but if as im thinking he has no idea on arth of marrying you no more than he has of mary brady ill be dd if i let him come here fooling you though you havent sperit enough to prevent it yourself were low enough already feemy but for heavens sake dont be making us lower yet  well now thady is that all and youre wrong then as you always are for captain ussher has asked me to have him just as plain as im telling you now and hes no ruffian it is youre the ruffian to him snubbing him when he speaks goodnaturedly to you and as for being a protestant i suppose hes none the worse for that if hes none the better i dont know why you do be hating him so unless its because i love him  im not talking about my hating him or loving him if hes honest to you ill neither say nor do anything to cross him but if he does mane to marry you its time he did it thats all did he say anything to father about it  what should he be saying to him of course dada would have no objection  and would you then be letting him come here as he likes and settling nothing and just maning to marry you or not as he likes and you and he talked of over the counthry these four months back and he talking about you jist as his misthress through the counthry  feemy was now regularly roused  thats a lie for you thady and a black lieabout your own sister too to say he ever spoke a bad word against me pat brady was telling you that perhaps its what he never did or would do for hes as true as you are false and its from jealousy and just from your hate because everybody else likes him makes you say it and now we are on it thady ill just tell you one thing im not to do what you tell me nor will i for im much more able to manage myself than you are for me and for all you say about him id attend more to one word from myles than to all you say if you stood talking till night and talk you may but ill not stand and hear you and she bounced out of the room slamming the door in a manner which made mr flannellys building shake to the foundation  poor thady was signally defeated there he stood with his back to the fire his old and dirty hat pulled low over his brow his hands stuck into the pockets of his much worn shooting coat his strong brogues and the bottoms of his corduroy trowsers covered with dirt and dry mould with the same heavy discontented look about his face which he always now wore he certainly appeared but a sorry mentor for a young lady in a love affair he felt that his sister despised him the more from her being accustomed to the comparatively gentlemanlike appearance and refined manners of her lover  there he stood a long time without stirring and so he stood in absolute silence he had put his pipe down when first captain ussher left the room and he had not resumed it now even that he was alone with thady this was a sign that his heart was very full indeed and so it was full almost to breaking  he had come there eager with two high feelings love for his sister real fond brotherly affection and love and respect for his family name he had wished to protect the former from insult and unhappiness and to sustain the fallen respectability of the latter and he had only been scoffed at and upbraided by the sister he loved for he did love her though little real communication had ever passed between them he had always supposed that she loved him he had taken it for granted and had asked for no demonstrative affection but her manner and her words now cut him very deep he was not aware how very uncouth his own manner had been that instead of reasoning with her gently he had begun by sneering at her lover that he had taken the very course to offend her selflove and that therefore feemy was quite as convinced at the end of the meeting that she had a right to be angry as he was that he was the injured party  at any rate there he stood perfectly baffled his object had been to advise her if captain ussher did not at once declare his purpose to her family to put a stop to his further visits and if she refused to comply with his advice to tell her that he should himself ask captain ussher his intentions and that if they were not such as he approved he should inform him that he was no longer welcome at ballycloran  this had seemed though disagreeable straightforward and easy enough before the meeting and now that it was over he could not think why he had not said exactly what he had come there to say to give him his due he blamed himself as much as he did his sister he was very unhappy about it all but he could not think how he had been so very stupid  had he lived more in the world he would have had recourse to the common resort in cases where speech is difficult he would have written a letter to his sister but this never occurred to him even had it done so thadys epistolary powers were very small and his practice very limited a memento to the better sort of tenants as to their thrifle of rint or a few written directions to pat brady about seizing crops and driving pigs was its extent and these were written on pieces of coarse paper which had been ruled for accounts and were smeared rather than fastened with very much salivated wafers his writing too was very slow and his choice of language not extensive a letter on such a subject from a brother to a sister should be well turned impressive terse sententious that scheme would never have done for thady  what then should he do if he were to go to captain ussher now and tell him to discontinue his visits he would only be asked if he had his sisters authority for doing so or his fathers should he get or try to get his fathers authority the old man he knew was moping over the parlour fire half drunk half stupid and half asleep  after thinking over it alone there in feemys sittingroom for an hour he determined that all he could do was to go back again to his only friend father john  when feemy slammed the door as she did at the end of her violent oration above given she betook herself to her bedroom and began to cry  though she had so well assumed the air of an injured person and had to the best of her abilities vindicated her absent lover still she was very unhappy at what her brother had said to her nor in truth was it only because thady had expressed himself unkindly about myles but she also could not but feel that there was something wrong she never for a moment believed that her lover spoke loosely of her behind her back for she never for a moment doubted his love but she did feel that it would be more comfortable if myles would speak or let her speak to some of her family if it were only to her father though she knew so little of what was usual in the world still she felt that even his sanction stupid tipsy unconscious as he was would give to her attachment a respectability which it wanted now and if a day for her marriage were fixed though circumstances might require that it should be ever so distant she would be able to talk much more satisfactorily of her prospects to mary cassidy and the miss mckeons besides if she could bring matters to this state she could so triumphantly prove that thady was wrong in his unhandsome conjectures and she determined before she had done thinking on the subject to give myles a few hints as to her wishes the next day he would be sure to come to ballycloran on his way to mcgoverys wedding and he would probably ask why thady had prevented their walk to aughermore and then she would have a good opportunity of saying what she wanted     chapter vii  the priests dinner party   thady as i said walked off to the priests cottage to partake of the relics of a goose and seek counsel of his friend but it was not father johns dinner hour yet and he found no one in but judy mccan he walked into the priests little parlour and sat down to wait for him again meditating on all the evils which hung over his devoted family and sitting thus he at length fell fast asleep  here he slept for above an hour when he was awakened by the door opening behind him and in jumping up to meet father john as he thought he encountered the lank and yellow features much worn dress and dirty moist hand of father cullen  were you sleeping then mr thady before father mcgraths fire deed then i dare say youve been walking a great sight for you look jaded im not that fresh myself for ive been away to loch sheen to widow byrnes bad luck to the cratures theres nothing but sick calls now and my hearts broken with them so it is  thadys only answer to this was how are you father cullen he wished him back at maynooth  well i hope father mcgrath isnt far off thin and he looked at a watch nearly as big as a church clock for im very hungry and my its only twenty minutes to six  this gave thady the very unwelcome intelligence that father cullen meant to dine at the cottage  and now the ponys lamed undher me i had to walk all the way to loch sheen in the dirt and gutther  thadys mind was full of one object and he could not interest himself about the curates misfortunes in the lameness of his pony and the dirt of his walk  and bad manners to them commissioners and people they sent over bothering and altering the people couldnt we have our own parishes as we like and fix them ourselves but they must be sending english people to give us english parishes altering the meerings just to be doing something you know thady the far end of loch sheen up there  yes father cullen i know where loch sheen is  well that used to be cashcarrigan parish and father comynsthats the parish priest in cashdont live not two miles all out from there and the widow byrnes is six miles from where i live out yonder if its a step and yet they must go and put loch sheen into this parish  father cullens misfortunes still did not come home to macdermot he sat looking at the fire  theres that poor ould woman too up there left to starve by herself the crature now theyve gone and put her two sons into gaol i wonder what the counthry ll be the better for all them boys being crammed into gaol i wish theyd kept that ussher down in the north when he was there hes fitter for that place than county leitrim any how  whats that about captain ussher father cullen  shure didnt you hear he put three more of the boys into gaol tuesday evening and one of them off drumleesh  heard it of course i heard it and more than ill be hearing it too oh father cullen wherever that ussher came from i wish theyd kept him there  thadys earnestness in this surprised the young priest  why i thought you and he were so thick but im glad its not so much so why would the like of you be making so free with a protestant like him did you break with him then mr thady  macdermot by no means desired to admit father cullen into the conference about his sister the strong expression of his dislike had fallen from him as it were involuntarily he therefore turned off the question  oh no break with him why would i break with him but you cant think i like to see him dhriving the boys into the gaol like sheep to the shambles what business had they sending tim reynolds into gaol therell be noise enough in the counthry about that yet father cullen  therell never be noise enough about that and such like cruelties till he and all of the sort is put down intirely in the counthry and thatll only be when the counthry rights herself as she should do and by gods blessing will still and that you and i mr thady may live to see it  the further expression of father cullens favourite political opinions was here interrupted by father johns quick heavy step on the little gravel walk  well boys said he sitting down and pulling off his dirty gaiters and shoes before the fire waiting for the goose eh egad when i found what time it was i thought youd be bribing judy to divide it between you cullen you look awfully hungry id better set you at the ham first or youll make terrible work at the half birdfor a half is all there is for the three of us well judy lets have the stew  the dinner was now brought in and father john talked joyously as though nothing was on his mind and yet we know the sad conversation he had had with young macdermot that very morning and that thady was there chiefly to tell the upshot of his missionand thadys face was certainly no emblem of good news he had also had a sad mornings work with his curate his parishioners were in great troubles the times were very bad on them many of them were in gaol for illegal distillation more were engaged in the business and were determined so to continue in open defiance of the police many of them were becoming ribbonmen or at any rate were joining secret and illegal societies driven from their cabins and little holdings their crops and cattle taken from them they were everywhere around desperate with poverty and discontented equally with their own landlords and the restraints put upon them by government all this weighed heavily on father johns mind and he strongly felt the difficulty of his own situation but he was not the man to allow his spirits to master him when entertaining others in his own house had only cullen or only thady been there he would have tuned his own mind to that of his guest but as their cases were so different he tried to cheer them both  egad thady heres another legcome my boy weve still a leg to stand uponcullen has just finished one and i could have sworn i ate the other yesterday see did judy put one of her own in the hashex pede herculemyoud know it so any way by the toughness lend me your fork thady or excuse my own well when i get the cash from deniss marriage ill get a carvingknife and fork from garleys not but what i ought to have one judy wheres the big fork  why didnt yer riverence smash it entirely drawing the cork from the bottle of sherry wine ye got for doctor blake the day he was here about the dispinsary business  this little explanation judy bawled from the kitchen  it is true for you judy so i did and bad luck to the day and doctor blake too that same day thady cost me three good shillings for a bottle of bad wine my old fork and a leg of mutton and all for i thought id be able to come round the doctor about his coming down to drumsna here once a week regular and when hed ate my mutton and drank the sherry he just told me it was not possible  hed sooner be making may be twenty or thirty poor sick craturs be walking five or six miles than hed ride over to see them though its little hed think of the distance av hed a fee to touch  for the matter of that cullen i think yourself would go quicker to a wedding than you would to a sick call deed and i know myself i like the part of the business where the cash is  in course mr mcgrath id go with more sperit but not a foot quicker nor so quick may be id grumble at the one and not at the other but what the church tells me ill do if it plazes god to let me  oh cullen youd make one think i was admonishing you a fine martyr hed make wouldnt he thady  cullen who took everything in downright earnest clasped his dirty hands and exclaimed  if the church required it and it was gods will i hope i would  well well but itll be just at present much more comfortable for all parties you should square round a little and take your punch come thady are you going to be a martyr too its a heathenish kind of penance though to be holding your tongue so long come my boy you were to bring the ticket about the rent with you  thady opened his ears at the word rent but before hed time to make any suitable reply judy was moving the things father john was pulling back the table and pushing cullen into a corner by the fire  now judy the fire under the pump you know out with the groceriessee but have i any sugar then  sorrow a bit of lump but moist and plenty father john  well my boys you must make your punch with brown sugar for once in your life and whats the harm what we want in sugar well make up in the whiskey ill be bound judy bring the tumblers  out came the tumblersthat is two tumblers one with a stand the other with a flat bottom and a teacup with a spoon in it the teacup was put opposite father johns chair and the reverend father himself proceeded to pour a tolerable modicum of spirits out of the stone jar into a goodsized milk jug and placed it on the table  isnt it queer then thady i cant get a bottle or a decanter or anything of glass to remain in the house at all im sure i had a decanter though i didnt see it these six months  and wouldnt it be odd if you did father john wasnt it smashed last february  smashed why i think everything gets smashed  well now mr thady to hear his riverence going on the like of that said the old woman appealing to macdermot and wasnt it himself sent the broth down in it to widow green the latter end of last winter and didnt the foolish slip of a girl her granddater go to hait it over the hot coals for the ould woman jist as it was and in course the hait smashed the glass and why wouldnt it and the broth was all spilt but isnt the jug just as good for the sperits yer honers  well well boiling mutton broth over a turf fire in my cut decanter optat ephippia bos piger thatll do judy thatll do  and the old woman retreated with a look of injured innocence  father john sniffed the whiskey fumum bibere institutæ its the right smell of the smoke come cullen make your punch come thady dont be sitting there that wayand he proceeded to make a most unpalatablelooking decoction of punch in his teacup to which the moist sugar gave a peculiarly nasty appearance  but all father johns attempted jovialities and preparations for enjoyment could not dispel the sadness from thadys face or the settled solemnity from father cullens visage he never joked and rarely conversed when he did speak it was usually to argue or declaim and thady even in his best times was but a sorry companion for such a man as father john there the three of them sat with their eyes fixed on the fire all drinking their punch it is true but with very little signs of enjoying it  how long they remained thus i am unable to say but father john was getting very tired of his company when they were all three startled by a sharp rap at the hall door and before they had had time to surmise who it was captain ussher walked in  now though neither father john nor his curate were very fond of ussher they both were tolerably intimate with him indeed till lately when the priest began to think the gallant captain was playing his fair parishioner false and the opinion was becoming general that he was acting the tyrant among the people father john had rather liked ussher than not he was livelyand if not well educated he had some little general comprehension of which no others of those the priest knew around him could boast he had met him first very frequently at ballycloran had since dined with him at mohill and had more than once induced him to join the unpretending festivities of the cottage there was nothing therefore very singular in captain usshers visit and yet from what was uppermost in the mind of each of the party it did surprise them all  father john however was never taken aback ah my darling and how are you come to see we are drinking parliament and not cheating the king  although they were drinking potheen and though ussher might doubtless have put a fine of from five to fifty pounds on the priest for doing so father john knew that he was safe it was at that time considered that no revenue officer would notice potheen if he met it as a guest people are rather more careful now on the matter  oh father john i never bring my government taster with me when i am not on service but if youve any charity give me an air of the fire and a drop of whats going forward all for love how are you father cullen and he shook hands with the curate how are you thady old boy and he slapped macdermot on the back as though they were the best friends in the world  how are you captain ussher said the former sitting down again as though the captains salutation were a signal for him to do so and as if he did not dare do it before nor would he father cullen had been told that he should stand up when strangers came into a roomthat it was a point of etiquette and there he would have stood though it had been ten minutes if ussher had not addressed him  thady did not get up at all in fact he did not know what to do or to say he had been waiting anxiously hoping that father cullen would go and now the difficulties in his way were more than doubled  captain ussher however took no notice of his silence but sitting down by father john began rubbing and warming his hands at the fire  well may i be ddbegging your reverences pardonif this isnt as cold a night as id wish to be out in and as dark as my hat i say thady thisll be the night for the boys to be running a drop of the stuff thered be no seeing the smoke now anyhow i was dining early at carrick and was getting away home as quick as i could and my mare threw a shoe luckily just opposite the forge down there so i walked up here father john and i told them to bring the mare up when shes shod  im glad the mare made herself so agreeable come judy another tumbler here by the by then cullen you must take to a teacup like myselfyoure used to it and captain ussher you must take brown sugar in your punch though you are not used to it if i could make lump sugar for you id do it myself directly  oh whats the odds im so cold i shant feel it and without any apology he took poor father cullens tumbler who emptied the rest of his punch into a teacup  well thady and who do you think there was at hewsons but keegan your friend you know and a very pleasant fellow he is in his way but how he does abuse you catholics  well captain and its little good youll hear any of us say of him so thats all fair said father john  take it that way so it is but i thought i heard some of you at ballycloran say he was once a catholic said ussher turning to thady your father was telling me so i think  he seemed determined to make thady say something but he only muttered an affirmative  whoever said so said wrong began father cullen rising up and putting his hands on the table as if he was going to make a speech whoever said so said wrong his father was a catholic and his mother was a catholic but he never was a catholic and how could he for he never was a christianand as he sat down he turned round his large obtruding eyes for approval  oh if you go on that high ground youll lose half your flock we are glad to get them whether they are christians or not so long as they are good protestants so you see keegans good enough for us and what could he do poor fellow if you wouldnt have him he must come to us  oh then father john hes satisfied to say men become protestants when they are no longer fit to be catholics was that the way yourself become a protestant captain ussher  if im to be dd for that you know its my fathers and mothers fault i aint like keegan i didnt choose the bad road myself  oh but isnt it for yourself to choose the good road didnt you say you knew ours was the ould church as it stood always down from christ if you do go wrong you dont do it from ignorance but you do it wilfully and your sowl will howl in hell for it  captain ussher only burst out laughing at this little outbreak but father john exclaimed whist whist cullen none of that here if you can take any steps towards sending captain ussher to heaven well and good but dont be sending him the other way while the poor fellow is over his punch  never mind father john i and father cullen are very good friends and i think hell hear me read my recantation yet but he cant do it tonight as heres my mare i must go by ballycloran thady will you walk as far as the avenue with me  thank you captain ussher ill not be going out of this just yet  ah well i see youre out with me for the tiff we had this morning hes angry now father john just through my telling him he couldnt count all the money hed received this week  father john observed the different manners of the young men towards each other and from thadys silence was quite sure that matters had gone amiss between them  i didnt know it before then captain ussher said thady but if you must know ive business to spake to father john about  oh well open confessions good for the soul i hope hell absolve you for your bad temper  its i am to get the absolution if i can this time its the old story captain a thrifle of rint thats owing nothing more  well its all one to me good night to you all and captain ussher rode away home to mohill  father cullen reseated himself by the fire and again assumed his gaze at the hot turf just as he was before ussher came in and looked hopelessly immovable thady shifted about uneasily in his chair then got up and walked round the room and then sat down again but the curate wouldnt move at last father john ended the affair by saying  any more punch cullen  thank you no sir  then just go home theres a good fellow  cullen rose up not the least offendednothing would offend himtook his hat and did as he was bid at last thady and father john were left alone  now my boy said the priest as he put on more turf well be alone for half an hour or it is odd well you spoke to feemy  i did spake to her father john but id better have left it alone for when i began she only snubbed me and she told me shed manage her own business but oh father john i fear it will be a bad business she told me she loved him and that he had gone so far as asking her to marry him and all that but as far as i could learn it was only just talk that but i could say nothing to her for she got the better of me and then flew out of the room saying it did not matter what i said  and then macdermot told the priest exactly what had passed how headstrong feemy was how infatuated she was with her lover and how regardless of what any one could say to her on the subject and now father john what on arth shall i do at all for the hearts broken in me with all the throubles thats on me  ill tell you what thady dont be falling out with captain ussherany way not yetfor he may mean honestly you know though i own my heart doubts him but take my advice and dont be falling out with him yet ill see feemy tomorrow and if she wont hear or wont heed what her priest says to her ill tell you what well do one woman will always listen to another and ill ask mrs mckeon to speak to feemy and tell her the character shell be giving herself mrs mckeon has daughters of her own and when i remind her that feemy has neither mother nor sister nor female friend of any kind shell not be refusing me this disagreeable though it may be to her and now thady do you go home to bed and pray to god to protect your sister and remember my boy that though you may have reason to be displeased with her as i said she has neither mother nor sister she has no one to look to but yourself and if there is much in her to forgive there are many causes for forgiveness  thady silently shook hands with his friend and went home and whether or no he obeyed the priests injunctions to pray for protection for his sister that good man himself did not go to sleep till he had long been on his knees imploring aid for her and the numerous unfortunates of his flock     chapter viii  miss macdermot at home   at any rate the priests admonitions had this effect on thady that when he came in to breakfast after his morning avocations he spoke to feemy whom he had not seen since their stormy interview of yesterday with kindness and for him gentleness but she seemed only half inclined to accept the proffered olive branch thadys morning salutations couldnt go far towards putting a young girl in good humour for even now that he meant to be gracious it was onlywell feemy hows yourself this morning and will you be ready for mary bradys wedding but her answeroh in course will you take your breakfast there showed him that she had not forgiven his aspersions against her lover and the breakfast passed over in silence with the exception of larrys usual growls thady therefore when he had swallowed his potatoes and milk betook himself again to pat brady and the fields larry was left alone to sleep if he could over the fire and feemy betook herself to her own parlour and proceeded to penetrate farther into the mysteries of the mysterious assassin  there she sata striking contradiction of that proverb which we so often quote with reference to young ladies and which so seldom can be quoted with truth beauty unadorned adorned the most  ussher would not come till the evening and her hair was therefore in papersand the very papers themselves looked soiled and often used her back hair had been hastily fastened up with a bit of old black ribbon and a comb boasting only two teeth and the short hairs round the bottom of her wellturned head were jagged and uneven as though bristling with anger at the want of that attention which they required she had no collar on but a tippet of different material and colour from her frock was thrown over her shoulders her dress itself was the very picture of untidiness it looked as though it had never seen a mangle the sleeves drooped down hanging despondingly below her elbows and the tuck of her frock was all ripped and tornshe had trod on it or some one else had done it for her and she had not been at the trouble of mending it it was also too tight or else feemy had not fastened it properly for a dreadful gap appeared in the back showing some article beneath which was by no means as white as it should bebut then wasnt it only her morning frock in front of it too was a streaked mark of grease the long since deposited remains of some of her culinary labours her feet were stuffed into slipperstruth compels me to say they would more properly be called shoes down at heelher stockings were wofully dirty and horror of all horrors out at the heels there she sat with her feet on the fender her face on her hands and her elbows on her knees with her thumbworn novel lying in her lap between them  there she sat how little like the girl that had eclipsed mary cassidy at the ball at mohill poor though feemy was she could make out a dress and a handsome dress for such an occasion as that then every hair on her fine head had been in its place the curls of her rich brown hair were enough to win the heart of any man the collar round her fair neck had been beautifully washed and ironed for her own hands had been at work on it half the morning her white long gloves had been new and well fitting and her only pair of silk stockings had been scrupulously neat her dress fitted her fine person as though made by carson and she had walked as though she knew she need not be ashamed of herself but now how great was the contrast  no girls know better how to dress themselves than irish girls or can do it with less assistance or less expense but they are too much given to morning dishevelment if they would only remember that the change in a mans opinion and mind respecting a girl will often take place as quick as the change in her appearance and that the contrast will be quite as striking they would be more particular and they never can be sure of themselves take what precautions they will lovers will drop in at most unseasonable hours they have messages to deliver plans to propose or leave to take they can never be kept out with certainty and all the good done by a series of brilliant eveningssatin dresses new flowers for the hair expensive patterns and tediously finished toiletsmay be and often is suddenly counteracted by one untidy head soiled dress or dirty stocking  i will however return to my story there sat feemy apparently perfectly contented with her appearance and occupation till a tap at the door disturbed her and in walked mary brady the bride elect  well miss feemy and hows your beautiful self this morning  and how are you mary now the time is coming so near  mary brady was a very tall woman being about the same height as her brother thirty or thirtythree years of age with a plain though goodhumoured looking face over which her coarse hair was divided on the left temple she had long ungainly limbs and was very awkward in the use of them and though not absolutely disagreeable in her appearance she was so nearly so that she would hardly have got married without the assistance of the two small pigs and thrifle of change which had given her charms in the eyes both of ginty and denis mcgovery  oh miss feemy and im fretting so these two days that is ever since denis said it was to be this blessed daythe lord help meand i with it all on my shouldhers and the divil a one to lend a hand the laste taste in life  why mary what can there be so much to do at all  och then hadnt i my white dress to get made and the pair of sheets to get hemmed for denis said hisn warnt large enough for him and iand here the amazon gave a grin of modestyand you know it was part of the bargain i was to have a pair of new sheets denis had kept this back from father john in his inventory of his brides fortune and isnt there the supper to get ready and the things and the house to ready and alland then when id done that it war all for nothing for the wedding isnt to be at pats at all  the wedding not to be at bradys where is it to be then  oh jist at mrs mehans shop below at the loch  oh thats better still mary we wont have so far to go in the mud  thats jist what the boys war saying miss and there be so much more room and there be so many to be in it they couldnt all be in it at all at all at home so you see we is to be married in the room inside where the two beds is and they is to come out of it and the supper is to be there miss you see and the most of the dhrinking and then well have the big kitchen comfortable to oursells for the music and the dancing and what do you think pat has got shamus na pebria all the ways out of county mayo him that makes all the pipes through the counthry miss and did the music about oconnell all out of his own head miss oh it ll be the most illigant wedding intirely miss anywhere through the counthry this long time back when one is to be married its as well to do it dacently as not arnt it miss  oh that it is mary and yours ll be quite a dash  yours ll be the next you know miss feemy and that will be the wedding but theres one thing that bothers me intirely  well out with it at once mary i suppose you want to borrow the plates and knives and forks and things  oh thats in course miss feemy and its very good in you to be offering them that way before i axed the loan of them at all but that aint all you see im so bothered intirely with them big sheets and they not half finished and not a taste in life done to the cap of me yet and the pratees and vegetables to get ready and the things to dress and not a sowl to lend me a hand at all unless jist mrs mehans bit of a girl and shes busy readying the rooms and so miss feemy if youd jist let biddy slip up for the afthernoonyou know katty could be doing for you down hereand then miss id be made intirely  well mary i suppose she must go up then one things certain you cant be getting married every day  why no miss that is sartain for even if denis were to die away likeas in course he must one day for he aint quite so young nowi would have to be waiting a little miss before i got my second  mary brady had been above thirty years getting one husband she was therefore probably right as to the delay she might experience in obtaining a second  well mary biddy may go with you  long life to you miss and about the things then you knowthe plates and the knives and the glasses  oh mary ill not have you bringing the glasses down there at all sure mrs mehans glasses enough of her own and she selling whiskey you may take the knives and the forks and the plates though you must leave us enough for ourselvesand there ant so many of them in it after all  well miss feemy thats very good of you now and youll be bringing your own sweetheart with you wont you dearand its id be sorry youd be at my wedding and no one fit to dance with your fathers daughter  oh if you mean captain ussher he told me pat asked him himself and hed sure be there  and who else should i main alanna sure isnt he your own beau and aint you to be married to him miss feemy  nonsense mary  well now but sure you wouldnt be ashamed of telling meisnt you going to have him miss  but musnt i wait to be asked like anothersure mary you didnt go asking denis mcgovery did you  no then indeed i didnt darling and glad enough he was to be axing me  well and musnt i be the same  oh in course but miss feemy the captains been up here coorting at ballycloran now these six months sure he axed you before this miss feemy  feemy was rather puzzled she didnt like to say she was not engaged she had a presentiment mary brady was fishing to find out if the report about the captains inconstancy was true and as matters stood she did not exactly like to say that the affair was arranged  well mary then ill tell you exactly how it isbut mind i dont want it talked about yet for rasons so you wont say anything about it if i tell you  och then is it i sorrow a word in life shall any one be the better av me and you know miss feemy i wouldnt tell you a lie for worlds  well then its jist this wayi and the captain is engaged but theres rasons for him why we couldnt be married just immediately so you see thats why i dont want it talked about  ah well dear i knew there was something av that in it and a nice handsome gentleman like the captain wouldnt be trating the likes of you that way  what way mary  why they do be saying  who do be saying  why jist through the counthrypeople you know miss who must always have their gag they do be sayingthats only some of them you know miss who dont be quite frindly to ballycloranthat the captain dont main to be married at all and is only playing his tricks with you and that hes a schamer but i knew you wouldnt be letting him go on that way and so i said to pat  feemy didnt quite like all thisit was a corroboration of what her brother had said for though the captain had certainly promised to marry her he had never thought it necessary to ask her she knew the matter did not rest on a proper footing and though she was hardly aware of it she felt the indignity of the probability of being jilted being talked over by such persons as pat brady  your brother mary might have saved himself the throuble of telling lies about either the captain or me not of course that i care  oh it warnt pat miss said it only he heard it you know miss through the counthry  well it dont signify who said it but dont you be repeating what i told you  is it i miss sorrow a word miss will any one hear from me av it would i tell a lie about it but ill be glad to see the day youre married for thatll be the great wedding through the counthryoh laws  this exclamation was not a part of the last speech but was a kind of longdrawn melancholy sigh which did not take place for some minute or two after she had done speaking during which time feemy had been thinking of her own affairs quite forgetful of mary brady and her wedding  my mary what are you sighing about  well then miss feemy and isnt it a dreadful thing to be laving ones home and ones frinds like and to be going right away into another house intirely miss and altogether the thoughts of what is the married life at all frets me greatly  why you neednt be married unless you like it mary  oh miss feemy thats in course too but then a young woman is behove to do something for her family  but you havent a family you know mary now  no but miss feemy alanna you know the chances is i shall have now im to be married and its for them the little innocents i does it  the strength of this argument did not exactly strike feemy but she thought it was all right and said nothing  and then the throubles of a married life darlingsupposing them is too many for me whatll i do at all i wonder miss feemy will i get any sleep at all  indeed mary i was never married but why shouldnt you sleep  deed then miss i dont jist know but they do be saying that denis is so noisy at nights ashoeing all the cattle over again as he shod in the day and counting the money and you see av he was hammering away the blessed livelong night that way maybe id be hurted  its too late for you to think of that now but hell be quieter than that i should think when youre with him  maybe he will miss and as you say i couldnt dacently be off it now but thinoh lawsim thinking what will poor pat be doing without me and no one in it at all to bile the pratees and feed the pigsthe craturs  thats nonsense maryyou and he was always fighting hell have more peace in it when youre gone  thats thrue for you miss sartanly and thats what breaks the heart of me intirely too much pace isnt good for pat no how hell never do no good youll see when he comes to have so much of his own way deed then the hearts low within me to be laving pat this way and miss brady put the tail of her gown into the corner of her eye  but mary youll have to be caring more for your husband now i suppose you love denis mcgovery dont you id never marry a man unless i loved him  oh thats in coursei do love him why wouldnt i for he has a nice little room all dacently furnished for any young woman to go intobesides the shop and he never has the horses at all into the one we sleeps in as is to be and hes a handful of money and can make any woman comfortable and in course i love himso i do but whats the use of loving a man if hes to be hammering away at a horseshoe all night  oh theyre making game of youthey are mary depend upon it when hes tired working all day hell sleep sound enough  well i sposes he will but now miss feemy i wonder is he a quiet sort of man will he be fighting at all do you think  really then i cant tell but even if he does they say you can take your own part pretty well when its necessary  for the matter of that so i can and i dont mind a scrimmage jist now and againsich as i and pat haveav its only to show i wont be put under but they do say denis is very sthrong i dont think id ever have had him av id known afore hed been so mortial sthrong  well thats all too late now for you to be talking of and take my advice mary dont be fighting with him at all if you can help it for from what people say of him i think your husband as will be sticks mostly to his own way and i dont think hell let his wife interfere but hes a hardworking man and itll be a great comfort to you that youll never see your children wanting  oh the childhren the little dears its of them im thinking god he knows its chiefly along of them as makes me do it butoh laws miss its a dreadful thing to come over one all at once but its a great comfort anyway your letting biddy come down to ready the mutton and pratees and things and so miss as ive so much to do youll excuse my waiting any longer and you and mr thady and the captainfor im thinking the masther wont be comingll not be down later than sivin for father johns to be in it at sivin exact  and whos to get the kiss mary  oh miss  the captain says hell have a try for it anyway  oh thatd be too much honor intirely miss but av here isnt father john coming up the avenue  and mary hurried off into the realms under ground to secure the willing assistance of biddy and father johns ponderous foot up the hall steps gave feemy anything but a pleasant sensation she was very fond of father john too but somehow just at present she did not feel quite pleased to see him  the doors were all open and father john walked into feemys boudoir however he was only father john and it wasnt her dress therefore that annoyed her any dress would do for a priest  after the common greetings were over and father john had asked after the family and feemy had surmised that it was either her father or her brother that he wished to see the priest began his task  no feemy my dear its not your father or your brother i want to see this turn but just your own self and father john sat himself down by the fire im come just to have a little chat with you and you musnt be angry with me for meddling with what perhaps youll say was no business of mine  this exordium made feemys heart palpitate for she knew it must be about captain ussher but she only said  oh no father john i wont be angry with you  thats my darling for you know its only out of love for you and thady that im speaking and a real friend to you cant do you any harm if after all you shouldnt take his advice  oh no father john and im sure im very much obliged to you  father john himself hardly knew how to take the sting from the rebuke which he was aware his mission could not but convey and he was no less aware that unless the dose had a little sugar in it at any rate to hide its unprepossessing appearance even if it did not render it palatable his patient would never take it  thady you know was dining with me yesterday and we were talking over ballycloran and old flannellys money matters and i was you see just making a bad tenants excuses to him and so on from one thing to another till we got talking about you feemyin short he didnt seem quite happy about you  i dont know i ever did anything to make him unhappy  no it wasnt anything you had done to make him unhappy but he is afraid you aint happy in yourself and feemy my dear you should always remember that though thady is rough in his manners and perhaps not at all times so gentle in his words as he should be his heart is in the right placeat any rate where you are concerned though maybe he doesnt say so as often as others might hes a very fond brother to you  and im sure im always very fond of himbut then hes so queer but father john if ive offended thady ill beg his pardon for im sure i dont want to be out with him  im sure you dont feemy but thats not exactly it either thadys not the least in life offended with you hes not at all easy to take offence at least not with you but he doesnt think you are just at ease with yourself and to come to the truth at once he was telling me what passed between you yesterday  feemy blushed up to her paper curls but she said nothing  now im thinking thady didnt go about saying what he wanted to say yesterday quite the way he should have done and i am not sure i shall do it any better myself but i thought it as well to step up as i was certain youd hear whatever your priest had to say to you  i dont think the better of thady though for going and talking about me if hed only let me alone by myself id do well enough its all that talking does the harm father john  father john didnt exactly like to tell feemy that girls in her situation were just the people that ought not to be left alone by themselveswhich probably means being left alone with some one of their own choosing and that he was of opinion that she would not do very well if left alone in that way that however was what he wished to convey to her  oh but my dear you must think better of thady for wishing to protect you as well as he can and you left alone so much yourself here so you knowand father john even blushed a little as he said itits about this fine lover of yours we are speaking now my dear ive nothing whatever to say against captain ussher for you know he and i are great cronies indeed its only last night he was taking his punch with your brother and cullen down at the cottage  you werent saying anything to captain ussher about me father john  you may take your oath of that my dear i respect a ladys secret a great deal too much for that no i was only saying that he was down at the cottage last night to prove that he and i are friends and its not out of any prejudice im speakingabout his being a protestant and all that not but that id sooner be marrying you to a good catholic feemybut thats neither here nor there but youve known him now a long time its now four months since we all heard for certain it was to be a match and to tell you the truth my dear people are saying that captain ussher doesnt mean anything serious  i think theyll dhrive me mad with their talk and what good will it do for you and thady to be coming telling me what they say  this good feemy if what they say is false and unfounded as i am sure i hope it isand if youre so fond of captain ussherdont you think it would be as well to put an end to the report by telling your father and brother of your being engaged and settling something about your marriage and all that  i did tell my brother i was engaged father john what would you have  ill tell you what id have id have captain ussher ask your father or brothers consent theres no doubt we all know but hed get it but its customary and in my mind it would only be decent  so he will i dare say but maynt there be rasons why he dont wish to have it talked about yet  then feemy in your situation do you think a long clandestine engagement is quite the thing for you is quite prudent  and how can it be clandestine father john when you and thady and every one else almost knows all about it  feemys sharpness was too much for father john so he had to put it on another tack  well feemy now just look at the matter this way one moment supposing nowonly just for suppositionthis lover of yours was not the sort of man we all take him to be and that he was to turn out false or inconstant suppose now it turned out he had another wife somewhere else  oh thats nonsense you know father john  yes but just supposing itor that he took some vagary into his head and changed his mind you must have heard of men doing such things and why shouldnt your lover as well as another girls were all likely to be deceived in people and why maynt we be as well deceived in captain ussher as others have been in those they loved as well well all hope and think and believe its not so but isnt it as well to be on the safe side particularly in so important a thing as your happiness feemy you wouldnt like it to be said through the country that youd been jilted by the handsome captain and that youd been thrown off by your lover as soon as he was tired of you  and thats thrue for you father john but myles isnt tired of me else why should he be coming up here to see me oftener than ever  but its that he never may be tired of you feemy take my word for it hell respect you a great deal more if youll show more respect to yourself  well father john and what is it youd have me be doing  why then id just ask him to speak a word to thadyjust to propose himself in the regular way  but thady hates him so  no thady dont hate him hes only jealous lest captain ussher isnt treating you quite as he ought to do  but thady is so queer in his manners and i know myles wouldnt like to be asking leave and permission to be courting me  but feemy he must like it and you shouldnt like your lover the more for thinking so little of your brother or for the matter of that of yourself either  you know father john i cant help what he thinks of thady as to his thinking of me im quite satisfied with that and i suppose thats enough  father john was beginning to wax wroth partly because he was displeased with feemy himself and partly because feemy answered him too knowingly  well then feemy itll be one of the two either captain ussher will have to speak to thady and settle something about the marriage in a proper and decent way or else thady will be speaking to him and now which do you think will be the best  its not like you father john to be making thady quarrel with captain ussher you know itd come to a quarrel if thady was to be spaking to myles that way and he would never think of doing so av you didnt be putting him up to it  and thats little like you feemy to be saying that to your priest telling me i put the young men up to be quarrelling its to save you many a heartache and many a sting of sorrow and remorse its to prevent all the evil of unlawful lovebad blood and false looksthat ive come here on a most disagreeable and thankless errand and now you tell me id be putting the young men up to fight  feemy had by this time become sullen but she didnt dare go farther with her priest  i didnt say youd be making them fight father john i only said if you told thady not to be meddling with myles why in course they wouldnt be quarrelling  and how could i tell a brother not to meddle with his sisters honour and reputation and happiness but now feemy ill propose another plan to you if you dont think my advice on such a subject likely to be goodand very likely it isnt for you see i never had a lover of my ownwhat do you say to your speaking to your friend mrs mckeon about it or if you like ill speak to her and then perhaps you wont be against taking her advice on the subject supposing now she was to speak to captain ussherfrom herself you know as your frienddo you think hed love the girl thats to be his wife worse for having a friend that was willing to stand in the place of a mother to her when shed none of her own  why i do think it would look odd mrs mckeon meddling with it  well then feemy what in the blessed name do you mean to do if you wont let any of your friends act for you i think you must be very much afraid of this lover of yours when you wont allow any one speak to him about you are you afraid of him feemy  afraid of himno of course im not afraid of him but men dont like to be bothered about such things  thats very true men when theyre false and try to deceive young girls and are playing their own wicked game with them do not like to be bothered about such things but i never heard of an honest man who really wanted to marry a young woman being bothered by getting her friends consent and you think then things should go on just as they are  now father john only youve been scolding me so much id have told you before i mane to spake to myles myself tonight just to arrange things and then i wont have mrs mckeon cocking over me that she made up the match  theres little danger of that kind i fear feemy nor would she be doing so but if you are actually going to speak to captain ussher yourself tonight ill say no more about it now but i hope youll tell thady tomorrow what passes  oh father john i wont promise that  will you tell me then or mrs mckeon  oh perhaps ill be telling you you know when i come down to confession at christmas but indeed i shant be telling mrs mckeon anything about it to go talking over the counthry  then feemy i may as well tell you at onceif you will not trust to me to your brother or any friend who may be able to protect you from insultnor prevail on your lover to come forward in a decent and respectable way and avow his purposeit will become your brothers duty to tell him that his visits can no longer be allowed at ballycloran  ballycloran doesnt belong to thady and he cant tell him not to come  thats not well said of you feemy for you know your father is not capable of interfering in this business but if as under those circumstances he will do thady quietly and firmly desires captain ussher to stay away from ballycloran i think hell not venture to come here if he does there are those who will still interfere to prevent him  and if among you all that are so set up against him because hes not one of your own set you dhrive him out of ballycloran i can tell you ill not remain in it  then your sins and your sorrows must be on your own head  and without saying anything further father john took his hat and walked off feemy snatched her novel into her lap to show how little what was said impressed her and resumed her attitude over the fire but she didnt read her spirit was stubborn and wouldnt bend but her reason and her conscience were touched by what the priest had said to her and the bitter thought for the first time came over her that her lover perhaps was not so true to her as she to him there she sat sorrowfully musing and though she did not repent of what she thought her own firmness she was bitterly tormented by the doubts with which her brother mary brady and the priest had gradually disturbed her happiness  she loved ussher as well as everyes almost more than ever as the idea that she might perhaps lose him came across herbut she began to be discontented with herself and to think that she had not played her part as well as she might in fact she felt herself to be miserable and for the time hated her brother and father john for having made her so  father john walked sorrowfully back to his cottage thinking miss feemy macdermot the most stiffnecked young lady it had ever been his hard lot to meet     chapter ix  mohill   we must now request our reader to accompany us to the little town of mohill not that there is anything attractive in the place to repay him for the trouble of going there  mohill is a small country town standing on no high road nor on any thoroughfare from the metropolis and therefore it owes to itself whatever importance it may possessand in truth that is not much it is or at any rate was at the time of which we are writing the picture of an impoverished townthe property of a nonresident landlorddestitute of anything to give it interest or prosperitywithout business without trade and without society the idea that would strike one on entering it was chiefly this why was it a town at allwhy were there on that spot so many houses congregated called mohillwhat was the inducement to people to come and live therewhy didnt they go to longford to cavan to carrick to dublinanywhere rather than there when they were going to settle themselves this is a question which proposes itself at the sight of many irish towns they look so poor so destitute of advantage so unfriended mohill is by no means the only town in the west of ireland that strikes one as being there without a cause  it is built on the side of a steep hill and one part of the town seems constantly threatening the destruction of the other every now and again down each side of the hill there is a slated house but they are few and far between and the long spaces intervening are filled with the most miserable descriptions of cabinshovels without chimneys windows door or signs of humanity except the children playing on the collected filth in front of them the very scraughs of which the roofs are composed are germinating afresh and sickly green with a new growth look more like the tops of longneglected dungheaps than the only protection over christian beings from the winds of heaven  look at that mud hovel on the left which seems as if it had thrust itself between its neighbours so narrow is its front the doorway all insufficient as it is takes nearly the whole facing to the street the roof looking as if it were only the dirty eaves hanging from its more aspiring neighbour on the right supports itself against the cabin on the left about three feet above the ground can that be the habitation of any of the human race few but such as those whose lot has fallen on such barren places would venture in but for a moment let us see what is there  but the dark misery within hides itself in thick obscurity the unaccustomed eye is at first unable to distinguish any object and only feels the painful effect of the confined smoke but when at length a faint struggling light makes its way through the entrance how wretched is all around  a sickly woman the entangled nature of whose insufficient garments would defy description is sitting on a low stool before the fire suckling a miserably dirty infant a boy whose only covering is a tattered shirt is putting fresh but alas damp turf beneath the pot in which are put to boil the potatoestheir only food two or three dim childrentheir number is lost in their obscurityare cowering round the dull dark fire atop of one another and on a miserable pallet beyonda few rotten boards propped upon equally infirm supports and covered over with only one thin black quiltis sitting the master of the mansion his grizzly unshorn beard his lantern jaws and shaggy hair are such as his home and family would lead one to expect and now you have counted all that this man possesses other furniture has he noneneither table nor chair except that low stool on which his wife is sitting squatting on the groundfrom off the ground like pigs only much more poorly fedhis children eat the scanty earnings of his continual labour  and yet for this abode the man pays rent  the miserable appearance of irish peasants when in the very lowest poverty strikes one more forcibly in the towns than in the open country the dirt and filth around them seems so much more oppressive on them they have no escape from it there is much also in ideas and associations on a roadside or on the borders of a bog the dusty colour of the cabin walls the potato patch around it the green scraughs or damp brown straw which form its roof all the appurtenances in fact of the cabin seem suited to the things around it but in a town this is not so it evidently should not be thereits squalidness and filth are all that strike you poverty to be picturesque should be rural suburban misery is as hideous as it is pitiable  again see that big house with such pretensions to comfort and even elegancewith its neat slated roof brass knocker on the door verandahs to the large sashed windows and iron railing before the front its very grandeur is much more striking that from each gableend hangs another cabin the same as those we have above described it is true that an entrance for horses cars and carriages has been constructed as it were through one end of the house itself otherwise the mansion is but one house in the continuous street  here lives mr cassidy the agent a fat goodnatured easy man with an active grown up son every one says that mr cassidy is a good man as good to the poor as he can be but he is not the landlord he is only the agent what can he do more than he does is the landlord then so hard a man so regardless of those who depend on him in all their wants and miseries no indeed lord birmingham is also a kind good man a most charitable man look at his name on all the lists of gifts for unfortunates of every description is he not the presiding genius of the company for relieving the poles a vicepresiding genius for relieving destitute authors destitute actors destitute clergymens widows destitute halfpay officers widows is he not patron of the mendicity society patron of the lyingin small pox lock and fever hospitals is his name not down for large amounts in aid of funds of every description for lessening human wants and pangs how conspicuous and eager a part too he took in giving the poor blacks their liberty was not his aid strongly and gratefully felt by the friends of catholic emancipation in short is not every one aware that lord birmingham has spent a long and brilliant life in acts of public and private philanthropy tis true he lives in england was rarely in his life in ireland never in mohill could he be blamed for this could he live in two countries at once or would the world have been benefited had he left the parliament and the cabinet to whitewash irish cabins and assist in the distribution of meal  this would be his own excuse and does it not seem a valid one yet shall no one be blamed for the misery which belonged to him for the squalid sources of the wealth with which poles were fed and literary paupers clothed was no one answerable for the grim despair of that halfstarved wretch whom but now we saw looking down so sadly on the young sufferers to whom he had given life and poverty that can hardly be and if we feel the difficulty which among his numerous philanthropic works lord birmingham must experience in attending to the state of his numerous dependents it only makes us reflect more often that from him to whom much is given much indeed will be required  but we are getting far from our story going a little further down the hill there is a lane to the right this always was a dirty illconditioned lane of bad repute and habits father mathew and the rigour of the police have of late somewhat mended its manners and morals here too one now sees but a short way from the main street the grand new stirring poorhouse which ten years ago was not in being  in this lane at the time to which we allude the widow mulready kept the shebeen shop of which mention has before been made  in her business mrs mulready acquired much more profit than respectability for whether well or illdeserved she had but a bad name in the country in spite of this however to the company assembled here on wednesday eveningthe same evening that thady dined with father johnwe must introduce our readers  the house or rather cabin consisted only of two rooms both on the ground and both without flooring or ceiling the black rafters on which the thatch was lying was above and the uneven soil below still this place of entertainment was not like the cabins of the very poor the rooms were both long and as they ran lengthways down the street each was the full breadth of the house in the first sat the widow mulready a strong redfaced indomitablelooking woman about fifty she sat on a large wooden seat with a back capable of containing two persons there was an immense blazing fire of turf on which water was boiling in a great potato pot should any of her guests be able to treat themselves to the expensive luxury of punch a remarkably dirty small deal table was beside her on which were placed a large jar containing a quantity of the only merchandize in which she dealt and an old battered pewter measure in which she gave it out in a corner of the table away from the fire was cut a hole through the board in which was stuck a small flickering candle no further implements appeared necessary to mrs mulready in the business which she conducted a barefooted girl with unwashed hands and face and unbrushed head crouched in the corner of the fire ready to obey the behests of mrs mulready and attend to the numerous calls of her customers this hebe rejoiced in the musical name of kathleen  the mohill resort of the wicked the desperate and the drunken was not certainly so grand nor so conspicuous as the gaslighted mahogany fitted pilastered gin palaces of london but the freedom from decent restraint and the power of inebriety at a cheap rate were the same in each  there was a door at the further end of the room which opened into the one where mrs mulreadys more known and regular visitors were accustomed to sit and drink and here rumour said a ribon lodge was held there was a fire also here at the further end and a long narrow table ran nearly the whole length of the room under the two windows with a form on each side of it opposite this was mrs mulreadys own bed which proved that whatever improprieties might be perpetrated in the house the careful widow herself never retired to rest till they were all over  the assembly on the night in question was not very numerous there might be about twelve in it and they all were of the poorer kind some even had neither shoes or stockings and there was one poor fellow had neither hat nor coatnothing but a tattered shirt and trousers  the most decent among them all was pat brady who occupied a comfortable seat near the fire drinking his tumbler of punch and smoking like a gentleman joe reynolds was sitting on the widows bed with a spade in his hand he had only just come in they were all from drumleesh with one or two exceptions the man without the coat was jack byrne the brother of the man whom captain ussher had taken when the malt was found in his brotherinlaws house  kathleen agra hallooed joe reynolds bring me a glass of sperrits will you  send out the rint joe hallooed out the wary widow and kathleen came in for the money  sorrow to your sowl then mother mulready dye think im so bad already then that they havent left me the price of a glass and he put three halfpence into the girls hand  oh joe said brady dont be taking your sperrits that way come over here like a dacent fellow and well be talking over this  oh thats all right for you pat youve nothing to be dhriving the life out of yer very heart i am cowld within me and divil a word ill spake till i dhriv it out of me with the sperrits and he poured the glass of whiskey down his throat as though he was pouring it into a pitcher and now my boys youll see joe reynolds ll talk may be as well as any of you give us a draw of the pipe pat  he took the pipe from pats hand and stuck it in his mouth  well jack i seed your brother in carrick and i towld him how youd done all you could for him and pawned the clothes off your back to scrape the few shillings together for him and what dye think hed have me do then why he towld me to take the money to hyacinth keegan esq jist to stand to him and get him off why he couldnt do it not av he was to give his sowland thats not his own to give for the divil has it and av he could he wouldnt walk across carrick to do them a good turnthough by jasus hed be quick enough pocketing the brads begad jack and its cowld youre looking without the frieze come and warm your shins my boy and take a draw out of pats pipe  and joe said pat what magisthrates war there in it  why there war sir michael and counsellor webb and there war that black ruffian jonas brown  and they jist sent him back to gaol agin joe  no they didnt counsellor webb stuck to the boys hard and fast while he could both his own boys and poor tim and that he may never sup sorrow for he proved hisself this day the raal friend to the poor man  but it war all no good in the end  divil a good that thief of the world old brown after axing ussher a sight of questions was sthrong for sending em back and then counsellor webb axed ussher how he could prove that the boys knew the stuff was in it and he the blackhearted viper said that warnt necessary so long as they war in the same house and then they jawed it out ever so long and ussher said as how the whole counthry through war worse than ever with the stills and counsellor webb said that war the fault of the landlords and brown said he hoped theyd take every mothers son of em as they could lay hands on in the counthry and bring em there and so they jawed it out a long while and then sir michael whod niver said a word at all good bad or indifferent said as how paddy byrne and smith war to pay each twenty pounds and tim ten or else to go to gaol as long as the bloody owld barrister chose to keep em there  jack said one of the others did paddy dy remimber happen to have an odd twenty pound in his breeches pocket becase av so he might jist put it down genteel and walk out afore thim all  well then corney answered jack with pat bradys pipe in his mouth av paddy had sich a thrifle about then i disremember it entirely but shure why wouldnt he hed hardly be so far as carrick in sich good company too without a little change in his pocket  but to go and put twenty pound on them boys observed the more earnest joe the like of them to be getting twenty pounds mightnt he as well have said twenty thousand and tin pounds on tim too more power to you jonas brown tin pounds for a poor boys warming his shins and gagging over an owld hags bit of turf  but joe said brady is it in carrick theyre to stop  not at all theyre to go over to the bridewell in ballinamore captain greenough was there a lot of his men is to take them to ballinamore tomorrow unless indeed they all has the thrifle of change in their pockets corney was axing about  and supposing now joe said jack the boys paid the money or some of the gentlemen put it down for em whod be getting it  sorrow a one of me rightly knows who would be getting the brads pat av they war paid  whod be getting em why who would have em but masther ussher dye think hed be so keen afther the stills av he war not to make something by it where dye think hed be making out the hunters and living there better nor the gentlemen themselves av he didnt be getting the fines and rewards and things for sazing the whiskey  choke him for fines said jack that the gay horse he rides might break the wicked neck of him  sorrow a good is there in cursing boys continued joe av there war any of you reallyd have the heart to be doing anything  whatd we be doing joe kicking our toes agin carrick gaol till the police comed and spiked us the boys is now in gaol and there theyre like to be for anything well do to get em out again  joe reynolds was now puzzled a little so he fumbled in his pockets and bringing out another three halfpence hallooed to kathleen  kathleen dye hear ye young divils imp bring me another half noggin of speerits and he gave her the halfpence and here bring a glass for jack too  sind out the rint joe my darling again bawled the widow proving that very little said in the inner room was lost upon her  oh sink you and your rint you owld hag but he paid for the glass for his friend and may i be dd if they aint the very last coppers ive got  long life to you joe said the other as he swallowed the raw whiskey may be ill be able to stand to you the same way some of these days bad as things is yet you is all to be up at ballycloran afther tomorrow with the rints eh brady whatll you be saying to the young masther joe  joe was now somewhat elated by the second glass of whiskey  what ll i be saying to him is it well ill tell you what ill be saying ill just say thisi owes two years rint misther macdermot for the thrifle of bog and the cabin i holds up at drumleesh and theres what i got to pay it and ill show him what he may put in his eye and see none the worse and ill go on and ill say now misther macdermot there is the bit of oats up there as i and poor tim broke the back of us dhrying the land for last

what you can do misther macdermot and when youve done all that therell be one as would have stood betwixt you and all harum will then go far enough to give you back your own in the hardships youve druv him to and then ill go on and ill say and you can do thisyou can tell me to go and be dd as ye did many a day and give me what bad language ye like and you can send pat to me next day or so jist

now patfor he tells you pretty much allwhatll the masther be saying to that  whatll he be saying to it joe faix then i dont know what hell be saying to it its little mind i think hell have to be saying much comfort to any of you for hell be vexed and out with everything jist at present he doesnt like the way that captain ussher is schaming with his sister  like it no i wonder av he did a blackhearted protestant like him what business is it a macdermot would have taking up with the likes of him  thats not it neither joe but he thinks the captain dont mane fair by miss feemy and by the blessed virgin he aint far wrong  then why dont he knock the life out of the traitor or av there is rasons why he shouldnt do it hisself why dont he get one of the boys asd be glad of the job to help him look here pat and reynolds went over to the fireplace and with his arm against the back wall and leaning down over the seat where brady was sitting began whispering earnestly in his ear and then brady muttered something dissenting in a low voice and reynolds went on whispering again with gesticulations and many signs this continued for a long time till corney exclaimed  what the divil boys are ye colloquing about there arnt we all sworn frinds and what need ye be whispering about why cant ye spake what yeve got to say out like a man instead of huggery muggering there in the corner with brady as though any one here wasnt thrue to ye all  whist corney ye born idiot ye dont know i spose what long ears the old hag there has and yed be wanting her to hang two or three of us i spose  divil a hang joe av no one towld of any but her wed be safe enough that way but what is it yere saying  but instead of answering him reynolds continued urging something to pat brady at last he exclaimed  tear and ages and why wouldnt he side with the boys as lives on his own land av he dont make frinds of them where will he find frinds is it among the great gintlemen of the counthry by dad they dont think no more of him nor they do of us and is it the likes of captain ussher asll be good frinds to him hes thinking of his own schames and taking the honest name from his sister is that his frind pat  didnt i tell ye joe he hates ussher a dd sight worse nor you or i theres little need to say anything to him about that  why wouldnt he join us then who else is there to help him at all wont he be as bad as we are if flannelly dhrives him and the ould man out of ballycloran but av hell stick to us divil a lawyer of em all shall put a keeper on the lands and i said before and i say it aginand av i prove a liar may i never see the blessed gloryav young macdermot ll help the boys to right themselves the first foot keegan puts on ballycloran he shall leave there by gd  but joe spose now mr thady agreed to join you here whatd you have him be doing at all  id have him lend a hand to punish the murthering ruffian as have got half the counthry dhruv into gaols and as is playing his tricks now with his own sisther  but what could any of you do you wouldnt dare knock the chap on the head  who wouldnt dare by the tarnal id dare it myself isnt there two of us here whose brothers is

as bad to him as he did to paddy av they hung him then id murther him and wilcome but paddyll be out of that some of these daysand i think therefore joe av we stripped his ears itd do this go  jack byrnes equal justice pleased the majority of his hearers but it did not satisfy joe as for pat he continued smoking and said nothing  oh my boys thats nonsense said joe either do the job or let it alone av youve a mind to let captain ussher walk into your cabins and take any of you off to carrick jist as he plazeswhy you can but im dd if i does ive had enough of him now and by the tarnal powers though i swing for it putting tim in gaol shall cost him his life  joe was very much excited and half tipsy but he only said what most of them were waiting to hear said and what each of them expected not one voice was raised in dissent pat said nothing but smoked and gazed on the fire  masther thadyll be in at the wedding tomorrow pat  oh in course he will  will you be axing him thin  axing him what is it to murther ussher  no in course not that but will you be thrying him will he join wid us to rid the counthry of him  i tell ye joe hes willing enough to be shut of him entirely av he knew

ll have a dhrop together you shant say i let you go away dhry  the rest made it up among them and kathleen having duly received the price in advance brought in a glass of spirits for each the widow mulready had only two glasses and they therefore had to drink one after the other joe took his first saying and theres more power and success to you captain ussher and its a fine gentleman is the only name for ye but av youre above the sod this day three months may none of us that is in it this night ever see the blessed glory  and they all drank the toast which their leader gave them  they now prepared to leave but not so quickly but that mrs mulready had to give them very forcible hints that she wanted quiet possession of her bedroom and much animated conversation passed on the occasion  and now ant ye a pretty set of boys the whole of ye blackguards that ye are that ye cant dhrink yer sperrits quietly in a lone womans house but you must be bringing the town on her by yer dd ructions and av i niver saw the foot of any of ye agin its little id be grieving for ye  quit that you ould hag of the divil or ill give you more to talk about thanll plaze you  is it you joe by the mortial then if ye dont quit that youll soon be having a stone roof over yer head by the blessed virgin ill be the hanging of you av you dont be keeping yerself to yerself  is it hanging yer talking of and wherell you be yerself not but hangings twice too good for you come corney is you coming up to loch sheen  after a few more exchanges of similar civilities between the landlady and her guests the latter at length took their departure and the widow having duly put away the apparatus of her trade that is having drank what whiskey there remained in the jug betook herself to her couch in her usual state of intoxication  joe reynolds and pat brady had each about three miles to go home and the greater part of the way they walked togethertalking over their plans and discussing the probability of their success  the two men were very different the former was impoverished desperate all but houseless he had been continually at war with the world and the world with him whether had he been more fortunate he might have been an honest man is a question difficult to solve most certainly he had been a hard working man but his work had never come to good he had long been a maker of potheen and from the different rows in which he had been connected had got a bad name through the country the effect of all this was that he was now desperate ready not only to take part against any form of restrictive authority but anxious to be a leader in doing so he had somehow conceived the idea that it would be a grand thing to make a figure through the country and as he would have said himself av he were hanged what harum  pat brady was a very different character in a very poor country he enjoyed comparative comfort he had never been rendered desperate by want and oppression poor as was the ballycloran property he had always by his driving and ejecting and by one or another art of rural law which is always sure to be paid for managed to live decently and certainly above want it was difficult to conceive why he should be leagued with so desperate a set of men sworn together to murder a government officer  yet in the conversation they had going home he was by far the most eager of the two he spoke of the certainty they had of getting young macdermot to join them the next evening told reynolds how he would get him if possible to drink and when excited would bring him out to talk to the boys in short planned and arranged all those things about which reynolds had been so anxiousbut as to which he could get so little done at the widows when there pat had been almost silent at any rate he had himself proposed nothing it had never occurred to the other poor fellow that brady was making a tool of him that though the rentcollector was now so eager in proving how easily young macdermot might be induced to join their party he would commit himself to nothing when they were congregated at the widow mulreadys had reynolds not been so completely duped he would have seen that brady made him take the part of leader when others were present who might possibly be called upon as witnesses but that when they were alone together he brady was always the most eager to press the necessity of some desperate measure on the present occasion too reynolds was half drunk whereas brady was quite sober  so said the latter on their way home thim boys is fixed in gaol for the next twelve months any way tim warnt thinking hed get lodgings for nothing so long when he went up to widow smiths there at loch sheen  well pat a year is a dreary long time for a poor boy to be locked up all for nothing and poor tim wont bear up well as most might but he that put him there will soon be sent where hell be treated even worser than tim at ballinamoreand he wont get out of it that soon by gd id sooner be in tims shoes this night than in captain usshers fine gentleman as he thinks hisself  but joe will them boys from loch sheen let tim and the others be taken quietly to ballinamore wont they try a reskey on the road  there arnt that sperrit left in em patand how should it what is the like of them with their shilelahs and may be a few stones agin them b pailers in the daylight av it had been at night we might have tried a reskey but the sperrit aint in em at all i axed em to go snacks with me in doing the job but they was afeardand no wonder  well youll be up at marys wedding tomorrow and see what the young masther ll be saying  and so the two friends parted to their different homes     chapter x  mr keegan   it will be remembered that the priest left feemy after his stormy interview in a somewhat irritable mood she was still chewing the cud of the bitter thoughts to which the events of the last few hours had given rise and was trying to make herself believe that her brother and father john and pat brady and all the rest of them were wrong in their detestable surmises and that her own myles was true to her when another stranger called at ballycloran and a perfect stranger he must have been for he absolutely raised the lionheaded rusty knocker and knocked at the doora ceremony to which the customary visitors of the house never dreamed of having recourse so unusual was this proceeding that it frightened the sole remaining domestic katty out of all her decorum it will be remembered that mary brady had absconded with biddy poor katty did not well know how to act under the trying emergencies of the case she could not get to the door of miss feemys parlour as a strange gentleman was standing in the hall so she ran round the house and ascertaining that the intruder was well in the hall and could not see her she clambered up to her mistresss window and exclaimed  hist miss feemy theres a sthranger gintleman a rapping at the big knocker and i think its the fat lawyer from carrick whatll i do thin miss  why you fool whispered feemy through one of the broken panes of glass go and ask him who he wants and tell him thady ant at home  so katty dropped from the windowsill again and went to receive the gentleman into the house by following him in at the hall door by the time however that she had entered herself old larry macdermot had been aroused out of his lethargy by a third knocking of the stranger and on opening his own parlour door was startled to see mr hyacinth keegan the attorney from carrick on shannon standing before him  mr hyacinth keegan requires some little introduction as he is one of the principal personages of my tale as father cullen before remarked his father was a processserver living at a small town called drumshambothat is he obtained his bread by performing the legal acts to which irish landlords are so often obliged to have resort in obtaining their rent from their tenants this processserver was a poor man and a roman catholic but he had managed to give his son a decent education he had gotten him a place as an errand boy in an attorneys office from whence he had risen to the dignity of clerk and he was now not only an attorney himself but a flourishing one and a protestant to boot his great step in the world had been his marriage with sally flannellythat sally whom macdermot had rejectedfor from the time of his wedding he had much prospered in all worldly things he was a hardworking man and in that consisted his only good quality he was plausible a good flatterer not deficient in that sort of sharpness which made him a successful attorney in a small provincial town and he could be a jovial companion when called on to take that part principle had never stood much in his way and he had completely taught himself to believe that what was legal was right and he knew how to stretch legalities to the utmost as a convert mr keegan was very enthusiastically attached to the protestant religion and the tory party for which he had fought tooth and nail at the last county election  mr keegan boasted a useful kind of courage he cared but little for the ill name he had acquired by his practice in the country among the poorer classes and to do him justice had shown pluck enough in the dangerous duties which he sometimes had to perform for he acted as agent to the small properties of some absentee landlords and for a man of his character such duties in county leitrim were not at that time without risk he had been shot at had once been knocked off his horse and had received various threatening letters but it always turned out that he discovered the aggressor and prosecuted and convicted him one man he had transported for life in the last case the man who had shot at him was hung and consequently the people began to be afraid of mr keegan  our friend was fond of popularity and was consequently a bit of a sportsman as most connaught attorneys are he had the shooting of two or three bogs kept a good horse or two went to all the country races and made a small book on the events of the curragh these accomplishments all had their effect and as i said before mr keegan was successful in appearance he was a large burly man gradually growing corpulent with a soft oily face on which there was generally a smile and well for him that there was for though his smile was not prepossessing and carried the genuine stamp of deceit it concealed the malice treachery and selfishness which his face so plainly bore without it his eyes were light large and bright but it was that kind of brightness which belongs to an opaque and not to a transparent bodythey never sparkled his mouth was very large and his lip heavy and he carried a huge pair of brickcoloured whiskers his dress was somewhat dandified but it usually had not a few of the characteristics of a horse jockey in age he was about fortyfive his wife was some years his senior he had married her when she was rather falling into the yellow leaf and though mr hyacinth keegan was always on perfectly good and confidential terms with his respected fatherinlaw report in carrick on shannon declared that great battles took place beside the attorneys fireside as to who was to have dominion in the house the ladys temper also might be a little roused by the illnatured reports which reached her ears that her handsome hyacinth lavished more of his attentions and gallantry abroad than at home such was the visitor who now came to call at ballycloran  mr macdermot was very much surprised for mr keegans business with ballycloran was never done by personal visits if money was received thady used to call and pay it at keegans office if other steps were to be taken he employed one of those messengers so frequently unwelcome at the houses of the connaught gentry and this usually ended in thady calling at mr keegans for a fresh bill for his father to sign old macdermot was therefore so surprised that he knew not how to address his visitor this together with his hatred of the man and his customary inability to do or say anything made him so perplexed that he could not comprehend mr keegans first words which were not only conciliatory and civil but almost affectionate  ah mr macdermot how do you dohow dye do im glad to see youvery glad to see youlooking so well too why what a time it is since i last had the pleasurebut then im so tied by the legso much business mr macdermot indeed though i was determined to drop in this morning as a friend still even now ive just a word to say on business you see i must join business and pleasure so if you are not very much engaged and could spare a minute or two why i have a little proposal to make to youacting for mr flannelly you knowwhich i think youll not be sorry to hear  the attorney had been obliged to begin his story thus far in the hallas the old man had shown no inclination to ask him into the parlour nor did larry even now move from the door and indeed he did not look as though he was a fit subject to enter on business with an attorney he had not shaved or rather been shaved since sunday last his eyes though wide open looked as if they had very lately been asleep and were not quite awake his clothes were huddled on him and hung about him almost in tatters the slaver was running down from his half open mouth and his breath smelt very strongly of whiskey  keegan finding that his host did not seem bent on hospitality was edging himself into the room when feemy who had heard his address to her father came out to the old mans relief and told the visitor that he was not just himself that morningthat thady was out but that she would desire him to call at mr keegans office the next day  ah miss feemy and hows your pretty self this morningand is it the fact what we hear down at carrick that we are to have a wedding soon at ballycloran ah well of course you wouldnt be after telling me but i was very glad to hear it that i was miss feemy but mr macdermotit was your father miss feemy i was wishing to see this morning not mr thadyif you could allow me ten minutes or sojust a message from our old friend flannellyand by this time keegan had wedged his way into the room out of which any one who knew him would be very sure he would not stir until he had said what he had come to say  larry hobbling back after him sat himself down in his accustomed chair and feemy as if to protect her father in her brothers absence followed him  its very hard then mr keegan that you should come up here as if sending your processes and latitats and distraining werent enough but now you must  ah my dear sir its not about such disagreeable business at allwere done with all that its not about such business at all when ive disagreeable jobs to doof course we must have disagreeable jobs sometimeswhy i always send some of my disagreeable fellows to do it but when ive good news why i like to bring it myself and thats why i rode down this morning  larry stupid as he was couldnt be talked round by the attorney so easily  if its good news you have why shouldnt thady hear it then i am sure poor fellow he hears enough of bad news from you one way or another and i tell you i cant understand business today and flannellys bill doesnt come round till next monthi know that and so if you plaze thady can hear what you have to say at carrick on saturday or monday or any day you plaze feemy my darling get something for mr keegan to eat ill be glad to see you eat a bit but i cant talk any more and the old man turned himself away and began groaning over the fire  you see mr keegan my father cant go to business this morning when shall i tell thady to call downbut wouldnt you take a glass of  wine feemy was going to say but she knew she had none to offer  not a taste in life of anything thank you miss feemy not a drop im very much obliged to you but im sorry to find your good father so bent on not hearing me as i have something to propose which he couldnt but be glad to hear  well father will you listen to what mr keegan has to say  dont i tell you feemy that the bill doesnt come round before november and its very hard he wont lave me in pace till that time comes  you see continued feemy that he wont hear anything dont you think youd better wait and see thady down at carrick  now this was what mr keegan did not want in fact his wish was to talk over larry macdermot to agree to something to which he feared thady would object but he had had no idea the old man would be so obstinate he however was at a loss how to proceed when feemy declared that thady was seen approaching  well then miss feemy as your brother is here and as your father isnt just himself this morning i might as well do my business with him but as it is of some importance and as mr flannelly wishes to have your fathers answer as soon as possible he will not object i hope to giving his opinion when he shall have heard what i have to say  by this time thady was before the door and on feemys calling to him informing him that mr keegan was in the house waiting to speak to him he came up into the parlour  how do you do this morning said the lawyer shaking thady by the hand how dye do ive just ridden up here to bring a message to your father from mr flannelly about this mortgage he holds but your father doesnt seem quite the thing this morning and therefore its as well you came in of course what i have to say concerns you as well as him  of course mr keegan i look after the affairs at ballycloran mostly now dont you know its me you look to for the moneyand im sorry you should have to bother my father about it just step out of the room feemy  and the young lady retreated to her own possessions  why now mr thady how you all put your backs up because an unfortunate attorney comes to call on you what im come to say is what i hope and think youll both be glad to hear and i trust youve too much good sense to put your father against it merely because it comes from me  you may be sure i shall not put my father against anything which would be good for him or feemy  well mr thady so far so good and im sure you wouldnt besides what ive got to say is greatly to your own advantage  well mr keegan out with it  why you see mr macdermotand the attorney turned to the father who sat poring over the fire as if he was determined not to hear a word that passedyou see mr macdermot mr flannelly is thinking how much better it would be to settle the affair of this mortgage out and out hes getting very old mr macdermot why thady hes more than thirty years older than your father and you see he wants to arrange all his money matters between us and the bedpost by the by i wish he didnt think so much of those nephews of his however he wishes the matter settled and i explained to him that after knowing one another so long it wouldnt be fairthough for the matter of that of course it would be fair but in fact the old man doesnt exactly wish it himselfthat is you know to foreclose at once and sell the estate  here he paused while larry merely fidgeted in his chair and thady said well mr keegan  so you see he just wishes the affair to be settled amicably i fear mr thady your father hasnt just got the amount of the principal debt  oh you know that of yourself mr keegan you know he hasnt the interest itself till i screw it out of them poor devils of tenants  well mr macdermot as you havent the money to pay the principal debt of course you cant clear the estate why you see the interest amounts to £198 odd shillings a year and before thats paidtimes is so bad you seemr flannelly is obligedobliged in his own defence you seeto run you to great expense well now perhaps youd say if flannelly wants his money at once youd borrow it on another mortgagethat is sell the mortgage mr thady but moneys so scarce these days and the property is so little improved and the tenants so bad that you couldnt raise the money on ityou couldnt possibly raise the money on it  why mr keegan father pays mr flannelly £5 per cent and the property is near to £400 a year even now  well of course if you think so i wouldnt advise you to the contrary only if so mr flannelly must foreclose at once in which case the property would be sold out and out but perhaps you could effect a loan in time  well mr keegan what was it you said you had to propose  what mr flannelly proposes you meanof course im only his messenger now what he proposes is this you see the property is so unimproved and badwhy the house is tumbling downits enough to kill your father now hes getting a little infirm  well well mr keegan what is it mr flannelly wishes to do with us  wishes to dooh he doesnt wish anything of course the law is open to him to get his own in fact the law would give him much more than he wishes to take but he proposes to buy ballycloran himself  buy ballycloran screamed larry  well well father lets hear what mr keegan has to saywell mr keegan does he propose giving anything but what he has got himself alreadyor does he propose to take the estate for the mortgage and cry quits so that father and feemy and i can walk out just where we plaze  of course not of course not its to make your father what he thinks a fair offer that im come up and its what im sure you must think is a generous offer  well out with it  well then what he proposes to do is to settle an annuity on your father for his life and give you a sum of money down for yourself and your sister  lets hear what he offers said thady  larry whose back was nearly turned to the chair where the attorney was sitting said nothing but he gave an ominous look round which showed that he had heard what had passed but it did not show that he by any means approved of the proposition  im coming to that you see the rent is mostly all swallowed up by this mortgage now can you say youve £50 a year coming into the house im afraid not mr thadyim afraid not and then all your time is occupied in collecting it and scraping it and if its true what i hearto be plain i fear youll hardly have the interest money this november and if you like mr flannellys proposal hell give in that half year so that youd have something in hand to begin and how comfortable mr macdermot would be in lodgings down at carrick youve no idea how reasonable he might board there say at dargans for instance for about ten shillings a week and im very glad i can assure you to hear of the very respectable match your sister is making ussher is a very steady nice fellow knows whats what and wont be less ready to come to the scratch when he knows hell have to touch a little ready cash  youd better let us know what your offer is and lave my sisther alone it doesnt do to bring every old womans story in when were talking business so if you plaze we wont calculate on feemys marriage  well well i didnt mean anything more than that i just heard that a match was made between them so mr macdermot mr flannelly will settle £50 a year on you paid as you like or come say a pound a week as you would probably like to pay your lodgings weekly and he would give £100 each to your son and daughter ready money down you know mr thady what do you say mr macdermot and he got up and walked round so as to stand over the side of larrys chair  didnt i tell you then i wouldnt be bothered with your business if you must come up here jawing and talking cant you have it out with thady there  well thady what do you say you see how much your fathers comfort would be improved and as i suppose after all your sister is to be married you couldnt well keep the house up and ill tell you what more mr flannelly proposes for yourself  i dont want what mr flannelly will do for me but im thinking of the old man and feemy there  well dont you see how much more comfortable he must benothing to bother him you know no bills coming due and as for yourself you should have a lease say for five years of any land you liked say forty acres or so and with your ready money you know  sure isnt the land crowded with tenants already said thady  ah yes those wretched cabin holders with their half acres mr flannelly would soon get shut of them he means to have no whiskey making on the land let me alone to eject those fellows by dad ill soon clear off most of them  what strip their roofs  yes if they wouldnt go quietly but they most of them know me now and i give you my word of honourindeed flannelly said as muchyou should have any forty acres you please at a fair rent say what the poor devils are paying now without any capital you know  no mr keegan i wouldnt have act or part in dhriving off the poor craturs that know me so well nor would i be safe if i did nor for the matter of that could i well bring myself to be one of mr flannellys tenants at ballycloran but i wont say i wont be advising the owld man to take the offer if you only make it a little fairer consider mr keegan the whole propertynigh £400 a year besides the houseand mr flannellys debt on it only £200  ah £400 a year and the house is very well said keegan but did you ever see the £400and isnt the house half falling down already  whose fault is thatwho built it then mr keeganbad luck to it for a house  well i dont know its much use going into that now but you cant say but what the proposal is a fair one  ah mr keegan £1 a week is too little for the owld man make it £100 a year for his life and give feemy £300 so that she poor girl may have some chance of neither begging or starving if she shouldnt get married and ill not go against the bargain id get a bit of land somewhere though i couldnt be a tenant on ballycloran deed for the matter of that if we must part it i dont care how long it is before i see a sod of it again  nonsense mr thady £100 a year is out of the question why your fathers hardly to be called an elderly man yet i couldnt think of advising mr flannelly to give more than he has already proposeddont you think mr macdermotand he began speaking loudly to the old man£1 a week regularly paid you know would be a nice thing for you now that your daughter is going to get married and that thady here thinks of taking a farm for himself  i towld you before id nothing to say about itand i will say nothing about it the bill dont come round till november and its very hard you should be bothering the life out of me this way  keegan turned away and taking thady by the collar of his coat led him to the window he began to find he could do nothing with larry  you see macdermot he said in a half whisper it is impossible to get your father to listen to me and therefore the responsibility must rest upon you as to advising him what hed better do and now let me put it to you this way you know that you have not the means of raising the money to pay off this debt and that flannelly can sell the estate any day he pleases wellsuppose you drive us to this and suppose the thing fetches a little over what his claim is dont you know there are great expenses attached to such a sale all would have to come out of the property and your fathers other creditors would come on the little remainder and where would you be then you see my boy its quite impossible the estate should ever come to you now by what i propose your father would sell the estate while still he had the power he would get comfortably settledand id take care to manage the annuity so that the other creditors couldnt touch it and youd get a handful of money to set you up something more decently than the way youre going on here with your tenants  but my sisther mr keegan when the home came to be taken from over her head what would become of feemy she and the owld man could hardly live on a pound a week and when the owld man should die  why nonsense man isnt your sister as good as married or if not a strapping girl like her is sure of a husband besides when shes a hundred pounds in her pocket she wont have to go far to look for a lover theres plenty in carrick would be glad to take her  take her mr keegan do you think id be offering her that way to any huckster in carrick that wanted a hundred poundor that she would put up with the like of thatbad as we are we ant come to that yet  there you go with your family pride thady but family pride wont feed you and the offer ive made will so youd better bring the old man round to accept it  make it £80 a year for my father and £250 for feemy and ill do the best i can  not a penny more than i offered indeed mr flannelly would get the property cheaper if he sold it the regular way under the mortgage so that he doesnt care about it only hed sooner you got the difference than strangerswell you wont get the old man to take the offereh  i cant advise him to sell his property and his house and everything so for nothing  then you know we must sell it for him  will you give me till monday said thady till i ask some friend what i ought to do  some friendwhat friend do you want to be askingsome attorney dolan i suppose who of course would tell you not to part with the property that he might make a penny of it no master thady that wont do either yes or nono or yes i dont care which but an answer if you please as flannelly is determined he will do something  its no lawyer i want to spake to mr keegan ive had too much of lawyers but its my friend father john  what the priest thank ye for nothing ill have no dd priest meddling and to tell you the truth at once its either now or never and think where your father ll be if the house is sold over his head before he has a place to stretch himself in  oh you know and i know you cant sell it out of hand in that wayall at once  deed but we can though and by gd if you mean to be stiff about it you shall be out of the place before the may rents become due  would you want me to go and sell all thats left in the family without giving me a day to considerwithout asking my friends whats best to do for the old man and for poor feemy surely mr keegan  surely nonsense you see how it is i want to give flannelly an answer hes not asking anything of youhes offering a provision to you all which you might go far to look for if the law takes its courseas of course it will do if you oppose his offer but perhaps youre thinking we cant sell the estate and from the old mans state because hes not compos you can get ballycloran into your own hands if thats the game youre playing youll soon find yourself in the wrong box my lad  its not of myself im thinking and its only you and such as you would be saying so of me but supposing now the owld man consinted to this bargainhow would he be sure of his money  sure of his money why wouldnt it be settled on himwouldnt it be named as one of the conditions of the sale hed be a deal surer of that than he is now of his daily dinner for that i believe hes not very sure of as things are going at ballycloran  thady looked at the attorney as though he longed to answer him in the same strain but he said nothing of the sort he remained looking out of the window for a short time considering what he should do  well macdermot i cant be waiting here all day you know what do you say to it  ill spake to my father its he must decide you know at last and not me larry you heard what mr keegan said didnt you and he explained to his father the nature of the offer and tried to make him understand that at any rate ballycloran must go and that it would be better to go at once with some provision to look to than to stay there and be driven out without any and that mr flannelly would not be content any longer with getting the interest for his money but that he was determined to get the principal either by having the property sold or by taking possession of it himself it was long before he could make the old man precisely understand what it was that was required of him during which time keegan remained at the window as if he was not hearing a word that passed between the father and son  and does he want us to go clane out of it thady  root and branch father for iver and iver and therell be the finish of the macdermots of ballycloran but larryand he put his hand with more tenderness than seemed to belong to his rough nature on his fathers armbut larry you know youll never want for anything then youll be snug enough jist wherever you plaze and your money coming due and paid every weekyoud be better than in this wretched place eh larry  and whats to become of feemy  why we must get feemy a husband till then shell stay with you shell have a thrifle of money herself you know shell be poor enough though god knowsits the thought of her that throubles me most  and yourself thady where would you go till you got ballycloran again  got ballycloran again why larry youre to sell it outright clane away altogether as for me i must get a bit of land i suppose or list or do something go to america perhaps  and was it keegan wanted to buy ballycloran  oh its between them i suppose but what does it matterkeegan or flannelly  and what did you say thady  what did i say oh i could say nothing you know its for you to do it but larry i think its the best for you and you may be sure ill not be complaining afther or saying ill of you for what you did when you could do no other  and you didnt tell the blackguard ruffian robber to be gone out of that when he asked you to dhrive your own family out of your own house  whist father whist  when keegan heard old macdermot break out in this way he was obliged to turn round so he walked up to the fire and said mr macdermot may i ask who you are speaking of  larry was again commencing when thady held him down gently and said  its not so asy mr keegan for an old man to hear for the first time that hes to lave his house and his home for iver where he and his father and his grandfather have lived youd better let me talk to him a while  oh for the matter of that i dont care for his passion but if he means to come to reason let him do so at once for as i said before i wont wait here all day  nobody wants you to waitnobody wants you to wait said the father  whist larry whist be asy a while  i wont whist and i wont be asy so mr keegan if you want to have my answer take it and carry it down to that old bricklayer in carrick whose daughter has the divils bargain in you and for the like of that youre not bad matched tell him from me larry macdermottell him from me that im not so owld yet nor so poor nor so silly that he can swindle me out of my lands and house that way so clever as you think yourself mr keegan you may walk back to carrick again and dont think to call yourself masther of ballycloran yet awhile  very well mr macdermot very well my fine fellow look to yourself and mind i tell you ill have a cheaper bargain of the place by this day six months than i should have now by the terms im offering myself  you dirthy mane ruffianif it was only myself you was wanting to turn out of itbut to be robbing the boy there of his property that has been working his sowl out these six years for that dirthy owld bricklayerand you want the place all to yourself do you mr keegan faix and a fine estated gintleman youd make any how  well now youll repent the day you made yourself such a fool however good morning mr macdermotgood morning ill tell them down at carrick to keep a warm corner for you in the lane there where them old beggars sleep at night  kick him out thady kick him out will yehave ye none of the owld blood left round your heart that youll not kick him out of the house for a pettifogging schaming blackguard and larry got up as though he meant to have a kick at the attorney himself  be asy father and let him go of himself hell go fast enough now sit down awhile sit down till i come back and thady followed the attorney down the steps on to the gravel road  youll see my boy said keeganand now the benevolent attorney had altogether lost his smileyoull see my boy whether i wont make the two of you pay for this ay and the whole family too for a set of proud beggarly starvedout paupers by g ill sell every rotten stick of old furniture left in the house on the 6th of next month and the three of you shall be tramping in the roads before the winters over  youre worse than the old man with your passion mr keegan said thady ten times worse you know i did what i could to advise him and even now if youll lave him to me ill bring him round  be dd to you with your bringing round ill have no more to do with the pack of you  would you go to remember the passionate words of an owld man thats lost his senses mr keegan for shame on you if youll stick to the offer you made before ill bring the old man round yet  i tell you ill do no such thing master thady but root and branch ill have you out of that and that right soon a pack of beggars like you what right have you to be keeping a respectable man out of his money  respictable indeed very respictablelook at the house mr keegan for which you want to take the whole propertytumbling down already and you call that respictable and to be threatening to be dhriving an owld man past his senses out of his house for a few foolish words and a poor innocent defenceless girl too thady himself was beginning to get in a passion nowand since you will have it the owld man was not far wrong for it is robbers you are both of you and thats your respictability  robbers are we and what are you and your innocent sister you know thady she can go to ussher he says hell keep her she wont be a hucksters wife you say better that than a captains misthress as all agree she is now  as keegan said this he seemed to expect that he would be answered by some personal violence the two were together standing at the end of the avenue all but on the public road keegan had a stout walkingstick in his hand and he walked out into the road as he said the last words turning round as he did so so as to face thady  the young man stood still for a second or two as if the meaning of the words had hardly reached him and then rushed at the attorney with his clenched fist but the man of law was too quick for him for striking out with his stick he cried  by the lord of heaven if you come nearer ill brain you and as the young man endeavoured to get within the sweep of the stick he received a blow on the arm and elbow which for the moment disabled him and the pain was so sharp as to prevent him from any further immediate attack  mr keegan by the living lord this days work shall cost you dear and then indulging that ready profuseness of threats in which the less educated of his countrymen are so prone to indulge he returned within the gateway of the avenue and proceeded a short way towards the house here he reached a felled tree lying somewhat across the path on which he sat down for he felt that he could not go to the house before he had considered in his sad heart what he would say there and how he would say it  keegan when he found that his antagonist like a dog cowed by a blow was not inclined to come again to the fight turned on his heel and walked back to the place where he had left his horse  for some time thady did not recover from the immediate sharp pain arising from the blow and during these minutes firm determinations of signal vengeance filled his imagination damped by no thought of the punishment to which he might thereby be subjecting himself but the luxury of these resolvesfor they had a certain luxurywas soon banished by the thoughts that crowded on his mind when pain gave him liberty to think firstly his own impotence with regard to retaliating on keegan secondly the horrid charge brought against feemy and the conviction that the scurrility of it would not have occurred to keegan had it not previously been rumoured or suggested by others and the dreadful doubtfor it was dreadful to thadywhether there could be any grounds for it then the recollection of their defenceless statethe certainty that flannelly would take every legal step against them and that keegans threat that they should be turned out to wander through the roads would be realizedall these things forced themselves on his recollection and he could not go up to the house he could not meet his father and tell him that between them they had destroyed all hopes of conciliation that they must wander forth as beggars to starve he could not ask counsel from feemy his inability to protect her made him averse to see her  in his misery and half brokenhearted as he was he all but made up his mind to join the boys who he knew were meeting with some secret plans for proposed deliverance from their superiors better at any rate join them now thought he than be driven to do it when he was no better than themas would soon be the case and if he was to perish better first strike a blow at those who had pressed him so low and then it occurred to him that at any rate he would first go to his only good counsellor and he accordingly retraced his steps to the bottom of the avenue resolved if he could find him to tell all his new sorrow to father john     chapter xi  pat brady   when thady reached the end of the avenue where the fracas had taken place between himself and keegan he met pat brady  as i fear that this talented young man must by this time be subject to heavy suspicions that his faith and honesty must be greatly doubted and as even with those who may still look upon him as a trusty servant it would be impossible to keep up the delusion much longer i may as well now make his character no longer doubtful by explaining some passages which had occurred in his life during the last few months  in the first place however we must return for a short time to mr keegan  it will be remembered that this gentleman was the soninlaw of larry macdermots creditor mr flannelly and it had been arranged between the two worthy relations that if by some lawcraft or other means keegan could obtain possession of the estate of ballycloran in payment of the debt due by the proprietor it should become his keegans property  now this gentleman had long looked forward to the day when he should be able to describe himself as hyacinth keegan esq of ballycloranhaving been aware that after his fatherinlaws death all right in the property would become his own but since he had induced the old man to make a gift instead of a legacy of the debt his passion to become an estated gentleman had hourly increased an ambitious man in his own way was hyacinth keegan he had first longed to obtain admission into the more decent society of carrickonshannonthat he had some time since achieved he then sought to mix among the secondrate country gentlemen and by making himself useful to them by plausibility by some degree of talent and by great effrontery he had become sufficiently intimate with many of them to shake hands with them at racecourses and ordinaries and to talk of them to others as blake brown and jones to some few who now usually called him hyacinth and occasionally invited him to drinking parties at their houses he had lent small sums of money on good security and now he was looking to obtain the subshrievalty of the county and to be hyacinth keegan esq of ballycloran  since the immediate probability of realizing this brilliant vision had occurred to him he had left nothing undone which could as he thought lead to its completion from the constant business which he had with thady he pretty well knew all the difficulties of the macdermots and the great poverty of their house and he had observed how completely pat brady was in young macdermots confidence he also knew that if any direct legal steps were necessary in selling the estate under the mortgage or if any underhand scheming should be required to drive the macdermots into further difficulties pat brady could and probably wouldfor a considerationgive him his zealous cooperation there were also other reasons why he desired the assistance of our friend pat it was a part of mr keegans daily practice to obtain what information he could of the habits of those with whom he was likely to form any connection and it was generally believed through the county that he could usually tell those who were and who were not guilty of the common crimes of the timesillicit distillation and secret conspiracies among the poor to injure their superiors or to redress their fancied wrongs it was from his accurate information on these points that he was usually employed in their defence when they were brought to trial and that he had been able to detect and punish those by whom he had himself been attacked this moreover as his character became known had materially led to his own safety for the boys knew that he knew everything through the county and thus had learnt to become afraid of him  he felt therefore that as it was probable that ballycloran would become his own pat bradys assured services might be of great utility and he found but little difficulty in obtaining them pat was clever enough to foresee that the days of the macdermots were over and that it was necessary for him to ingratiate himself with the probable future masther and though he of course made sufficiently good market of his treachery he felt that in all ways he consulted his own interest best in making himself useful to keegan he had dim prospects too of great worldly advantages which might accrue from being chief informer to so conspicuous a man as mr keegan was likely to prove himself and with no false selfvanity he felt himself qualified for such a situation there was considerable danger in being always among people of a wild and savage nature to entrap and ensnare whom would be his duty and he felt that he had the requisite courage moreover there was a certain cunning and prudence necessary and in that also he with some truth fancied himself not deficient and as mr keegans scheme opened upon him the idea of entrapping his young master into the difficulties which lay around offered not a bad opportunity for the display of his talents  that such a man as brady is described to be should exist and find employment in a country is a fact which must shock and disgust but that it is a fact in great parts of ireland those who are most conversant with the country will not pretend to deny it is true that by paid spies and informers real criminals may not unfrequently be brought to justice but those who have observed the working of the system must admit that the treachery which it createsthe feeling of suspicion which it generatesbut above all the villanies to which it gives and has given rise in allowing informers by the prospect of bloodmoney to give false informations and to entrap the unwary into crimesare by no means atoned for by the occasional detection and punishment of a criminal  let the police use such open means as they haveand god knows in ireland they should be effective enough but i cannot but think the system of secret informersto which those in positions of inferior authority too often have recoursehas greatly increased crime in many districts of ireland i by no means intend to assert that this system is patronised or even recognised by government i believe the contrary most fully but those to whom the execution of the criminal laws in detail are committed and who look to obtain advancement and character by their activity do very frequently employ what i must call a most iniquitous system of espionage  a very few years since i was walking down the street of a small town with a gentleman who was at that time in the immediate employment of the government it was a fair day and we were strolling through the crowd which was moving slowly hither and thither as though in absolute idleness the dusk was fast commencing and he pointed out to me two or three men who had come in from the country like the others telling me that they were waiting till it was dark to speak to him that they did not dare to speak to him during the light that they were in his pay and that they had information to give him respecting illegal societies and hidden arms he ridiculed me when i questioned the propriety of his system in fact he was so accustomed to it that he could not conceive the possibility of going on without it in the same way i have had men pointed out to me by the officer leading a party of revenue police in quest of illicit stills who were dressed as policemen though not belonging to the force and who were brought in that disguise that they might not be known by their neighbours whose haunts they were going to disclose  the momentary success no doubt reconciles this usage to the officer employing it but the result must be to create suspicion of each other among the poor and fearfully to increase instead of diminishing crime  now that our friend bradys character is perfectly understood we will return to our story first however explaining that he had witnessed the scene between the attorney and his master and had determined to make the most of it  thady had turned on the road towards the priests house without taking any notice of his dependant but this pat could not allow  well mr thady youll live to be even with him yetthe born ruffian faix and a good sight more nor even else itll be no ones fault but yer own  even with who  with who now why didnt i see it with my own eyesthe born thief of the world didnt he knock flashes out of yer shoulther with the shilaleh he hadmr keegan i main and if it wornt that you hadntbad cess to the luck of ityour own bit of a stick in your hand wouldnt you have knocked the life out of him for the name he put on your sisther miss feemythe blackguard  and did you hear him pat  shure i did yer honer  and did you see him  see him yes shure i seed him riz his big stick and i thought it was nigh kilt you were  and you heard him call your misthress the name he called and you saw him sthrike at me the way he did and i having nothing but my fist to help me and were you so afraid of a man like keegan you wouldnt step forward to strike a blow for me  afraid of keegan no masther thady i arnt afraid of him but you wouldnt have had me come up jist to witness that you war the first to strike at him  nonsense wasnt he the first to call my sisther the name he did  ah but that warnt a braich of the pace you see mr thady thim divils of lawyers is so cute and av i had come to help you or sthrike a blow or riz my stick hed have had both before old jonas brown tomorrow morning and whered weve been then but mr thady as i said before youll be more nor even with mr keegan yet any way  howll i be even with him pat  but where are you going mr thady shure ant it your dinner time at the house and remimber youve to be at the wedding tonight  oh dn the wedding do you think id be playing the fool at weddings tonight afther what just took place i want to see father john and ill go and catch him before he goes down to your sisther  what mr thady to tell about the blow and the dishonour the ruffian put on you and miss feemyshurely you wouldnt be doing that  and why notwont all carrick have it before long  thats no rule why you should be going and telling father john about it yourself and wont he be putting you against revenging yourself and you wouldnt mr thady with the owld blood in your veins and in miss feemysmay the divils curse blacken him for the name he give heryou wouldnt be putting up quiet and aisy with what hes doneand the like of him too  by this time thady had stopped and was beginning to waver in his determination of going to the priest he felt that what brady said was truethat the priest would implore him not to avenge himself in the manner in which his heart strongly prompted him to do he felt he could not forego the impulse to inflict personal punishment on keegan and after all what could father john do for him  besides mr thady now i think of it father john ant in it at all for he was to be at drumsna before the wedding and i know hes to dine with mrs mckeon he does mostly when hes in drumsna this time of day so im sure he arnt in it  satisfied by this thady allowed himself to be led back again and they walked together in silence a little way  youve only to say the word continued pat in a low voice youve only to say the word to them boys as ll be there tonight and theyll see you righted with keegan  what boysand how righted  how righted why how should you be righted afther what hes afther doingand i tell you thems the boys as will not see your fathers son put upon that way  which them dye main pat  oh theres a lot of them up to anything theres jack byrne and joe reynolds is mad to be having a fling at ussher you know their brothers is in gaol about the malt they found away at loch sheen and theres corney dolan and mckeon and a lot more of them i knows them all and itll be jist as good to them to be making a job of keegan as the other  i wouldnt have the ruffian murthered pat you dont think i want to have him murthered  whist mr thady may be the children about in the trees there would hear you who says anything of murdher no but just give him a bating that would go nigh taching him the taste of being murdheredand the same for master ussher for i tell yemay the tongue of the cowardly ruffian be blisthered for putting the name he did on your sistherbut he was only repating what ussher has said hisself and that more nor once nor twice  thady made no reply but walked on slowly he gave no assent but he showed no indignation at the kind of revenge which was proposed to him  and what was he saying about the estatekeegan i main mr thadybefore you came to be quarrelling that way  he was saying what ll be thrue enoughthat ballycloran ll be sold right away before next may and that he himself will be the purchaserand that well be wandering the road like any other set of beggars  and did he say hed buy ballycloran  he did  and turn you all out mr thady  and he ll do it too said thady  tunder and ages man and would you be letting him come over ye that way if any blackguard of a lawyer could be selling an estate that way because money may be a little scarce or so would there be so many gintlemen in the counthry enjoying themselves in their own houses just keeping the right side of the door only take care the owld man dont be showing hisself that way he does be doing on the big steps there and take care the door is kept shut instead of right open and make biddy understand she ant to open it for any one at all at allexcept yerself jist and father john or the like who wouldnt mind going round to the back door i tell ye that all the flannellys and keegans in ireland cant sell ballycloran unless they first get hould of the owld man  but cant they put resavers on every acre of the land and wouldnt that be all one as selling it  oh let the boys alone for that stick to them and theyll not let a resaver do much among them faix im thinking i for one wouldnt like to go resaving rents up to drumleesh for any one but the masther hisself but any way youll be coming down to the boys and spaking to them yerself this nightyou wouldnt go mr thady not to be at marys wedding  you know that ruffian ussher ll be there and i dont want to be meeting him  but thats jist it dont let him be there playing what tricks he plazes with miss feemy and you not there to purtect herand theres all them boys expect you you wont let keegan run off with land and house and all without a blow sthrick  theyll all be up at ballycloran tomorrow and ill hear what they have to say then  but i tell you they wont be there at all tomorrow unless you come down to them tonight answered pat  do they main to say they refuse out and out to pay the rint  not at all but theyll be getting stiff if they think youre so thick with him as is their inimyand isnt that natural too its only to come down and say a kind word or so to em yourself and youll find them all rightand ready to stand by you and yours to the last mr thady  well pat ill be down there father john would think it odd if i werent there  by this time they had got round to the back of the house where the outhouse stood and the young man told brady to go into the kitchen and get him a coal for his pipe and to tell the girl to say he wouldnt be in to dinner  and wont you be wanting your dinner mr thady  no pat ill jist sit and have a smoke in the stable till its time to go down to you i couldnt face the owld man and feemy afther what jist happened  so we will for the present leave him smoking in the stable and return to the inmates of the house  it will be remembered that when father john left feemy after his morning visit she remained alone till mr keegan came and that she was dismissed from the diningroom when they began to talk on business she then betook herself to dress for the evening amusement that is to make herself something decent before she met ussher to brush her hair and to dismiss all the traces of that disenchanting dishabille which i have attempted to describe whilst at her toilet feemy turned over in her mind all that her brother and father john had said and firmly resolved not to let the evening pass without telling her lover the comfort it would be to have some decided steps taken as to their engagement and yet she almost shuddered at the thoughts of doing so there was a frown which occasionally came over usshers face which made her dread him and she couldnt but feel that if he wished to take any such steps he would do so without her asking him in fact that it would be much better that he should do so unasked and then if he got angryif he should tell her that as she could not wait and trust him they must part how could she bear the idea of losing him what could she say or do if he answered her sternlyif he scolded her or perhaps worse absolutely quarrelled with her poor feemy began to wish the evening over to which she had looked forward as the source of so much pleasure she feared to neglect the warnings she had received and she felt that things could not go on always as they were but she trembled at the idea of telling this to ussher  her silent dinner was soon over she made her fathers punch and sat down to wait for her lover larry kept up a continual growl about thadys absence suggesting that keegan had cozened him off to carrick to sign the estate away accusing him of conspiracy with the attorney to rob him his father wondering why he wouldnt come to dinner c to all which feemy made no reply she never noticed his grumblings she sat absorbed in her own thoughts meditating what she would say to ussher till she heard his horses feet at the head of the avenue and then she jumped up to meet him at the halldoor  how are you myles and well feemy hows yourself and then having reached the hall door he took the fond girl in his arms and kissed her ah dont then myles theres katty on the stairs come in then and take your punch and they entered the room where larry was sitting over the fire  how are you this evening sir said ussher this fine night  the old man always brightened up a little when ussher came in  how dye do captainim glad to see you did the captain get his dinner then feemyyou dont ask captain ussher whether he got his dinner  feemy knows she neednt ask about that thats one of the things i always take care of but wheres thady mr macdermot i wanted to speak to him about keegan that sworn friend of his and ussher began to make himself comfortable with the hot water sugar c  thady is it youre axing afther deed then i dont know where he is and as for keeganbut you dont make your punch captainas for keegan the ruffian he was here this blessed morningwanting me and feemy and thady too to walk clane out of the place but i walked him off the like of him to be buying ballycloran and his father a processserver and his wifes father that dd bricklayer flannelly  holloa mr macdermot so youve had a breeze with the attorney have you and was thady here at the time  he was in it all the time and divil a word hed say for himself or feemy or his father or the owld place either but just wanted me captain to give it all up to them at once the ruffians and when i wouldnt he went off with keegan to carrick theres my own son joined with em agin me and hell help to dhrive me out he willand feemy too poor girl  in vain ussher endeavoured to make him believe that his son had not conspired against him to deprive him of his property the old man had taken it into his head that thady had gone off to carrick with keegan and was determined to make the most of this new grievance and would not be comforted he seemed cunning enough in his determination to thwart the attorney in his plan of buying the estate and explained to ussher that he had made up his mind not to be taken personally assuring him that from that time nothing should induce him to leave his own fireside or so much as show himself at the halldoor that he would have the halldoor barricadoed and in short that he would himself take all those precautions which brady had enumerated to his son as proper to be put in practice on such an occasion and from that time with one sad exception it was many months before larry macdermot was seen to cross his threshold he strictly adhered to his resolution and although during that time many attempts to arrest him were made he eluded them all he could not however be brought to understand that for the present this was uselessthat no one could arrest him till after christmas the dread of losing his property had come upon him and he would not allow himself even to be seen by any one but those of his own household and by ussher  after listening to his grievances as long as he thought necessary ussher followed feemy into her own room and here we will leave them till we meet them again at denis mcgoverys wedding merely remarking that poor feemy though more than once she prepared to make her dreaded speech to her lover each time hesitated and stopped and at last made up her mind that it would be just as well to put off the evil hour till her pleasure was over and finally determined to have the conversation on the return home for she well knew that ussher would walk back with her to ballycloran where his horse would be left     chapter xii  the wedding   when ussher first came into the parlour at ballycloran he asked after thady and it will be necessary to explain why he did so the terms on which the two men stood towards each other not being such as to render it probable that either should be very anxious for the presence of the other  it had come to the knowledge of denis mcgovery that brady had asked to the wedding a lot of men from drumleesh and some also from mohillcharacters with whom denis was not apt to consort himself and whom he looked on as paupers and rapparees he had also made out it is presumed with the aid of his affianced that some other motive was probably ensuring their attendance than merely that of doing honour to his deniss nuptials pat brady was not likely to have made a confidant of his sister or of denis on the occasion but nevertheless the bridegroom had discovered that the meeting was to some extent to be a political one and moreover that thady macdermot was expected to be there  now mcgovery although it must be presumed that in common with all irishmen of the lower order he conceived that he was to a certain degree injured and oppressed by the operation of the existing laws nevertheless had always thought it the wiser course to be with the laws bad as they might be than against them when therefore he learnt that the brothers of the men whom ussher had put into prison were to be of the party and that many of their more immediate neighbours would be there and remembered also that captain ussher himself had promised to come to the divarsion mighty fears suggested themselves to him and he began to dread that the occasion would be taken for offering some personal injury to the latter in which case might not all be implicatedand among the number that dear person for whom denis felt the tenderest regardviz himself  actuated by these apprehensions denis on the morning of the wedding had gone to ussher to unfold his budget of dreadful newsto assure the captain that his only object was to get himself married and to see that the pigs and the thrifle of change were all rightand strongly to advise the captain to stay away not that it wouldnt be a great honer for a poor boy like him to see his honer down there for he had the greatest rispect in life for him and all that wore the kings sword but there war no knowing what them boys might be afther when they got the dhrink in them  ussher thanked denis for his communication but at the same time begged him not to disquiet himselftold him that there was no danger in life and declared that he felt so confident of the good feeling of the men through the country towards him particularly those at drumleesh and mohill that he should always feel perfectly safe in their companyin fact that he looked on their presence as a protection poor denis stared hard at him but as he soon perceived that the captain was laughing at him for his solicitude he retreated with a grin on his face remarking that he had meant all for the best  though captain ussher affected to set no value on mcgoverys tale he nevertheless thought that there might be something in it he determined however not to be deterred from going to the wedding though in many respects a bad man ussher was very vigilant in the performance of his official duties and as has been before said was possessed of sufficient courage it had been part of mcgoverys disclosure that thady macdermot was to be at the wedding and it occurred to ussher that at any rate no personal violence would be offered as long as young macdermot was with him he therefore determined to see him first and tell him what he had heard it is true he had no great love for the poor fellow still he would have been sorry to see him from any cause of uneasiness or distress throw himself into the hands of men who might probably induce him to join in acts which would render him subject to the severest penalties of the law ussher understood thadys character tolerably well and though he had no real sympathy for his sufferings still he had manly feeling enough to wish to save him as feemys brother from the danger into which he believed him so likely to fall  it was for the purpose of talking on this subject that he asked for thady but when he found he was not in the house nor expected home to dinner he was obliged to postpone what he had to say till he met him at mary bradys wedding  about seven oclock feemy and her lover arrived at mrs mehans little whiskey shop where the marriage was to take place the whole party were already there father john was standing with his back to a huge turf fire in the outer roomthe usual drinking room of the establishmentamusing the bystanders with jokes apparently at the expense of the bridegroom mary brady was dressed in a white muslin gown which though it was quite clean seemed to have been neither mangled nor ironed so multitudinous had been the efforts to make it fit her ungainly person she had a large white cap on her head extending widely over her ears and her hair parted on her left brow was smeared flat over her forehead with oil her arms were bare and quite red and her hands were thrust into huge white cotton gloves which seemed to make them so ashamed of themselves as utterly to unfit them for their ordinary uses everyone that entered said well mary or well alanna hows yourself or some greeting of the kind to which she answered only with a grin she and her future husband seemed totally unacquainted with each other for since he came in he hadnt spoken to her in fact poor mary as she expressed herself to feemy couldnt get her sperrits up at all and felt quite cowed like  biddy from ballycloran was her bridesmaid and she though she did not emulate the bride in her white dress had also thrust her head into a huge cap which if it did not much add to her beauty at any rate made her sufficiently remarkable to show that she was one of the principal characters of the evening  denis had procured himself a secondhand light brown coat with metal buttons this was the only attempt at wedding finery which he had made but even this seemed to make him somewhat beside himself and gave him a strong resemblance to that wellknown martyr to unaccustomed grandeura hog in armour pat seemed to scorn the party altogether though he was to officiate in giving away the bride he was talking apart to reynolds and one or two others and seeing to the proper arrangement and distribution of the good things which were to follow the wedding thady was not in the place he had not yet arrived  ah feemy began father john as she walked in followed by ussher how are you and this is kind of you captain  long life to you miss feemy and you too captain dear said mary at last excited to speak by the greatness of the occasion  your honers are welcome miss your honers are welcome captain ussher said denis forgetting that for the present he was only a guest himself and then brady and then shamuth na pibua the blind piper from county mayo who had made the music out of his own head all about oconnelland then biddy and mrs mehan and all the boys and girls one after another got up and ducked their heads down in token of kindly welcome to the young misthress and her lover and though most of those present at other times would have said that it was a pity their own miss feemy should be marrying a born inimey of the counthry like a revenue officer and a black prothestant too it wasnt now when she had come to honour the wedding of one of themselves that they would be remembering anything against her or her lover  well mary so the times nearly come said feemy as she sat down on the bench by the fire that mary regardless of all bridal propriety wiped down for her with the tail of her white dress saying as she did so what harum sure wont the dust make it worse when the dancing comes on and  whisper mary  what is it miss  whisper then  ah now youll be at me like the rest of em and she put her big face down over feemys are the sheets done mary  ah now miss youre worse than em all and mary put her big hand with the big cotton glove with the fingers widely extended before her face to hide the virgin blush  whats that feemy said father john whats that i heard  go asy now father john do and mary gave the priest a playful push which nearly put him into the fire for gods sake miss dont be telling him now you wont darlint  what was it feemy alls fair now you know  only just something mary was to get ready for her husband then father johnnothing particular youll never be married yourself you know so you neednt ask  oh part of the fortune was it trust denis hell look to that is it the pigs eh denis  no father john it jist ant the pigs said mary  come what is itout with it denis  sorrow a one of me knows what youre talking about said denis  it ant the calf at last denis is it  bad luck to it for a calf exclaimed mcgovery and then sidling up to the priest you wouldnt be setting all the boys laughing at me father john and thim sthrangers too  well well denis but why didnt you tell me the whole  when ussher had first entered brady had come up expressly to welcome him and there was something in his extreme servility which made ussher fear all was not quite right but ussher had become habituated to treat the servility of the poor as the only means they had of deprecating the injuries so frequently in his power to inflict he had too from his necessity of not attending to their supplications acquired a habit of treating them with constant derision which they well understood and appreciated and the contempt which he always showed for them was one of the reasons why he was so particularly hated through the country though now a guest of bradys he could not help showing the same feeling moreover ussher who as far as the conduct of man to man is concerned had nothing of treachery about him strongly suspected pats true character and was therefore less likely to treat him with respect  thank you brady ill do very well dont you expect mr thady here  is it the young masthur captain in course we do mary wouldnt be married av he warnt to the fore  indeed i didnt know youd so much respect for mr macdermot as that  is it for the masthur captain  for the matter of that brady you wouldnt much mind how many masters you had if they all paid you im thinking  and thats thrue for you captain said pat grinning in his perplexity for he didnt know whether to take what ussher said for a joke or not  keegan now wouldnt be a bad master said ussher  and what puts him in your head captain ussher  only they say he pays well to a sharp fellow like you  deed i dont know who he pays they do be saying you pay a few of the boys too an odd time or two yourself  is it i what should i be paying them for  jist for a sight of a whiskey still or a little white smoke in the mountains on a fine night or so they say that same would be worth a brace of guineas to a boy i could name  youre very sharp mr brady but should i want such assistance i dont know any id sooner ask than yourself  dont go for to throuble yourself for i dont want to be holed of a night yet and thats whatll happen them thats at that work im thinking and that afore longnot that im blaming you for in course every one knows its only your dooty  youre very kind but when will mr thady be here  deed i wonder he ant here captain but war you wanting him  not in particular is it true the brothers of those poor fellows i took up at loch sheen are here tonight  they is both of em theres joe reynolds sitting behind therein the corner where i was when you and miss feemy come in  its lucky he wasnt with his brother thats all and hed better look sharp himself or hell go next  oh hes a poor harmless boy captain he never does nothing that way though in course i knows nothing of what they do be doing how should i  how should you indeed though you seem to be ready enough to answer for your friend reynolds however i dont want to be taking any more of the boys at drumleesh so if he is a friend of yours youd better warn him thats all and he walked away  and its warning you want yourself captain dear said pat to himself how clever you think yourself with your mr keegan and your spies and your fine lady miss there but if you ant quiet enough before christmas its odd thats all  they were called into the inner room now as father john was going to perform the ceremony and such marshalling and arranging as he hadtrying to put people into their proper places who would be somewhere elseshoving down the forms out of the waymoving the tablesremoving the dishes and plates for the supper was to be eaten off the table at which the couple were to be married and though all the company had probably been at weddings before and that often they seemed new to the proceedings  denis you born fool will you come here where i told you and dont keep the mutton spoiling all night and he shoved mcgovery round the table  mary brady if you wish to change the ugly name thats on you this night will you come here and he seized hold of the young womans arm and dragged her round and whos wanting you biddy as the girl followed close behind her principal  shure father john ant i to be bridesmaid then  you bridesmaid and miss feemy to the fore stay where you are come feemy  oh father john i ant bridesmaid  oh but you will be and as thady ant here captain ussher ll be best man come round captainand ussher came round and mind captain he added whispering when i come to salute nostrâthose are the last wordsyoure to kiss the bride you are to kiss her first and then youll be married yourself before the years out  but i am not all ambitious that way  never mind do as i tell you and dont forget to have a halfcrown in your hand or so when i bring the plate round come pat where are you youve to give her away  shell jist give herself away then father john by dad shes ready and willing enough  do as i tell you and dont stand bothering you want to keep those shiners in your pocketi know you and brady shamed into compliance also went into his place  now denis the other side of her boy why youre as awkward to marry as shoeing a colt  why then father john thats thrue for i shod many a colt and never was married  youll not be so long avick and may be youll know more about it this time next week but heres the plate what do you mean to give the bride you must put something handsome here for mary  faix then i forgot about that and he put his hand into his pocket and forked out halfacrown which with a sheepish look he put in the plate  halfacrown indeed for a tradesman like you theres corney dolan there who dont seem to have a coat that fits him too well would do more for his wife if it was gods pleasure he was to have one this night  well there and denis put down another halfcrown this money which is always put down just before the marriage is a bridal present to the bride and becomes her exclusive property  well mary you must be getting the rest of it from him another time  let her alone for that yer riverence said corney dolanwho considered that father johns allusion to his coat privileged him to put in his jokelet her alone for that she knows how to be getting the halfpence and to hoult them too  its a great deal youre knowing about it im thinking mr dolan retorted denis its a pity you couldnt keep the hoult of any yerself  wisht boys how am i to marry you at all if you go on this way come mary off with that glove of yours now for the ring denis and mary hauled away at the glove which the heat of her hand prevented her from pulling off  drat it for a glove then  ah alanna gloves come so nathural to your purty hand they dont like to lave it at all  at last however mary got her hands ready for action the ring was in the plate with the two halfcrowns father john was standing between the two matrimonial aspirants ussher and feemy were close behind mary and brady was sitting down on the right hand of denis and the priest opened his book and began  the marriage ceremony took about five minutes but during this time father john found occasion to whisper ussher to come up close to the bride and then after hurrying over a great part of the service almost under his breath he pronounced the final wordssalute nostrâin a loud voice adding at the same time to ussher now my boy  ussher in obedience to the priests injunction seized hold of the bride at one side to kiss her while mcgovery determined to vindicate his own right pounced on her on the other justly thinking that the first kiss she should have after her wedding ought to be given to her by her lawful married husband  but alas both aspirants were foiled and mary got no kiss at all she in her dismay at the energy of the two aspirants ducked her head down nearly to the level of the table and denis in his zeal and his hurry struck ussher in the face with his own forehead with no slight force the captain retreated halfstunned and not very well pleased with the salute he had received and denis was so shocked at what he had done that he forgot his wifeand apparently even the pigs and the moneyin his regrets and apologies  egad captain said father john thats more of a kiss than i meant to get you why youre as awkward mcgovery as a bullcalf whod have thought to see you butting at the captain like an old goat on his hind legs  faix then yer riverence i didnt intend to be trating the captain in that way but any way the captains head is amost as hard as my own for the flashes isnt out of my eyes yet  never mind said ussher and if you always take care of your wife the same way my good fellow youll be sure shell not come to any harm for want of looking after  in the meantime mary had escaped from the salute intended for her and was with the aid of biddy mrs mehan and sundry others of her visitors engaged in extricating two legs of mutton a ham and large quantities of green cabbages from the pots in which they had been boiling in the outer room  god bless you sally dear and will you drain them pratees theyll be biled to starch and mrs mehan darling my hearts broke with the big pot here will you lend me a hand good luck to you then theres denis and pat bad manners to them theyd see me kilt with all the bother and stand there doing nothing under the sun  and poor mary mcgovery as we must now call her toiled and groaned under the labours of her wedding day till the perspiration ran from under her wedding cap and her weddingdress gave manifold signs of her zeal in preparing the weddingsupper  whilst mary was dishing the mutton c father john was employed in the not less important business of collecting his dues  between mcgovery and pat brady he had succeeded in getting two thirtyshilling notes which lay in the bottom of the plate and formed a respectable base for the little heap of silver which he would collect and if he did not get as much as the occasion would seem to warrant the deficiency arose from no delicacy in asking or want of perseverance in urging  now captain youre the only protestant among us show these catholics of mine a liberal exampleshow them what they ought to do for their priesthere captain ussher put a couple of halfcrowns in the plate there boys see what a protestant does for me well feemy i never ask the ladies you know but i shant let thady off though he aint here i shall settle that in the rent  oh yes father john make thady pay for himself and me mrs brennan has got all my money  but wheres thady feemy dear i hope you and he are good friends now  oh yes father john that is i didnt see him since morning  but will he be here tonight  he said he would but youd best ask pat he knows most about him  this conversation took place in an under tone and the priest walked on with his plate  come mr tierney hows yourself i see youre waiting there quite impatient with your hands in your pocket its nothing less than a crown piece ill go bail  deed then crown pieces ant that plenty in the counthry these days father john the likes of themand he put halfacrown in the plateare scarce enough  the speaker was an old man rather decently dressed in kneebreeches and gaiters he was one of those who even in bad times manage by thrift and industry to get among the poor the reputation of comparative wealth  and thats true for you mr tierney and thank you kindly they do however say that however scarce they are in the country youve your share of them  go on father john go on you do be saying more than you know  and by degrees the priest went through them all from most of them he got something from some a shilling from some only sixpence some few gave nothing at all these in general endeavoured to escape observation behind the backs of the donors but father john let none of them off and those who were unprepared and who alleged their poverty and their inability he reproved for their idleness and hinted rather strongly that their visits to mrs mulreadys or similar establishments were the cause of their not being able to do what he called their duty by their priest  standing in a corner at the further end of the room and resting against a wall was joe reynolds as father john had a bad opinion of this man and as he was not a parishioner of his he was returning without speaking to him when joe said  youre in the right of it father john not to be axing such a poor divil as me you know betwixt them all theyve not left me the sign of a copper harp  i know reynolds youre too fond of mrs mulreadys to have much for your own priest let alone another  faix then father john you shouldnt spake agin mother mulready for shes something like your riverence and a poor boy with an empty pocket will get neither comfort nor good words from either of ye  father john did not think it to be consistent with his dignity to answer this sally so he returned to the other end of the room carefully counting as he went and pocketing the money which he had collected in the meantime the bride with such assistance as she could get had succeeded in putting the supper on the table a leg of mutton at the top reclining on a vast bed of cabbage a similar dish at the bottom and a ham with the same garniture in the middle the rest of the table was elegantly sprinkled with plates of smoking potatoes and what knives and forks and spoons and plates could be spared from the head of the table where a few were laid out with some little order for the more aristocratic of the guests were collected together in a heap at first no one seemed inclined to sit down every one was struck with a sudden bashfulness till father john taking up the knife and fork at the top of the table called mcgovery to bring his wife to supper  now denis my man dont be thinking of those two pigs but bring your better half with you and lets see how you can behave as a married man  come miss feemy said mary if you and the captain now would jist sit down and begintheres a dear miss do  oh mary nobody must sit down before you tonight  never mind me missif i could only get you and the captain seated yer honer and she turned round with a curtsey to ussher theres denis and pat there will do nothing in life to help me and the poor woman seemed at her wits end to know how to arrange her guests  at last however ussher and feemy sat down at one side of the priest denis and his wife at the other and by degrees the table got quite full so much so that when the boys saw one another taking their seats they were as eager as before they had been slow and they hustled each other at the bottom of the table till they were so crowded that they hadnt room to use their arms pat sat at the bottom and he and the priest emulated each other in the zeal and celerity with which they cut up and distributed the joints before them  at pats end of the table plates were scarce and the boys round him took the huge lumps of bloodred mutton in their fists and seemed perfectly independent of such conventional wants as knives and forks in the ease and enjoyment with which they dispatched their repast at last brady had done all to the joint that carving could do and having kept a tolerably sufficient lions share for himself he passed the bone down the table which was speedily divided into as many portions as nature had intended that it should be  matters were conducted in a rather more decorous manner among the aristocrats at father johns end of the tablethough even here they were carried on in a somewhat rapid and voracious fashion the priest helped feemy and ussher mary and her husband and then remarking that he had done all the hard work of the evening and that he thought it was time to get a bit himself he filled a moderate plate for his own consumption and passed the joint down to be treated after the same manner as its fellow  as long as the eating continued there was not much said but when the viands had disappeared and the various bottles came into requisition the clatter of tongues became loud and joyous and though the first part of the entertainment had to all appearance come to a rather too speedy termination for want of material to carry it on there seemed from the quantity of whiskey produced little chance of any similar disappointment in what the greater portion of the guests considered the more agreeable part of the entertainment  well denis said father john i believe ive done all i can this time and as i know youll want to be looking after the cow thats in calfno not the cow but the pigsill be off  folly on father john folly on its always the way with yer riverenceto be making yer game of a poor boy like me but youre not going out of this till youve dhrunk marys health here and heard a tune on the pipes any way  not a drop denis thank ye and father john got up and now boys and girls good night and god bless youand behave yourselves  faix then yer riverence said joe reynolds from the bottom of the table you may tell by the way the boys take to the bottle that theyll behave themselves dacently and discreatly like christians  indeed then reynolds where you are and the whiskey with you i believe theres likely to be little discretion but the discretion of drunkennessand not much of that  thank ye father john and its you have always the kind word for me  but father john began mary youre not really going to go without so much as a tumbler of punch  not a drop mary my dear i took my punch after dinnerand i cant stand too much good night feemyyoull stay and have a dance i suppose good night captain ussher  and father john got up from table and went out of the room as soon however as denis saw that he was really going he rose and followed him out of the door  sit down denis sit downdont be laving your company such a night as this  but i want to have jist a word with yer riverence  well what is it  jist step outside then father john  well denis is it anything about betsy cane or has ginty come home and is he wanting the pigs  no but would you just step outside here mr mcgrath where those longeared ruffians wont be hearing me and he and the priest walked a little distance from the door of mrs mehans house  im afeard father john them born divils from drumleesh and mohill as pat brought here tonight are maning more than good to captain ussher  and what makes you think that denis  why father john mary was saying that pat towld her a lot of his own frinds would be up with him and that if they war talking together she and those as are with her dancing and the like warnt to be disturbing them and then i knows them boys is very mad with the captain about that whiskey business up at loch sheen and then joe reynolds and jack byrne are in it and their brothers are two of them as war sazed and are now in ballinamore bridewelland i know there is something of the sort going on through the counthry and faix father john i wouldnt for money that anything happened and i in it the while for a poor boy is always made to be mixed up in them affairs if by bad luck he is anywhere near at the time  but what do you think theyd do to the captain tonight denis  faix then yer riverence i dont know what theyd be doingmurther him maybe  god forbid but denis those men from drumleesh could hardly know captain ussher was going to be at the wedding tonight  oh yer riverence theyd know it well enough from pat brady  but you dont think your wifes brother would join a party to murder ussher  why then father johni think its just he that would be putting the others up to it  good gracious denis and what would he get by such deeds as that isnt he comfortable enough  it isnt them as is poorest is always the worst but any how father john if youd come back and yer riverence wouldnt mind for the onst jist sitting it outjist dhrinking a dhrop at an odd time or colloguing a bit with owld mr tierney till we get the captain out of that shure theyd never be doing anything out of the way as long as yer riverence is in it  it isnt herein the house where there are so many togethertheyd attack him even if they meant to do so and i dont think they mean it tonight but its on his way homeand my going back would not in any way prevent that but why dont you at once tell captain ussher and warn him that you fear he is not safe among those fellows at night  thats jist what i did then but hes so foolish and so bowld theres no making him mind what one would say i did tell him father john that i was afeared that there would be some lads in it wouldnt be his wellwishers but he laughed at me and towld me there were none of the boys through the counthry war so fond of him as those reynoldses and byrnes and all them others down at drumleesh  well denis and what can i do more if he laughs at you why wouldnt he also laugh at me  why yer riverence you and he are frinds like besides he wouldnt trate the like of you as he would such a one as i why i believe he dont think the poor are christians at all  its true enough for some of them but what would you have me do i couldnt walk back to mohill by his horses sideand i tell you if they attack him at all it will not be at the house there but on his way home  deed then father john any way i wish he was well out of that  it seems denis its yourself youre thinking of more than the captain  shure and why wouldnt iand i just married a purty thing for me just now to be took up among a lot of blackguard ruffians for murthering a kings officer  well denis i wont go back nowit would look odd and do no good so do you go back and drink a tumbler of punch with the men and dance a turn or two with the girls as you should on your wedding night and by and by ill come down again as if to see what was going onand to walk home with miss feemy the captain must go back to ballycloran for his horse and if he can be persuaded that there is any danger he can go up and sleep at the cottage for i tell you if they mean to hurt him at all its on the road home to mohill theyd make the attempt do you go in and say nothing about it and ill be down by and by  father john walked away towards his house and denis mcgovery went back with a heavy heart to dance at his own wedding for though his solicitude for the kings officer would not have been of the most intense kind had he thought that he was to be murdered anywhere else he had a great horror at the idea of any evil happening to that important personage when it could in any way affect his own comfort  when denis returned into mrs mehans big kitchen the amusements of the eveningdancing and drinkingwere on the point of commencing shamuth of the pipes the celebrated composer and musician was sitting in the corner of the huge fireplace with a tumbler of punch within reach of his hand preparing his instrumentsqueaking and puffing and blowing in the most approved preparatory style mary was working and toiling again for the benefit of her guestscarrying kettles of boiling water into the inner roomemptying pounds of brown sugar into slopbasins and mugstelling the boys to take their punchtaking a drop herself now and again with some one who was wishing her health and happiness and comfort with the man shed gotinciting the girls to go and danceand scolding her brother and husband because bad manners to them divil a hand theyd lend to help her and she with so much to do and so many to mind  and now miss feemy if youd only get up and begin dear the others would soon folly come captain ussherwould yer honer jist stand up with miss feemy  oh no maryyoure the bride you know captain ussher must dance with you first  oh laws miss but thatd be too much honour intirely  no mrs mcgovery but its i thatll be honoured so if you will be good enough to stand up with me i shall be glad to shake a foot with you and the gallant captain led mary into the middle of the floor  but captain dear sorrow a sup of dhrink did i see you take this blessed evening shure then youll let me get you a glass of wine before we all begin jist to prevent your being smothered with the dust like shure yer honour hasnt taken a dhrop yet  i wont be so long mary but i wont have the wine yet ill wash the dust out with a tumbler of

now beginning to regain the serene looks which had been dispelled by father johns not permitting her to act as bridesmaid  and now shamuthhis preparatory puffs having been accomplishedstruck up paddy carey with full force and energy as this was the first dance no one stood up but the two couple above named there were therefore the more left to admire the performance and better room left for the performers to show their activity  faix then mary said one its yerself that dances illigantthe lord be praisedonly look to her feet  well deardenis shure no one thought you were that good at a jig give him a turn biddydont spare himhes able for you and more  ah but see the captain kathleen its he that could give the time to the music ant he and mary well metyou must put more wind into the pipes

me  axes you ah theres little doubt of that its he thats ready and willing to ax you now and always  ah mr mcgovery shure man youre not bait yet you wouldnt give in to biddy that soon  poor denis was giving signs of having had enough of the amusement there was a tolerably large fire on the hearth near which he had been destined to perform his gyrationswhich if not very graceful had at any rate been sufficiently active and the exertion heat and dust were showing plainly on his shining countenance  ah mr mcgovery panted biddy shure youre not down yet and i only jist begun  indeed then biddy i am and quite enough ive had too for one while here corney come and take my place and denis deposited a penny in a little wooden dish by the pipers side  by dad denis said corney youll sleep tonight any waysto look at you  thats jist what he wont then for itll be morning before hes in bed and maryll have too much to say to him when he is there to let him sleep  never mind boys do you dance and ill get myself a dhrink for im choked with the dustand heres mr thady why mr thady why didnt you come in time for the supper then  just as denis mcgovery gave over dancing thady entered the house having anything but a wedding countenance he had been since the time we parted from him after his interview with keegan lying in the stable smoking he had eaten nothing but had remained meditating over the different things which conspired to make his heart sad  his fathers statethe impossibility of carrying on the war any longer against the enmity of flannelly and keeganhis own forlorn prospectsthe insult and blow he had just received from the overbearing heartless lawyerbut above all feemys condition and his fears respecting her were too much for him to bear after his sister and captain ussher had left ballycloran he had gone up to the house and had swallowed a couple of glasses of raw whiskey to drive as he said to himself the sorrow out of his heart and he had now come down to seek the friends whom brady had recommended to him and determined at whatever cost to revenge himself by their aid against keegan for the insults he had heaped upon him and against ussher for the name which he believed he had put upon his sister  it was with these feelings and determinations that thady had come down to mcgoverys wedding and as he entered the room ussher and feemy were just standing up to dance     chapter xiii  how the wedding party was concluded   when thady entered the room where the party was dancing the welcomes with which he was greeted by mcgovery and his wife prevented him from immediately seeking pat brady as he had intended for he was obliged to stop to refuse the invitations and offers which he received that supper should be got for him and it was well for those that made the offers that he did refuse them for every vestige of what was eatable in the house had been devoured and had he acceded to marys reiterated wishes that he would take jist the laste bit in the world it would have puzzled her to make good her offer in the most literal sense of the words  luckily however thady declined her hospitality and was passing through to the inner room when he was stopped by ussher who as we have before said was standing up to dance with feemy the last time the two young men had met was at the priests house when it will be remembered thady had shown a resolution not to be on good terms with the captain and subsequent events had not at all mollified his temper so when ussher goodhumoredly asked him how he was and told him he wanted to speak to him a word or two as soon as he should have tired feemy dancing or what was more probable feemy should have tired him thady answered him surlily enough saying that if captain ussher had anything to say to him he should be within but that he didnt mean to stay there all night and that perhaps captain ussher had better say it at once  well macdermot perhaps i had so if your sister ll excuse me i wont be a minutejust step to the door a moment will you and thady followed him out  well captain ussher what is it  i dont know why it is macdermot but for the last two or three days you seem to want to quarrel with me if it is so why dont you speak out like a man  is that what you were wanting to say to me  indeed it was not for its little i care whether you choose to quarrel or let it alone but i heard something tonight which though i dont wholly believe it may like enough be partly true and if you choose to listen i will tell you what it was perhaps you can tell me whether it was all false and if you cannot what i tell you may keep yourself out of a scrape  well  mcgovery tells me that he thinks some of the boys that are here tonight are come to hold some secret meeting and that from the brothers of the two men i arrested the other day being in it he thinks their purpose is to revenge themselves on me  and if it war so captain ussher what have i to do with it  ussher looked very hard at thadys face but it was much too dark for him to see anything that was there  probably not much yourself but i thought that as these men were your fathers tenants you might feel unwilling that they should turn murderers and as i am your fathers friend you might for his sake wish to prevent them murdering me  and is it from what such a gaping fool as mcgovery says you have become afraid that men would murder you who never so much as raised their hand agin any of those who are from day to day crushing and ruining them  if i had been afraid i should not have come here indeed it was to show them that i am not afraid of coming among them without my own men at my back that i came here but though i am not afraid and though it is not what mcgovery says i mindand he is not such a fool as some othersnevertheless i do think in fact from different sources i know that there is something going on through the country which will bring the poor into worse troubles than theyve suffered yet and if as i much think theyve come here to talk of their plans tonight and if you know that it is so youre foolish to be among them  is that all youve to say to me captain ussher  not quite i wanted to ask you on your honour as a man and an irishman do you know whether there is any conspiracy among them to murder or do any injury to me ussher paused for a moment and as thady did not answer him he went onand i wanted to warn you against one who is i know trying his best to ruin you and your father  who is that captain ussher i believe i know my own friends and my own inimies said thady who thought the revenue officer alluded to keegan  answer my question first  and suppose i dont choose to answer it  why if you wont answer it i cannot but think you are aware of such a conspiracy and that you approve of it  do you mean to say captain ussher that i have conspired to murdher you  no i say no such thing but surely if you heard of such a scheme or thought there was such an intention in the country wouldnt you tell me or any one else that was so doomed that they might be on their guard  youre very much frightened on a sudden captain  thats not true macdermot you know im not frightened but will you answer the question  thady was puzzled he did not know what to say exactly he had not absolutely heard that the men whom he was going to meet that night and whom he knew he meant to join intended to murder ussher but brady had told him that they were determined to have a fling at him and it was by their promise to treat the attorney in the same way that thady had been induced to come down to them it had never struck him that he was going to join a body of men pledged to commit murderthat he was to become a murderer and that he was to become so that very night his feeling had been confined to the desire of revenging himself for the gross and palpable injuries with which he had been afflicted whilst endeavouring to do the best he could for his father his sister and his house but nowconfronted with ussherasked by him as to the plots of the men whom he was on the point of joining and directly questioned as to their intentions by the very man he knew they were determined to destroy thady felt awed abashed and confused  then it occurred to him that he had not at any rate as yet pledged himself to any such deed or even in his mind conceived the idea of such a deed that there was no cause why he should give his surmises respecting what he believed might be the intentions of others to the man whom of all othersperhaps not excepting the lawyerhe disliked and hated and that there could be no reason why he should warn captain ussher against danger though these things passed through thadys mind very quickly still he paused some time leaning against the corner of an outhouse till ussher said  well macdermot surely you ll not refuse to answer me such a question as that thoughgod knows whywe maynt be friends you would not wish to have such ill as that happen to me  i dont know why you should come to me captain ussher to ask such questions if you were to ask your own frinds that you consort with in course they would feel more concerned in answering you than i can not that i want to have art or part in your blood or to have you murdheredor any one else but to tell you gods holy truth if you were out of the counthry intirely i would be better plased as would be many others and since you are axing me ill tell you captain ussher that i do think the way you do be going on with the poor in the counthrydhriving and sazing them and having spies over themisnt such as is likely to make you frinds in the counthry except with such as jonas brown and the like and though mind you i know nothing of plots and conspiracies among the boys i dont think youre over safe whilst staying among thim you have been trating that way and if they were to shoot you some night its no more than many would expect to tell you the truth then captain ussher i think youd be safer anywhere than at mohill  thady considered that he thus made a just compromise between the faith he thought he owed to the men with whom he was going to league himself and the duty which he could not but feel he ought to perform of warning ussher of the danger in which he was placed  ussher felt quite satisfied with what thady had said he was not at all surprised at his expressions of personal dislike and he felt confident from the manner in which young macdermot had spoken of his perilous situation that even if any conspiracy had been formed of which he was the object there was no intention to put it into immediate operation and that at any rate in macdermots opinion no concerted plan had yet been made to attack him a good many reasons also induced ussher to think that he stood in no danger of any personal assault in the first place though the country was in a lawless statethough illicit distillation was carried to a great extentthough many of the tenants refused to pay either rent tithes or county cesses till compelled to do sothe disturbances arising from these causes had not lately led to murder or bloodshed he had carried on his official duties in the same manner for a considerable time without molestation and custom had begotten the feeling of security moreover he thought the poor were cowed and frightened he despised them too much to think they would have the spirit to rise up against him in fact he made up his mind that thadys intention was to frighten him out of the country if possible and he resolved that he would not allow anything he had heard on the subject either to disturb his comfort or actuate his conduct  well macdermot thats fair and above boardand what i expected though its neither friendly nor flattering and i am not vexed with you for that for if you dont feel friendly to me you shouldnt speak as if you did and therefore im obliged to you and i will say that if i am to be shot down like a dog whilst performing my duty to the best of my ability at any rate i wont let the fear of such a thing frighten me out of my comfort before it happens and now if youll let me say a word or two to you about yourself  im much obliged to you captain ussher but if you can take care of yourself so can i of myself  why how cranky you are man if you hate me hate me in gods name but dont be so absurd as to forget youre a man and to act like a child i listened to youand why cant you listen to me  well spake on ill listen  mind i dont pretend to know more of your affairs than you would wish me but as i am intimate with your father i cannot but see that you in managing your fathers concerns put great confidence in the man within there  what pat brady  yes brady now if you only employed him as any other farm servant he would not probably have much power to injure you but i believe he does more than thatthat he collects your rents and knows the affairs of all your tenants  well  i have very strong reason to think that he is also in the employment or at any rate in the pay of mr keegan the attorney at carrick  what makes you think that captain ussher  i could hardly explain the different things which make me think so but im sure of it and it is for you to judge whether if such be the case your confidence will not enable him under the present state of affairs at ballycloran to do you and your father much injury he is also to my certain knowledge joined in whatever societiesall of them illegalare being formed in the country and he is a man therefore not to be trusted i may add also that if you listen too much to his advice and counsels you will be likely to find yourself in worse troubles than even those which your fathers property brings on you  dont alarm yourself about me i dont be in the habit of taking a servants advice about things captain ussher  theres your back up again i dont mean to offend you i tell you however if you remember what i have said to you it may prevent much trouble to youand ussher walked into the house  prevent throubles soliloquised thady there is no way with me to prevent all manner of throublei believe ill go in and get a tumbler of punchand determined to adopt this mode of quieting troubles if he could not prevent them he followed ussher  ussher was now dancing with feemy and the fun had become universal and incessant there were ten or twelve couple dancing on the earthen floor of mrs mehans shop the piper was playing those provocative irish tunes which like the fiddle in the german tale compel the hearers to dance whether they wish it or no and they did dance with a rapidity and energy which showed itself in the streams of perspiration running down from the performers faces not much to their immediate comfort a huge fire was kept up on the hearth but the unnecessary heat thus produced was atoned for by the numerous glasses of punch with which they were thereby enabled to regale themselves when for a moment they relaxed their labours  this pleasant recreation began also to show its agreeable effects in the increased intimacy of the partners and the spirit of the party all diffidence in standing up had ceasedand now the only difficulty was for the aspirants to get room on which to make their complicated steps and oh the precision regularity and energy of those motions although the piper played with a rapidity which would have convinced the uninitiated of the impossibility of dancing to the time every foot in the room fell to the notes of the music as surely as though the movements of the whole set had been regulated by a steam machine and such movements as they were not only did the feet keep time but every limb and every muscle had each its own work and twisted shook and twirled itself in perfect unison and measure the arms performed their figure with as much accuracy as the legs  take a sup of punch now miss tierney shure youre fainting away entirely for the want of a dhrop the lady addressed was wiping with the tail of her gown a face which showed the labour that had been necessary to perform the feat of dancing down the whole company to the tune of the wind that shakes the barley and was now leaning against the wall whilst her last partner was offering her punch made on the half and half system take a sup miss tierney then shure youre wanting it  thank ye mr kelly but i am afther taking a little jist now and the heads not sthrong with me afther dancing she took the tumbler however faix mr kelly but its yourself can make a tumbler of punch with any man  deed then theres no sperrits in it at allonly a thrifle to take the wakeness off the water come miss tierney you didnt take whatd baptize a babby  itd be a big babby then one like yerself may be  heres long life to the first you have yerself any way miss tierney and he finished the glass of which the blushing beauty had drunk half might a boy make a guess whod be the father of it  go asy now masther mortythe swain rejoiced in the name of mortimer kelley itll be some quiet dacent fellow that ant given to chaffing nor too fond of sperrits  by dad my darling and ant that me to a hairs breadth  is it you a dacent asy boy  shure if it ant me wheres sich a one in the counthry at all and its id be fond of the childand the childs mother more especial and he gave her a loving squeeze which in a less energetic society might have formed good ground for an action for violent assault  ah dont go asy i tell you morty but come ant you going to dance instead of wasting your time here all night and the pair reinvigorated by their intellectual and animal refreshment again commenced their dancing  whilst the fun was going on fast and furious among the dancers those in the inner room were not less busily engaged brady was still sitting in the chair which he had occupied during the supper at the bottom of the table though he had turned round a little towards the fire at the further end of it thady was seated with a lighted pipe in his mouth and a tumbler of punch on the shelf over the fireplace joe reynolds was seated a little behind but between thady and pat brady and a lot of others were standing around or squatting on the end of the tableleaning against the fireplace or sitting two on a chair wherever two had been lucky enough to secure one between them they were all drinking most of them raw spiritsand all of them smoking at the other end of the room three or four boys and girls were standing in the doorway looking at the dancing and getting cool after their own performances and denis mcgovery was sitting in the chair which father john had occupied with his head on the table apparently asleep but more probably intent on listening to what was going on among them at the other end of the room whom he so strongly suspected of some proposed iniquity the noise however of the music and the dancing the low tones in which the suspected parties spoke and the distance at which they sat must have made deniss occupation of eavesdropping difficult if not impracticable  thady had just been speaking and it was evident from the thickness of his voice that the whiskey he had drunk was beginning to have its effects on him instead of eating his dinner he had been drinking raw spirits in the morning to which he was not accustomed for though when cold or when pressed by others he could swallow a glass of raw whiskey with that facility which seems to indicate an iron throttle he had been too little accustomed to give way to any temptation to become habitually a drunkard now however he was certainly becoming tipsy and therefore more likely to agree to whatever those around him might propose  asy mr thady said pat theres that longeared ruffian mcgovery listening to every word he can catch be spaking now as if you war axing the boys about the rint  and isnt it about that he is axing said joe but how can he get the rint or we be paying it unless he gives us his hand to rid the counthry of thim as robs us of our manes and desthroys him and us and all thim as should be frinds to him and the owld masther and to ballycloran  you know all of ye that i never was hard on you continued thady when god knows the money was wanted bad enough at ballycloran you know ive waited longer for what was owed than many a one has done who has never felt what it was to want a pound did i ever pull the roof off any of you and though queer tenants youve most of you been ant the same set on the land now mostly that there was four years ago theres none of you can call me a hard man i think and when ive stuck to you so long it isnt now ill break away from you  long life to you mr thady long life to yer honerand may ye live to see the esthate your own yet and not owe a shilling its thrue for the masther what he says why should he turn agin his own now god bless him such were the exclamations with which thadys last speech was received  and ill tell you what it is and he now spoke in a low thick whisper ill tell you whats on my mind those that you hate i dont love a bit too well you all know hyacinth keegan i think  deed we domay the big devil fetch him home  well then would you like him for your landlord out and out such a fine gentleman as he is  blast him for a gintleman said joe id sooner have his father he war an honest man more by token he war no protestant he sarved processes for richard peyton up by loch allen  well then continued thady if you dont like him boys i can tell you he dont like you a bit better and if he can contrive to call himself masther at ballycloran as i can tell you he manes to try its not one of you hell lave on the land  did he tell you that himself mr thady whispered brady now though young macdermot was nearly drunkquite drunk enough to have lost what little good sense was left to him after being fool enough to come at all among those with whom he was at present drinkingstill what ussher had said about his follower was not forgotten and though he did not absolutely believe that brady was a creature of keegans what he had heard prevented his having the same inclination to listen to pat or the same confidence in what he said  faith then he told me so with his own mouth and it isnt only the others d be going but youd have to walk yourself masther pat  and why wouldnt i dye think id be staying at ballycloran afther you war gone mr thady  dont be making any vows pat maybe you wouldnt be axed and maybe av you war you wouldnt refuse to ate yer bread though it war keegan paid for it  that the first mouthful may choke me that i ever ate of his paying for  well however boys hyacinth keegan will sthrip the roof off every mothers son of you if he ever conthrives to put his foot in ballycloran but by god he never shall mind boys he can never do that till he can lay his hands on the owld man and wherell you all be i wonder to let him or any one he sends do that or take a sod of turf or a grain of oats off the land either  by dad youre right mr thady said one of them shure wouldnt we have him in a boghole or as many as hed send and then they might take away what they could carry in their mouths  ill tell you what sir said joe reynolds and he laid his hand on thadys knee and leant forward till his mouth was near the young mans earso near that not only could not mcgovery overhear his words but of the whole party round the fire only brady and byrne besides thady himself could catch what he said ill tell you what sir keegan shall never harum you or yours if youll be one of usone of us heart and sowl and i know you will and i know its not in you to put up with what theyre putting on you an dearly hell pay for the blow he strik you an the word he saidsurely mr thady and he whispered still lower into his ear let alone the esthate an the house an all that youd niver put up with what he has been about this day paceable an in quiet  youre thrue in that joe by gd  well then wont we see you righted let the bloody ruffian come to ballycloran an then see the way hell go back again to carrick will you say the word mr thady will you join us agin thim that is as much an a deal more agin you than they are agin us  but what is it you main to do  thats what youll know when youve joined us but you know it isnt now or here wed be telling you that which maybe would put our necks in your hand but when youve taken the oath weve all taken well be ready then not only to tell you all but follow you anywhere  the young man paused  isnt it enough for you to know that our inimies is your inimiesthat thim you wishes ill to we wishes ill to isnt keegan the man youve most cause to hate an wont we right you with him dont we hate that bloody captain that is this moment playing his villains tricks with your own sisther in the next room there and shure you cant feel very frindly to him by the holy virgin when youre one of us its not much longer he shall throuble you if you can put up with what the likes of them is doing to youif you can bear all thatwhy mr thady youre not the man i took you for but mind divil a penny of rint ll ever go to ballycloran agin from drumleesh for the matters up nowyoure either our frind or our inimy but if mr thady youve the pluck they all says you havean which i iver see in you god bless youits not only one of us youll be but the head of us all for there isnt one but ll go to hells gate for your word an then the first tinant on the place that pays as much as a tinpenny to keegan or to any but jist yourselfby the cross he may dig his own grave  what thady immediately said does not much signify before long he had promised to come over to mrs mulreadys at mohill with pat brady on an appointed night there to take the oath of the party to whom he now belonged  though it was agreed that the secret determinations of the party were not to be divulged to him until he had joined them there it nevertheless was pretty clearly declared that their immediate and chief object was the destruction of ussher and if possible the liberation of the three men who had lately been confined in ballinamore bridewell for the malt that had been seized in the cabin by loch sheen however to prevent the evil arising from this carelessness in the performance of their duties as conspirators thady was requested to swear on a cross made with the handles of two knives that he would not divulge anything that had occurred or been said in that room that nightwith which request he complied  by the time this was done most of them were drunk but none were so drunk as poor macdermot his intoxication moreover was unfortunately not of that sort which was likely to end in quiescence and incapability it was a sign of the great degradation to which macdermot had submitted in joining these men that in talking over the injuries which ussher had inflicted on them all he had quietly heard them canvass usshers conduct to his sister and that in no measured terms this had gone much against the grain with him at first because he could not but strongly feel that in abusing ussher they were equally reproaching feemy but the fall of high and fine feelings when once commenced is soon accomplished even when the fall is from a higher dignity than those of thadys had ever reached and though a few hours since he would have allowed no one but father john even to connect his sisters name with ussher he had soon accustomed himself to hear the poorest tenant on his fathers property speak familiarly on the subject when urging him to join them in common cause against his enemy but though he had so far sacrificed his sisters dignity in his drunken conversation with these men he was not the less indignant with the man whose name they had so unceremoniously joined with hers and he got up with the resolution to inform ussher that the intercourse between him and feemy must immediately cease the spirits he had taken gave him a false feeling of confidence that he should find means to carry his resolution into effect without delay  when he got into the outer room ussher and feemy were not there the dancing and drinking were going on as fast as ever shamuth the piper was in the same seat with probably not the same tumbler of punch beside him and was fingering away at his pipes as if the feeling of fatigue was unknown to him and mary the bride was still dancing as though her heart had not been broken all the morning with the work she had had to do biddy also the ballycloran housemaid was in the seventh heaven of happinessfor hadnt she music and punch galore and though the glory of her once wellstarched cap was dimmed if not totally extinguished by the dust and heat her heart was now too warm with the fun to grieve for that especially when such a neat made boy as barney egan was dancing foranenst her it did not however add to her happiness when after being addressed once or twice in vain she heard her young masters voice  biddydye hear and be dd to youis your misthress gone home  deed mr thady i think she be  and why the divil then ant you gone with her dyou mane to be dancing here all night  now thady was in general so very unobservantso little inclined to interfere with if he could not promote the amusements of his dependantsmoreover so unaccustomed to scoldthat biddy and the others round her soon saw that something was the matter  what are you staring at you born fool if miss feemys gone up to ballycloran do you follow her  thadys thick voice red face and sparkling eyes showed that he was intoxicated and biddy if not preparing to obey himfor the temptation to stay was too strongwas preparing to pretend to do so when mary mcgovery by way of allaying macdermots wrath said  i dont believe then mr thady that miss feemys gone home at all at all i think she and the captain is only walked down the lane a bit jist to cool themselves for sure its hot work dancing  thady did not stop to ask any more questions but hurried out of the door and turning away from ballycloran walked as fast as his unsteady legs would carry him towards mohill and unfortunately ussher and feemy were strolling down the lane in that direction  when pat brady saw macdermot hurry out of the house he said to his sister begad mary youd better hurry down the laneif captain ussher and miss feemy is in itjist to take care of her for he and the masther ll have a great fight of it this night the masthers bloods up and the twoll be slating one another afore theyre parted  goodness gracious exclaimed mary why dont you go yourself pat mr thadys taken a dhrop and maybe hell be hurting miss feemy or the captain denis dearher husband came in the room just thentheres a ruction between the captain and mr thady in gods name go and bring away miss feemy  ussher and feemy had not been out of the house many minutes it was a beautiful mild moonlight night in october and as the girl had said they had come out to cool themselves after the heat and noise and dirt of the room in which they had been dancing myles was in one of his best humours he had persuaded himself that he had no real danger to fear from the men who as he was told were so hostile to him feemy too had looked very pretty and nice and had not contradicted him and whereas what thady had drunk had made him cross ussher had only just had enough to make him goodhumoured feemy too was very happy she had contrived to forget her brothers croaking and father johns warning or at least the misery which they had occasioned her and was very happy in usshers goodhumour it were bootless to repeat their conversation or to tell how often it was interrupted by some unchided caress on the part of ussher feemy however had not forgotten her resolution and was bringing up all her courage to make some gentle hint to myles on the subject on which she had promised father john to speak to him when her heart sunk within her on hearing her brothers voice calling to her from behind  good heaven myles theres thady what can he be wanting here  usshers arm fell from the fair girls waist as he answered never fear dear dont you speak to him leave him to me by this time thady had nearly joined them  is that you feemy here at this hour what the d are you doing there this time of night here take my arm and come home its time you had some one to mind you im thinking  feemy saw that her brother was intoxicated and was frightened she turned though she did not take his arm and ussher turned too  your sisters not alone macdermot as im with her i dont think you have much cause to fear because she is about a mile from ballycloran  may be captain ussher youre being with her maynt make her much safer at any rate youll let me manage my own affairs i suppose i can take my sisther to her own home without your interference and he took hold of his sisters arm as if to drag it within his own  good heavens thady what are you afther shure ant i walking with you dont be dragging me  it appears to me macdermot said ussher that though your sister was in want of no protector before you came she is in great want of one now  she wanted it thin and she wants it now and will do as long as shes fool enough to put herself in the way of such as you but by gd as long as im with her she shall have it and he dragged her along by the arm  but thady said the poor girl afraid both of her brother and her lover and hardly knowing to which to address herself but thady youre hurting me and ill walk with you quiet enough i was only getting a little cool afther the dancing and whats the great harm in that  wellthere and he let her go im not hurting you now its very tender youve got of a sudden when i touch you captain ussher if youll plaze to go on or stay behind ill be obliged for i want to spake to feemy and theres no occasion in life for my throubling you to hear what ive to say  you can say what you like macdermot but i shant leave you for though feemys your sister youre not fit to guide her or yourself either for youre drunk  and there you lie captain ussher you liethats what youre used to but its the last of your lies shell hear  ah youre drunk replied ussher besides you know id not notice what youd say before your sister if however youre not so very drunk as to forget what youve called me tomorrow morning and would then like to repeat it ill thrash you as you deserve  then by jasus youll have your wish you asked me tonight if i had a mind to quarrel with you and now ill tell you if i find you at ballycloran schaming agin youll find me ready and willing enough  thats where youll find me tomorrow morning then for ill certainly come to ask your sister how she is after the brutal manner youve frightened her this night and then perhaps youll have the goodness to tell me what you mean by what you call schaming  ill tell you now then its schaming to be coming with your lies and your blarney afther a girl like feemy only maning to desave herits schaming to go about humbugging a poor silly owld man like my fatherand its the higth of schaming and blackguardness to pretend to be so frindly to a family when you know youre maning them all the harum in your power to do but youll find my fine captain it ant quite so asy to play your thricks at ballycloran as you think though we are so poor  feemy when the young men had begun to use hard words to one another had commenced crying and was now sobbing away at a desperate rate  dont distress yourself feemy said ussher your brother ll be more himself tomorrow morning hell be sorry for what he has said thenand if he is so i am not the man to remember what any one says when theyve taken a little too much punch  they had now come near enough to mrs mehans to see that there were a number of people outside the door as soon after thadys departure as denis mcgovery and the rest had been able to make up their minds what it would be the best to do in the emergency of the case denis and his wife sallied forth the former to carry home whichever of the combatants might be slaughtered in the battle and mary to give to feemy what comfort and assistance might be in her power pat brady prudently thought that under all circumstances it would be safest for himself to remain where he was the married pair however bent on peace if possible and if not on assuaging the horrors of war had barely got into the road when they encountered father john returning to the wedding party  oh and its yer riverence is welcome agin this blessed evening god be praised that sent you for its yerself ll be wanted im afeard and that immediately  it was some time before the priest could learn what was the matter at last he discovered that ussher and feemy had gone out walkingthat thady had got drunk and had gone after them and he was inquiring whether he had gone towards mohill or towards ballycloran which none of them knew when the three came in sight  father john instantly walked up to them and if he had learnt it from nothing else soon discovered from feemys tears that something was the matter  how are you thady he said putting out his hand to take the young mans which was given with apparent reluctance how are you is there anything wrong that feemy is crying so  oh you know father john there is a dd deal wrong and ive jist told the captain what it is thats all ill not have the girl humbugged any longer thats all  there must be a great deal wrong thady when youd curse that way before me  i cant be picking my words now for priest or parson  they were now surrounded by the whole crowd out of the house who were staring and gaping and absolutely shocked at thadys impudence to his friend and priest feemy was sobbing and on ussher offering her his arm to take her from the crowd took it  by gd exclaimed thady if you touch that ruffians arm again ill niver call you sisther or shall you iver call me brother so now choose betwixt us  feemy dropped her hand from usshers arm but turning to the priest she said for heavens sake take him away father john hes drunk  drunk or sober you may choose now its either me or him but if you disgrace yourself you shall not disgrace me  father john took feemys arm on his and telling the people to go back to their dancing laid his hand on thadys shoulder and said  at any rate thady come a little out of this if you must speak to your sister in that way you dont wish all the parish to hear what youre saying  what matthers father john what matthers shure theyve all heard too much alreadydont they all say shes the blackguards misthress  oh thady how can you repeat that word of me sobbed the poor girl  why did you let them say it why dont you tell the man thats blackening your name while hes desaving you to be laving you now and not following you through the country like a curse  by this time the whole party consisting of father john the two young men and feemy were walking on rapidly towards ballycloran feemy was crying but saying nothing ussher was silent although thady was heaping on him every term of abuse he could think ofand father john was in vain attempting to moderate his wrath thus they continued until they came to the avenue leading up to the house and on usshers proceeding with them through the gate thady put himself in the way stopping him  youll not come a step in here captain if i know it you might follow us along the road for i couldnt help itbut by gd you dont come in here  nonsense man do you think ill stop out for a drunken mans riot let me pass  set a foot in here you blackguard and ill stretch you  thady had an alpine in his hand and was preparing to strike a blow at the captain exactly on the spot where keegan had struck him when the priest pushed his burly body in between them ill have no blows boys at any rate while im with you put your stick down thady and he forced the young mans stick down run up to the house feemy and get to bed ill see you in the morning feemy however did not move now captain ussher i am not saying a word on the matter one way or other for i dont well know how the quarrel beganbut do you think its well to be forcing your way in here when the master desires you not  but mr mcgrath ive yet to learn that this drunken fellow is master here besides i suppose it is not a part of his project to rob me of my horse which is in his fathers stable  thady was at length persuaded to allow ussher to go to the stables for his horse and the captain after what had passed did not now wish to go into the house he was however going up to feemy to shake hands with her when the priest caught him by the arm saying  why would you anger a drunken man and that too when the feeling in his heart is right ill tell you what captain if what that young man fears is true youre almost as much worse than him as vice is than virtue  spare me your sermon now father john if i see you tomorrow ill hear it in patience and he galloped down the avenue  thady and feemy went into the house and we hope each got to bed without further words and father john walked slowly home thinking of all the misery he saw in store for his parishioners at ballycloran     chapter xiv  denis mgoverys tidings   as soon as he had finished his breakfast on the morning after the nights events just recorded father john took his hat and stick and walked down to drumsna still charitably intent on finding some means to soften if he could not avert the storm which he saw must follow the scenes he had witnessed on the previous evening ussher would have considered it want of pluck to stay away because thady had told him to do so feemy also would encourage his visits and would lean more to her lover than her brotherespecially as her father if it were attempted to make him aware of the state of the case would be sure to take feemys part father john felt it would be impossible to induce the old man to desire ussher to discontinue his visits and he was confident that unless he did so the captain would take advantage of the unfortunate state of affairs at ballycloran and consider himself as an invited guest in spite of the efforts thady might make to induce him to leave it but what the priest most feared was that the unfortunate girl would be induced to go off with her lover who he knew under such circumstances would never marry her and his present object was to take her out of the way of such temptation father john gave feemy credit for principles and feelings sufficiently high to prevent her from falling immediately into vice but he at the same time feared that with the strong influence ussher had over her he might easily persuade her to leave her home partly by promising at some early time to marry her and partly by threatening her with desertion he thought that if she were at present domiciled at mrs mckeons ussher might then be brought to hear reason and be made to understand that if he was not contented to propose for and marry feemy in a proper decent manner he must altogether drop her acquaintance  he was not far wrong in the estimate he formed of both their characters though ussher loved feemy perhaps as well as he was ever likely to love any woman circumstances might easily have induced him to give her up it was the impediments in the way and the opposition he now met with which would give the affair a fresh interest in his eyes he certainly did not intend to marry the poor girl had she had sufficient tact she might perhaps have persuaded him to do so but her fervent love and perfect confidence though very gratifying to his vanity did not inspire him with that feeling of respect which any man would wish to have for the girl he was going to marry i do not say that his premeditated object had been to persuade her to leave her home but father john was not far wrong in fearing that unless steps were taken to prevent it it would be the most probable termination to the whole affair  with regard to feemy he was quite right in thinking that her love of ussher was strong enough to induce her to take almost any step that he might desire and that that love joined to her own obstinacy and determined resistance to the advice of those to whom she should have listened was such as to render it most unlikely that she should be induced to give him up but though he so well understood the weakness of her character he was not aware of for he had had no opportunity of trying its strength  as long as feemy had her own way as at the present time she had she would as we have seen yield entirely to her strong love but this was not all had circumstances enabled her friends to remove her entirely out of usshers way and had they done so her love would have remained the same her passion was so strong that it could not be weakened or strengthened by absence or opposition when father john calculated that by good management ussher might be brought to relinquish feemy he was right but he was far from right when he thought that feemy could be taught to forget him she literally cared for no one but him her life had been so dull before she knew him and so full of interest sincehe so nearly came up to her beau ideal of what a man should be for she had seen or at any rate had known no betterhe so greatly excelled her brother and father and was so much better looking than young cassidy and so much more spirited than frank mckeon that to her young heart he was all perfection  she had lately been vexed tormented and even frightened but her fear was merely that ussher did not love her as she did himthat he might be made to leave her and she was learning to hate her brother for opposing as she would have said the only source of her happiness as to being induced by prudence or propriety to be cool to her loveras to taking the first step herself towards making a breach between themnothing that her brother or the priest had said nothing that they could ever say could either make her think of doing so or think that it could be advisable or in any way proper that she should do so for this strong feeling father john did not give our heroine credit but he still felt that she was headstrong enough to make it a very difficult task for him to manage her in any way but as his charity was unbounded so were his zeal and courage great  his present plan was to induce his friend mrs mckeon to ask feemy to come over and spend some time with her and her daughters at drumsna there were difficulties in this for in the first place although feemy and the miss mckeons had been very good friends still the reports which had lately been afloat both about her and the affairs of her family might make mrs mckeon a prudent woman unwilling to comply with the priests wishesthough indeed it was not often that she contradicted him in anything then after he had talked mrs mckeon over when he had aroused her charitable feelings and excited the good nature which to tell the truth was never very dormant in her bosom he had the more difficult task of persuading feemy to accept the invitation not that under ordinary circumstances she would not be willing enough to go to mrs mckeons but at present she would be likely to suspect a double meaning in everything father john had already mentioned mrs mckeons name to her in reference to her attachment to ussher and it was more than probable that if he now brought her an invitation from that lady she would perceive that the object was to separate her from her lover and that she would obstinately persist in remaining at ballycloran  as father john was entering drumsna he met his curate cullen and mcgovery who considering that he had only been married the evening before and that if he had not been dancing himself he had been kept up by his guests doing so till four or five in the morning had left his bride rather early for according to custom he had slept the first night after his wedding at his wifes house and though it was only ten oclock he had been on a visit to father cullen with whom he was now eagerly talking  on the previous evening when feigning to be asleep he had managed to overhear a small portion of what had passed between thady joe reynolds and the rest but what he had overheard had reference solely to keegan for when they began to speak of ussher everything had been said in so low a voice that he had been unable to comprehend a word he had contrived however to pick up something in which ballycloran rents keegan and a boghole were introduced in marvellous close connection and he was not slow in coming to the determination that he had been wrong when he fancied that ussher was the object against whom plots were being formed and that keegan was the doomed man but what was worse still he was led to imagine that the perpetrators of mr keegans future watery grave were instigated by young macdermot he was well aware that flannelly and keegan for they were all one had the greater portion of the rents out of ballycloran and he now plainly saw that the more active of this firm was to be made away with while collecting or attempting to collect the rent  denis was puzzled as to what he should do his conscience would not allow the man to be murdered without his interference he had no great love for mr keegan and his sympathies were not more strongly excited than they had been when he thought ussher was to be the victim should he tell mr keegan that would be setting the devil in arms against his wifes brotheragainst his wifes brothers masterand against his wifes brothers masters tenants this was too near cutting his own throat to be a line of action agreeable to denis then it occurred to him to have recourse again to father john but father john had made light of his former warning besides the fact of his having been wrong in his last surmises would have thrown stronger doubts on those he now entertained father john too was always quizzing him and denis did not like to be quizzed after much consideration mcgovery resolved to go to father cullen and disclose his secret to him father cullen was a modest steady man who would neither make light of or ridicule what he heard and if after that keegan was drowned in a boghole it would be entirely off deniss conscience  when father john met the pair they had just been discussing the subject cullen was far from making light of it for in the first place he believed every word mcgovery told him and in the next he was shocked and greatly grieved that one of his own parishioners and one also of the most respectable of them should be concerned in such a business he felt towards keegan all the abhorrence which a very bigoted and ignorant roman catholic could feel towards a protestant convert but he would have done anything to prevent his meeting his death by the hands or with the connivance of thady macdermot  as soon as cullen had heard mcgoverys statementwhich by the by had been made without any reference to his previous statement to father john or his warning to captain ussherhe determined to tell it all to the parish priest and to take mcgovery with him this plan did not however suit denis at all and he used all his eloquence to persuade father cullen that if he told mr mcgrath at all he denis had better not make one of the party and he was at the moment considering what excuse he could give for refusing to go into the priests cottage when they met father john on the road coming into drumsna  denis was greatly disconcertedbut cullen full of his news and as eager to communicate it as if it had been arranged definitely that keegan was to be put into the boghole at noon precisely was very glad to see him and instantly opened his budget  im very glad to meet you this morning mr mcgrath he began and its well since youre out so early that its not the other way you wentfor id been greatly bothered if i hadnt found you  but here i am you seeand if it was only after me you were going i suppose you can turn for im going to drumsna  oh to be sure i can dont you be going denis mcgovery denis had taken off his hat and muttering something about his wife and good morning yer riverence was decamping towards ballycloran  why man said father john what business have you so far from your wife at this hour of the morning after your wedding have you been to take the two pigs home  he he father john youll niver have done with them pigsbut the wifell be waiting for me and as yer riverence says i mustnt be baulking her the first morning  stay a whileas youve come so far without her you can stop a moment  oh yes said cullen wait till youve told mr mcgrath what you told me  denis was unwillingly obliged to remain and repeat to father john the whole story he had told cullen though he could hardly tell why himself he softened down a little the strong assurance he had given cullen that thady himself had been urging the boys to make away with keegan father john listened to all in silence till denis ended by wishing that the two young men got home safe last night and that there war nothing worse nor harder than words betwixt them  get home safe you fool answered father john and why wouldnt theydont you know the difference yet between a few foolish words said half in fun and a quarrel to be sure they got home safeand let me tell you denis for a sensible fellow as you pretend to be youd be a deal better employed minding your business than thinking of other peoples quarrels or trying to pick up stories of murders and heaven knows whatfilling your own mind and other peoples too with foolish fears for which there are no grounds and now if youd take my advice youll go home and leave your betters to take care of themselves for youll find it quite enough to take care of yourselfand mind mcgovery if i find this cock and bull story of yours gets through the country so as to reach mr keegans ears or to annoy mr macdermot i shall know where it came from and perhaps youre not aware that a person inventing such a story as youve been telling mr cullen might soon find himself in carrick gaol  it would be impossible to say whether cullen was most astonished or mcgovery disconcerted by father johns address  but began cullen if the man really heard the plan proposed mr mcgrath and if mr thady was one of them  ah nonsense cullen  but i havent invented a word father john said mcgovery i heard it every word and shure afther hearing it all with my own ears was i to let the man be shot into a boghole without saying a word to no one about it father john  ah youre a nice boy denisand why did you pass my gate to come all the way down to father cullen to tell him the dreadful tale why didnt you come to me ehwhen you knew not only that i was nearer you than mr cullen but also nearer to the place where all this was to happen  why then father john not to tell you a lie it is because you do be going on with your gagging at me so  nonsense manhow can you say you are not going to lie when you know youve a lie in your mouth at the moment  sorrow a lie is there in it at all father johni wish the tongue of me had been blistered this morning before i said a word of it  i wish it had been why cullen it was only last night that he wanted to persuade me that a lot of boys were to meet at the place where he was married to agree to murder ussher and to hear the man youd think it was all arranged who was to strike the blow and all and now here he is with you with a similar story about keegan he was afraid to come to me because he knew hed half humbugged me with his other story last night  but i tell you father john i heard it all with my own ears this time  and i tell you you were dreaming do you think youd make me believe that such a young gentleman as mr thady would turn murderer all of a sudden now go home and take my advice if you dont want to find yourself in a worse scrape than captain ussher or mr keegan dont repeat such a tale as that to any one  mcgovery sneaked off with his tail allegorically speaking between his legs he didnt exactly know what to make of it for though as has been before said he did not wish on this occasion to make father john the depositary of his fears he did not expect even from him to meet with such total discomfiture he consoled himself however with the recollection that if anything did happen now either to the revenue officer or the attorneyand he almost hoped there wouldhe could fairly say that he had given warning and premonitory tidings of it to the parish priests which if attended to might have prevented all harm with this comfortable feeling to atone for father johns displeasure and now not quite sure whether he had overheard any allusion last night to keegan and a boghole or not he returned to his wife  as soon as he was gone cullen as much surprised as mcgovery at the manner in which father john had received the story asked him if he thought it was all a lie  perhaps not all a lie answered the priest perhaps he heard something about keegannot very flattering to the attorney no doubt thady was asking the boys about the rent and threatening them with keegan as a receiver over the property or something of that sort and very likely one of those boys from drumleesh said something about a boghole which may be thady didnt reprove as he ought to have done ive no doubt it all came about in that waybut that fellow with his tales and his stories will get his ears cut off some of these days and serve him right why he wanted yesterday to make me believe that these fellows who are to drown keegan this morning were to shoot ussher last night hes just the fellow to do more harm in the country than all the stills if he were listened towell cullen good day im going into mr mckeons hereand cullen went away quite satisfied with father johns view of the affair  not so father john for thadys saketo screen his character and because he did not think there was any immediate dangerhe had given the affair the turn which it had just taken but he himself fearedmore than fearedfelt sure that there was too much truth in what the man had said thadys unusual intoxication last nighthis brutal conduct to his sisterto ussher and to himselfthe men with whom he had been drinkinghis own knowledge of the feeling the young man entertained towards keegan and the hatred the tenants felt for the attorneyall these things conspired to convince father john that mcgovery had too surely overheard a conversation which if repeated to keegan might probably considering how many had been present at it give him a desperate hold over young macdermot which he would not fail to use either by frightening him into measures destructive to the property or by proceeding criminally against him father john was not only greatly grieved that such a meeting should have been held with reference to its immediate consequences but he was shocked that thady should so far have forgotten himself and his duty as to have attended it but with the unceasing charity which made the great beauty of father johns character he in his heart instantly made allowances for him he remembered all his distress and miseryhis want of friendshis grief for his sisterhis continued attempts and continued inability to relieve his father from his difficulties and he determined to endeavour to screen him  his success with mcgovery whom he had made to disbelieve his own senses and with cullen who was ready enough to take his superiors views in any secular affair had been complete and he did not think that either would now be likely to repeat the story in a manner that would do any injury we shall in a short time see what steps he took in the matter with thady himself in the meanwhile we will follow him into mrs mckeons house at whose door he had now arrived     chapter xv  the mkeons   when father john opened the wicket gate leading into the small garden which separated mrs mckeons house from the street he saw her husband standing in the open doorway ruminating mr mckeon was said to be a comfortable man and he looked to be so he was something between fortyfive and fifty about six feet two high with a goodhumoured red face he was inclined to be corpulent and would no doubt have followed his inclination had he not accustomed himself to continual bodily activity he was a great eater and a very great drinker it is said he could put any man in connaught under the table and carry himself to bed sober at any rate he was never seen drunk and it was known that he had often taken fifteen tumblers of punch after dinner and rumour told of certain times when he had made up and exceeded the score  he was comfortable in means as well as in appearance though mr mckeon had no property of his own he was much better off than many around him that had he had a large farm on a profitable lease he underlet a good deal of land by conacre or cornacrefew of my english readers will understand the complicated misery to the poorest of the irish which this accursed word embraceshe took contracts for making and repairing roads and bridges and altogether he contrived to live very well on his ways and means although a very hardworking man he was a bit of a sportsman and usually kept one or two welltrained horses which as he was too heavy to ride them himself he was always willing and usually able to sell at remunerating prices he was considered a very good hand at a handicap and understood wellno one betterthe dangerous mysteries of knocking he was sure to have some animal to run at the different steeplechases in the neighbourhood and it was generally supposed that even when not winning his race tony mckeon seldom lost much by attending the meeting there was now going to be a steeplechase at carrickonshannon in a few days and mckeon was much intent on bringing his mare playfula wicked devil within twenty yards of whom no one but himself and groom could comeinto the field in fine order and condition in addition to this mr mckeon was a very hospitable man his only failing in that respect being his firm determination and usual practice to make every man that dined with him drunk he was honest in everything barring horseflesh was a good catholic and very fond of his daughterslouey and lydia his wife was a kind good easy creature fond of the world and the worlds goods and yet not selfish or niggardly with those with which she was blessed she was sufficiently contented with her husband whose friends never came out of the diningroom after dinner and therefore did not annoy her she looked on his foibles with a lenient eye for she had been accustomed to such all her life and when she heard he had parted with her car in a handicap or had lost her two fat pigs in a knock she bore it with great goodhumour she was always willing to procure amusement for her daughters and was beginning to feel anxious to get them husbands she was a good neighbour and if she had a strong feeling at all it was her partiality for father john her daughters had nothing very remarkable about them to recommend them to our attention they were both rather pretty tolerably well educated to the extent of a two years sojourn in a convent in sligo were both very fond of novels dancing ribbons and potato cakes and both thought that to dance at a raceball with an officer in his regimentals was the most supreme terrestrial blessing of which their lot was susceptible  we have however kept the father too long standing at his own door while we have been describing his family  well father john said mckeon how are you this morning  why then as luckily i didnt dine with you mr mckeon im pretty much as i usually amand thank god thats well im told you had those poor fellows that were with you last night laid on a mattress and that you sent them home that way to carrick on a country car and that they couldnt move leaving this at six this morning  oh nonsense father john who was telling you them lies  but wasnt it true didnt they go home on one of the cars off the farm and young michael driving them and they on a mattress  and sure father john you wouldnt have had me let them walk home to carrick after dinner  they were little fit for walking i believe why they couldnt so much as sit up in the car will you never have done mr mckeon dont you know the sin of drunkenness  the sin of drunkenness me know it indeed i dont then when did you ever see me drunk come which was a case last father johnyou or i  god forgive me but i believe some boys did make me rather tipsy the first day i ever was in france and my head should have been full of other things and i believe if you were to swim in punch it wouldnt hurt you but you know as well as i can tell you its worse for you to be making others drink so much who cant bear it as you can than if you were hurting yourself  and you know as well as i can tell you that yourself would be the last man to take the whiskey off the table as long as the lads that were with you chose to be drinking it and i think when i sent them boys off to carrick as comfortably asleep as if they were in bed so that they wouldnt be too late at business this morning i acted by them as id wish anybody to act by me if i had an accident and if that ant being a good christian i dont know what is so lave off preaching father john and come round to the stables till i show you the mare thatll win at carrick at least it ll be a very good nag that ll take the shine out of her  i hope youll win mr mckeon in spite of your villany in making those young fellows drunk but ill not look at the mare just at present more by token im told shes not very civil to morning visitors  arrah nonsense man shes as quiet a mare as ever went over a fence when shes well handled  but you see i cant handle her well and as i want to see the good woman that owns you if you please ill go into the house instead of into the stable  well every man to his choice and ill see playful get her gallop but i tell you what father john if you dont mind what youre after with mrs mckeon ill treat you a deal worse than i did those two fellows i sent home to carrick on a mattress  so mr mckeon walked off to superintend the training of his mare and the priest in spite of the marital caution he had received walked into the diningroom where he knew that at that hour he should probably find the mother and daughters surrounded by their household cares  when the usual greetings were over and the two girls had asked all the particulars of mary bradys wedding and mrs mckeon had got through her usual gossip father john warily began the subject respecting which he was so anxious to rouse his friends soft sympathies  mrs mckeon had gone so far herself as to ask him whether anything had been settled yet at ballycloran about ussher and whether he thought that the young man really intended to marry the girl  the way this question was asked was a great damper to father johns hopes if there had been any kindly feelings towards poor feemy at the moment in her breast she would have called her by her name and not spoken of her as the girl it showed that mrs mckeon was losing or had lost whatever good opinion she might ever have had of feemy and when louey illnaturedly added oh lawsnot hethe man never thought of her father john felt sure that there was a slight feeling of triumph among the female mckeons at the idea of feemys losing the lover of whom perhaps she had been somewhat too proud  still however he did not despair he knew that if they spoke with illnature it arose from thoughtlessnessand that it was at any rate with the mother only necessary to point out to her the benefit she could confer to arouse a kindly feeling within her  i think youre wrong there miss louey said father john i think he not only did think of herbut does think of her and ill tell you what i know that if feemy macdermot had the great blessing which you have and that is a kind good careful mother to the fore shed have been married to him before this  but father john said the kind good careful mother what is there to prevent them marrying if hes ready i always pitied feemy being left alone there with her father and brother but if captain ussher is in earnest i dont see how twenty mothers would make it a bit easier for her  dont you mrs mckeonthen its little you know the advantage your own girls have in yourself dont you think a man would prefer taking a girl from a house where a good mother gave signs that the daughter would make a good wife than from one where there was no one to mind her but a silly old man and a young one like thadya very good young man in his way but not very fit mrs mckeon to act a mothers part to a girl like feemy  thats true enough but then why did she make all the world believe he was engaged to her if he wasntand if he wasnt why did she let him go on as though he was being at all hours im told with her at ballycloranand if they are not to be married why does her brother let him be coming there at all i know youre fond of them father john and id be sorry to think ill of your friends but i must say it begins to look odd  youre right any how in saying im very fond of them indeed i am and so is yourself mrs mckeon and i know though you speak in that way to me you wouldnt say anything that could hurt the poor girl any where but just among ourselves if it wasnt in a kind mother with such a heart as your ownespecially in one shed known so longin whom could a poor motherless friendless girl like feemy expect to find a friend  god forbid i should hurt her father john and indeed id befriend her if i knew how but dont you think yourself now shes played a foolish game with that young man  why as i never was a young lady in love i cant exactly say how a young lady in love should behave but my dear woman look at it this way i suppose theres no harm in feemy wishing to get herself married more than any other young lady  oh dear no father john quite right she should  and every one seems to think this captain ussher would be a proper match for her  why barring that hes a protestant of course hes a very good match for her  oh as to his being a protestant we wont mind that now well then mrs mckeon under these circumstances what could feemy do better than encourage this captain  i never blamed her for encouraging him only she should not have gone the length she has unless he downright proposed for her  but he has downright proposed for her  no father john said louey  has he though really exclaimed lyddy  then why in the name of the blessed virgin dont he marry her said the mother  thats poor feemys difficulty you see mrs mckeon now if any man you approved of were to make off with miss lyddys heartand im sure shell never give it to any one you dont approve ofwhy of course hed naturally come to you or her father and the matter would be settled but feemy has no mother for him to go to and her father you know cant mind such things now  but she has a brother in short if he meant to marry her it would soon be done where theres a will theres a way  but thats where it is you know young men and what they are a deal better than i do and you can understand that a young man may propose to a girl and be accepted and afterwards shilly shally about it and perhaps at last change his mind altogethermerely because the girls friends dont take care that the affair is regularly and properly carried on now isnt that so mrs mckeon  indeed father john its all true  well thats just feemys case may be after as you say having given the young man so much encouragement shell lose him because she has no mother to keep him steady as it were and fix him and no blame to her in the matter either is there mrs mckeon  why if you look at it in that way of course shes not so much to blame  of course not said father john obliged to be satisfied with this modicum of applause of course not but its a pity for the poor girl  you think hell jilt her altogether then  i dont think he means it yet but i think he will mean it soonunless indeed mrs mckeon youd befriend her now  me father john  if youd take a mothers part with her for a week or so it would all be right and i dont know a greater charity one christian could do another this side the grave than you could do her  what could i do father john said the good womanrather frightened for she would now be called on to take some active part in the matter which perhaps she might not altogether relishwhat could i do you see ballycloran is three miles out of this and i couldnt always be up there when ussher was coming and though i believe id be bold enough where one of my own girls was concerned id be shy of speaking to a man like captain ussher when it was no business of my own  as for that i believe youd never want wit or spirit either to say what youd wish to say to any man and that in the very best manner its true enough though you couldnt be always up at ballycloran but why couldnt feemy be down at drumsnafather john paused a minute and mrs mckeon said nothing but looked very gravenow be a good woman mrs mckeon and ask the poor girl down here for a fortnight or so i know lyddy and louey are very fond of their friend and feemyd be nice company for them and then as you are acquainted with captain ussher of course hed be coming after his sweetheart and then when feemy is under your protection of course youd speak to him in your own quiet ladylike way and then take my word for it id be marrying them in this very room before christmas wouldnt we have dancing up stairs eh miss loueymrs mckeon still said nothingand even supposing ussher did not come down here and nothing was done why it would be evident the match was not to take place and that ussher was a blackguard then of course feemy must give up all thoughts of him and though maybe shed grieve awhile it would be better so than going on as she is now up at the old place with no one to give her any advice or tell her what she ought to do or say to the man any way you see it would be doing her a kind service come mrs mckeon make up your mind to be a kind good neighbour to the poor girl and do you and the two young ladies go up to ballycloran and ask her to come down and spend a week or two with you here  but perhaps said louey feemy wont like to leave ballycloran and come so far from her beau because she couldnt see him here as she does there you know father john  why miss louey i dont think you know how she sees him i believe he goes and calls there much as youd like your beau to come and call here if you had one  indeed father john when i do have one i hope i shall manage better than to be talked about as much as she is any way i hardly think it would do to ask her at present mother you know mr gayner is to be here the night of the raceball and weve only the one bed  come come miss louey i didnt expect to hear you say a word against your old friend why should you be less goodnatured than your mother you see shes thinking how she can best do what im asking  as for old friends said louey i and miss macdermot were never so very intimate and as for being illnatured i never was told before that i was more illnatured than mother but of course mamma will do as she likes only she cant very well turn mr gayner out of the house after having asked him to come for the races thats all and miss louey flounced out of the room  come mrs mckeon continued father john think of the benefit this would be to feemy and you cant have any real objection the raceball is only for one night and the girls will be too tired after that to think very much of sleeping together  but you seem to forgetvery likely mr mckeon wouldnt like my asking her you know i couldnt think of doing it without asking him  oh mrs mckeon thats a good joke youll make me believe wont you that youre not as much mistress of your own house as any woman in ireland as if mr mckeon would interfere with your asking any one you pleased to your own house  but you see the girls are against it  i hope they are not against anything that would be charitable and kind in their mother but if they were im quite sure their mother shouldnt give way to them wouldnt you be glad to have miss feemy here a short time miss lyddy  indeed id have no objection if mamma pleases father john  there you see mrs mckeoni am afraid i said something rude which set miss loueys back up but i am sure in her heart shed be glad of anything that would be of service to feemy come mrs mckeon will you drive over to ballycloran this fine morning and ask her  but suppose she wont come  then it wont be your faultyou can tell her its just for the races and the ball youre asking herthat she may see mr mckeons horse win the race and dance with ussher at the ball afterwards oh if you mean her to come shell come fast enoughlet you alone for carrying your point when youre in earnest i know your way of asking when you dont mean to take a refusaland to give you your due this day i never heard you give an invitation you didnt mean to be accepted  well father john as you think it will be of so much service to feemy and as as you say she has no mother poor girl of her own and no female friend that she can look to ill ask her over here but it mustnt be for a week or a fortnight but till the affair of captain ussher is finally settled and if the girl behaves herself as she ought when once she is here tony wont see her wronged by any man  thats my own friend said father john with tears in his eyes what could any poor priest like me do in a parish if it wasnt that there were such women as yourself to help him  but father johnwhisper here and she took him aside into the window and spoke in a low voice you cant have helped hearing the stories people have been talking about feemy as i have heard them of course you must  heard them of course i havebut you know what lies get talked abroad  but they say she walks with him after dark and goes in and out there at ballycloran at all hours just as she pleases of course i can have none of those doings here  of course not it is because she has no one there to tell her what is right or wrong that i wish her to be here of course you have regular hours here and youll find youll have no difficulty with her that way  well father john ive only one more thing to say and youll answer me that as a priest and a christian god knows i wouldnt believe any illnatured story against any poor girl situated as feemy is but you know such things will get aboutpeople say ussher speaks of her as his mistress instead of as his wife now father john if this unfortunate girl whom im ready and willing to help has done anything really wrong you would not be the means of bringing her into the house with my own dear girls have you father john told me all you know about her attachment to this man  indeed then if she was unfit to associate with your girls mrs mckeon id be the last man on earth to ask you to invite her here if feemy has been imprudent in going out too much alone with ussher its the most that with truth can be said against her and as you ask me to tell you all ill tell you one thing i didnt wish to mention before the girls and father john told her how thady had got drunk and insulted ussher telling him not to come to ballycloran again and all that but he did not tell her how strongly he suspected that thady was right in his fears for his sister and that his chief object in getting feemy away from ballycloran was to remove her as far as possible from usshers influence  well father john ill go to ballycloran and ask her here i suppose shell hardly be ready to come today but if she pleases ill drive over again for her after tomorrow ill go now and talk louey over for you and she seem to have quarrelled somehow  and god bless you mrs mckeon its yourself is a good woman and you never did a kinder action than the one youre going to do this morning and father john took his leave  the breakfast party at ballycloran the morning after the wedding was not a very lively one indeed the meals at ballycloran seldom were very gay but this was more than usually sombre  larry was brooding over keegans threats his fears that thady meant to betray him into the attorneys hands and his determination never from that day forth to stir from his fireside lest the horrid myrmidons of the law should pounce upon him  feemy was intent on the insults which had been offered to her lover and her temper was somewhat soured by the remembrance that she had not effected her purpose of questioning ussher about his intentions thady however was the blackest looking of the family everything was dark within his breast he thought of the ruffians with whom he had leagued himself and though previously he had only considered them as poor hard used somewhat lawless characters they now appeared to him everything that was iniquitous and bad secret murder was their objectblack foul midnight murderand he was sworn or soon would be sworn not only to help them but to lead them on what he had already done might hang him he felt his life to be in the power of each of those blackguards with whom in wretched equality he had been drinking on the previous evening and what had led him to this if he had been wronged and injured why could not he redress himself like other injured men if revenge were necessary to him why could he not avenge himself like a man instead of leaguing with others to commit murder in the dark like a coward and a felon and then he thought of his position with keegan and ussher there was something manly in his original disposition he would have given anything for a stand up fight with the attorney with equal weapons if it had been sure death to both he would have fought him to the death but he had no such opportunity the dastardly brute had trampled on him when he could not turn against him and then with rancorous hatred he thought of the blow that keegan had struck himof the manner in which he had insulted his father and worse than all of the name he had applied to his sister and remembering all this he almost reconciled himself to the only means he had of punishing the wretch that had inflicted all these injuries on him then he thought of ussher and the scene which had passed between them last night he knew he had been drunk and had but a very confused recollection of what he had done or said he remembered however that he had insulted ussher this did not annoy him but he had a faint recollection of having committed his sisters name by talking of her in his drunken brawl and of having done or said something he knew not what to father john  though thady had never known the refinements of a gentleman or the comforts of good society still he felt that the fall even from his present station to that in which he was going to place himself would be dreadful but it was not the privations which he might suffer but the disgrace the additional disgrace which he would bring on his family which afflicted him how could he now presume to prescribe to feemy what her conduct should be or to his father in what way he should act respecting the property he already felt as though he was unworthy of either of them and was afraid to look them in the face after breakfast he wandered forth striving to attend to his usual work but the incentives to industry were all gone he had no longer any hope that industry would be of service to him he walked along the hedges and ditches unconsciously planning in his mind the different ways of committing the crimes which he really so abhorred but in which he was about to pledge himself to join he thought if it should be his lot to murder keegan how he would accomplish it should it be at nightor in the daywould he shoot himand if he did would not the powder or the gun be traced home to himwould not his footsteps in the bog be tracked and knownif he struck him down on the road would not the blood be found on his coat or his shirt be torn in the struggleand above all would not his own comrades betray him he had some short time since heard the whole of a trial for murder at carrick assizes and though he had not then paid particular attention to it all the horrid detail and circumstances of the case now came vividly before his minds eye he planned and plotted how had he in that case been the murderer he would have foreseen and provided against the different things the untoward accidents which then came in evidence against the prisoner he thought how much more wary he would be than the poor wretch who was then tried and of what benefit the experience he had gained would be to him then he remembered that the principal witness in the case was an illfeatured sullenlooking fellow who had been called kings evidenceone who in answering the tormenting questions put to him had appeared almost more miserable than the prisoner himselfthat this man had been the friend and assistant of the murdererthe sharer and promoter of all his plansthe man who had led him on to the murderhis sworn friend he remembered how it had come out on the trial that the two had for months shared the same bedtilled in the same fieldeat from the same messand had sinned together in the same great sin yet this man had come forward to hang his friendand thady shuddered coldly as he thought how likely it might be that his associates would betray him he had not slept eat and worked with themhe was not leagued to them by equal rank equal wants and equal sufferings if that wretched witness had been induced to give evidence against the man so strongly bound to him how much more likely that byrne or reynolds should hang him or pat brady and as bradys name occurred to him he remembered usshers caution respecting that man and his assurance that he was in keegans pay if this were true he had already committed the oversight to guard against which he had calculated that his superior cunning would be sufficient and then the cold perspiration trickled from his brow and he abruptly stopped leaning against a bank to meditate again on the position in which he stood  it was not that during this time thady had been absolutely planning murder he had not been making any definite scheme to be carried into immediate execution against any individual he was not a murderer even in mind or wish he would have given anything to have driven the idea from his mind but he could not he could not avoid thinking what he would do if he had resolved to do the deedhow the crime would be most safely perpetratedhow the laws most cunningly evaded then he half resolved to have nothing more to do with reynolds and his followers and to quiet his conscience while yet he possibly could but the insolence of keegan the injuries of ussher and the sure enmity of those whom he had sworn to join and now scarcely dared to desert stifled his remorse and destroyed the resolution before it was half made he thought of enlistingbut he could not desert his sister of going to father john and confessing all but would father john befriend him after his late conduct to him thus he wandered on through the whole long morning twice he returned to the house and creeping in through the back door got himself a glass of spirits which he swallowed and again sallied forth to find if movement would give him comfort or his thoughts suggest anything to him in mitigation of his sorrows  as he was returning the third time for the same bad purposefor the short stimulus of the dram was the only relief he could find to the depression which seemed to weigh him down and make his heart feel like a cold lump within himand just as he was turning from the avenue to the back of the house he met ussher walking down he did not know what to do he remembered that the evening before he had defied this man he even recollected that he had arrogantly declared that he should not again set his foot on ballycloran he had forbad him the house as if he had been the master and at the present moment he felt as though he did not dare address him for it seemed to him as if every one now would look down on him as he looked down on himselfas if every one could see what was in his breast as plainly as he saw it himself  this annoyance however was of short duration for ussher passed him with a slight unembarrassed nod as if nothing had passed between them on the previous eveningas if they were still good friends and had met and been talking together but a short time before ussher had walked by quickly and there was a look of satisfaction or rather gratified vanity in his face he seemed also absorbed with the subject of his thoughts thady however as soon as he had passed took but little notice of him but walked on into the kitchen at the rear of the house  here on a small settle by the fireside where he had been placed out of the way by biddy or katty sat a ragged barelegged little boy known as patsy the priests gossoon he was the only assistant judy had in the management of father johns ménage he ran on errands to drumsna and occasionally to carrickonshannonfetched the priests lettersdug his potatoesplanted his cabbages and cleaned his horse paul he had now come up to ballycloran with a message to thady and having been desired to stay there till he could see him himself he had been quietly sitting in the kitchen since a little after thady had first left the house he now jumped up to give his message  misther thady yer honer father john says as how hell be glad av yer honerll come down to dinner with him at six and he says as how you must come mr thady because divil a bit hell ate himself he says till youre in it  for shame patsy interposed biddy putting those words into his riverences mouth im sure thin father john wasnt cursing that way  faix thin maam thim wor his very wordstell mr thady av he dont come down to the cottage to his dinner this day divil a bit will i ate till he does  well to hear the brat continued biddy shocked at the indecorous language which was put into her priests mouth  and whos to be at father johns else said thady  sorrow a one av me rightly knows thin for i wasnt hearing all i wor told wor i warnt to come out of this widout yer honer  but i cant go tonight patsy  but father john says you must mr thady  tell father john patsy that i am very much obliged to him but that im not just well enough to come out tonight i couldnt go tonight do you hear go down and tell him so or hell be waiting dinner  but mr thady said the boy half sobbing father john said as how i warnt to come at all widout you  do as i tell you you fool but mind you tell father john im very much obliged to him only im ill  well muttered the boy at length taking his departure i know father john ll be very mad but any way it aint my fault  thady was gratified with the priests invitation for it showed that he at least had forgiven him but he did not dare to face him by accepting it  he got himself another glass of whiskey and lighting his pipe sat down to smoke by the kitchen fire after he had been some time sitting there pat brady came into the kitchen thady however took no notice except muttering something in answer to pats usual salutation they remained both some time silent till at last brady observed that theyd all of them had ilegant divarsion last nightmost of them stayed a power later nor you mr thady  this allusion to last night was not at present the subject most likely to make thady talk freely so he still continued silent at last pat said  could i spake to you a moment mr thady  spake outwhat is it  oh its business yer honer its something about moneywouldnt you step out to the rintoffice  dont you see im just going to dinner besides i aint wellitll keep till tomorrow i suppose  but it wont keep mr thady  at this moment biddy who had been taking some smoking viands out of a big black pot and transferring them to a dish went out of the kitchen with them on her road to the diningroom and pat took the opportunity of whispering to his master that the boys wor to meet at mulreadys on the next evening  what of that answered thady i suppose some of them meet there mostly every night  but tomorrows the night mr thady when yer honers to be inisheated among us sworn brothers  i shant be in it at all tomorrow then  not be in it why you promised and the boys is all noticed now didnt you take the oath mr thady and he whispered down close to his ear  i took no oath about any day i suppose i neednt come before i choose  biddy now returned and thady got up to go to his dinner pat followed him and renewed the conversation in the passage thady however would give no definite promise to come tomorrow or the next day but said he meant to come some day pat observed that the boys would be furiousthat they would think themselves deceived and betrayedthen urged the necessity of taking steps to prevent their paying the rent to keeganhinted that ussher had been with miss feemy that morningand at last departed when he found that his master was not in a proper mood to be persuaded remarking that he would come up again in the morning when perhaps his honer would be thinking better of it and not break his promised word to the boys as there would be a great ruction among them av he didnt go down jist to spake a word to them afther what had passed besides mr thady he added av you wor to go back now some of thim boys as wor in it last night would be going to jonas browns thinking to get the first word agin youthinking you know as how you would peach agin thim may be  after this threat pat took his leave and thady with a sad heart and low spirits which even three glasses of whiskey had not raised went in to dinner after swallowing a few hasty morsels without speaking either to his father or his sister he returned to the kitchen and again sat there smoking till one of the girls came in telling him that father john was on the steps of the halldoor waiting for himthat he couldnt come in but that he said he had important business to speak of and must see mr thady  confound you muttered thady in a low voice why didnt you say i was out  shure you niver told me mr thady  thady considered a moment whether he should escape through the back door at last however he plucked up his courage and went out to meet the priest     chapter xvi  promotion   as soon as father john had gone mrs mckeon prepared to persuade her refractory daughter to agree to the propriety of what she was going to do with respect to feemy and to inform her husband of the visitor she intended to ask to her house she had not much difficulty with either for though louey was indignant when father john hinted at her want of a beau she was not really illnatured and when her mother told her that father john had said that this invitation would be the performance of a christian duty she soon reconciled herself to the prospect of feemys company in spite of mr gayner and his bed and as for mr mckeon he seldom interfered with the internal management of his house and when his spouse informed him that feemy was coming to drumsna he merely remarked that no wonder the poor girl was dull at that old ramshackle place up there and that though drumsna was dull enough itself it was a little better than ballycloran especially now the carrick races were coming on and so the three ladies put on their best bonnets and set off on their journey of charity  feemy was in her own sittingroom and was somewhat more neat in her appearance than the last time we saw her there for ussher had said he would call early in the morning but she was employed in the same manner as thensitting over the fire with a novel in her hand when she heard the sound of the car wheels and on going to the window saw mrs mckeon and her daughters  that lady managed her business with all the tact and sincerity for which father john had given her credit she made no particular allusion to ussher but merely said that they should have a party to the racecourse as mr mckeon had a horse to run and that afterwards they should all go to the ball at carrick and mrs mckeon added you know feemy youll meet your old friend captain ussher there  she then assured feemy how glad she would be if she would stay a short time at drumsna after the races were over as her two daughters were now at home and that if she would she would try to make the house as pleasant as possible for her  this was all said and done so pleasantly that feemy did not detect any other motive in her friends civility than the one which was apparent and after a little pressing agreed to accept the invitation it was agreed that mrs mckeon was to call for her on the monday following when if her father made no objection she would accompany her home to drumsna  as soon as they were gone feemy made her father understand who had been there and obtained his consent to her proposed visit which he gave saying at the time god knows my dear whether youll ever come back for your brothers determined to part with the owld place if he can in spite of all your poor father can say to the contrary  she then returned to her room resuming her novel and waiting with what patience she could for usshers coming about two oclock he made his appearance and she was beginning gently to upbraid him for being so late when he stopped her by saying  well feemy i have strange news for you this morning  strange news myles what is it i hope its good news  ussher had not quite his usual confidence and ease about him he seemed as if he had something to say which he almost feared to disclose at once and he did not give feemy a direct answer  why as to that it is and it isnt i suppose its good news to meat least i ought to think so but i dont know what youll think of it  poor feemys face fell and she sat down on the chair from which she had risen as if she had not strength to stand myles stood still with his back to the fire trying to look as if he were not disconcerted  well myles what is it wont you tell me and then when he smiled she said why did you try and frighten me  frighten you why you frightened yourself  but what is it myles and she walked up to him and put her two hands on his shoulders and looked up in his facewhat is your strange news  in the first place i am promoted to the next rank im in the highest now next to a county inspector  oh myles im so glad but you couldnt but know that would be good news to mebut what else  why theyve sent me a letter from dublin with a lot of blarney about praiseworthy energy and activity and all that  thats why theyve promoted you but you dont tell me all  no thats not all then they say they think theres reason why id better not stay in this immediate neighbourhood  ah i thought so exclaimed the poor girl youre to go away out of this  and they say im to commence in the new rank at cashel in county tipperary  feemy for a time remained quiet she was endeavouring to realize to herself the idea that her lover was going away and then trying in her mind to comprehend whether it must follow naturally as a consequence from this that he was going away from her as well as from ballycloran ussher still stood up by the fireplace with the same smile on his face what he had told feemy was all true he had unexpectedly received an official letter that morning from the dublin office complimenting him on his services informing him that he was to be moved to a higher grade and that on his promotion he was to leave mohill and take charge of the men stationed at cashel all this in itself was very agreeable promotion and increased pay were of course desirable mohill was by no means a residence which it would cause such a man as ussher much regret to leave and though he had made up his mind not to fear any injury from those among whom he was situated he could not but feel that he should be more assured of safety at any other place than that at which he now resided all this was so far gratifying but still he was perplexed to think what he should do about feemy it was true he could leave her and let her if she chose break her heart or he might promise to come back and marry her when he was settled with the intention of taking no further notice of her after he had left the placeand so let her break her heart that way but he was too fond of her for this he could not decide what he would do and when he came up to see her at the present time the only conclusion to which he could bring himself with certainty was thisthat nothing should induce him to marry her but still he did not like to leave her  he was however rather perplexed to know what to say to her and therefore preferred waiting to see what turn she herself would give to the conversation at length feemy said  and when do you leave this  oh theyve given me a months leave of absence im to be in cashel in a month  even this seemed a reprieve to feemy who at first thought that he would have to start immediatelyperhaps that evening a good deal might be done in a month now however she regretted that she had promised to go to mrs mkeons  then myles youll not leave this for a month  i dont know about that that depends on circumstances ive to run up to dublin and a deal to do  but when do you mean to be out of this  why i tell you i havent settled yetperhaps immediately after the races  again they were silent for some time feemy longed for ussher to say something that might sound at any rate kind he had never met her before without an affectionate wordand now on the eve of his departure he stood at the fire and merely answered her questions coldly and harshly at length she felt that this must be the time if ever for saying to him what she had made up her mind to say on the previous evening when her courage failed her so plucking up all the heart she could and blushing at the time to the top of her forehead she said  ant i to go with you myles when you go  ussher still remained silent he did not know how to answer to this question come myles speak to me i know you came down to tell me your plans what am i to do you know you must settle now if youre going so soon what are your plans  why feemy its not two hours or more since ive received the letter of course i couldnt think of everything at once tell me what do you think best yourself  me what do i thinkyou know id do anything you bid me wont you step in and tell father about it  oh you can tell him i couldnt make him understand it at all hes so foolish  feemy bore the slur on her father without indignation  but myles if you go so soon am i to go with you and when after a few minutes he did not answerspeak myles ant we to be married before you go when she said this she sat down on the old sofa looking up into his face as if she would read there what was passing in his mind that which was passing in his mind must be the arbitrament of her fate  why feemy how can you be so foolishhow can we be married in eight days time i must go i tell you in eight days from this  but you wont go to this new place then youll be back here wont you before you go to cashel  how can i be back againno i could not be back again then besides feemy i wouldnt be married in this place after what your brother and father john said to me last night if we are to be married at all it cant be here  if we are to be married exclaimed feemy rising upif we are why myles what do you mean and rushing to him she threw her arms round his neck and hiding her face on his bosom she continued oh myles you dont mean to desert me mylesdear mylesmy own mylesdont you love meyou wont leave me nowsay you wont leave me and she sobbed and cried as though her heart was breaking  ussher put his arm round her waist and kissed her he seated her on the sofasat down by herand tried to comfort her by caresses but he still said nothing  why dont you speak myles i shall die if you dont speak only tell me what you mean to do ill do anything you bid me if youll only say you dont mean to desert me  desert you feemy who spoke of deserting you dearest  then you wont leave me my own myles you wont leave me here with those i hate i love no onei care for no one but you only say you wont leave me here when youre gone and again she clung to him as though she could have detained him there for ever by holding him  but feemy what can i doyou see ive told you after what passed i couldnt be married here  why not miles why notnever mind what thady saidor father john what does it signifyyoull be soon away from them ill never treat you that way my own mylesid put up with more than that for youi wouldnt mind what the world might say to meid bear anything for you  i tell you feemy there are reasons why i couldnt be married before i get to cashel thereto tell you the whole they wouldnt let a man take his rise from one rank to another if hes married they cant prevent the officers in the force marrying but they dont like it and its a rule that they wont promote a married man you see i couldnt marry till after i was settled at cashel  feemy received the lie with which usshers brain had at the moment furnished him without a doubt she believed it all and then went on  but when youve got your rank youll come back myles wont you  why thats the difficultyi couldnt well again get leave of absence  then myles what will you do  and by degrees he proposed to her to leave her home and her friends and trust herself to him and go off with him unmarried without her fathers blessing or the prieststo go with him in a manner which she knew would disgrace herself her name and her family and to trust to him afterwards to give her what reparation a tardy marriage could afford she poor girl at first received the offer with sobs and tears she proposed a clandestine marriage but he swore that when afterwards detected it would cause his dismissalthen that she would come to him at cashel when he was settled but nohe told her other lies equally false to prove that this could not be done she prayed and begged and lay upon his bosom imploring him to spare her this utter degradation but now that the proposal had been fairly made that he had got her to discuss the plan his usual sternness returned and at last he told her somewhat roughly that if she would not come with him in the manner he proposed he would leave her now and for ever  poor feemy fell with her knees on the ground and her face on the sofa and there she lay sobbing for many minutes while he again stood silent with his back against the fireplace during this time old feelings principles religious scruples the love of honour and fair fame and the fear of the worlds harsh word were sorely fighting in her bosom they were striving to enable her to conquer the strong love she felt for ussher and make her reject the disgrace to which he was alluring her then he stooped to lift her up and as he kissed the tears from her face passion prevailed and she whispered in his ear that she would go  he stayed there for a considerable time after that at first feemy was so agitated and so miserable that she was unable to converse with him or listen to his plans for her removal she sat there sobbing and crying and all he could sayall his protestations of loveall his declarations that it was his firm intention to marry her at cashelall his promises of kind and good treatment were unable to console her he tried to animate her by describing to her the pleasure she would have in seeing dublinthe delight it would be to her to leave so dull a place as ballycloran and see something of the world from which she had hitherto been excluded but for a long time it was in vain she was thinkingthough she rarely thought of themof her father and her brother of what the old man would feel when she his only joy had gone from him in such a manner of what thady would do and say when he found that the suspicions which she knew he already entertained were too true she could not bring her heart to give up ussher but the struggles within her breast at length made her hysterical and ussher was greatly frightened lest he should have to call in assistance to bring her to herself she did not however lose her senses and after a time she became more tranquil and was able to listen to his plans she first of all told him that she had promised mrs mckeon to go to her house for a short time during the races and suggested that she should now send some excuse for declining the visit but this he negatived he desired her to go thereto go to the races and the balland above all to keep up her spirits and at any rate seem to enjoy herself there as if nothing particular had happened this she promised to do but with a voice and face which gave but little sign of her being able to keep her promise  he told her that he would occasionally call at mrs mckeons so that no remark might be made about his not coming to see her he desired her to tell no one that he was going permanently to leave the country and that he should not himself let it be known at mohill till the day or so before he went and he added that even when it was known that he was going there would be less suspicion arising respecting her if she was at drumsna than if she remained at ballycloran  to all this she quietly submitted he was to meet her at the ball at carrickonshannon and then tell her what his definite plan of carrying her off would be but he added that the ball night would be the last she would spend in the country for that they would leave the next evening  about five oclock ussher took his leave she begged of him to come and see her the next dayevery day till they went but this he refused she said that unless she saw him every day to comfort her she would not be able to keep up her strengththat she was sure she would fall ill it was now friday and she was to go to mrs mckeons on monday on tuesday he said he would call on her there the races and ball were to be on the tuesday week in vain she asked him how she was to bear the long days till she saw him again ussher had no true sympathy for such feelings as were racking feemys heart and brain he merely bid her keep up her spirits and not be foolishthat he would see her on tuesday and that after tuesday week she would have nothing more to make her unhappy and then kissing her he went awayand as we have seen thady met him in the avenue so satisfied in appearance so contented so triumphant that he was able to forget the words which had been applied to him on the previous evening and to nod to feemys brother with as pleasant an air as though there were no grounds for illfeeling between them  poor feemy those vain words that after tuesday week she would have nothing more to make her unhappy sounded strangely in her ears nothing more to make her unhappy could she have anything more then or ever to make her happy could she ever be happy again all that had happened during the last few days passed through her mind and added to her torment how indignant had she been when her brother had hinted to her that ussher did not intend honestly by her into what a passion had she flown with father john when he had cautioned her that she should be circumspect in her conduct with her lover what an insult she had felt it when mary brady alluded to the chance of usshers deserting her and now so soon after all thisbut a few hours after this strong feelingafter the indignation she had then shown she had herself submitted to worse than they had even dared to suspect she had herself agreed to leave her fathers house as the mistress of the man of whom she had then confidently boasted as her future husband and it was not only for her own degradation dreadful as that was that she grieved but ussher himselfhe of whom she had felt so fondwhom she had so lovedwas this his truth his lovewas this the protection he had sworn to give her against her fathers folly and her brothers violenceand as he had basely added against father johns bigotry was this the protectionroughly to swear hed leave her desert her for ever unless she agreed to give up her family her home her principles and follow him a base low creature without a name and was it likely that after she had agreed to thisafter she had so debased herself that he who had already deceived her so grossly would at last keep his word by marrying her  she was lying down with her face buried in her hands tormenting herself with such thoughts when biddy came to tell her that dinner was on the table feemy did not dare to refuse to go in lest something should be suspected so she rubbed her red eyes till they were still redder and went into the parlour where she alleged that she had a racking headache which would give her no peace and having sat there for a miserable half hour till her father and thady had finished their dinner she went up stairs to her bedroom and after laying awake half the night at last succeeded in crying herself to sleep  when thady came from the kitchen on being told that father john was waiting for him at the halldoor he left his pipe behind him swallowed a draught of water to take off the smell of the spirits and prepared to listen to the priests lecture as he expected with sullenness and patience but he was surprised out of his determined demeanour by the kindness of the priests address he came forward and taking his hand said  what thady are you ill what ails you  not much then father john only a headache  are you too bad my boy to take a turn with me ive a word or two i want to say but if youre really sick thady and are going to bed ill come down early tomorrow morning would you sooner i did so  father john said this because he thought that thady really looked ill and so he did his face was yellow his hair unbrushed his eyes sunken and the expression of his countenance sad and painful but he was overcome by the kindness of the priests manner and replied  oh no im not going to bed i believe father john i did not come up to you because i was ashamed to see you afther last night  so i thought my boy and thats why i came down im not sorry for your shame though there was not much cause for it if it was a usual thing with you to be drinking too much you wouldnt be thinking so much of it yourself the next day  but i believe i said something to yourself father john  something to me egad i forget what you said to me or whether you said anything oh no you werent so bad as that but you were going to eat ussher about something but never mind that now dont get tipsy again if you can help it and thats all about it its not the drinking im come to talk to you about for youre no drunkard thady and indeed its not as your priest i want to talk to you at all but as one friend to another and now my dear boy will you take what ive to say in good part  these gentle words were the first comfort that had reached thadys heart that day and tears were in his eyes as he answered  indeed i will father john for youre the only friend i have now  it was a fine moonlight evening and they were on the road leading to the cottage  walk up this way thady well be less likely to be interrupted in the little parlour than here and they walked on to the priests house father john discoursing the while on the brightness of the moon and the beauty of the night and thady alternately thinking with pleasure of his kindness and with dread of the questions he was about to be called upon to answer  when they were in the parlour and thady had refused his hosts offers of punch tea or supper and the door was close shut father john at once struck into the subject at his heart  i told you thady that i thought but little of your having been drinking yesterday evening not but that i think it very foolish for a man to make himself a beast but what i did think of was the company you were drinking in now i heardand i know you wont contradict me unless its untruethat the party consisted of you and brady and joe reynolds and byrne and corney dolan and one or two others from drumleesh your own or your fathers tenants and the very lowest of themall of them infamous charactersmen never or seldom seen at massmakers of potheenfellows who are known to be meeting nightly at that house of mrs mulready at mohill and who are strongly suspected to be ribbonmen or terryalts or to call themselves by some infernal name and sect by belonging to which they have all become liable to death or transportation  the priest paused but thady sat quite still listening with his eyes fixed on the fender  now thady if this is so what could you gain by mixing with them you werent drunk when you went among them or i should think nothing about itfor a drunken man doesnt know what he does and it wasnt from chancefor a man never seeks society so much beneath himself from chance and it wasnt from habitfor i know your habits well enough and thats not one of them but i fear you were there by agreement if so what could you get by a secret meeting with such men as those you know their characters and vices are you fool enough to think that you will find comfort in their society or assistance in their advice  i didnt think so father john  then why were you with them i know the most of your sorrows thady and the most of your cares and i also know and appreciate the courage with which you have tried to bear them and if you would make me your friend your assistant and your counsellor though i mightnt do much for you i think i could do more or show you how to do more than you are likely to learn from the men you were with yesterday and at any rate i shall not lead you into the danger which will beset you if you listen to them and which you may be sure would soon end in your disgrace and destruction can you tell me thady why you were with them or they were with you  i was only just talking to them about thady began but he felt that he was going to tell his friend a falsehood and again held his tongue  if youll not tell me why you were there ill tell you at least ill tell you what my fears are you went to them to talk over your fathers affairs respecting keegan and flannelly you went to induce those poor misguided men not to pay their rent to him and oh thady if what ive heard is true you went there to consult with them respecting a greater crime than ill now name and to instigate them to do that which would lead to their and your eternal shame and punishment  thady now shook in his chair as though he could hardly keep his seat he felt the perspiration stand upon his brow and he wiped it off with his sleeve he did not dare to deny that he had done this of which father john was accusing him though he felt that he had been far from instigating them to any crime like murder father john continued  if you have joined these menif you have bound yourself to these men by any oathif there is any league between you and them let me implore you to disregard it nothing can be binding that is only to bind you to greater wickedness i do not ask you to tell me any of their secrets or plans though god knows what you tell me now would be as sacred as if i heard it in the confessional but if you have such secrets if you know their signs whatever may be the consequence at once renounce them  i know no secrets or signs father john and i dont belong to any society  then if you dont you can have nothing to bind you is it true that you were rash enough mad enough to speak to these men about murdering keegan tell me have you a plan made to murder keegan have you had such a crime in your thoughts  it had been in his thoughts all day what answer should he make should he lie and deny it all or should he confess it all just as it was  if youll not tell me i must for mr keegans sake take some step to secure his safety come thady come you know its not by threats i wish to guide you you know i love you i know well enough your patient industryyour want of selfishness i know if you have for a moment thought of this crime you have now repented it tell me how far you have gone and if you are in dangerif you have done that which was very very wicked i will still try and screen you from the effects of a sin which i am sure was not premeditated is there any plot to murder keegan  there is not  as you are a living man theres none  there is not  what were you saying about keegan then to those men yesterday  i dont know what i saidi dont know i said anything they were threatening him if he came on drumleesh for rent if they have a plot i dont know it  but thady are you to join them again do you mean again to renew your revellings of last night have you agreed to see them again  i have  and where  at mulreadys in mohill  and when  they sent today to say it was tomorrow night but i have refused to go  you have refused  yes father john i got the message from them just before dinner and i said id not go tomorrow  but have you said youd never join them again have you sent to them to say youd never put your foot in that hole of sin did you say you were mad when you promised it and that you would never keep that promise did you say thady that you would not come or are you still in their opinion one of their accursed set  ill niver go there father john ive not had one moments ase since i said i would its been on my heart like lead all the morning indeed indeed father john ill niver go there  i will not doubt you thady but still that you may feel how solemnly you are bound not to peril your life and soul by joining them who can only wish to lead you into crime give me your honour on the sacred word of god that you will never go to that placeor join those men in any lawless plans or secret meetings  and thady swore most solemnly on the sacred volume that he would do as the priest directed him respecting these men  father john then gradually drew from him in conversation what had really taken place he told him what he had heard from mcgoveryhow he had quieted that man and cullenand advised him by his own demeanour to his tenants to pass over what had been said as though it had been a drunken frolic he asked him however whether he considered that mr keegan or ussher were in any real danger and thady assured him that he did not think they werethat there was no plot laidthat the men were angry and violent but that unless further instigated he did not think they would commit any act of absolute violence these opinions were not given spontaneously but in answer to various questions from the priest who at last satisfied himself that in confirming the horror with which thady evidently regarded what he had already done and in preventing him from following any further the course he was about to pursue he had done all that was possible in the case to prevent crime  whether he thought that either of those who had been named as the object of hatred to these unruly men might ultimately fall a victim to the feeling to which their actions had given rise in the country is another question if he did he could not prevent itnor was it his especial business to attend to it but he felt tolerably sure that to whatever bad feelings hardships and cruelty might have given rise in thadys breast he would not now gratify them by such atrocious means as those which mcgoverys statement had induced him to apprehend  under this impression he bade him good night with another kind shake of the hand telling him that though at present there might be much to sadden and distress him if he confronted his difficulties with manly courage and honest purposes he would be sure sooner or later to overcome them  thady returned home more comfortable than he had been in the morning but he could not bring himself to that state of mind in which father john had hoped to dismiss him he felt that though he was determined not to go to mrs mulreadys the affair could not rest there he felt himself to be in some horrible manner in the power of brady and joe reynoldsas though he could not escape from them a general despondency respecting all his prospects weighed him down and when he reached ballycloran he was nearly as unhappy as he had been in leaving it     chapter xvii  sport in the west   carrickonshannon the assize town of county leitrim though an assize town is a very poor place it consists of one long narrow irregular street lying along the shannon in which slated houses and thatched cabins delightfully relieve each other and prevent the eye from being annoyed with sameness or monotony the houses are mostly all shops and even the cabins profess to afford lodging and entherthainment so that it is to be presumed that the poverty of the place is attributable to circumstances and misfortune and not to the idleness of the inhabitants the prevailing feeling however arising in any human mind on entering the place would be that of compassion for the judges barristers attorneys crown clerks grand jury long panel witnesses c who have to be crammed into this little place and lodged and fed for five or six days twice a year during the assizes  there is however a tolerably good hotel in the place and we at present beg to take our reader with us into the largest room therein which was usually dignified by the name of the ball room it was not however by any means dedicated solely to the worship of terpsichore all the public dinners eaten in carrick were eaten here all the public meetings held in carrick were held here all the public speeches were spoken here here committees harangued gallagher ventriloquised itinerant actors acted itinerant concertgivers held their concerts itinerant lancashire bellringers rang their bells here also were carried on the mysteries of the carrickonshannon masonic lodge with all due zeal and secrecy  on the present occasion the room was or rather had been devoted to the purpose of feeding an ordinary had been held here previous to the races and most of those who were in any way interested in the coming event were there the cloth had been just taken away decanters of whiskey and jugs of boiling water alternated each other down the table and large basins of white sugar were scattered about unsparingly the party were evidently about to enjoy themselves there were about thirty of them there some of them owners of horses some of them riders some of them backers the rest were eaters drinkers and spectators  the chair was filled by major mcdonnell one of the stewardsa little man who had probably never crossed a horse himself and had nothing of the sportsman about him he had however lately inherited an estate in the neighbourhood and having some idea of standing for the county on the tory interest at the next election was desirous of obtaining popularity and had consequently given forty pounds to be run forhad agreed to wear a red coat at the races and call himself a stewardsit at the top of the table and carve for thirty hungry sportsmen today with each of whom he had to drink wineand get partners for all the ugly girls if there be any in county leitrim on the morrow this was certainly hard work in reward for which he was probably destined to have his head broken at the next election if he should have sufficient courage to show himself as a tory candidate for the county  there however he sat on this day very unfit to take the chief part among the spirits by whom he was surrounded  opposite to him at the other end of the room sat our big and burly friend mckeon a very different character whenever six or eight were talking aloud together his voice might always be heard the loudest whenever a shout of laughter aroseand that was incessantlyhis shout was always the longest it seemed that every bet that was offered was taken by him and that every bet taken by any one else had been offered by him he was always scribbling something in that wellworn book of his and yet he never had his hand away from his tumblerexcept when it was on the decanter all the waiters came to him for orders and he seemed perfectly competent to attend to them if any man finished his punch and did not fill again mckeon reminded him of his dutyand that not only by preaching but by continual practice in fact he was just in his element and enjoying himself  there was an empty chair next mr mckeon where his friend mr gayner had been sittingi wont say during his dinner for he had not swallowed a mouthful he was now standing up against the fireplace sucking a lemon he had a large great coat on buttoned up to the neck and a huge choker round his throat he was mckeons jockey and was to ride playful for the forty pounds on the morrow  bob gayner as he was usually called was one of the best gentlemen riders in the country he came from county roscommonthe county by the by which can probably boast the best riders in irelandwhere he had a small property of his own near athlone but the chief part of his time was spent in riding races and training for them he had been at it all his lifeand certainly if there be any merit in the perfection of such an art bob was entitled to it for he rode beautifully it was not only that he could put his horse at a fence without fear and sit him whilst he was going over itany man with practice could do that but bob had a sympathy with the animal he was riding which enabled him not only to know what he could do himself but also what the horse could do he knew exactly where a horse wanted assistance from his rider and he had another knack too not unfrequently made use of in steeplechasesbob seldom let his own horse baulk but he very generally made those that others were riding do so and then at a finish how admirable was bob in leap races the finish is seldom so near a thing as in flat races but when it did come to be neck and neck at the post there was no man in ireland could give a horse a stretch and land him in a winner like bob he had also an exquisite genius for tumbling horses will occasionally fall and when they do riders must follow them but no one fell so safely recovered so actively and was again so instantly in the saddle as our friend and consequently wherever there was a steeplechase to be run where pluck science and practice were wanting there bob was in requisition and there he usually was found it was a great thing to secure his services and knowing this tony mckeon had in his own way long since made gayner his fast friend how i cannot say for bob was much above being bought and though no doubt he made money by his races he would have thought little of shooting any one who was bold enough to offer to pay him for riding when in his cap jacket boots and breeches he would if he thought occasion required or his interests demanded it wrangle like a devil though its back were turned to him he could see a horse go on the wrong side of a post and woe betide the man who came to the scales as a winner an ounce below the weight bob from long practice knew all these dodges and he made the most of them but when once his cap was off and his coat was on he was a quiet easy unassuming fellowliked and petted by all he knew for he never spoke little of others nor bragged of himself  he was now talking to another member of the same confraternity but of a very different character he also had been sitting dinnerlessfor both these gentlemen in the pursuit of their amusement were obliged to starve and sweat themselves down to a certain standard about twenty pounds below their ordinary weightand he was now also sucking a lemon george brown was the second son of jonas brown of brown hall the magistrate by whom tim reynolds and the others had been committed to ballinamore and like his father was most unpopular in his own country he was arrogant overbearing conceited and passionatewithout any rank which could excuse pride or any acquirement that could justify conceit it is however as a gentleman jockey that we are at present to make his acquaintance and in that capacity he was about as much inferior to the grooms by whom the horses were trained as bob was superior to them he had courage enough however and would ride at anything and as his own relations and friends for whom he rode were tolerably wealthy and he was therefore generally well mounted he sometimes won but he had killed more horses under him than any man in irelandand no wonder for he had a coarse hand and a loose seat and it was no uncommon thing to see george coming the first of the two over a fence headlong into the next field as if he had been flung there by a petard leaving the unfortunate brute he had been riding panting behind him with his breast cut open or his knees destroyed by the fence over which his rider had had neither skill nor patience to land him he was now going to ride his own horse conqueror and had talked himself and had been talked into the belief that it was impossible that anything could beat him  these two were standing talking at the fireplace and as they also had their little books in their hands it is to be presumed that they were mixing business with amusement  there were others there sitting at the table who were to ride tomorrow but whose usual weight allowed them to do so without the annoyance to which gayner and brown had to subject themselves there was little larry kelly from roscommon who could ride something under eight stone nicholas blake from the land of the blakes burkes and bodkins pat conner with one eye from strokestown who had brought his garron over under the speculation that if the weather should come wet and the horses should fall at the heavy banks she would be sure to crawl overknowing too that as the priest was his second cousin he could not refuse him the loan of a stable gratis  there was ussher there also sitting next to george brown who was a friend of hismuch more intent however on his own business than that which had brought the others here and greenough the subinspector of police from ballinamore and young fitzpatrick of streamstown who kept the subscription pack of harriers and a couple of officers from boyle one of whom owned a horse for which he was endeavouring to get a rider but which none of those present seemed to fancy and there was peter dillon from beyond castlebar who had brought up a stronglooking longlegged colt which he had bred in county mayo with the hope that he might part with it advantageously in a handicap to some of those roscommon lads who were said to have money in their pockets and there were many others apparently happy joyous fellows who seemed not to have a care in the world and last but not least there was hyacinth keegan attorney at law and gent  there he was smiling and chatting oily and amiable getting a word in with any one he could creeping into intimacy with those who were not sharp enough to see what he was after jabbering of horsesof which he considered himself a complete judgeand of shooting hunting and racing as if the sports of a gentleman had been his occupation from his youth upwards  well boys said mckeon i suppose were to have an auction whats it to be the owld thinghalfacrown each i suppose  an auction mr mckeon said the chairman whats an auction  well show you major all youve to do is to give me halfacrown  now as many may be as ignorant as major mcdonnell respecting an auction in sporting phraseology i will if i can explain what it is  it has but little reference or similitude to those auctions from which sir robert peel has removed the duty  supposing there may be twenty members each having halfacrown and six horses to run twenty bits of paper are placed in a hat on six of which are written the names of the running horsesthe others are blanksand they are then drawn as lots out of the hat the tickets bearing the horses names are sold by the auctioneer the last bidder has to pay twice the sum he bidsone moiety to the man who drew the horse the other is added to the fund composed of the twenty halfcrowns after the race the happy man holding the ticket bearing the name of the winning horse receives the whole there are therefore different winners in this transaction the man drawing the name of the favourite horse of course wins what is bid for the ticket any one drawing the name of any horse would probably win something as his chance if the beast have more than three legs must be worth at least five shillings such however is an auction and on the present occasion it was a very animated one  the thirty halfcrowns were now collected and handed over to mckeon the names of the eight horses expected to start scrawled in pencil on the backs of fragments of racebills and those together with the blanks deposited in the hat which was carried round by one of the party  ah now pat come to me last said gayner ive never any luck with the first haul never mind ill take it and he drew a lot and by the virgin tony ive got my own mare  have you got playful gayner said a dozen at once this made their chance less for playful was second favourite  brown was next and he got a blank and the next and the next  ive drawn brickbat said fitzpatrick a dd good horse he won the hunters plate at tuam last year  oh i wish you joy said gayner for he wont start tomorrow my boy hes at tuam now  begad hell start as soon as yourself bob said little larry he came to castleknock last night and hes at frenchpark now murphy from frenchpark is to ride him  these details brought brickbat up in the market  they might have left him at tuam then and saved themselves money said gayner why he hadnt had a gallop last tuesday week i was in his stable myself if burkes cattle had been as fat at ballinasloe hed have got better prices  i say mckeon said fitzpatrick what odds will you bet bob doesnt buy brickbat himself  the hat went round and others got blanks ussher got miss fidget larry kellys mare and was advised in a whisper by that cunning little gentlemanwho meant to buy conqueror by way of a hedge and who therefore wanted to swell the stakesto be sure and buy the mare himself for she didnt know how to fall and he added you know shes no weight on her and when ussher looked at larry kelly who was to ride her himself he couldnt but think the latter part was true  then nicholas blake drew kickiewickie the officers mare whereupon the gallant captain who knew blake was a sporting fellow thought this was a good opportunity to sound that gentleman about getting him a rider and began whispering to him all the qualities of the mare how she could do everything a mare should do how high she was bred and how well she was trained and how she was like the poacher and could leap on anywhere for all which and kickiewickie herself with her owner into the bargain blake did not care a strawfor he was confident of winning himself with the galway horse thunderer  then some one else drew thunderer and peter dillon got conqueror greatly to his joy for he reckoned that his expenses from castlebar would thus be mostly paid even if he couldnt sell the longlegged colt the major drew cromaboo a carrick horse who had once been a decent hunter and whose owner had entered it at the instigation of his fellow townsmen and by the assurance that these sort of races were often won by your steady old horses and mr stark the owner since he had first made up his mind to pay the £5 stake had gradually deceived himself into the idea that he should probably win and having never before even owned a horsefor this was a late purchase or rather the beast had been taken in lieu of a debthad now for the last three weeks talked of nothing but sweats gallops physics training running and leaping and having secured the services of a groom for the day who was capable of riding his horse had entirely given himself up to the delights of horseracing lucky was it for mr stark that cromaboo was sure to lose for had he won stark would have been a ruined man nothing would have kept him from the curragh and a conviction that the turf was his proper vocation  the major was delighted at his prize he had not drawn a blank and that was sufficient for him  then at last keegan got pat conners mare from strokestown she was called diana and his was the last paper drawn  faith keegan youre in luck said mckeon for the mare cant but run well pats been training her since may last i was over there going to castlereagh and i saw pat at her then  deed then mr mckeon said conner maybe shell beat your own mare much as you think of her  oh im sure she will theres so much running about her was she at plough after last winter pat  she had other work to do then for she had to carry me twice a week through the season and that she didand thats not light work i think  carry you pat said gayner why you dont mean to say you hunt that old garron you call diana faith man youre too bold your friends ought to look to you what would the country do if you broke your neck  its your own is in most danger im thinking replied pat faith i wouldnt take all the pick up tomorrow to ride that devil youre to ride over the course  and ill take devilish good care youre not asked said mckeon but now boys as i fear the majors hardly up to it ill dispose of the prizes come which shall i put up first which was drawn first  your own mare tony gayner got playful at the first start  well gentlemen heres the mare playful i believe im to say all the good i can about her and upon my word she doesnt want spirit here he whispered gayner whom he told to bid for themselves conjointly come gentlemen what do you offer people say shes wicked but shell not kick you if you dont come in her reach she can go if she likes and she can i suppose if she likes stand still but upon my soul i never saw her to do so in the field  ill say thirty shillings tony said bob  five and thirty said young brown  two pounds said bob  ill not go beyond that said brown  two poundswholl give more than two pounds for playful gentlemen the horses are all favourites and the pool will consequently be a large one wholl give more than two pounds bob youve got the mare hand me two pound and hand yourself two more  then brickbat and miss fidget were sold both at good prices for the horse had won the last race at tuam and that put him up in the market in spite of bobs vile comparison between him and his owners bullocks and the mare was a favourite among the roscommon gentry who knew little larry could ride when he meant it  kickiewickie was the next put up but in spite of all that had been said about her by her gallant owner she was in very little request and was purchased cheap  thunderer fetched a good price galway horses always do and it was easy to see that nicholas blake was in earnest and nick was a man that wouldnt come from loughrea to carrickonshannon and lose a day with the galway dogs for nothing george brown made the purchase for if anything could beat conqueror it was thunderer  then came conqueror and bidding began in earnest george offered two pound to frighten the field but both larry kelly and mckeon wanted to hedge and they raised the price against each other by half crowns till at last little larry kelly got the winner that was to be for three pound ten much to gayners satisfaction who felt no such confidence in george browns invincibility and was very glad to see the pool increased by those who did  when cromaboo was put uphis owner rashly offered five shillingsfor which sum he was allowed to retain him he could not however comprehend that because he had bid five he was to pay tenhowever he had to do it and began to find that the pleasures of the turf were not entirely unalloyed  the strokestown garron did not create much emulation but peter dillon knowing that though pat had only one eye that one was a good one and that he wouldnt lose the race for want of hard work and patience and having little larrys three pound ten in his pocket to back him at length doubled keegans offer of halfacrown which he made to keep his own ticket and diana was knocked down to him at the same price that cromaboo had fetched  then the fun grew fast and furious and calls for hot water and spirits were loud and incessant  by the holy poker boys im thirsty after that said mckeon you should stand me a bottle of champagne among ye no lessjust to take the dryness out of my throat before i begin drinking  champagne indeed tony wouldnt a bucket of brandy and water serve you  indeed fitz if youre to pay for it yourself a mouthful of brandy and water wouldnt be a bad thingfor i want something more than ordinary afther that work ah conner it was the bidding afther that mare of yours that broke my heart entirelywhy man you see every one wanted her  niver mind mr mckeon niver mind said pat with his one eye fixed on his punch shes a nice good easy creature anyway i dont have to be sending a boy down through the rack to be cleaning her as they say you do with the one youre going to start tomorrowpray god she dont kill any of us thats all  pray god she dont pat and especially you well fitz wheres this brandy and water youre talking about  to hear tony talking said little larry one would think he didnt drink this week when he got a sup at every bid that was made and finished a tumbler as every horse was knocked down why that was eight tumblers of punch  water larry all water to clear my throatask the waiter else  its little of that cure you take im thinkingwaiter bring some tobacco here  and now the party began smoking as well as drinking and an atmosphere was formed which soon drove the major out of the roomnot however before mckeon implored him to stay just for one handicap as he wanted to challenge the bay gelding he drove under his gig and as the major was waiting for his hat tony threw a shilling on the table  come major cover that just for luck i must have a shy at that gig horse i want him for mrs mckeons car come ill tell you every beast ive got and you may choose from them all from the mare thats to win tomorrow down to the flock of turkeys thats in the yard at drumsna  but the major was inexorable he thought the £40 and the red coat which he had had to buy for tomorrows use together with the hard work he had to do was enough for popularity and may be he had heard of tonys celebrity in a knock and he did not wish to sacrifice his own nag for a chance selection out of those in mckeons yard nor yet for a flock of turkeys  however though the major wouldnt join in a handicap others wouldand mckeon wasnt baulked of his amusement men soon had their hands in their pockets waiting the awards of the arbiter which were speedily pronounced and various and detailed were the descriptions given of the brutes which were intended to change hands but not in general such as made those who got them satisfied with their bargains when they afterwards became acquainted with their real merits  peter dillon threw away sundry shillings in endeavouring to part with the mayo colt but either he had been there before with the same kind of cattle or he priced him too high he couldnt get his money for him either from little larry kelly or his elder brother who was there  tony before the evening was over gave the boyle officers two or three most desperate bargains first he got the celebrated mare kickiewickie for a pair of broken down gig horses to run tandem engaged to go quiet and not kick in harness they couldnt be warranted sound but then as tony said what horse could and he was so particularhe would never say a horse was sound unless he knew it in fact he never warranted a horse sound which was true enough for tony knew no one would take his warrant and then when the captain was in the first fit of grief for kickiewickie some goodnatured friend having told him that the two gig horses werent worth a feed of oats tony gave her back again for a good hack hunter and a sum of money to boot about the real value of the mare again late in the eveningwhen the punch had made further inroads upon the poor warriors brainhe gave him back his own hunter for the two gig horses and a further sum of money from all which it will be seen by those who understand the art that the officer from boyle could not have made a great deal and that tony mckeon could not be much out of pocket  this fun continued till about two when half the party were too drunk to care about winning and losingand the other half mostly consisting of the married men too wary to attempt business with those as knowing as themselves gayner and brown had gone home to bed as they had to be up and walk ten miles before breakfast with their great coats on after which as gayner had told mrs mckeon he would trouble her for the loan of two feather beds and three or four buckets of turf as he thought that after laying between them for an hour or so before a roaring fire and then being rubbed down with flannels by tony and his two men there was little doubt but hed be able to ride 11 stone 4 and he was to be up at that weight on the next day  keegan had become very drunk and talkative had offered to sing two or three songs to make two or three speeches and had ultimately fallen backwards on his chair being drawn away from which position he was unable to get up and little larrys brother was now amiably engaged painting his face with lampblack mrs keegan the while was sitting in her cold dark little back parlour meditating the awful punishment to be visited on the delinquent when he did return home  vain woman there she sat till four while hyacinth lay happy beneath the table nor did he return home till brought on the waiters back at eight the next morning  pat was winking with his one eye and nodding on his chair with his pipe still stuck in his mouth little larry was laughing till he cried at his brothers performance peter dillon and young fitzpatrick each with a whiskey bottle in his hand were guarding the door at which stark the unfortunate owner of cromaboo was vainly endeavouring to make his exit which he was assured he should not be allowed to do till he had sung a song standing on the sideboard and the younger son of mars conquered by tobacco and whiskey was leaning his unfortunate head on the table and deluging keegans feet with the shower which he was unable to restrain  ussher was detailing in half drunken glee to his friend fred brown georges brother his plan for carrying off poor feemy and brown always as he said ready to help a friend in necessity was offering him the loan of his gig to take her as far as longford at which place he could arrive in time to catch the mail if he could manage to take feemy away from ballycloran immediately after sunset and ill send a boy to bring the gig back from longford added fred so youll have no trouble at all and ill tell you what it is youre taking the prettiest girl out of county leitrim with youso heres her health  tony nicholas blake and greenough were the only three left who were still able to drink steadily and they kept at it till about four when they all agreed that if they meant to do any good at all tomorrow theyd better be getting to bed they consequently took one tumbler more because it was to be the last and made towards the door out of which stark had at length escaped after having a bottle of whiskey poured over his head as they passed the captain who was snoring against the wall mckeon slightly touched his foot with his toe and said to blake well if i was as soft as that fellow id have my head boiled in a puddingbag by gad the colonel oughtnt to let him out without his nurse  you oughtnt to talk then tony for you didnt make a bad thing of him tonight  oh dn his money said mckeon id much sooner be without such a fellow id sooner by half have a bargain with a man that knew how to take care of himself than a greenhorn whod let you rob him of his eyes without seeing you  by this time theyd got to the front door at which was now standing tonys buggy and servant greenough was going to walk to his lodgings and blake had come to the door to see his friend off when they heard a loud shrieking down the street and they saw the unfortunate stark running towards the hotel still followed by fitzpatrick and dillon each with an empty bottle in his hand  when he had escaped from the inn his persecutors had followed him still swearing that he should sing stark had run towards his home but before he got there his pursuers headed him in the street and turned him back and now as he rushed along half blinded by the spirits in his eyes they followed him whooping and yelling like two insane devils and were just catching him near the door of the hotel when poor stark striking his foot against the curb stone fell violently on his face and dillon who was just behind him stumbled and fell upon him  halloo fitzpatrick is that you said tony what in gds name are you doing with that poor devil i believe you and dillon have killed him  by this time dillon had got up and mckeon and blake together helped the other man to his feet his wrath was by this time thoroughly kindled and he was swearing all manner of vengeance against fitzpatrickthe other mans name he did not know they contented with their sport carried the decanters wonderful to relate unbroken in triumph into the hoteland mckeon bidding the boy to bring the gig after him helped stark whose face was dreadfully bleeding to his home trying to console him and assuring him that the mischief was all owing to dillon and that fitzpatrick who was a neighbour and friend of tonys had had little or nothing to do with it and having left him at his halldoor he drove quietly home to his own house and went soberly to bed     chapter xviii  how pat brady and joe reynolds were eloquent in vain   the day after ussher had obtained feemys consent to go off with him she passed in the same manner as she had that afternoonsometimes sitting quiet with her eyes fixed on vacancysometimes sobbing and crying as though she must have fallen into an hysterical fit once or twice she attempted to make some slight preparation for her visit to mrs mckeons such as looking through her clothes mending them c but in fact she did nothing the next day sunday she spent in the same manner she omitted going to mass a thing she had not done for years unless kept at home by very bad weather or real illness she never took up a book nor spoke a word except such as she could not possibly avoid to the servant or her father of thady she saw nothing except at her meals and then they took no notice of each other they had not spoken since the night when thady had upbraided her whilst walking in the lane with ussher  on the monday morning she was obliged to exert herself for she had to pack the little trunk that was to carry her ballroom finery to mrs mckeons and prepare everything that was necessary for her visit  biddy the favourite of the two girls had once or twice asked her mistress what ailed her and whether she was ill but feemy only answered her crossly that she was bothered with that horrid headache and the girl could only believe that either this was actually the case or else that she had quarrelled with her lover and as it was now three days since he had been at ballycloran she at last determined that this was the case  during these three days feemy had frequently made up her mind or rather she fancied she had made up her mind to give ussher upto go and confess it all to father john or to tell it to mrs mckeon and if it had not been for the false pride within her which would not allow her to own that she had been deceived and that her lover was unworthy she would have done so his present coolness and his cruelty in not coming to see her though they did not destroy her love greatly shook it and had she had one kind word to assist her in the struggle within herself she might still have prevented much of the misery which her folly was fated to produce  when mrs mckeon and her daughters came for her about one oclock on monday the small exertion necessary for putting up her clothes had made her somewhat bettersomething more able to talk than she had been before and they did not then observe anything particular about her but she had been but a very short time at drumsna before it was evident to mrs mckeon that something was the matter with her when she questioned her feemy gave the same answerthat she had a racking headache and though this did very well for a time before the evening was over the good lady was certain that something more than a headache afflicted her guest  the next day according to his promise ussher called but of course at mrs mckeons house he could not see her alone that lady and her daughters were present all the time when he came in ussher shook hands with feemy as he would with anybody else and began talking gaily to the two other girls he had regained his presence of mind completely and however deficient feemy might be in that respect he now proved himself a perfect master of hypocrisy he did not stay long and as he got up to go away he merely remarked that he hoped he should meet the ladies that day week on the racecourse and at the ball and the only thing he said especially to feemy was that he should call at ballycloran on his way to the races and that when he saw her on the course he would tell her how her father and brother were and he remarked that he should not go home that night as he had been asked to dine and sleep at brown hall  the week passed on and feemy remained in the same melancholy desponding way saying nothing to mrs mckeon and little to the two girls who in spite of feemys sin in having a lover did everything in their power to cheer and enliven her  father john usually dined at mrs mckeons on sunday and she came to the determination of having another talk with him about feemy so before dinner on that day she opened her mind to him telling him the state in which feemy had been the whole of the week and that she thought the sooner she could be made to understand that she must give up all thoughts of ussher the better  feemy had been at mass with the family and when she met father john afterwards she exerted herself to appear before him as she usually did and to a certain extent she succeeded father john was himself usually cheerful and he spoke to her good humouredly and she made an effort to answer him in the same strain this deceived the priest and when mrs mckeon spoke to him about feemys deep melancholy and suggested the propriety of speaking to her on the subject which they supposed was nearest her heart he said  better let her alone mrs mckeon i think youd better let her alone and time will cure her you see feemy is proud and perhaps a little too headstrong and i dont think shed bear just as quietly as she ought any one speaking to her about the man now it isnt only the losing him that vexes her it isnt only that she has been deceived but that everyone knows that she has lost him and has been deceived its this that hurts her pride and talking to her about it will only make her more fretful if youll take my advice youll just leave her to herself take no especial notice of her and let her go to this ball and when she sees the man paying attention to othersdancing and philandering with them and neglecting herher pride will make her feel that she must at any rate appear to be indifferent and when she has once enabled herself to appear so she will soon become really so just let her go to the races and the ball and your kindness and the girls society will soon bring her round  all monday feemy spent in bed but mrs mckeon and her girls took no notice of it except carefully tending heroffering to read to her and bring her what she wanted they soon however found that she preferred being left alone and they consequently allowed her to think over her own gloomy prospects in solitude and silence  feemy had however declared her intention of going both to the races and to the ball ussher had desired her to do so and she feared to disobey him besides at one of these places he had to give her final instructions as to their departure she was therefore dressed for starting on the tuesday morning when the other girls were ready and though her eyes and nose were somewhat red and her cheeks somewhat pale and though she did not now deserve the compliment that fred brown had paid her when he told ussher that he was going to carry off the prettiest girl in county leitrim still she did not look unwell and mrs mckeon kindly comforted herself by the reflection that as she was both able and willing to dress herself for amusement there could not be much really the matter with her  in the meantime thady had been honestly firm to the promise he had made to father john not to join the mulreadyites his sisters absence from ballycloran at the present time had been a relief to him and on the morning after his visit to the priest he had returned to his work not certainly with much happiness or satisfaction but still with his mind made up to struggle on in the best way he couldto do nothing which he knew to be wrong and come what come might to leave reynolds and his associates to their own schemes and villanies he felt determined if he could not protect himself and his family from his enemies by honest means to leave it to circumstances to protect him and though he could not shake off a deep desponding as to the future still there was a kind of contentment in the feeling that he knew he had to suffer and that he had made up his mind to do so firmly and bravely  on the saturday morning pat brady had again come to his master informing him that all the boys were to be on that evening at the whiskey shop and using all his powers of oratory to induce him to come down but thady was firm and he not only refused to come then but plainly told pat that he had entirely altered his mind and that he did not intend to go down to them at all he advised pat also to give them up hinting that if he did not they two viz pat brady and thady macdermot would probably soon have to part company  this was a threat however for which pat did not much care for he knew that there was little more to be made by his old master and like a wise man he had already provided himself with a new one and a more prosperous and wealthy one than him he was going to leave rats always leave a falling house and brady was a real rat  still however though he did not expect to get much more from his service with thady he was for his own reasons anxious that his present master should not be quit of the companions with whom he had been so anxious to join him and therefore when he found that he could no longer work on his masters mind by the arguments he had hitherto used he began to threaten himtelling him of the different perils from the law which he would have to encounter by having joined the party and various dangers to which he would subject himself by deserting it but in vainthady was firm and when pat got violent and inclined to be impertinent on the subject he told him that he would knock him down with the alpine in his hand if he said another word about it  on sunday thady went to mass and afterwards took a walk with his friend the priest who said everything he could to raise his spirits and to a certain degree he did so on the next morning as he was going to his work a messenger brought a letter from keegan to his father this was a legal notice on flannellys part that on some day in november which was named heflannellywould require not only the payment of the interest money which would then be due but also the principal and in this notice was set forth the exact sum to be paid for principal for interest for costs and it further stated that if the sum was not paid on or before that day writs would be issued for his bodythat is the body of poor larry macdermotand latitats and sheriffs warrants and heaven knows what besides for selling the property at ballycloran and that the mortgage would be immediately foreclosed and the property itself disposed of for the final settlement of the debt  this agreeable document was very legibly addressed to lawrence macdermot esq c c c ballycloran and its unusual dimensions and appearance made thady at once feel that it was some infernal missile come still further to harass him and leave him if possible more miserable than it found him however such as it was it was necessary that it should be read so he took it to his father and having broken the seal said  heres a letter from keegan larry shall i read it you  dn keegan was the fathers consolatory reply i dont want his letters i tell you he cant call for his money before november and this is october yet  thats thrue said thady when he had spelt through the epistle thats thrue father but this is to say that he manes to come in arnest when that time comes  and dont he always come in arnest is it in joke he comes when he axes for a hundred pound every half year come in arnest why dn him hes always in arnest  but father its not only the hundred pound now but the whole debt he demands and at last thady succeeded in reading the letter to his father  larry at first got into a violent passion swearing fearfully at keegan and hinting that he larry knew well enough how to take care of his own body and that he keegan might get more than he bargained for if he came to meddle with it after that he began to whimper piteously and cry complaining that it was a most grievous thing that his own son should bring such a letter to him and he ended by accusing thady of leaguing with the attorney to turn him out of his own house and even asked him whether when they had effected their purpose he and keegan intended to live at ballycloran together  all this was not comfortable thady however quietly folded up the letter put it in the old bureau left his father to his pipe and his fireside and went out again to his occupations  nothing new occurred at ballycloran for a few days and he began to flatter himself that mrs mulreadys boys and their threats would annoy him no more and he was even thinking of sending pat down to drumleesh to notice the tenants again to come up with the rents if it were only to see what steps they would then take as he was returning home however on friday evening across the fields a little after dusk he saw the figure of a man standing in a gap through which he had to pass and when he came close to him he perceived it was joe reynolds  thady had been rather surprised that he had not seen joe before and had been inclined to think that that worthy gentleman had been intimidated when he heard of his own defection but joe was not a character so easily frightened the truth was that he had for the last few days left his own cabin at drumleesh and had been engaged with others in the mountains which lay between loch sheen and ballinamore in making potheen in large quantities and drinking no small portion of what they made the morning after the wedding he had been boasting to his comrades there of the success he had had in bringing over his landlord to their ranks and he had brought down a large party of them from that quarter all sworn friends to be present at his proposed initiationand great was their wrath and loud were their threatenings when they found that thady would not come joe had however been obliged to join them again at their business and though he had heard the ill success of bradys second attempt he had not been able till now to try the effects of his own eloquence  he had now come down for that purpose and had been for the greater portion of the evening watching thady till he could get a good opportunity of talking to him undisturbed and he was now determined not to leave him till he had used every means in his power of inducing him to change the resolution to which he had so suddenly come  when thady came close to him he respectfully raised his old battered hat and said  long life to ye mr thady i hope yer honer is finding yerself well this evening  quite well thank you joe and joe walked on with him a few steps  have you the rint ready for me yet continued thady  rint is it faix then i have notnot a penny but it wasnt rint i was wanting to talk to your honer about just now not but what the rint ll be coming and that right soon mr thady and plenty tooif youll only listen to me  those d be glorious times joe when the rint came that way and thady walked on faster for he didnt want to prolong the conversation beyond what he could help  stop mr thady what are ye in sich a hurry for ive come a long way to spake to youand well both talk pleasanter av youd go a little aisier  well joe what is it then im in a hurry  in a hurry is it but why wor ye in sich a hurry to break the promise you made us all at mrs mehans thursday night week past ah mr thady you wornt in a hurry when you said youd come down and be one of us at mohillay and swore it too on the blessed cross you wornt in sich a hurry then and what hurries you now so fast  now reynolds its no use youre saying more of that i sent you word by pat that i wouldnt come and i wontso theres an end of it  but that ant an end of it no nor nigh the end of it i suppose mr thadyand he paused and resuming his respectful tone said and didnt you say you niver had deserted us and niver would and that youd always stick to us that youve known so long shure mr thady youll not change your mind now and reynolds paused in the little path they were walking in and thady was obliged to stand too for reynolds had got before him and he couldnt pass unless he pushed the man aside and shuredo you mane to let keegan off and ussher the black ruffians that way do you intend to put up with everything from the likes of them come mr thady say the wordonly say the word you swore before and by the holy cross you swore on before next week is over keegan shall be put where hell never spake another bad word or do another bad deed  come reynolds out of this and let me pass said thady perceiving that he must now absolutely make the man understand that he was not to be talked over out of that and let me pass and ill tell you what ill not have my neck in danger and if i hear you threatening murdher ill have you before the magisthrates and he pushed by the man who however still walked close behind him  and is that the way with you now have me before the magisthrates will you and whered you be all the time why theres not one of them that was in it at mrs mehans that night but could have you before the magisthrates and im thinking thim folk would make a deal more of you than they would of me av you talk of magisthrates mr thady may be youll find theres too many of them in the counthry for yerself  thady walked on fast but did not answer him and reynolds continuedcome mr thady i dont intend to anger you or affront you and av ive said anything that way i axes your pardon but just answer mewill you come down there only for once av it wor only becase you swore it afore them all on the holy cross  no joe i will not av i took any oath at all i was dhrunk besides i said i wouldnt and i wont so now good night  but mr thady av youd only come there to tell the boys so themselves it would be all right shure youre not afeard to trust yerself among them  not a foot joe  well then i tell you youll be sorry not that id say a word agin you myself becase though youve illtrated me now you wor always a kind landlord and becase its not in your heart to hurt a poor man but i tell you and youll find it comes thrue enough there were them there that night at mrs mehans as will turn agin you unless you do as im axing you now  well joe i cant help it if they do so good night  they had now come to a lane and as thady was going to jump on the bank to get over joe put his hand on his coat  one more word yer honer may be yet youll change your mind  indeed i shall not then  may be you will and im thinking when you find keegan too hard on you it ll come to that well av you do let me know and ill make it all right for you just tell corney dolan and hes still at drumleesh that youre wanting me and i wont be far off  thady did not answer him but merely saying good night joe jumped into the road and joe by some devious path through bogs and bottoms betook himself to mrs mulreadys and drowned the feeling of his ill success in whiskey  thady went home to his dinner or supperrather glad that he had had the interview for the mans manner was not so insolent as he had expected it would be and he now felt tolerably confident that he should not again be solicited to keep the unfortunate promise which he had made  his father however was still muttering over the misfortunes which he was doomed to bear from the hands of his own son thady took all the pains he could and all the patience he could muster to prove to the old man that he was only desirous to do the best he could for him and feemy he had even told him that he had absolutely quarrelled and come to blows with the attorney on the day of his visit but it was all in vain and when he got himself to bed he was puzzled to think whether keegan and ussher or his father and feemy caused him most trouble and unhappiness     chapter xix  the races   although we have hitherto only seen ussher as a guest at ballycloran or figuring as a lion at mary bradys wedding he was nevertheless in the habit of frequenting much better society and was not unfrequently a guest at the houses of certain gentlemen in the neighbourhood of carrickonshannon  for ussher could assume the manners of a gentleman when he chose and moreover be a lively and agreeable companion and this perhaps quite as much as the attribute made him somewhat of a favourite among many of the surrounding gentry he was however more intimate at brown hall than at any other house and he had now been asked over there to spend the few days previous to his final departure from county leitrim  the establishment at brown hall consisted of jonas brown the fatheran irritable overbearing magistrate a greedy landlord and an unprincipled fatherand his two sons who had both been brought up to consider sport their only business horses and dogs their only care grooms and trainers the only persons worthy of attention and the mysteries of the field and the stable the only pursuits which were fit to be cultivated with industry or learnt with precision they could read as was sufficiently testified by their intimate knowledge of the information contained in nimrod upon horses and the veterinary magazine and the clerk of the course at the curragh could prove that they could write by the many scrawls he had received from thementering horses and giving their particulars as to age colour breeding qualifications c but beyond this they had no acquirements for the elder son who was only intended to be a landlord and a magistrate and to spend about a thousand a year this did not signify but for the younger it afforded but a melancholy prospect had his eyes been open to see it  for the estate which was all set at a rack rent was strictly entailed and as jonas had always lived beyond his income there would be little to leave to a younger son when their mother died the two young men together with a sister had been left to the fathers care she also had learnt to ride and ride hardto go to the stable and see that her own horse was made upand to rate her groom in no gentle terms if things in that department were not as they should be she also could be eloquent on thrush sandcracks and overreachescould detect a splint or a spavin at a glanceknew all the parts and portions and joints of a horse much more accurately than she did of a sheep and was a thorough judge of condition rumour also not unfrequently hinted among the tabbies of carrickonshannon that miss julia could not only ride with her brothers in the morning but that she was also occasionally not ill inclined to drink with them of an evening  things were in this state when it occurred to jonas and his favourite son fred that it were well for all parties if they could get miss julia off from brown hall as there was reason to fear she was coming out a little too fast and that if they did not get rid of her now she might in a short time become a card somewhat hard to play they consequently invited a squireen of three or four hundred a year to the house who had rather unequivocally expressed his admiration for di vernon and under the fostering auspices of father and brother the two soon made up matters together though the lady was unable to follow her prototypes example by wooing her lover over the pages of dante however though dante was wanting opportunity was not which for one so well inclined as miss julia was sufficient and before the young gentleman had been three weeks in the house fred was enabled to hint to him one day as he was pulling off his boots before dinner that of course he presumed his intentions to his sister were honourable and explicit now that things had gone so far toby armstrongfor such was the name of di vernons admirernot relishing pistols and coffee made no objection to the young lady but he absolutely refused to take her empty handed and in consequence jonas and fred had to hand him over their joint bond for two thousand pounds before he would be induced to make her mistress of castle armstrong there she now reigned supreme and it is to be hoped for the sake of the future generation that she had by this time learnt to transfer her attention from the stable to the nursery  the browns were at any rate quit of the young lady and had brown hall now wholly to themselves and this was a satisfaction still the hundred a year which they had to pay their dear brotherinlaw toby was a great loss to them and made it more improbable that when the old man should be gathered to his fathers george should have anything to subsist on except his brothers affection and bounty  as fred inherited all his fathers love of money joined to an irresistible passion for everything that he called pleasure and as he was already continually quarrelling with his younger brother who was as continually impertinent to him georges prospect in life was not particularly bright as to turning his mind to any useful pursuitstudying for any profession or endeavouring in any way to earn his own bread honestlyhe would have been as angered and felt as insulted by such a proposition as though any one had asked him to turn cobbler and sit crosslegged at the window of one of the little shops at carrickonshannon  as however he at present had food to eat wine to drink horses to ride and usually cash to bet with he concerned himself but little for the future and we therefore may fairly be equally apathetic respecting it it would not however be difficult to foretell his fate should he not break his neck before his fathers death he will quarrel with and slander his brother he will ride for those who are young and green enough to trust their horses to him and pay him for mounting them he will spunge upon all his acquaintance till he is turned out of their houses he will be a hanger on at the curragh and all racecourses he will finally become a blackleg and swindler and will die in the marshalsea if he does not as he most probably will break his neck by a fall from the saddle for to the last george will preserve his pluckthe only quality on which he could ever pride himself  on the morning of the races the two brothers and ussher were sitting over a very late breakfast at brown hall the father had long since been out careful to see that he got the full twelve hours work from the unfortunate men whom he hired at five pence a day and who had out of that to feed themselves and families and pay their rent we will not talk about clothing them it would be a mockery to call the rags with which the labouring poor in that part of the country are partially covered clothes or to attach value to them though i suppose they must once have cost something  why what nonsense ussher said fred to be sending that mare of yours down to munster shed never be fast enough for that countrynot the thing at all for tipperary fencesall gaps and breaks besides the expense of sending her and the chances that shes lamed on the road youd better let me have her shes only fit for this country ill tell you what ill do ill give you the horse and gig youre to take that girl of yours to longford in tomorrow for her  hush man for gds sake if the servants hear you talking that way im dished if it once got abroad about my taking her off id have the devil to pay before i got out of the country  i believe ussher thinks said george no one ran away with a girl before himself why if you were going to seize a dozen stills you couldnt make more row about it  i shouldnt make any about that for it would come natural to me and id a deal sooner be doing that than what i have to do tomorrow night im dd but id sooner take a score of friezecoats with only five or six of my own men to back me than drive twenty miles in a gig with a squalling girl  if youre sick of the job ill take her off your hands said the goodnatured fred  thank ye no as ive got so far with it i believe ill go on now  well if you wont take a kind offer about the girl will you take the one i made about the mare to tell the truth id sooner have the mare than the girl myself  thank ye no i believe ill keep both  ill tell you what ill do said fred getting anxious in his hankering after the mare ill throw the harness into the bargainspick and span new from hamiltons i paid eight pound ten for it not a month since all the new fashionbrass fittings and brass haines you could have the crests taken out and new ones put in for a few shillings only send me down the old ones  what would i do with a gig and horse besides the gigs shook the shafts are all loose and the boxes are battered and the horse was saying his prayers lately by the look of his knees  never down in his life by gd said george willing to help his brother in a matter of horseflesh its only a knock he got when i was trying to put him over the little wall beyond the lawn there but i couldnt make the brute jump though hes the sweetest horse in harness i ever sat behind  ussher was not to be done and fred consoled himself by assuring him that hed be sorry for it when he found the mare was not the least use in life down in munster and that no one would give him a twentypound note for her  a drag now came round to the door george was making his toilet before the fire having eaten about half an ounce of dry toast after his morning exercise under the three greatcoats he was adjusting his boots and breechesand george was not a little proud of his appearance in his riding costume the jacket and cap were carried loose and after many exclamations from fred that they would be late and that as he had backed conqueror it was a shame for his brother to give the stewards the chance of starting the horses without him which were answered by rejoinders from george that they wouldnt dare to do soshowing that he didnt care how much all the rest might be inconvenienced by his delay so long as he didnt suffer himself the three got into the conveyance at the door about an hour after the time at which the horses were advertised to start punctually and fred drove them to the course which was not above a mile distant  i cannot say that the ground displayed much that was elegant in the way of equipages or anything very refined in the countenances belonging to the racecourse  the weighing stand consisted of the scales in which potatoes and oats were usually weighed in the marketplace in carrick and were borrowed from the municipality for the occasion the judges chair was formed of a somewhat more than ordinary high stool with a kind of handle sticking up at one corner by holding on to which he was barely able to keep his place so constantly were the mob pressing round him  there was a stand from which a tolerable view of the race could be obtained admission one shilling but few ascended it and long before the start the price had fallen to sixpence  there were two or three carriages one containing counsellor webbs family he himself was one of the stewards and consequently appeared on horseback in a red coat another belonged to sir michael gipson who owned the greater part of the town and who drawing about six thousand a year from this county and the next had given ten pounds to be run for by farmers horses contriving thereby to show them that he thought they ought to indulge in expensive amusements and to stimulate them to idleness and gambling as however the land in the country was chiefly let in patches under twenty acres each and to men who were unable to feed the sorry beast necessary to keep them in tillage sir michaels generosity had not the effect which it might be presumed to cause and his ten pound was annually won by some large tenant who might call himself a farmer but who would make a desperate noise if another man presumed to call him anything but a gentleman of cars there were plenty crowded with pretty faces all evidently intending to be pleased not invariably however for there was mrs keegan in one of those altogether abominable affairs called inside cars not because you had any of the comforts of an inside place in case of rain for they have no covering but because the inmates sitting on each side have full power to kick each others shins and no liberty to stretch their legs there she sat alone as sour as at the moment when she had first seen her hyacinth as he was deposited by the hotel waiter on the mat inside her halldoor  she looked little as if she was there for amusement and in truth she was not after a time hyacinth had come to himself and by dint of continual scolding much sodawater and various lavations he had enabled himself to make a very sickly appearance on horseback but the wife of his bosom was determined that he should not escape from thence to another ordinary or even to any hospitable table where he might get drunk for nothing and consequently she was there to watch him  there was but one other there that did not seem bent on enjoyment and this was poor feemy there she was sitting on the same side of the car with lyddy mckeon and the goodnatured mother had taken care that this should be the side facing the horses but feemy took no interest in them she had given over crying and sobbing but she was silent and apparently sullen and would much have preferred her own little room at ballycloran  there were to be three races had there been a prospect of thirty and among them a trial of speed between all the favourites of the derby there could not have been a greater crowd or more anxiety every ragged barefooted boy there knew the names of each horse and to whom he belonged and believed in the invincibility of some favourite beastprobably from attachment to its ownerand were as anxious as if the animals were their own among this set mckeon or little larry kelly were booked to winthey were kind friendly masters and these judges thought that kind men ought to have winning horses  shure thin said one halfnaked urchin stuck up in a small tree growing just out of one of the banks over which the horses were to pass shure thin playfuls an illigant swate baste entirely ill go bail theres nothin ll come nigh her this day  that tony may win the day thin said another its he is the fine sportsman  bedad yere both out said a third squatting as close on the bank as the men would let him its mr larry ll win god bless himand none but himand he the weight all wid him and why not theres none of em in the counthry so good as the kellys hoorroo for the kellys thems the boys  they do say said the second speaker who was only half way up the tree that conqueror ll win by jasus av he do wont young brown be going it  is it conqueror said the higher and more sanguine votary of mckeon is it the brown hall horse he cant win i tell ye i saw him as paddy cane was leading him down and he didnt look like winning he hasnt got it in him that he may fall at the first lep and never stir again tony ll win boys hurroo for tony mckeon  the weighing was now accomplished and jockeys mounted major mcdonnell had to look after this part of the business of which he knew as much as he did of arabic however he was shoved about unmercifully for half an hourhad his toes awfully trodden on for he was told he should dismount to see the weighingnarrowly escaped a halfhundredweight which was dropped within three inches of his foot and did i daresay as much good as stewards usually do on such occasions  counsellor webb was to start them and though a counsellor he was an old hand at the work he always started the horses at the carrick races and usually one of his own among the lot the counsellor by the by was a great favourite with all parties and what was more he was a good man and a gentleman  major longsword from boyle was the third steward and he like his military colleague was rather out of his element he was desired to keep the populace back and preserve the course but it seemed to major longsword that the populace didnt care a button for him and his red coat and though he valiantly attempted to ride in among men women and children he couldnt move them they merely pushed the horse back with their hands and the brute frightened by their numbers wouldnt go on they screamed arrah sir go asy shure youre on my foot musha thin cant you be quiet with the big horse faix im murdhered with you siris you going to ride over us shure yer honer wont you go over there look how the boys is pressing in there the major soon saw he could do no good so he rode out of the crowd mentally determining that the jockeys might if they could clear the course for themselves  and now they were offat least seven of them for when the important morning came the captain had in vain used every exertion to get a rider for kickiewickie his ambition had at first soared so high that he had determined to let no one but a gentleman jockey mount her but gradually his hopes declined and at the ordinary he was making fruitless inquiries respecting some proper person but in vain and now he had been from twelve to one searching for any groom in possession of the necessary toggery he would have let the veriest tailor in carrick get on his mare if he had merely been legitimately dressed really his exertions and his misery were distressing for at last he was obliged to send her back to boyle after having paid the stakes and the stable charges for her and console himself by telling his friends that the gentleman from galway who was to ride for him had deceived him and that he could not possibly have put any one he did not know upon kickiewickie  but the seven are off there they go gently cantering looking so pretty and so cleanthe riders so steadythe horses so eager how different they will look when three or four or more probably only two are returning to the post the horses jaded the men heated with whip speedily raised and sharply fallingspurs bloodyand jackets soiled by perhaps more than one violent fall and yet in ten minutes this will be their appearance  there they gohurroo theyre off faix theres playful at her tricks alreadyby dad shell be over the ropes steady bobsteady or shell back on yougive it her gayner my boy give it her never spare herlaws did you see that well if he gets her over the course hed ride the very divil well done bob now youve got herhurroo tony my boy youre all

took at the walland now they had come to a big drain all the horses being well together as far as this excepting cromaboo who having been forced through a breach made by some other of the horses in the first wall had baulked at a bank which came next and never went any further some one told poor stark on the course that the horse didnt run today nearly so well as his owner did last night and it was true enough  there goes conquerorhes over faith then george is leadingbrown hall against the field  never mind said some knowing fellow hes a deal too fond of leadinghes a deal oftener seen leading than winning  theres little larrymy how sweet the mare went over the water theres brickbat in itno hes out hes an awkward beast thats thundererholy virgin what a leap he goes at everything as

gayner afther that youll never live till youre drowned come away to the double ditch thats where theyll show what theyre made ofthe marell be cooled now and shell run as easy as a coachhorse  and the two rode away to the big fence mentioned which consisted of a broad flattopped bank between two wide dry ditches while the horses went the round of the course over four or five intermediate banks  here they come theres blake leading what a stride that horse has but youll see hell die away now larrys secondno george is second but larrys well up  faith and hes been down toohe and the mare theres playful how she pullswheres brickbat now then  and the galway horse came at the big fenceblake pulling him off a little as he came to it then stuck his spurs into his horses flankgave a lift at his head and threw his left hand to the tree of the saddle the horse gave a terrific leap on the bankpaused for a momentand clearing the second ditch came down safe on his legs with a shock that seemed to shake the field  hurroo well done beat that georgenow for brown hall no by jasus little larrys nextnow larry the virgin send you safe over the mare with the light weight on her back made nothing of what seemed in the horse so tremendous a jump and without losing her running skimmed on to the bank and off it and collared the horse before he had regained his stride  good luck to you masther larry its you that can ride hurroo for the kellysoh by the holy theyre both dead this last exclamation referred to conqueror who had come up to the fence much heated but at a great pace george never attempting to pull him off or give him a moment of breath using his whip and riding forward over his horses neck hurried him on the gallant brute leapt with all his force but not being able to master the height breasted it violently sending his rider a dozen feet into the next field and falling himself into the ditch his head on to the field with a broken heart and dead george however was soon on his feet for his head was hard and he was used to tumbling  before he was on his legs however up came playful awfully rushing her neck outher nose forwardher nostrils openher eye eagercovered with foam but showing no sign of fatigue nor any further inclination to baulk gayner was sitting her beautifully not attempting to hold her for he knew that if he stopped her whipcord wouldnt make her run again but with a firm steady pull on her mouthhis hands low and both on the reins and his legs well tucked in there she came on at the leap without easing her pace for a moment and going over the carcass of the dying animal cleared it all bank and ditches at one leaptwo and thirty feet at one stride there are the marks to this day for tony mckeon in his pride measured the ground and put in stakes to point out the spot where his mare showed herself so worthy of all his trouble  brickbat had quarrelled with some of his namesakes at a wall and was now nowhere diana still persevered and got well over the big fence but her chance was out unless some unaccountable accident happened to the three other horses that were still running on they went there were only three more fences two small banks and a five foot wall thunderer and miss fidget neck and neck took the two banks the big horse making awfully high leaps at them playful nearing them at every stride galloping over the banks as though they were but a part of the level field now for the wall now nicholas blake now show them how little they think of a five foot wall in galway faith though larrys firstbravo roscommon hes over and a couple of bricks only falling show how lightly miss fidget touched it with her hind feet not so thunderer again the horse made an awful leap but the pace had been too much for him he struck the wall violently with his knees and bursting through gave blake a fall over his shoulders galway however was soon in his saddle again but not before bob was over and had long passed him  and now there was a beautiful race in between the two mares and oh how charmingly both were ridden but though miss fidget was so favoured in weight and had begun with the lead her elder rival collared her and beat her at the post by a head and why shouldnt she win as tony said in triumph to his friends for hadnt she the dhrop in her wasnt she by coriander out of pink by highflyer of course shed winhadnt he known it all the time  thats all very well said larry as he stood with his saddle in his hand waiting till bob got out of the scales it was only her dd long nose and neck that won after all fur ill swear my head was past the post before bobs  well then larry well make a case for the stewards whether its your head or the horses the judge should go by  theres two of em whispered gayner wouldnt know if you were to ask em  thunderer came in third and a couple of minutes afterwards dianaand pat conner when he was laughed at as to his place truly boasted that at any rate he was the only one that had been able to ride round the course without a fall  the chief and most exciting race of the day being over the more aristocratic of the multitude seemed with one accord to turn their attention to luncheon the ladies began to unpack the treasures with which the wells of their cars had been loadedcold hamsshoulders of muttonpigeon piesbottles of sherryand dozens of porter soon made their appearance and pretty girls putting corkscrews and carving knives into the hands of their admirers bid them work for their food before they ate woe betide the young man there who had no female friends on the courseno one to relieve the pangs of his hunger or to alleviate that intolerable delay which seems always necessary between races  then were made engagements for the ball quadrilles and waltzes were given in exchange for sandwiches and alelieutenants were to be had for sherrya glass of champagne would secure a captain  great was the crowd round mrs mckeons car and plentiful the partners who solicited the honour of dancing with lyddy louey and feemy mckeon was there in all his glory shaking hands with every onepraising his mare with his mouth full of ham and uttering vehement eulogiums on gayner between the different tumblers of porter which in his joy he seemed to swallow unconsciously then bob came up himself glowing with triumph for he knew that he had acquitted himself more than ordinarily well he had changed all his clothes for he had been completely drenched by his fall in the brook and now having nearly altogether fasted for the last fortyeight hours was not at all disinclined to assist at mrs mckeons banquet  he shook hands with her and all the three girls round and with tonyalthough he had already done that three times before and he began a full history of the race which we neednt repeat  i knew brickbat was as fat as a bullock he couldnt keep the pace up but ill tell you what tony if any horse there could beat playful it was conqueror but george cant waiti win fifteen pound from himhes made a bad thing of itlost his horse and all  did you see the horse bob when you came to the big ditch  by my honour then i didnt see anything from the time i got out of the brook id enough to do to sit where i was and keep the mares head straight when she made the great leap i hardly felt her feet come to the ground she came down so lightly  while he was speaking ussher came up to the car and began congratulating them he had now openly stated that he was to leave the country altogether and that he had been ordered to cashel mrs mckeon was therefore no longer at a loss to account for feemys melancholy and whilst she felt a cordial dislike to the man who she thought had so basely deceived feemy and was now going to desert her she was heartily glad for her sake he was going and reflected that as he was to be off tomorrow it was useless for her now to begin to be uncivil to him  im glad to congratulate you mr mckeonim glad you won as my friend brown didnt a bad thing his losing his horse isnt it  thank ye captain and im to congratulate you too i hear youre promoted and going away from usvery glad for one sorry for tother take a bit of cold pie dn it i forgotthe pies all gone but theres cold mutton and plenty of sherry lyddy give captain ussher a glass of sherry  and ussher went round to the side of the car where feemy was sitting and shook hands with her and the other girls it was the first time through the whole long morning he had come near her indeed it was the first time he had seen her since his short visit at mrs mckeons and very cruel poor feemy had thought such conduct yet now when he merely came to speak a few words it was a relief to her and she took it actually for a kindness she felt herself so fallen in the worldso utterly degradedshe was so sure that soon every one else would shun her that she shuddered at the idea of his illtreating or deserting her he soon left her having got an opportunity of desiring her in a whisper to dance the first quadrille with him as he didnt think he should remain late at the ball  as for ussher himself he would now have been glad if he had been able to have got rid of feemy altogether as i said before when he started for ballycloran on the day that he heard he had to remove his quarters he had by no means made up his mind as to what he would do it was not at that time at all his purpose to induce feemy to leave her home or go with him in the scandalous manner he had at last proposed it was the warmth of her own affection and the vanity which this had inspired or rather strengthened in his breast that had at the moment induced him to do so and now he could not avoid it he had told his sporting friends of his intention and if even he could have brought himself to endure their ridicule by leaving her behind him he had gone so far that he could not well break off with feemy herself  he was considerably bothered however by his position he felt that she would be a dreadful chain round his neck at the place he was going to and he began already to dislike her poor feemy she had already lost that for which she had agreed to sacrifice her pride her family her happiness and herself  ussher now returned to his two friends whose tempers were by no means improved by the calamity which had occurred fred declared it was all georges faultthat he had ridden his horse too fast or too slowthat he had been too forward or not forward enough his temper was by far too much soured by the loss of his own bets to allow him to console his brother for the more serious injury he had suffered  at length however the three got into the drag and returned to brown hall after dinner each endeavoured to solace himself by no stinted application to the bottle george declared that as he had been able to drink nothing for the last three days hed make up for it now and that he wouldnt allow himself to be disturbed to dress for the best ball that could be given in ireland fred however was not so insatiable and at about eleven he and ussher dressed and again drove into carrick  the ball at carrick passed off as such balls always do there was but little brilliancy but a great deal of good humour the dresses were not the most costly nor possibly the most fashionable but the faces were as pretty and the figures as good as any that could be adorned for almacks by a parisian headdresser or milliner the band was neither numerous nor artistic but it played in good time and never got tired the tallow candles fixed in sconces round the walls of the room in which a short time since we saw some of our friends celebrating the orgies of bacchus gave quite sufficient light for the votaries of the nimblefooted muse to see their partners mind their steps and not come in too rude collision with one another quadrilles succeeded waltzes and waltzes quadrilles with most unceasing energy and no one dreamt of giving way to fatigue or supposed that it was at all desirable to sit down for a single dance from ten to two they kept it up without five minutes pause and then went joyfully to suppernot to drink half a glass of wine and eat a mouthful of jelly or blancmanger standingbut to sit down with wellprepared appetite to hot jointsham and chicken veal pies potatoes and bottled porter and then the songs that were sung it would have done your heart good to hear young fitzpatrick sing the widow machree and then all the punch that was mixed and the eloquence that was used not in vain to induce the fairer portion of the company to taste it  this state of things was not however allowed to remain long it was not at all the thing that menat any rate unmarried menshould waste their time in drinking when they had come there to dance and after the ladies had left them about ten minutes messages came hot and thick from the ballroom desiring their immediate presence nor were they so bold as to neglect these summonses excepting some few inveterate sinners who having whiskey and hot water in their possession and looking forward to a game at loo neglected the commands which were brought to them  soon again the fiddles sounded and quick feet flew round the floor with more rapidity than before the tedium of the quadrille was found to be too slow and from three till six a succession of waltzes reels and country dances kept the room in one whirl of confusion and at last sent the performers home not from a feeling of satiety at the amusement but because from very weariness they were no longer able to use their feet  feemy early in the evening had danced with ussher and received his final instructions respecting their departure on the morrow he was to leave brown hall early for mohill and freds gig and horse were to be sent over to him there he was to send his heavy luggage on by the car and leaving mohill about seven when it would be dusk drive by the avenue at ballycloran and pick feemy up as he passed and they would then reach longford in time for the mailcoach during the night  ussher calculated that feemy would not be missed till he had had two hours start and that then it would be impossible to catch him before he reached dublin  but myles said feemy how am i to get home you know i am at mrs mckeons now  why how helpless you are replied he cant you easily make some excuse to get home say you are illand sickand want to be at home or if it must come to that say you will go home whos to stop you  but i wouldnt like to quarrel with them myles just now too when theyve been so kind to me  well dearest you neednt quarrel with them say youre ill and wish to be at home but dont make difficulties love dont look so unhappy youll be as happy as the day is long when were once awaythat is if you still love me feemy i hope after all im doing for you youll not be sullen and cold to me because youre leaving such a hole as ballycloran if you dont love me feemy say so and you may stay where you are  oh myles how can you say such words now you know i love youhow much i love youelse i wouldnt be leaving my home for you this way and though ballycloran is  here the poor girl could say no more for she was using all her energies to prevent herself from sobbing in the ballroom  good gd youre not going to cry here come out of the room feemy and he led her into the passage where under the pretence of looking at the moon they could turn their faces to the window what are you crying for now  dont you know i love you why else would i be going with you  well dont cry then but mind i shant see you again before the time for im going out of this at once now i shall be at the avenue at a quarter before eight dont keep me waiting if you are there first as you will be walk a few steps along the mohill road so as to meet me no one will know you if you should meet any one for it will be nearly if not quite dark the moon wont rise till past ten do you understand feemy  oh yes i understand  well good night then my own love for i must be off  but myles i want to say one thing  hurry then dear what is it  what ll i do about my things  what things  why myles i must bring some things with me clothes you know and things of that sort  this puzzled ussher rather he had considered that he should have enough trouble with feemy herself he had quite forgotten the concomitant evils of the bandboxes bundles and draperies which it would be necessary for feemy to take with her  ah you can get clothes in dublin you cant want to take much with you you can bring a bundle in your hand just that distance cant you eh feemy  feemy could not but think that a week since he would not have asked her to carry all her travelling wardrobe in a bundle in her hand however she only said  why not well myles i shall have so many things to think of but i shant have much and if youll let me ill send biddy to meet you with what i must take shell meet you on the road and put it into the gig  good heavens what do you mean would you tell the girl what youre going to do why shell tell your father and thady and raise the whole country on me  no she wouldnt myles she wouldnt tell anybody a word when i told her not you dont know those sort of people shed not say a word so if youll let me ill send her on to meet you with my things  with a good deal of reluctance ussher agreed to this and then again enjoining feemy not to keep him and the gig waiting in the road he took his leave and departed with his friend fred for brown hall first of all taking feemy into the refreshmentroom and making her drink a glass of sherry this did her much good and when she got back into the ballroom she was able to dance with tolerable spirit and mrs mckeon who had been watching her and had seen her dance with ussher was glad to think that her protegée had made up her mind to part with her lover in good spirits and before the evening was over she assured louey with great glee that in spite of all that had been said she foresaw that as soon as that horrid man had been gone three or four days feemy would be as well and as cheerful as ever  feemy was nevertheless very glad when she was told to get her cloak on and found herself on the car going to drumsna she then told her friend that she wanted to be home with her father on the morrowthat she had promised to be home the day after the ball she even pretended that she had received a message that evening from her father begging her return mrs mckeon did not think much about it supposing that feemys presence might be necessary for household purposes at ballycloran and she readily promised her the loan of the car at four in the afternoon on condition that she would return to drumsna at least in a day or two this feemy promised rejoicing that her expected difficulties as to getting to ballycloran were so easily overcome and going to bed she slept more soundly than she had yet done since she had given her fatal consent to usshers proposal     chapter xx  how captain ussher succeeded   late the next morning feemy and the other girls got up they had slept together to make room in the house for the victorious bob but as father john had prophesied they were all too tired to be much inconvenienced by this immediately after breakfast the car came round and feemy afraid to wish her friends good bye too affectionately lest suspicion should be raised and promising to come back again in a day or two returned to ballycloran  thady was out when she got there but he was expected in to dinner her father was glad to see her and began assuring her that he would do all in his power to protect her from the evil machinations of her brother and then again took his grog and his pipe she went into the kitchen and summoning biddy desired her to follow her up to her bedroom when there she carefully closed the door and sitting down on the bed looked in her attendants face and said  biddy if i told you a secret youd never betray me would you  is it i miss feemy thats known you so long in course i wouldnt and the girl pricked up her ears and looked all anxiety what is it missshure you know av you tould me to hould my tongue never a word id spake to any

any one at all at all  well biddy did you hear captain usshers going away from this intirely  what away from ballycloran  no but from mohill and from county leitrim altogether hes going a long way off to a place called cashel  and what for is he going there and you living here miss feemy  thats the secret biddy im going with him  my and is you married in sacret miss said the girl coming nearer to her mistress and opening her eyes as wide as she could  feemy blushed up to the roots of her hair and said no were not married yet were to be married in dublin we couldnt be married here you know because captain ussher is a protestant  holy mary miss youre not a going to lave the ould religion youre not a going to turn prothesthant is you miss feemy  no biddy why should i turn protestant but

misthress to me but whatll i be doing to help you  and then feemy explained to her her plans and began to pack up the few treasures she could take with her in a box small enough for biddy to carry and the two kneeled down together to the work  feemys tears dropped quickly on the little things she was packing and the poor girl soon followed the example her mistress gave her  ochone ochone miss feemy alanna whatll we be doing widout you and she came round and began kissing her mistresss dress and hands and face what shall we do widout you at all then what will the ould man be doing when youre not to the fore to mix his punch  dont talk that way said feemy shure wont i be coming back to see him when im married  in course you will but itll be a great miss when he and mr thady finds youre gone whatll i say at all when i come back from seeing you offand they finds that you are gone  but you mustnt stay to see me off at all when youve put the box in the gig you must go on to mrs mehans and when you come back you can say youd been down to look for something that was left the day of marys wedding but mind biddy dont say a word about it at mrs mehans and above all dont mention it to katty  not a word miss niver fear but whatll i be doing when youre gone but i suppose its all for the best may sorrow seize him thin av he dont make you the good husband  it was then settled that feemys bonnet and shawl were to be brought down into the sittingroom opposite the diningroomthat dinner was to be put off as late as possiblethat when larry and thady were at their punch feemy was to escape unobserved biddy was enjoined when she slipped out with the box to leave the front door ajar so that her mistress could follow her without making any noise the girl was also to carry down her mistress cloakso that she might the easier run down the avenue  when these things were all settled biddy returned to the kitchen big with the secret but she was too prudent to say or hint anything which could create a suspicion in her colleagues breast  thady came in about the usual dinnerhour and feemy spoke goodhumouredly to her brothermore so than she had done since the day he had desired her not to walk with captain ussher thady himself was less gloomy than usual for he had been rejoiced by hearing that the revenue officer was immediately going to leave the country he had only been told it that morning at mohill as a secret and he therefore presumed that feemy did not know it he thought that he would not distress her by telling her of it nowthat he had better leave her to find it out herself after he was gone but the reflection of the misery it would occasion her when she did know it gave rise to a feeling of pity for her in his heart which made him more inclined to be gentle and tender to her than he had felt for a long time  after sitting over the fire with their father for some time thady said  well feemy these are fashionable hours youve brought with you from drumsna does mrs mckeon always dine as late as this why its half past six  the stupid girl forgot the potatoes thady you could have them now but you know you wouldnt eat them as hard as stones ill go and hurry her  deed and im starving said the father why cant we have dinner then feemy dear why wont they bring dinner in  and feemy went out not to hurry them but to cause grounds for fresh delay at last a little after seven she allowed dinner to go in and following it herself she sat down and made as good a meal as she could and endeavoured to answer thadys questions about the races and the ball with some appearance of having taken interest at any rate in the latter if she did not altogether succeed the attempt was not so futile as to betray her and the dinner passed over and the hot water came in without anything arising especially to excite her alarm at last she heard the front door open and she listened with apprehension to every creak the rusty hinges made as biddy vainly endeavoured to close it without a noise but the sounds which in her fear seemed so loud and remarkable to her attracted no notice from her father or brother then she mixed their punch had thady been looking at her he might have seen a tear drop into the tumbler as she handed it to him but his eyes were on the fireplace and she slipped out of the room without her telltale face having been observed  it was now as she calculated about the time that she should start and with trembling hands she tied on her bonnet having thrown her shawl over her shivering shoulders she opened her book upon the table with a handkerchief upon itplaced her chair by the fire and leaving the candle alight slowly crept through the halldoor down the front steps and into the avenue leading to the road she shuddered when she found herself alone in the cold dark air but soon plucking up her courage she ran down as quickly as she could to the spot where the old gate always stood open and leaning against the post listened intently for the sound of the gig wheels she stood there listening for three or four minutes which seemed to her to be an hour and then getting cold she thought shed walk on to meet ussher as he had directed her but before she had gone a dozen yards the darkness frightened her and she returned as soon as she had again reached the gateway she heard a mans footstep on the road a little above and still more frightened at this she ran back the avenue towards the house till the footsteps had passed the gate she did not however dare again to stand in sight of the road though it was so dark that no one passing could have seen her if she were a few yards up the avenue so she sat down on the stump of a tree that had been lately felled and determined to wait till she heard the sound of the gig  there she remained for what seemed to her a cruelly long time she became so cold that she could hardly feel the ground beneath her feet and her teeth shook in her head as she sat there alone in the cold night air of an october night with no warmer wrapping than a slight shawl thrown over her shoulders there she sat listening for every soundlonging to catch the rattle of the wheels that were to carry her awayfancying every moment that she heard footsteps approaching and dreading lest the awful creak of the housedoor opening should reach her ears  she could not conceive why ussher did not comeshe had absolutely been there half an hour and she thought it must be past tenshe had long been crying and was now really suffering with bodily pain from cold and fright and then the whole of usshers conduct to her since that horrid morning passed through her mindshe saw things now in their true light which had never struck her so before what would she not have given to have been safe again at mrs mckeons to have been in her own room of which she could still see the light through the window in fact to be anywhere but where she was she did not dare however to return to the house or even again to walk down the road poor unhappy feemy she already felt the wretched fruits of her obstinacy and her pride  at last she absolutely heard the frontdoor pushed open and could plainly see a mans figure standing on the threshold it must be thady they had discovered her departure and he was already coming to drag her back she heard his feet descending the hall steps but they were as slow and as deliberate as usual and she could perceive that instead of coming down the avenue he turned towards the stables this was a slight relief to herit was evident she was not yet missed but she was dreadfully cold and what was she to do if thady heard the noise of the gig and perceived that it had stopped at their gate  ussher had driven over to mohill early in the morning and had gotten everything ready for his departure in the manner he had proposed but when the time for starting came he had been detained by business connected with his official duties and it was eight oclock before he was able to bid adieu to the interesting town of mohill he had then at the risk of his own neck driven off as fast as fred browns brokenkneed horse could take him and was proceeding at a gallop towards ballycloran when he was stopped near mrs mehans wellknown shop by biddy who was standing by the roadside opposite  he stopped the horse as quick as he could and biddy came running to him with feemys bundle  is that yer honer at last glory be to god but i thought you wor niver coming the misthress ll be perished with the could  never mindhurrygive me what youve got and biddy handed in the bundle and cloak and ussher again drove on  musha then but hes a niggardly baste soliloquised biddy not to give me the sign of a bit of money after waiting there for him these two hours by the roadside and me with his sacret and all that could ruin him if i chose to spake the word only i wouldnt for miss feemys sake but maybe it was the hurry and all that made him be forgitting for he was niver the man for a mane action i wish he may trate her well thats all for hes a hard man and its bad for her to be leaving the ould place without the priests blessing  ussher was at the gateway but when he got there he could not see feemy he waited about a minute and then whistleda minute more and he whistled again what should he do it would be so foolish now for him to go without her he knew the horse was steady and would stand so he got out and walked up the avenue till he saw the figure of feemy still sitting on the root of the tree where we left her there was a light colour in her shawl and the little white collar round her neck enabled him to see her at some distance and she saw or at any rate heard him but she neither moved to or from him  she had caught some time since the sound of the gig wheels but just as she did so she again saw the figure of thady as he came round from the stables and he evidently had heard it also for he stood still on the open space before the house he was smoking for she caught the smell of the tobacco and she plainly heard the stones on the pathway rattle as he now and then struck them with the stick in his hand he didnt move towards her but there he stood as if determined to ascertain whether the vehicle which he must have heard would pass along the road by the gate  then the sound ceased it was when biddy was putting in it the cloak and bundle and again it continued closer and closer the road came round the little shrubbery through which the avenue passed the gig was therefore at one time even nearer to feemy than it would be when it stopped at the avenue gate and when it passed this place she fancied she could hear ussher moving in his seat she did not dare to stir however for there still stood thady listening like herself to the sounds within forty yards of her and had she risen he must have seen her  and now the gig stopped at the avenue gate feemy was all but fainting what with the cold and her former fear and the dreadful position in which she found herself she could not have moved if she had tried she just preserved her senses sufficiently to torture her and that was all plainly she heard her lover whistle and plainly thady heard it too for he kept his stick completely still and took the pipe from his mouth then the second whistlethen she heard usshers foot on the groundheard him approaching and saw his figure draw nearer in vain she endeavoured to make signs to him in vain she thought she whispered keep back for when she tried to speak the words would not come on he came till he was close to her and in a low voice he said  feemy is that you why dont you come what are you here for and he put down his hand to raise her feemy tried to rise and whisper something but she was unable and when ussher stooped and absolutely lifted her from her seat she had really fainted come feemy said he still unaware of thady being near come this is nonsensehurry theres a love come feemy stand cant you  when thady had first come out of the house it had merely been for the purpose of going into the stable as was his practice to see the two farm horses fed as he returned he caught the sound of usshers gig but it was more for the purpose of smoking his pipe in the open air than from any curiosity that he lingered out of doors when however the vehicle stopped at ballycloran gate and he heard the whistle twice repeated his interest was excited and he thought that something was not right he then heard usshers footsteps up the avenue and he fancied he could hear him speak but he had no idea who he was nor had he the slightest suspicion that his sister was so near him  but when ussher stopped thady gently came down the avenue unperceived he saw him stoop and lift something in his arms but still up to this time he had not recognised the voice it was thadys idea that something had been stolen from the yard which the thief was now removing under cover of the darkness by degrees as he got nearer he perceived it was a womans form that the man was half dragging half carrying and then he heard usshers voice say loudly and somewhat angrily this is dd nonsense feemy you know you must come now  these were the last words he ever uttered thady was soon close to him and with the heavy stick he always carried in his hand he struck him violently upon the head ussher when he had heard the footsteps immediately behind him dropped feemy who was still insensible upon the path but he could not do so quick enough to prevent the stunning blow which brought him on his knees his hat partially saved him and he was on the point of rising when thady again struck him with all his power this time the heavy bludgeon came down on his bare temple and the young man fell never to rise again he neither moved nor groaned the force of the blow and the great weight of the stick falling on his uncovered head as he was rising had shattered his brains and he lay as dead as though he had been struck down by a thunderbolt from heaven  though it was so dark that thady could not see the blood he had shed or watch how immovable was the body of the man he had attacked still he knew that ussher was no more he had felt the skull give way beneath the stroke he had heard the body fall heavily on the earth and he was sure his enemy was dead  at first he felt completely paralysed and unable to do anything but he was soon aroused by a long sigh from poor feemy the cold had revived her and she now regained her senses thady threw his stick upon the ground and stooping to lift her up said  oh feemy feemy what have you brought upon me  when she recognised her brothers voice and found that she was in his arms she said  where am i thady what have you done with him where is he  never mind now hes gonecome to the house  gonehes not gone dont i know he would not go without me and then escaping from her brothers arms she screamed myles myleswhat have you done with him ill not stir with you till you tell me where he is and then the poor girl shuddered and added oh im cold so miserably cold  come to the house with me feemythis is no place for you now  ill not go with you thady its no use for you shant make me tell me what youve done with himill go nowhere without him  thady paused a minute thinking what hed say and then replied youll never go with him now feemy for captain ussher is dead  feemy only repeated the last word after her brother and again fell insensible on the ground  thady at length succeeded in getting her to the house and pushing open the front door which was still unlatched with his foot took her into her own room on the left hand side of the passage and deposited her still insensible on the sofa he then went into the kitchen and sent katty to her assistance  pat brady was sitting over the kitchen fire smoking though this man was still hanging about the place and had not come to an actual rupture with his master still there had been no cordiality or confidence between them since brady had failed to induce thady to keep his appointment at the widow mulreadys and for the last two days not even a single word had passed between them now however there was no one else but pat about the place and thady felt that he must tell some one of the deed that he had done it would be useless to consult his father his sister was already insensible the two girls would be worse than useless besides he could not now conceal the deed he could not leave the body to lie there on the road  brady said he come out i want to spake to you is there a lanthern in the place at all  no mr thady there is not said he without moving what is it you want tonight  come out and bring a lighted candle if you can  brady now saw from his masters pale face and fearstruck expression that something extraordinary had happened and he followed him with a candle under his hat but the precaution was useless the wind blew it out at once  pat said thady as soon as the two were out before the front door pat and he didnt know how to pronounce the thing he wished to tell  good god mr thady whats the matther has anything happened the owld man  what owld man  your father  no nothings happened him butbut captain ussher is dead  gracious gloryno why he was laving this for good and all this night and how did he dieand he whispered in his masters eardid the boys do for him  i killed him by myself answered thady in a whisper  you killed him mr thady ah now youre joking  stop said thadyfor they were now in the avenuejoking or not his body is somewhere hereand he had feemy here dragging her along the road and i struck him with my stick across the head and now theyll say ive murdhered him  brady soon touched the body with his foot and the two raised it together and put it off the path on the grass and then held a council together as to what steps had better be taken  brady after his first surprise and awe at hearing of usshers death was over spoke of it very unconcernedly and rather as a good thing done than otherwise he recommended his master to get out of the way he advised him at once to go down to drumleesh and find out joe reynolds he assured thady that the man would even now be willing to befriend him and get him out of harms way he told him that reynolds and others had places up in the mountains where he might lie concealed and where the police would never be able to find him and that if he only got out of the way for a time it might probably not be found murder by the coroner and that in that case he could return quietly to ballycloran  thady listened sadly to bradys advice but he did not know what better to propose to himself he remembered the last words which reynolds had said to him and he made up his mind to go down at once to corney dolans who was a tenant of his own and from him find out where reynolds was  but pat said thady when he had made up his mind to the line of conduct he meant to pursue what shall we do with the mans body we cant let it lie here as i trust in god i had no thoughts to kill him and i would not run away and lave the body here as though id murdhered him  jist lay him asy among the trees mr thady till youre out of the counthry and then ill find itby accident in course and get the police to carry it off thim fellows is paid for sich work  no pat that wouldnt do at all i wont have them say i hid the body every one ll know twas i did it mind i dont ask you to tell a lie about it and ill not have it left here as though id run away the moment afther i struck him we must take him into the house brady  into the house yer honer not a foot of it why youd have miss feemy in fits and the owld mand be worse still wid all thim fellows coming from carrick and sitting on the body discoursing whether it wor to be murdher or not  well then well take it to mrs mehans  av you do mr thady the country ll have it all in no time howsomever they must take it there if you choose as its a public but youd better lave it where it is and let me send it down by and byjist to give you an hours start or so  this thady absolutely refused stating that he would not leave the body till he had seen it deposited in some decent and proper place and the two men took it up between them and carried it away meaning to take it to mrs mehans but at the avenue gate they found fred browns horse and gig exactly where ussher had left it excepting that the horse was leisurely employed in browsing the grass from the ditch side  brady soon recognised both the horse and gig as belonging to brown hall and he then proposed putting the body of its former occupant in it and driving it to the station of the police at carrickonshannon and restoring at the same time the horse and gig to its proper owner at brown hall to this scheme thady at last agreed but he made the man promise him that when he got to the police at carrick he would tell them that he thady had desired him to do so and that instead of running away he had not left the body till he had seen it put into the vehicle to be carried into carrickonshannon and with these injunctions brady departed with his charge     chapter xxi  the coroners inquest   during the short time that elapsed between the heavy blow which had occasioned usshers death and the departure of pat brady with the gig a great many thoughts had passed through thadys mind although he had been in action the whole time his first idea had certainly been that ussher was carrying off feemy against her will the last words which ussher had spoken before his death and which were the only words of his that thady had heardthis is dd nonsense you know you must come nowcertainly were calculated to make him think so but he soon reflected that had this been so feemy could not have been sitting alone in the place where ussher found her besides her own conduct when she came to herself disproved it feemy had therefore evidently been a consenting party still however he thought that he could not but be justified in doing what he had done in his sisters defence even though his interference was in opposition to her wishes then he thought of the man himself whom he had known so long seen so frequently and hated so bitterly there he was nowdeada cold corpseentirely harmless and unable to injure him or his more but thady already felt his enemys blood heavy on his conscience and he would have died himself to see him rise on his feet thoughts as to his own safety crowded on his mind he felt that if he intended boldly to justify the deed he should himself declare what he had donesee that the body was properly taken care ofand give himself up at once to the police as to the fact of his having killed the man that he had declared to his sister before he had at all thought what his conduct ought to be and he had done the same to brady it was useless for him therefore to attempt to conceal it even if he had wished to do so but he felt afraid to give himself up to the police he abhorred the idea of what he thought would be the disgrace of being in confinement and instead of going as he at first thought to have done at once to father john and telling him all that had happened he listened to bradys traitorous advice and determined to take himself at any rate for a time to the fancied security of joe reynolds and his haunts  after brady had departed he stood on the road till he could hear no longer the sound of the retreating wheels and while standing there determined he would not leave the place for the last time perhaps till he had told his father what had happened and ascertained whether feemy had recovered he reflected that it would be a dreadful thing for her to tell her father and the servants and to be called on to explain why her brother was away having made this resolution he walked again up to the house  he pushed the door open and at once went into his sisters room here she was still lying on the sofa and katty was sitting beside herbegging her mistress to tell her what was the matter but feemy had not spoken since she had been there she had recovered her senses for she held her hands before her eyes and the tears were falling fast beneath them but she had not spoken a word to katty since her brother had placed her on the sofa  when he entered the room she uncovered her eyes for a moment but as soon as she saw him she buried her face in the pillow and it was plain from her sobbing that she was crying more violently than before  thady walked up to the sofa and as he did so the girl got up  go out katty said he i want to spake a word to your misthress but be in the kitchen ill call you when ive done  she retreatednot however farther than the door which she closed and left the brother and sister together the last time they had been so in that roomthe last time the two had conversed alone together before was when thady cautioned his sister against the man he just now killed he thought of this but he was too generous to let the reflection dwell on his mind at such a moment  feemy he said as he attempted to take his sisters handwhich however she violently drew back from himfeemy im going to lave you a long time and i must spake to you firstperhaps the last words ill ever be able to say to you at all feemy darling wont you listen to me theneh feemy  feemy however only buried her head further in the sofa and did not answer him a word  i must spake a word to you continued thady about him that is nowhim that was with you on the avenue i told you feemy he was dead and what i told you then was only too true god knows when i struck him i did not wish for that but how was i to see him with you in his armscarrying you off through the dark night and from your own house without raising my stick to strike him i dont say this to be blaming you now and i dont ask you to tell me why you were there but you must know dearest that it was for your sake i raised my hand and though the blow i struck has killed him you loved you shouldnt now at such a moment turn from your brother who has brought all this upon himself only to protect your honer and your name  still feemy did not turn her face towards him or answer him  well i know whats on your heart and may be its as heavy as that which is weighing on my own i must say a word or two to the owld man that he may not larn from sthrangers what it is his son has done and then i must wish goodbye to ballyclorani trust for iver but theres one thing ill ask you feemy before i go there ll be men from carrick here before the night is over looking for me and when they come theyll be asking you all manner of questions about this deed tell them it was i that did itbut tell them how and why i did it tell them that it was not my purpose to kill the man but that i could not see him dragging my sister from her house before my eyes without raising my stick against the man that was doing it that feemy is all i want of youand he turned to go but when he reached the door he returned and putting his hand on his sisters shoulder saidsister my own sister will you kiss me before i lave you for so long  feemy shuddered horribly as she felt his hand upon her thady quickly withdrew it for he saw it was all covered with blood feemy however had seen it for she screamed loudlyshe had raised her head to answer and at last she saidkiss you no i hate youyoure a murdherer youve murdhered him because you knew i loved him go awaygo out of that youll kill me too if you stand there with his blood upon your hand  thady who had fallen on his knees to kiss his sister now hastily jumped upon his feet and a dark frown came upon his brow it was just upon his lips to tell his sister to whose folly it was owing that myles ussher was now a corpse but before the words had left his mouth he checked himself even then at that saddest moment of all when the horrid word he so dreaded had been applied to him by the only person whom he really loved he was able to restrain his passion and was too highminded to add to the suffering of his sister though she was so unjust and cruel to him  god forgive you feemy he said but thats a cruel word to come from youand he left the room he met the two girls in the passage for biddy had returned from mrs mehans whither she had gone after ussher had passed and she was now horrified to find that her mistresss plans had been as she thought defeated by her brother and her departure prevented  good god mr thady said she with pretended astonishment what ails the misthress then  go in to her biddy shell want you captain ussher is dead and he went into his fathers room  here a still more distressing scene awaited him he felt that if he meant to escape he should not lose much time but he could not leave his father in ignorance of what had taken place larry was sitting as usual over the fire with his pipe in his mouth and was nearly asleep when thady came in the noise of the closing door roused him however but he only put his empty glass to his lips and when he found there was nothing in it he turned round again dissatisfied to the fire  larry said his son ive bad news for you  youve always bad news i niver knew you have anything else  im going to lave you father altogether  faix then thats no such bad news said the cross old man the doors open and youve my lave may be we ll do as well without you as were like to do with you  thady made no answer to this piece of silly illnature but continuedlarry youll be sorry to hear what ive to tell you but id sooner you should hear it from me than from another myles ussher is dead it was i father that killed him  at the first declaration the old man had turned round in his chair and he sat staring at his son but when he heard the second and more dreadful part of the story his jaw dropped and he sat for some time the picture of an idiot  he was bringing disgrace on you larry and on your name he was disgracing your family and your daughter and myself he was dragging feemy away with him by night i saw him with her speechless and fainting in his arms and i struck him down as he was doing it with my stick i didnt think father to strike so hard but his skull was broken and he died without a strugglethe old man still stared at him and thady continued  and now father i am going to lave you for av im found here when they come to look for me theyll take me to prison and may be when they come to hear the truth of it alland i suppose they willtheyll see i didnt mane to kill him but if they call it murdher why then i trust youll niver see me agin  murdher at last said the old man laughing who doubts but that it was murdher in course theyll call it murdher well he was the only frind youd left me and now that youve murdhered him you may go now you may go nowbut mind i tell you theyll be sure to hang you  this was old macdermots last address to his son it was very evident that the poor old man had gradually become more and more imbecile during the last few days and the suddenness of the melancholy news he now heard utterly destroyed his mind each however of the dreadful words he uttered fell with an awful appearance of intention and sane purpose on the ears of his son he had hitherto restrained his feeling powerfully and had shown no outward signs of strong emotion but when his father said that there was no doubt the deed hed done was murder he burst into a flood of tears and left the room without being able to articulate a word  when the police came which they did before the night was over in search of thady they were unable to make anything of the old man at first he took them for emissaries of keegans and swore that they should not have admittance into the house and when they were in it he endeavoured to hide himself declaring at the same time that he understood the law that the money was not due till november and that keegan had no right to send the men there harassing him yet when however he was made to understand that it was not about keegan and the rents but about the death of ussher that they had come he whimpered and whined declaring that he had not murdered him that he loved ussher better than any one in the worldyes better than his own childrenand that for the world he would not hurt him when at length the men explained to him that they were only there to look for thady he was worse than ever for he began cursing his son dreadfully swearing that if he had committed the murder he would neither hide nor screen him and finally declaring that he hoped they might catch him and hang him  the next morning he was taken away to give evidence before the coroner at carrickonshannon it was the first day since the summer that he had been above a few yards from his own halldoor and though the day was fine he suffered much from the cold when he got to his destination he could hardly speak the room was greatly crowded for the whole neighbourhood had by that time heard of the event and when the poor old man had warmed himself by the fire near which a seat had been procured for him he smiled and nodded to those around perfectly unconscious of the cause which had brought him there but evidently thinking it must be holiday occasion  brady had stated to the coroner pretty accurately what he knew for there was nothing which it could have benefited him to falsify the two girls proved that after brady had started with the body thady had had interviews with his sister and his father and it was necessary that both of them should be examined  when the book on which he was to be sworn was handed to larry macdermot he at first refused it and when it was again tendered to him he put it in his pocket and made the man who gave it to him a bow the coroner seeing he was in such a state of mind as rendered him unable to give evidence and unfit to be sworn asked him some questions on the subject but larry instantly began to cry and protest his own innocence swearing as he had done before that he had loved ussher better even than his own family  it was a most melancholy sightthat poor weak old man whom so many of those now present had known so long and who so very few years before had been in the full strength of manhood and health for even now he was hardly more than fifty  but sad as all this was the examination of feemy was still worse as she had been actually present at the moment when ussher had been killed it was absolutely necessary that her evidence should be taken by the coroner and the sergeant of police who came with a car from carrick for them in the morning insisted in spite of all that she and the maids could say to the contrary that she must accompany him back she had got on the same car with her father biddy and the other girl were on the same seat with her one on each side but before they reached drumsna she was in such a state that they could hardly keep her on the seat  when they reached that village the car was stopped by father john he had heard of the sad occurrence late on the previous evening for pat brady had spared no exertions in disseminating the news of the catastrophe far and wide as he returned from carrick he had stopped at the priests gate and finding father john absent on a sick visit had nearly frightened judy out of her life by telling her what had happened father john had not returned home till two in the morning and he then heard some garbled version of the story from which he was led to believe that thady was in custody at carrick for the murder of ussher  early on the morning of the inquest he went into carrick and there learnt from the police the truth and ascertained the fact that an inquest was held on the body that day and that both old macdermot and his daughter were to be examined at it  up to this time father john did not know that feemy had left drumsna and though the police informed him that she had been absolutely present when the fatal blow was struck he could not believe it and hurried off to mrs mckeons to tell her all that he knew and learn from her all that she could tell him  the kindhearted man hardly knew what he was doing so shocked was he and surprised by what he had heard he could hardly believe that after what thady had said to him after the promises he had made he would deliberately and with premeditation plan and execute usshers murder such an idea was incompatible with the knowledge that he had of thadys disposition and he concluded that there must have been some quarrel between the two men in which ussher had fallen the victim he little dreamt when he started for mrs mckeons how much more justly the blood which had been shed was to be attributed to the sister than to the brother or he would hardly dared again to solicit her kind offices for his protegée  when he got to drumsna the mckeons were only just rising from breakfast but father john saw on entering the room from their grave and anxious faces that they had all heard the news tony had been out to his fields before breakfast and had there been told by one of the men that usshers body had on the previous night been taken through drumsna to the police station at carrick and that it was said that thady macdermot the murderer had already escaped out of the country  this tale tony had communicated in a whisper to his wife and she had afterwards told the girls what was the good of keeping it secret before the evening it would be known to the whole country when father john came in they all crowded round him to learn what really might be relied on as the truth of the case but he could only tell them that it was too sure that ussher had died by thadys handthat that young man was not in custodyand that he had been informed that feemy herself was present when the blow had been struck  feemy and their poor father added father john are to be examined today before the coroner it will be a dreadful thing for her poor girl to be forced to tell all her secrets to declare all that she would most wish to conceal before the mob that will be in the room at carrick  yes added tony and to stand there without any one to support her and to be asked questions which if theyre answered correctly may be will hang her brother  ill never believe said father john that he killed him in cold blood yourself mrs mckeon hasnt a kinder heart within you than that young man he never would have committed a wilful premeditated murder i dont think yet it will come to be so bad as what mckeon says but when did feemy leave this i thought she was here and was to stay here for some time to come  mrs mckeon then explained how feemy had insisted on returning home the morning after the ball with the promise of returning again after talking over the various unaccountable circumstances of the case without once suspecting that feemy had consented to and had actually been in the act of going off with ussher mrs mckeon agreed at the instigation of her husband and the priest to accompany feemy to the inquest and after it was over to bring her to her own house and to allow her to remain there till something should be definitely arranged as to her future residence  for said tony ballycloran will be no place for her again nor the county either for the matter of that but now that shes unhappy she shant want a roof over her head we were glad enough to see her when she held her head high and i wouldnt advise any one to say much against her now shes in throubleunless he wished to quarrel with me and tony mckeon closed his fist as much as to show that if any one did entertain so preposterous a wish he could be little better than a born idiot  tony then sent a message into carrick for a postchaise that feemy might not be exposed to the curiosity of every one in the street by sitting on an outside vehicle and when she arrived in drumsna from ballycloran she was taken off the car on which her father was sitting and brought into mrs mckeons house she would not however speak to any one and could hardly sit on a chair without being supported she squeezed however her kind friends hand when she promised to go to the inquest with her and seemed grateful when she was told that she should not return to ballycloran but should again occupy her old quarters at drumsna  at length they got into the hack chaise and were driven into the yard of the hotel where the inquest was to be held this was the same house in which mckeon and his party had dined on the evening before the races and there the cold stiff body of the man was lying on the same table round which he and so many others were carousing but a few hours since there he lay at least all that mortal remained of him who was then so joyous so reckless and so triumphant in the very room in which he had boasted in his wilful wickedness of the sad tragedy he was intending to inflict on those who had been so friendly to him at ballycloran and of which he was now himself the first victim  the table on which he was laid out had been hastily removed for the dance and it had now been as hastily replaced for its present purpose the laurel wreaths with which the walls had been decorated were yet remaining and when the coroner entered the room his foot slipped on a faded flower which some wearied beauty had dropped when leaving it on the previous morning little more than four and twenty hours had elapsed since the fiddles were playing there and some of those who were now summoned upon their oaths to decide in what manner ussher had met his death had on that morning been nearly the last to leave the room in which they were now to exercise so different a vocation  biddy and katty were first examined and it was from the evidence of the former that father john first heard that feemy had agreed to elope with ussher and it appeared from what the girl said that her mistress was to have left the house some time previous to the time at which the other girl proved that she had been brought back by her brother this added greatly to his sorrow but at the same time he now instantly perceived under what provocation thady had struck the fatal blow brady proved that his master had confessed to him that it was he who had killed ussher and that he had said that when he did so his sister was in usshers arms the stick was then brought forward which was proved to be the one usually carried by thady and the blood upon the stick and the nature of the wound upon the dead mans head left no doubt that this was the weapon with which he had been killed  the father was then brought in and we have already seen the manner in which he conducted himself it was now necessary to examine feemy and at last she came in almost carried in mrs mckeons arms with a thick veil over her face which however well it hid her countenance by no means rendered her sobs inaudible two chairs were placed for them by the table and when they were both seated the book was handed to feemy then she had to take her glove from her right hand and this was so wetted with her tears and she herself was so weak that it was long before she could get it off and when she had taken the oathwhen she had sworn to tell not only the truth but the whole truthshe found it impossible to speak a word and the coroner was obliged to ask her questions to which mrs mckeon was allowed to get the answers spoken below her breath and in whispers  did she know captain ussher was dead  she did  did she know that it was her brother who had killed him was it her brother thady  yes it was  how did she know it was he who had done it did she see him do it  no she didnt see him  how then did she know it  he had told her so afterwards  could she say how he killed him  no she could not  or why  to this question even mrs mckeon could get no answer  where was she when captain ussher was killed  no answer  was she with captain ussher  she believed she was  why or for what purpose was she with him  to this question although pressed for some time she would not answer and mrs mckeon who was up to this time totally ignorant of the locality in which ussher had been killed and was really unaware how it had come to pass that feemy was present at the time was quite unable to suggest to her what answer she ought to make and finding that it was with difficulty she could keep feemy from falling from her chair she told the coroner she was really afraid miss macdermot was so ill that she would be quite incapable of answering any more questions and she added that considering all the circumstances of the casethat the young lady had been engaged to the unfortunate man who was dead and was the sister of the man who had killed him it was not to be wondered at if she found her dreadful position too much for her  the coroner answered that he was quite prepared to give miss macdermot every indulgence in his power as he felt as strongly as any one could do the distressing situation in which the young lady was placed but that it was absolutely imperative that the last question he had asked should be answered and that he was sure when he stated that the result of the inquest very probably depended on what the answer to the question might beas from that the jurors would probably have to decide whether her brother was to be accused of murder or merely homicidehe was quite sure he said under these circumstances miss macdermot would make an effort to answer it fully and firmly he was willing he added to put the question in a form which might render it more simple for her to answer though it would oblige him to say that which he feared would be still further distressing to her feelings  he then told her and mrs mckeon that from the evidence of the servants it had appeared that she feemy had agreed to elope with captain ussher and that as far as could be judged from circumstantial evidence she was in fact eloping with him when thady had killed him now it was necessary for her to state whether she was there of her own good will going away with him or if not what she was doing at the moment of the tragical occurrence  after many fruitless attempts made by mrs mckeon to get an answer to this feemy said through her friend that she was sitting down  does she mean that she was sitting down when the blow was struck  she doesnt know where she was  when was she sitting down  she was sitting down till captain ussher lifted her up  when captain ussher lifted her up was she going away willingly with him  yes she was  did she struggle with him at all  no  did any of her friends know she was going with him  before however the poor girl could be got to answer this question she had fainted and it was found impossible to restore her for a long time and when she had recovered it was only to give way to the most distressing cries and hysterical shrieks she threw herself on the floor of the bedroom to which she had been taken and mrs mckeon was afraid that she would have broken a bloodvessel in the violence of her emotions as it was she was for a long time spitting blood and fell from one fit into another until the medical man who was now with her was afraid that she would become entirely delirious  it had long been found impossible to proceed with her examination any further she had however unwittingly and hardly knowing at the time what she was saying given evidence against her brother which the facts of the case did not warrant  for when thady had first seen her she was not going willingly with ussher she had then fainted and ussher was dragging her apparently with violence along the road  when it was found in the inquest room that feemy macdermot could not possibly attend again the coroner gave the jury the substance of the evidence on the case he pointed out to them that though there could be no doubt that young macdermot was the man by whom captain ussher had been killed still if they thought there was sufficient ground for them to believe that ussher was illtreating his sister and that the brother had interfered on her behalf they should not come to the decision that murder had been committed  the jury after consulting for a short time brought in a verdict of wilful murder against thaddeus macdermot and accordingly a coroners warrant was issued for his apprehension and trial and was handed over to the police that they might lose no time in endeavouring to take him prisoner     chapter xxii  the escape   thady left the house immediately after the last cruel speech his father made to him with the tears running fast down his face he leapt down the steps hurried across the lawn through the little shrubbery and over the wall into the road he did not dare to go alone down the avenue and by the spot where usshers body had lain and where the ground would still be moist with his blood  his fathers words still rang dreadfully in his earsmurdered of course theyll call it murder of course theyll be sure to hang you and then he thought of all the bearings of the case and it seemed to him that his father must be right that there could be no doubt but that all men would call it by that horrid name which sounded so hideously in his ears if that which he had done was not murder what manner in which one man could kill another would be thought so it was now evident to him that feemy had been with ussher willinglythat she was there of her own consent and by appointment and merely because she had fainted in his arms he had struck him down and killed him of course his father was right of course they would call it murder and then again even if he could justify the deed to himselfeven if he could make himself believe that the man was at the time using violence to his sisterhow could he get that proved whereas proofs of her having consented to go off with him would no doubt not be wanting and then again thady rememberedand as he did so the cold sweat stood upon his browhow lately he had sat in company where the murder of this very man whom now he had killed had been coolly canvassed and decided on and he had been one of those who were to be banded together for its execution would all this be forgotten at his trial would there not certainly be some one to come forward at that horrid hour and swear these things against himay and truly swear them and then he fancied the precision with which he knew each damning word he had lightly uttered would be brought against him would not these things surely condemn him would they not surely hang him it would be useless for him then to open his bosom and to declare to them how hatefuleven during the feverish hours of that detested eveningthe idea of murder had been to his soul it would be useless for him to tell them that even then at that same time he had cautioned ussher to avoid the danger with which he was threatened it would be vain for him to declare how soon and how entirely he had since repented of the folly of which he had on that occasion been guilty the stern faces by whom he would be surrounded at his trialwhen he should stand in that disgraceful spot with his head leaning on that bar so often pressed by murderers miscreants and thieveswould receive his protestations very differently from that benign friend who had previously comforted him in his misery they would neither listen to nor believe his assurances and he said involuntarily to himselfmurder of course theyll call it murder of course theyll hang me  the oftener he thought of this the more he hurried for he felt that the police would be soon in search of him and that at most he had but that night to escape from them as these ideas crossed his mind he hastened along the lane leading to drumleesh sometimes running and sometimes walking till the perspiration stood upon his brow if it was murder that he had doneif the world should consider it as murderthen he would most probably soon be in the same condition as that criminal whose trial had so vividly occurred to his recollection a few days ago at that time the idea had only haunted him he had only then dreamt of the possibility of his situation being the same as that mans and the very horror he had then felt at the bare thought had made him determined to avoid those who could even talk of the crime which would lead to that situation but now he had of his own accord committed that crime and how had he done it in such a manner that he could by no possibility escape detection then again he tried to comfort himself by reflecting that it was not murderthat his intention had not been to murder the man but his fathers horrid words again rang through his ears and he felt that there was no hope for him but in flight  the moon got up when he was about halfway to his destination and he left the road lest by chance there might be any one out at that hour who would recognise him he crept on by the hedges and ditches sometimes running along the bits of grass between the tillage and fencessometimes having almost to wade through the wet bottoms which he crossed often falling in his hurry and in the imperfect light of the cloudy moon till at last tired hot and covered with dirt pale with fear and nearly overcome by the misery of his own reflections he reached corney dolans cabin it was now about eleven oclock it had been past ten when he left ballycloran and in the interval he had traversed above five irish miles there was no light in the cabin which was a solitary one standing on the edge of a bog now he was there he feared to knock as he did not know what to say to corney when he should come to the door besides he was aware that his hands and coat were soiled with blood and he was unwilling that the inmates of the cabin should see him in that plight  he had however no time to spare and as it was necessary that he should do something after pausing a few minutes he knocked at the door no one answered and he had to knock two or three times before he was asked in a womans voice who he was and what he wanted there at that hour of the night he stated that he wanted to see corney dolan the woman told him that corney dolan wasnt at home and that he couldnt see him thady knew that he lived alone with his mother an aged woman nearly eighty years old and that it was she who was speaking to him now  nonsense mother said he hes at home i know and i must see him dont you know me  faix then i dontand i dont want said the old hag at any rate corneys not here so you may jist go back agin whoever you call yerself  but where is he then can you tell me where ill find him  i cant tell you thin what should i know myself so now you know as much about it as i do  well then get up and let me in dont you know me im corneys landlord thady macdermot ill wait here till he comes so get up and let me in  there was a silence for some time then he heard the old woman say to some one else  the lord be praised it cant be himit cant be mr thady coming here at this time of night dont stir i tell yedont stir avick  oh but it wor him mother shure dont i know his voice answered the child that the old woman had spoken to  i tell you it is me shouted thady open the door will you and not keep me here all night  the child now got up and opened the door and let him into the single room which the cabin contained there were still a few embers of turf alight on the hearth but not sufficient to have enabled thady to see anything had not the moon shone brightly in through the door there was but one bed in the placeat the end of the cabin farthest from the door standing between the hearth and the wall and in this the old woman was lying the child about eight years had jumped out of bed stark naked and now in this condition was endeavouring with a bit of stick to poke the hot embers together so as to give out a better heat and light but thady was in want of neither and he therefore desired the boy to get into bed and upsetting with his foot the little heap which the urchin had so industriously collected together for his benefit so as to extinguish the few flickering flames which it afforded he sat down to try and think what it would now be best for him to do  wheres corney then he said at this hour will he be long before hes here  not a one of me rightly knows yer honer maybe it ll not be long afore hes here and maybe it ll not be afore the morning said the child  and maybe not then added his grandmother theres no knowing when he ll be here maybe not for days i dont know whats come to them at all nowbeing out night skirring through the counthry it cant come to no good any ways  when corneys at home where does he sleep said thady looking round the cabin for a second bed but seeing none  he mostly takes a stretch then down there afore the fire but corneys not over partickler where he sleeps for the matter of that i blieve he sleeps most out in the bog at day time  thady now sat down on one of the two rude stools with which the place was furnished either to wait for corney or to make up his mind what other steps he would take he had closed and bolted the door and was just in the act of asking the old woman whether joe reynolds was at present living on his bit of land or if not where he was when he heard footsteps coming up to the little path to the door and the woman sitting up in bed said  theres both on em thin get up terry and open the door  one of the men outside rattled the latch quietly to let the inmates know who it was that desired admittance and the naked boy again jumped out of bed and opening the door ran back and jumped in again  two men now entered whom thady as they appeared in the moonlight through the open door at once recognised as joe reynolds and corney dolan he was seated close to the fire and in the darkness and obscurity of the cabin they did not at first perceive him  a few moments since he had been longing for these two men who now stood before him as the only persons on whom he could depend for security and concealment and now that they were there he almost wished them back again so difficult did he find it to tell them what he had to say and to beg of them the assistance he required  who the divil are you said corney whos this youve got here motherand what made you let him in here this time of night  shure its the young masther corney and he axing afther you you wouldnt have me keeping him out in the cowld and he waiting there to see you that ought to have been at home and asleep two hours since  faix mr thady and is that yerself said corney well anyway youre

of cash  well thats where the stills are mostly at work now an thats where i was to be myself tomorrow evening but now we must both be there before the suns up for no one must see us on the road but mr thady howll i do about taking you there when you wouldnt come to mulreadys to take the oath which all must do afore theyll be allowed among the boys that is together or as will be together there tomorrow evening  thady then promised him that when he reached their destination he would take any or every oath that might be proposed to him that he would join their society in every respect whatever might be its laws and that if they would assist him in his present condition by affording him whatever security might be in their power he would faithfully conform to all their rules and regulations so far did his fears and the agitated state of his mind overcome the great repugnance which still he felt to break the solemn promise he had given father john and which he had so faithfully intended to keep  reynolds reflected that though it was contrary to their regulations to bring a stranger to the haunts where his companions carried on their illegal trade they could hardly be unwilling to give shelter to the man who had killed the enemy whom they all so cordially hated and to murder whom they were all sworn particularly when his present necessity of concealment arose from the fact of his having done so reynolds had an idea of justice in his composition he knew that had he murdered ussher his companions would have used every effort to conceal him and to baffle his pursuers and he was determined that they should do as much for thady  he went back to the cabin for corney dolan and told him the story which he had just heard and at about midnight the party started for the mountains  aughacashel is a mountain on the eastern side of loch allen near the borders of the county cavanuncultivated and rocky at the top but nevertheless inhabited and studded with many miserably poor cabins till within about a quarter of a mile of the summit the owners of these cabins with great labour have contrived to obtain wretchedly poor crops of potatoes from the barren soil immediately round their cabins to their agricultural pursuits many joined the more profitable but hazardous business of making potheen and they were generally speaking a lawless reckless set of peoplepaying some little and others no rent and living without the common blessings or restraints of civilization no road or sign of a road came within some miles of them drumshambo the nearest village was seven or eight miles distant from them and although they knew that neither the barrenness of their locality nor the want of means of approach would altogether secure them from the unwelcome visits of the revenue police or the constabulary still they felt sure that neither of these inimical forces could come into their immediate neighbourhood without their making themselves aware of their approach in time to guard against any injury which they might do them either by removing all vestiges of their trade or by sending those who were in fear of being taken up into the more inaccessible portions of the mountain on the western side of aughacashel immediately over loch allen and about half way between the lowlands and the summit a kind of rude limekiln had been made apparently for the purpose of burning lime for the neighbouring land but the very poor state of the rocky ground about which gave signs of but little industry afforded evidence that the limekiln had not added much to the agricultural wealth of the country it was now at any rate made use of for other purposes for it was in here that joe reynolds at present usually worked his still there were only two cabins immediately close to it one of which was occupied by a very old man and his daughter but in which corney dolan and reynolds resided when they were away from drumleesh and the other belonged to another partner in the business who considered himself the owner of the limekiln and the head of the party concerned in it this mans name was daniel kennedy and to the reckless desperate contempt of authority and hatred of those who exercised it which characterized reynolds he added a cruelty of disposition and a love of wickedness from which the other was much more free  this was the place to which his two guides were now conducting thady and where it was proposed that he should at any rate for some time conceal himself from those who it was presumed would soon be scouring the country in search of him it was now a bright moonlight night and the three men hurried across the country with all the haste they could make little was said between them as they went excepting observations made between joe and his comrade as to the characters and occupations of the residents in the various cabins by which they passed after going for some considerable way across fields and bogs and bottom lands they came out on a lane running close round a small lake lying in the bed of the low hills which rose on the other side of it the water was beautifully calm and the moon shining immediately down upon it gave it the appearance of a large surface of polished silver at this spot the fields came close down to the road and also to the water and in the corner thus formed stood a very small poor cabin  this lake was loch sheen and it was in that cabin that ussher had apprehended tim reynolds and the two other men little more than a fortnight ago  joe stopped a moment when he reached the spot till thady who was following the other man had come up and then pointing to the low door close to which he stood said  the last deed as that ruffian did as now lies so low was in that cabin it war there he sazed tim an dragged him off with ropes round his arms an sent him to ballinamore bridewell an all for spaking a few words of comfort to an owld woman hed known since he war a little child i swore mr thady that that man should be put beneath the sod before the time came round that tim should be out agin an this very night i war a grieving in my heart to think that he war out of the country safe an merryready agin to play the same bloody game with them among he war going an that i should let him go without so much as making one effort to keep my word with him by gd mr thady quare as you may think it who are now so low within yerself with what youve done that thought was heavy on my heart this night had i known what way he war to travel id followed him had it been for days an nights till i had got one fair blow by dad he would niver have wanted a second corney whats the owld hag doing since her two sons is in gaol along with tim  ah thin shes doing badly enough she war niver from her bed since faix joe theyll niver be out in time to bury her  is it starving she is  well thin i blieve thats the worst of it that an the agny an no one to mind her at all is enough to kill an owld woman like her  niver mind replied joe it will be a comfort to her any way to hear that usshers gone before her not but what theyll go to different places though and then after a time he added usshers black soul has gone its long journey this night with more curses on it than there are stones on these shingles but come on lads we mustnt be standing here we must be in aughacashel before sunrise or else theyll be stopping us as we pass through the counthry  and again they went through the clear bright moonlight they passed loch sheen and soon afterwards another little lake lying also to the left of the road and then they found themselves in the small village of cashcarrigan this they passed through silently and quickly and without speaking a word and having proceeded about half a mile on the road towards ballinamore they again left it and took to the fields they went along the northern margin of loch dieney running where the ground was hard enough at other times stepping from one dry sod to another through gaps and fences which seemed as well known to thadys guides as the cabins in which they had passed their lives they left drumshambo to their left and at about four in the morning they came to loch allen here they got upon a road which for some way skirts the eastern side of the lake along which they ran for about a mile and a half and then turned into a small boreen or path and began to ascend the mountains  asy boys now said corney were all right when were here an by the powers im hot and the man began wiping his brow with his sleeve  what corney youre not blown yet said the other an heres mr thady as fresh as a four year old come along man the sooner hes got a snug room over his head the better hell be you forget hes not accustomed to be out all night and take his supper of moonshine as you are come along mr thady youll soon be where youll get as good a dhrop as iver man tasted an youll feel a deal better when youve got a glass or two of that stuff in you  thady who in spite of joes compliment as to his freshness was so weary that he could hardly drag his legs along and who had seated himself for a moment upon one of the big loose stones which were scattered over the side of the hill again rose and they all resumed their journey they soon lost the track of the boreen but they still continued to ascend keeping by the sides of the loose built walls with which the land was subdivided it was astonishing what labour had seemingly been wasted in piling wall after wall in that barren place and that even in spots where no attempt had been made at tillage and where the only produce the land afforded was the food of a few miserable sheep and goats which it might be thought could have grazed in safety without the necessity for all those numerous fences these however after a time ceased too but just at the spot where the open mountain no longer showed any signs of mans handiwork dan kennedys limekiln was built and immediately behind it were the two cabins of which we have before spoken  it was at the door of the furthest of these two that joedid not knockbut raised the latch and rattled it the old man within well knew the sign and getting out of bed drew the wooden bolt and admitted the three into the cabin though he did not expect joe or corney and had not an idea who thady was and though thadys dress which was somewhat better than those worn by his usual associates must have struck him as uncommon he made no remark but hobbled into bed again merely saying in irish god save ye kindly boys its a fine night yeve had the lord be praised there was a second bed in the placeif a filthy ragged cotton tick filled with straw and lying on the ground could be called a bedin which the old mans daughter was lying it was nearly dark now out of doors for the moon had disappeared and it was hardly yet six oclock but one of the men lighted a candle of which there were two or three hanging against the wall the girl was not asleep for her eyes were wide open looking at the party but she seemed not at all surprised by their entrance or at the addition to their usual numbers for she lay quite quiet where she was as if such morning guests in her bedchamber were no unusual thing  joe now got a stool for thady and he and corney sat down opposite the fire while reynolds drew a stone jar out from beneath the old mans bedhe seemed well to know the place where it was to be foundand reaching a cracked cup down from a shelf which was fixed into the wall over the fireplace filled it with spirits and handed it to thady he swallowed a considerable portion of it and returned it when joe filled it again finished the contents himself and gave it again full to corney who in a very short time did the same  by gor said the latter i wanted that an i tell you thats not bad work why mr thady  have done with your misthers corney said joe in a whisper let them find out who he is theyselves theyll know soon enough divil doubt them theres no good telling them yet any how  thats thrue joe but as i was saying thats not bad work why mr thady  sorrow saze yer tongue thin ye born idiot  well by dad it comes so natural to me joe to call him by his own name that one cant help it but it war only four oclock when we left this this blessed afthernoonthat is yesterday afthernoonan since that we wor down at mulreadys an then at drumleesh an now were here agin why how many miles is that  niver mind the miles heand joe pointed to thadyhe has done a deal more than that in the same timean whatever comes of it he did a good deed howsomever if youll take my advice youll take a stretch now megi say megand he turned round to the girl who was lying in the cornerget out of that an make room for this man to lie down youve been asleep all night make room for yer betthers now  the girl without grumbling turned out of bed and burthened with no feeling of conventional modesty commenced and finished her toilet by getting into an old ragged calico gown and tying up with a bit of antique tape her long rough locks which had escaped from their bondage during her sleep thady for a long time resisted but joe at last was successful in persuading him to take advantage of the bed which meg had so goodhumouredly relinquished  i an corney have stillwork to do afore daylight an we wont be back afore its night said joe but do you bide here an youll be safe you must put up with the pratees this day for theres nothing better in it at all but ill be getting something fitter for you by night an av you feel low which youll be doing when you wakes mind theres the sperrits in the jar there undher the bed a sup of it wont hurt you now an agin for indeed youll be wanting it by yerself here all day an look youand he led him to the door as he spoke and pointed to the two withintheyll soon know who you are an all about it but you neednt be talking to them you know an you may be quite certain that even should any one be axing about you theyll niver peach or give the word to the police or any one else av you like to go out of this during the day dont go further than the kiln an av you lie there you could easily see them miles afore they war nigh you even av anything should put it into their heads to think of coming afther you to aughacashel  the two guides then took their leave of him and thady laid himself down on megs bed and after a time from sheer fatigue and exhaustion he fell asleep     chapter xxiii  aughacashel   at what hour he woke thady did not know but it was broad day and the sun was high in the heavens he would have slept again if he could that he might again forget the dreadful deed which had made the last night so horrible but he could not he was obliged therefore to get up and when he did so he felt himself weak for want of food meg it appears had gone out the old man could not speak a word of english but thady could talk irish and he had no difficulty in getting plenty of potatoes from him and as he was eating them the old man pulled out the jar of whiskey thady took part of another cup full and then felt less sad than he had done before after his breakfast he sat for a long time over the fire smoked his pipe till he had no tobacco left in it got up and sat down again walked to the door and then again returned to his seat at last he became dreadfully fatigued he felt all the misery which a man usually active always feels when condemned for a time to idleness he sat watching the turf as though he could employ his mind or interest himself in observing the different forms which the sods took or how soon they would reduce themselves to ashes then he counted the smutty rafters on which the crazy roof was supported and then the different scraughs of which it was composed he next endeavoured to think how the old man got through the tedium of his miserable existence there he sat on the bed quite imperturbable he had not spoken ten words since thady had got up and seemed quite satisfied in sitting there enjoying the warmth of the fire and having nothing to do how thady envied his quiescence then he began to reflect what had been this mans life had he always been content to sit thus tranquil and find his comfort in idleness at last he got almost alarmed at this old man why did not he speak to him why did he sit there so quiet doing nothingsaying nothinglooking at nothingand apparently thinking of nothing it was as sitting with a dead body or a ghostthat sitting there with that lifeless but yet breathing creature every now and again as he endeavoured to fill his mind with some idea that was not distressing to him the thoughts of the horrors of his own position would come across himthe almost certainty of detectionthe ignominy of his future punishmentthe disgrace to his father and his sister and even if not detected if left in his present concealment the horrors of such a life as he was now leading a few hours of which had already nearly made him frantic nearly overwhelmed him  he got up and leaving his companion to himself he went to the limekiln and laid himself on the top of it looking down the mountain towards loch allen and drumshambo that he might see if any of the police were coming in search of him the open air was for a time pleasanter than the close heat of the burning turf and solitude by far preferable to the company of that silent old manbut it was only for a short time that he felt the relief the horrid inactivity of the day joined to the weight that was on his mind nearly drove him mad as long as he had work to dowhile he had to dispose of the dead mans bodywhile he had his father and his sister near himas long as he was hurrying through the country with reynoldsthe energy of whose character had for a time relieved himas long as the sweat was pouring down his face and his legs had been weary under himhe had borne much better the misery which he felt now he was always doomed to bear for he had then thought less of the past and the future but now he could occupy his mind with nothing but the remembrance of the death he had inflicted and the anticipation of the death he was to suffer he tried to sleep but it was in vain he tried to imitate that old man and let his mind sleep but no he could only thinkhe could not but think oh he said to himself that it were all overif it were only doneif he could only swallow up the next six months and be dead and forgotten if he had got past that dreadful trialthat cold unfeeling prison with the harsh noise of the large key and the fetters the stern judge and the twelve stern men sworn to hang him if he deserved it if he could escape the eyes of the whole country which would then be on him the harsh cold solemn words which would then be addressed to himthe sorrow of his fatherthe shame of his sisterand last and worst the horrid touch of that dread man with the fatal rope it was not death he fearedit was the disgrace of death and the misery of the ignominious preparations he knew in his heart that heaven could not call it murder that he had done but he felt equally sure that man would do so  he lay there on the limekiln till the sun had already set and then he was again driven into the cabin by the cold  there sat that silent still old man he had not moved from his former position his bare feet thrust into old ragged shoes which in some former generation had been made for some strong man double his size and hanging down so that his toes just reached the floorhis hands resting on the quilt on each side of him and his head dropping on his chest oh what an easy quiet mind thought thady must that man havehow devoid of care and fear must he be to be able to sit there motionless all the livelong day and not feel it dreary long endless insupportable as he did  the girl was still absent and thady again sat himself down by the fire the blazing turf on which gave the only signs that the old man had moved again he counted the rafters counted the miserable scraps of furniture counted the sods of turf speculated where the turf was cutwho cut it who was the landlord of the cabin what rent was paid who collected it but a minutehalf a minute sufficed for the full consideration of all these things and again he began to reflect how long it would be before the police would find him and drag him forth from that dreary place how long it would be before he should feel the handcuffs on his wrist and before the first day of his concealment had passed over he had become almost impatient for that time and looked forward to the excitement of his capture which he knew must sooner or later take place with something like a wish that it might soon occur to relieve him from the weight of his present condition  at last he determined to speak to his companion and after considering for some time what he should say to him he asked him what his name was but thady had spoken in his usual language and the old man looking up answered that he had no english  whats your name asked thady in irish  andy mcevoy  and is this cabin your own  yes  and whos your landlord  the mountain belongs mostly to sir michael  but dont you pay any rent  no  and what is it you do all day long  why then mostly nothing im very old  and what does your daughter be doing  why then i dont rightly know shes mostly out for dan kennedy  and where do you be getting the pratees  deed i blieve meg gets them mostly from dans garden  who does dan pay his rent to  why then i cant be saying  it was useless carrying on a conversation any longer with such a man he neither interested himself about his house his food his landlord or his family and thady again held his tongue  soon after dusk meg returned she had in the folds of her gown a loaf of bread and a very small piece of bacon and it was evident to thady that whatever had become of joe and the other they had not forgotten him or their promise to provide him with some better food than the lumpers which sufficed for andy mcevoy and his daughter  when the old man saw the provisions his eyes glistened a little and he clutched the dirty quilt somewhat faster and by the eagerness he evinced for the food it was a relief to see that he had some human feeling left meg boiled the bacon and some potatoes together and when they were ready put them on the dirty deal table before thady she did not seem much more communicative than her father but she asked him civilly if he would eat and evidently knew he was of a higher rank than those with whom she was accustomed to associate for she went through the ceremony of wiping the top of the table with the tail of her gown thady eat a portion of what was given him and as he did so he saw the old mans greedy eyes glare on him as he still sat in his accustomed seat it was quite horrible to see how greedy and ravenous he appeared thady however left much more than he consumed and the girl carefully putting the bit of bread away for his breakfast in the morning divided the remnant of the bacon with her father  then the mans apathy and tranquillity vanished and the voracity with which he devoured the unaccustomed dainty showed that though he might have no demon thoughts to rack his brain the vulture in his stomach tortured him as violently  joe reynolds and corney returned about an hour after dark and requested thady to come out with them which he did they then told him that it was necessary that he should now take the oath which they before warned him that he would have to take if he accompanied them to their haunts at aughacashel he at first felt inclined to declare that he had again changed his mind and that instead of taking this oath and joining himself in any league with them he was prepared to return home to ballycloran and give himself up to the police but his courage failed him now that he was as it were in their own country and particularly after the kindness and attention that reynolds had showed him he therefore followed them and they entered together the other cabin belonging to dan kennedy dan and his wife and another man his brother were there dan was a sullen surly brutal looking ruffian about fifty years old and his wife was a fitting mate for such a man she was dirty squalid and meagre but there was a determined look of passion and selfwill about her which plainly declared that whoever dan bullied he did not and could not bully his wife  his brother abraham was a cripple having no use in either of his legs but he had an appearance of intelligence and wit in his face which his brother in no degree shared and he was very powerful with his arms it was he who chiefly made the spirits while dan and the others procured the barleybrought it up to aughacashel malted it and afterwards disposed of the whiskey  well my hearty said dan as thady followed his guides into the cabin where his family party were engaged drinking raw spirits round the fire so youve done for that bloody thief of the world have you joe tells me you riz agin him quick enough when you found him at his tricks with yer sisther divil a toe though you stirred to come to mother mulreadys when we axed you in spite of the oath you took on the holy cross but youre quick enough coming among us now youre in the wrong box yourself  asy dan said joe whats the use of all that bother now ant he here and hasnt he rid us of him that would have got clane off from us but for mr thady here that struck the blow we ought to have struck  thrue for you joe said abraham so hould yer jaw dan and give me hoult of the blessed book till i give him the oath  alls right said dan and im glad to see you here my lad of wax seeing what sent you but business first and play after i spose if youre maning to stay here wid usan by gd youre wilcomeyoull not be saying anything agin giving me or corney there a bit of a line to some of your frinds at ballycloran to be sending you up a thrifle of money or so or a few odd bits of duds or may be a lump of mate or bacon or a pound or two of sugar to swaiten the punch  thady looked very blank at this for he by no means wished to be writing to his friends at ballycloran nor were the articles mentioned in dans catalogue at all too plentiful in that place however before he could answer joe indignantly scoffed at his friends shabbiness  dn it dan i didnt think you war that main to be charging a boy for the morsel hed be ating an the sup hed be taking an him undher a cloud an he afther doing us sich a sarvice  av he wor one of ourselves replied dan but a gintleman the likes of him may be would be plased not to be beholden to the likes of us  nonsense dan said joe dont think of giving such a line at all mr thady im not so bad off but ill not see you wanting youre as wilcome to everything here as daylight  spake for yerself youre mighty ready im thinking to spake for others said dans helpmate av the gintlemans willing to help a poor man like dan for putting a house over his head in his throubles whos to hinder him  thady however made them understand that he would give them no such letter to his father or his sister as they proposed and abraham then proceeded to administer the oath to him by this he bound himself first of all never to divulge to any one particularly not to any magistrate or policeman or in any court of law anything that should be done or said in that place where he now was that might be prejudicial to any of the party secondly to give all aid and assistance in his power to all those now present and to any which might be in possession of a certain password and who might be able to answer certain questions with the fit and appointed answers and to help in the escape or concealment of any such when they might be either in confinement or in dread of being arrested and thirdly that he would aid and assist in all schemes of vengeance and punishment which would be entered into by those with whom he was now bound against any who attempted to molest them but especially against all revenue officers and their men  to all these conditions thady bound himself and as he finished repeating each article after abraham he kissed the dirty prayerbook which that man presented to him and having done this he made one of the party round the fire whilst corney dan and joe took it by turns to go out and watch that no unexpected visitor was at hand  when the night was tolerably advanced the three left the family of the kennedys to themselves and returned to andys cabin and thady having refused to allow that meg should be again disturbed for his accommodation they all stretched themselves upon the earthen floor before the fire and were soon asleep  the next morning joe and corney again went away early and thady found himself doomed to pass just such another day as the preceding one  after giving him his breakfast meg again also went out and left thady alone with her father  by way of propitiating the old man he gave him half the bit of bread which he was eating andy devoured it as he had done the bacon and then resumed the same apathy and look of idle contentment which had so harassed thady on the previous day this second day was more grievous more intolerable even than the first he walked from the cabin to the limekiln and from the limekiln to the cabin twenty times he went to kennedys cabin to try if he could kill time by subjecting himself to the brutality of the man or his wife but the door was locked or bolted and there was apparently no one in it he clambered up the hill and then down againand again threw himself upon the walls of the limekiln and looked upon the silver lake that lay beneath him but the day would not passit was not even yet noonhe could see that the sun had yet a heavy space to cover before it would reach the middle of the skies oh heavens what should he do should he sit there from day to day when every hour seemed like an age of misery waiting till he should be dragged out like a badger from its hole he looked towards the village and to different bits of road which his eye could reach thinking that he should see the dark uniform of a policeman but no nothing ever was stirringit seemed as if nothing ever stirredas if nothing had life by day in that lifeless desolate spot at length he thought to himself that he would bear it no longer that he would not remain for a short time indebted for his food to such a man as dan kennedy and then at length be taken away to the fate which he knew awaited him and be dragged along the roads by a policeman with handcuffs on his wristsa show to be gaped at by the country no he would return at once and give himself up he would boldly go to the magistrates at carrickdeclare that he had done the deed and under what provocation he had done it and then let them do the worst they chose with him  after much considering and many changes in his resolutions he at length determined that he would do thisthat as soon as it began to be dusk he would leave the horrid mountain where he had passed the saddest hours that he had yet known and go at once from thence to father john and implicitly follow the advice which he might give him  when once he had definitely resolved on this line of conduct he was much easier in his mind he had at any rate once more something to dosome occupation he had freed himself from the prospect of long weary unending days to be passed with that horrid man and he was comparatively comfortable  he determined to wait till it was nearly or quite dusk which would be about five or halfpast five oclock and then to leave the cabin and making what haste he could to drumshambo go from thence by the road to cashcarrigan and ballycloran and he calculated that he would be able to reach father johns cottage between ten and eleven before the priest had gone to bed and having finally settled this in his mind he returned to the cabin for the last time determined manfully to sit out the remainder of the afternoon in the same apathetic tranquillity which his enemy andy displayed     chapter xxiv  the second escape   for four long hours there he remained seated on the same stool without moving or speaking and for the same time there sat andy on his bed looking at the fire and from time to time dragging a few sods from under the bed to throw them upon the ashes and keep up the warmth which seemed to be his only comfort at length thady thought it was dark enough and without saying a word to the old man he left the cabin and again descended the hill he would not return by the same path by which he had come for fear he should meet joe or corney or megfor he was unwilling that even she should see him escaping from his hidingplace by the time that he reached drumshambo it was dark and it continued so till he got to cashcarrigan which he did without meeting any one who either recognised him or spoke to him from thence he passed back by the two small lakes and the cabin of the poor widow who owed her misery to usshers energy and across the bog of drumleesh to the lane which would take him by ballycloran to father johns cottage but before he reached ballycloran the moon again rose bright and clear and as he passed the spot where he more particularly wished to be shrouded by the darkness it was so light that any one passing could not but recognise him  he pulled his hat far over his forehead and passed on quickly but just as he got to the gateway he met mary mcgovery who was on the very point of turning up the avenue to the house the turn in the road exactly at the spot had prevented him from seeing her before and she immediately recognised him  holy virgin mr thady she said and is that yerself  hist mary dont spake so loudnot that i care who spakes now you see its me and im going to the cottage is father john at home  and what would you do with father john now dont you know the police is afther you  what matther its not much throuble ill be giving thim looking for me im going to thim myself now  an what for would you do that mr thady dont you know they found it murdher agin you we all hoped you were out of the counthry afore this what for would you go to the police time enough when they catches you  this was the first time that thady had heard that a verdict of murder had been found against him before the coroner and though it was only what he expected nevertheless the certainty now that it reached him almost made him change his mind and return to aughacashel the remembrance however of that weary day and the feeling that even though he were there he would assuredly be ultimately taken strengthened his resolution and he said  no mary ive had enough of running away already but tell me hows feemy  why thin mr thady shes nothing much to boast of since she was in carrick yesterday shes been very bad intirely  what is it ails her itsits that mans death isnt it mary  deed mr thady i spose that war the first on it poor young lady in course she feels itwouldnt i feel it av any one was to knock poor denis on the headnot that its the same thing altogether for the captain wasnt her lawful wedded husbandnot that im saying agin you mr thady for what ye did  never mind about that mary what ive done is my own look out but would feemy see me do you think  see you mr thady how could she see you an she in a raging fever in bed at mrs mckeons in course she couldnt see you  good god and is she so bad as that  faith then she is very bad intirely at laste docther blake says so  its very well any way

thin an god bless you mr thady said mary youve a peck of throubles on yer head this night she added to herself as she walked up the avenue an its little you did to desarve em onless working hard night an day war a sin well god forgive us shure youre betther off still than the gay man you stretched the other night and she went on to commence her new businessthat of watching and consoling larry macdermot in his idiotcy  thady pursued his road to the cottage without meeting anyone else and with some hesitation knocked at the priests door his heart palpitated violently within him as he waited some little time for an answer it was about eleven and he knew that at that hour father john would still be up if he were at home though judy would probably have retired to her slumbers he was right in his calculation for in a short time he heard the heavy step of father john in the hall and then the rusty doorkey grated in the lock thadys knees shook beneath him as he listened to the rising latch how should he meet father johns eyes after what he had done how should he find words to tell him that he had broken the solemn vow that he had taken on the holy scriptures and had in his first difficulty flown to the disreputable security to be found in the haunts of such men as joe reynolds and dan kennedy however this he would have to tell him for the door was now open and there stood the priest with his eyes fixed on thadys sad face and soiled appearance  thady had not had his clothes off for the last two nights and they now bore all the soil and stains of his two midnight walks his countenance was pale in the extreme and never full or healthy now seemed more thin and wan than fortyeight hours sorrow could possibly have made it he was much fatigued for his shoes had become soaked with water in the moist grounds through which he had passed and repassed and his feet were blistered with his long and unaccustomed walks  when father john saw him his heart melted within him at the sight of the young mans sad and melancholy figure we already know that from the moment he had first heard of the catastrophe he had made excuses in his own heart for thady and when he had heard as he did at the inquest that his sister had been with ussher when he lifted his stick against him he had not only acquitted him in his own estimation from anything like the crime of murder but he also felt certain that had he been in the same situation he would most assuredly have done the same as thady had done he had been much surprised at the coroners verdict he could not think how twelve men on their oath could call usshers death murder when it so evidently appeared to him that the man stigmatised by that verdict as a murderer had only been actuated by the praiseworthy purpose of defending his sister from disgrace and violence and when moreover it was so plain that thadys presence on the scene at the moment was accidental and that the attack could not have been premeditated  the jurors however had not been thadys friends as father john was nor were they inclined to look upon such a deed with the same lenient eyes it appeared to them that ussher was not using any violence to the young lady who had herself admitted in her evidence that she was a willing party to usshers proceedings doubtless there might be circumstances which at the prisoners trial would be properly put forward in palliation of the murder by his counsel but with that the jury before the coroner could have nothing to do and on these considerations the jurors with very little delay had come to the conclusion which had so surprised and grieved father john still however he looked forward with almost absolute certainty to thadys acquittal at his trial and was by far more angry with the young man himself at his folly in attempting to fly from justice than he was at the deed which had put him under its power now however when he saw him pale fatigued harassed and in sorrow at his door his anger all turned to pity and the only feeling left in his bosom led him to think how he could assuage his sufferings and comfort him in his afflictions  thady was the first to speakfather john he said ive come to give myself up i thought id tell you as i passed the door  oh my son my son said father john come in though thady come intill we think whats best to do in this sad time and they went again into the little parlour where so short a time ago thady had made the promise which he now had to confess he had broken  he then gave the priest by degrees the whole history of the affair he told how the different events had happened he explained how feemys appearance as she lay fainting in usshers arms and that mans words to her when he declared that she must come with him had at the moment made him think that she was being dragged away by violence and that he had had this conviction on his mind when he raised his stick to strike he then told father john exactly what he had done since the occurrence the precautions which he took respecting the bodythe visit which he paid to his father and his sister and lastly how he had fled for the sake of security and passed two miserable days among the mountains in aughacashel  ah my poor boy said father john thats what i have to blame you for what made you fly there what made you fly anywhere why did you not with an honest face at once place yourself in the hands of the police from whom you must know you couldnt have remained concealed  oh father john av you could feel all i felt when i first knew the man was deadwhen my own sisther spurned meand when my father told me i was a murdherer you wouldnt wonder at my flying av it were only for an hour  thats true my boythats very true and i wont ask you now where you were or who were with youor what folly you may have done whilst there for i havent the heart to blame you for what youve done in the extremity of your misery but now thady we must think of the future of course you know that having come to my house and having seen me you must at once place yourself in the hands of the police  in course father john i was only on my way to carrick when i called here in truth i wanted a kind word from you before they put me in that horrid place  my poor dear boy its little comfort i can give you except to tell you that we all thinkthat is mckeon and i and the rest of usthat when the trial comes on they must acquit youany jury must acquit you and that till that time comes you may be sure whatever can be done for you by the warmest friends shall be done by us but you know thady till that time does cometill the trial is over you must remain in prison  but father john do you think theyll acquit me do you thinkdoes mr mckeon think theyll not find it murder  indeed he does thady and so do i and so im sure does the coroner by what he said to the jury im sure he didnt expect them to find it murder at the inquest  thats great comfort father john but you always had comfort for me but tell me whats this i hear about feemy and my father is it thrue theyre both ill  ive little comfort for you in that quarter im afraid but though feemys ill i dont think shes dangerously so she will want time to bring her round but ive no doubt time will bring her round she has had a great deal to try her too she was very fond of that man though he was so unworthy of her and it isnt easy for a girl like feemy to get over at once the loss of him she loved so dearly  god send she may recover i did it all for the best larry was long ailing i fear this has knocked him up intirely whatll the tinants do now at all theyll have no one over thim but keegan i suppose hell be resaving the rints now father john wont he  dont mind that now my boy youve enough on your heart now without troubling yourself about that  well then ill be wishing you good bye ill go on to carrick  no thady not tonight stay here tonight i would not have you go in and give yourself up under cover of the dark early tomorrowas soon as counsellor webb will be up you shall go with me to him hell no doubt commit you indeed he must do so but that will be better for you than lying all night in the guardroom at the police station and being dragged out in the morning cold comfortless and hungry  father john then got him supper and had a bed prepared for him and early in the morning he sent down to ballycloran for his linen and clothes that he might appear in a more respectable manner before the magistrate he had his horse and car ready for them after breakfast and at about ten they started for counsellor webbs  they found the magistrate at home and father john sent in word to him that mr macdermot having heard the verdict which had been returned at the coroners inquest had come to surrender himself mr webb received the two into his study and having explained to thady that it was of course his duty immediately to commit him sent to carrick for police in whose charge it would be necessary that the prisoner should be sent from thence  im very sorry said webb that this should be my principal duty and that i should be obliged to hand you over to the constables but you must have been aware that i should do so when you came to me  father john then took mr webb aside and explained to him all the particulars of the case which had not come out at the inquest and at last it was agreed that he mr webb should go with them into carrickthat they would call at the policeoffice to inform the sergeant there that the prisoner was in custody and that they should go direct to the gaol and that thady should be immediately handed over to the custody of the gaoler this was accordingly done and he avoided the disgrace which he so feared of being led through the town with handcuffs on his wrists  father john did not leave him until he had seen him settled with whatever comfort a prison could afford but of these things now that he was there he seemed to think much less than the priest himself  when father john was kindly petitioning with the governor to allow the prisoner a light in his cell he said what matters a light wont make the time pass over quicker  the next assizes would not take place till april six months after the present time and it was finally agreed that father john should take on himself all the cares connected with his defence and should from time to time visit him in his confinement and give him such news respecting his father his sister and the affairs at ballycloran as he might have to bringand then he took his leave  when he was gone thady was once more alone and in solitude moreover he felt strongly the gloom of the big cold walls around himof the huge locks which kept himthe austerity and discomforts of prison discipline and all the miseries of confinement but yet even there in gaol and committed to take his trial for lifethough doomed to the monotony of that dull cell for six monthsstill he felt infinitely less wretched than he had done whilst sitting in andy mcevoys cabin wondering at the torpidity of its owner the feeling of suspense of inactivity the dread of being found and dragged away joined to the horror he felt at remaining in so desolate a place would have driven him mad now he knew that he had no daily accident to fearno new misfortune to dreadand he nerved himself to bear the six long coming months with fortitude and patience though the time was long and his weary days generally unbroken by anything that could interest or enliven them still from the hour when father john first spoke to him at his halldoor to that in which he was led into the courthouse dock as a prisoner to take his trial for his life he never once repented that he had quitted aughacashel and his mountain security to give himself up as a prisoner to the authorities of carrick     chapter xxv  retrospective   as storytellers of every description have from time immemorial been considered free from those niceties by which all attempts in the nobler classes of literature are or should be restrained we consider no apology necessary for requesting the reader to leap over with us the space of four months but still before we continue our tale from that date it will be as well that we should give a short outline of the principal events which produced the state in which the circumstances of the macdermots will then be found and we are sorry to say that they were not such as could offer much consolation to them  it will be remembered that pat brady was commissioned by his master to take usshers body to the police station at carrick in fred browns gig this commission he promptly performed and also that of restoring the gig to its owner and after having thus completed his masters behests like a good servant he paid a visit on his own account to mr keegan  although it was late he still found that active gentleman up and gave him a tolerably accurate account of what had happened at ballycloran adding that the young masther had gone off to join the boys at laste thats what he supposed hed be afther now as soon as keegans surprise was a little abated he perceived that the affair would probably act as a steppingstone on which he might walk into ballycloran even sooner than he had hitherto thought to do and when as one of the jurors at the coroners inquest on the next morning he saw that poor larry had evidently fallen into absolute idiotcy and heard that thady had in fact escaped he instantly determined to take such legal steps on behalf of his fatherinlaw as would put the property under his management and this accordingly he did the proper steps for proving the old man to be of unsound mind would have been attended with very great expense instead of doing this he got himself made receiver over the property and determined to arrest larry which in his existing state he conceived he should have no difficulty in doing here however he found himself very much mistaken for nothing could induce the old man to leave his own room or so much as allow the front door to be unlocked mary brady still continued to attend him every day returning home to her husband after sunset and she found him very easy to manage in every other particular as long as he was allowed to have his own way in this  he had quite lost the triumphant feeling which led him to boast in the streets of carrick after leaving the inquest that he had escaped from flannellys power and that he would never have to pay him another farthing for now if he heard a strange step he fancied it to be a bailiffs and if there was the slightest noise in the house he thought that an attempt was being made to drag him off by violence it was a miserable sight to see the old man thin wan and worn out sitting during that cold winter by a few sods of turf with the door of his own room ajar watching the front door from morning till night to see that no one opened it before christmas he had his bed brought down into the same room in order that he might not be betrayed into the hands of his enemies in the morning before he was up and from that time no inducement could prevail on him to leave the room for a moment  during this time his poverty was very great the tenants had been served with legal notices to pay neither to him nor to thady any portion of their rents and consequently provisions were very low and very scarce at ballycloran in fact had it not been for the kindness of father john mr mckeon and counsellor webb whose property was adjoining to ballycloran larry would have been starved into a surrender mr webb went so far as to interfere with mr keegan and to point out to him that in all humanity he should stay his proceedings till after thadys trial but keegan replied that he was only acting for mr flannelly who was determined to have the matter settled at once that all he wanted was his own and that he had already waited too long  when keegan found that larry macdermot in spite of his infirmities was too wary to be caught he endeavoured to bribe mary to open the door to his emissaries and to betray the old man but though mary was very fond of money she was too honest for this and she replied to the attorney by telling him that for all the money in the bank of carrick she wouldnt be the one to trate the ould blood that way larry consequently still held out at ballycloran living on the chance presents of his friends who sent him at one time a few stone of potatoes at another a pound of tea then a bit of bacon or a few bottles of whiskey this last however was confided to mary with injunctions not to allow him too frequently to have recourse to the only comforter that was left to him  though keegan failed to gain admission into the house and could not therefore put himself into absolute possession of the estate still he could do what he pleased with the lands and he was not long in availing himself of the power in january he served notices on all the tenants that unless the whole arrears were paid on or before the end of the next month they would be ejected and to many of those who held portions of the better part of the land he sent summary notices to quit on the first of may next following these notices were all served by pat who assured the tenants that he only performed the duties which he had now undertaken that he might look after mr thadys interests and as as he said there could be no use in life in his refusing to do it for av he didnt another would and the tenants would be no betther and he a dale the worse  these things by no means tended to make keegans name popular on the estate particularly at drumleesh where the tenants were but ill prepared to pay their rent by small portions at a time and were utterly confounded at the idea of having to pay up the arrears in a lump but pat assured him that although they were surly and sullen they gave no signs or showed any determination of having recourse to violence or of openly rebelling against the authority of their new landlord  pat however knew but little of what was going on amongst them now although they found no absolute fault with the arguments which he used for acting on mr keegans behalf still he soon discovered that the tenants had withdrawn their confidence from him and that they looked upon him rather as the servant of their new tyrant than as the friend to whom they had been accustomed to turn when they wanted any little favour from their old master he had moreover discontinued his visits to mrs mulreadys and had for a long time seen nothing of joe reynolds and his set who spent most of their time in aughacashel or at any rate away from drumleesh  joe reynolds had been altogether unable to account for thadys sudden disappearance from aughacashel at first he thought he must have been taken prisoner by some of the police whilst roaming about in the neighbourhood and although he ultimately heard that father john and he had gone together to counsellor webbs still he never could learn how thady had fallen into the priests hands joe however did not forget that thady had done what he considered the good service of ridding the country of ussher and he swore that he would repay it by punishing the man who in his estimation was robbing thady of his right and his property he had long since declared at mrs mulreadys as we are aware that if thady would come over and join his party keegan should not come upon the estate with impunity and he was now determined to keep his word  keegan trusting to the assurance of pat that the tenants were all quiet and peaceable at length began to go among them himself and had about the beginning of february once or twice ridden over portions of the property about five oclock one evening in that month he was riding towards home along the little lane that skirts drumleesh bog after having seen as much of that delectable neighbourhood as a man could do on horseback when his horse was stopped by a man wrapped in a very large frieze coat but whose face was not concealed who asked him could he spake to his honer about a bit of land that he was thinking of axing afther when the man that was on it was put off as he heard war to be done as the man said this he laid his hands on the bridle and keegan fearing from this that something was not right put his hand into his coat pocket where his pistols were and told the man to come to him at carrick if he wanted to say anything the man however continued av his honer wouldnt think it too much throuble jist to come down for one moment hed point out the cabin which he meant keegan was now sure from the mans continuing to keep his hand on the bridle that some injury to him was intended and was in the act of drawing his pistol from his pocket when he was knocked altogether from off his horse by a blow which he received on the head with a large stone thrown from the other side of one of the banks which ran along the road the blow and the fall completely stunned him and when he came to himself he was lying on the road the man who had stopped his horse was kneeling on his chest a man whose face was blackened was holding down his two feet and a third whose face had also been blackened was kneeling on the road beside him with a small axe in his hand keegans courage utterly failed him when he saw the sharp instrument in the ruffians grasp he began to promise largely if they would let him escapeforgivenessmoneylandanythingeverything for his life neither of them however answered him and before the first sentence he uttered was well out of his mouth the instrument fell on his leg just above the ankle with all the mans force the first blow only cut his trousers and his boot and bruised him sorelyfor his boots protected him the second cut the flesh and grated against the bone in vain he struggled violently and with all the force of a man struggling for his life a third and a fourth and a fifth descended crushing the bone dividing the marrow and ultimately severing the foot from the leg when they had done their work they left him on the road till some passer by should have compassion on him and obtain for him the means of conveyance to his home  in a short time keegan fainted from loss of blood but the cold frost soon brought him to his senses he got up and hobbled to the nearest cabin dragging after him the mutilated foot which still attached itself to his body by the cartilages and by the fragments of his boot and trousers and from thence reached his home on a country car racked by pain which the jolting of the car and the sharp frost did not tend to assuage  at the time of which we are writingabout the first week in marchhe had been entirely unable to ascertain any of the party by whom he had been attacked the men were dan kennedy joe reynolds and corney dolan of these joe alone was personally known to keegan and it was he who used the axe with such fell cruelty but he had been so completely disguised at the time that keegan had not in the least recognised him dan was the man who had at first stopped the horse and he being confident that keegan had not even heard his name and that he was very unlikely to be in any place where his victim could again see him so as to know him had not feared to stop the horse and address its rider without any disguise  this act which was originally proposed and finally executed more with the intent of avenging thady than with any other purpose was the most unfortunate thing for him that could have happened for in the first place it made the magistrates and the government imagine that the country was in a disorderly state generally and that it was therefore necessary to follow up the prosecutions at the assizes with more than ordinary vigour and in the next place it made keegan determined to do all that he could to secure thadys conviction for he attributed his horrible mutilation to the influence of the macdermots  other things had also occurred during the four months since thady had given himself up to the authorities which had determined the law officers of the government to follow up usshers murderer with all severity and obtain if possible a conviction  the man who had been sent to mohill in usshers place was by no means his equal either in courage determination or perseverance still it had been necessary for him to follow to a certain degree in his predecessors steps especially as at the time illicit distillation had become more general in the country than it had ever been known to be before a man named cogan who had acted very successfully as a spy to ussher also offered his services to the new officer by whom they were accepted this man had learnt that potheen was being made at aughacashel and dressed in the uniform of one of the revenue police had led the men to dan kennedys cabin here they merely found abraham the cripple harmlessly employed in superintending the boiling of some lumpers and andy mcevoy in the other cabin sitting on his bed not a drop of potheennot a grain of maltnot a utensil used in distillation was found and they had to return foiled and beaten  the new officer whose name was foster also received various threatening letters and among them the following      this is to giv notis captin furster av youll live    and let live and be quite an pacabledivil a rason is    there why you need be afeardbut av you go on among the    leatrim boysas that bloody thundhering ruffin ussher by    the etarnal blessed glory you wul soon be streatched as    he warfor the leatrim boys isnt thim as wul put up with    it   this was only one of many that he receivedand these together with the futility of his first attempta tremendous stoning which he and his men received in the neighbourhood of drumshambothe burning of cogans cabin and the fate of his predecessor totally frightened him and he represented to the head office in dublin that the country was in such a state that he was unable with the small body of men at his command to carry on his business with anything approaching to security  these things all operated much against the chance of thadys acquittal and his warmest friends could not but feel that they did so people in the country began to say that some severe example was necessarythat the country was in a dreadful stateand that the government must be upheld and these fears became ten times greater when it was generally known that thady a day or two before the catastrophe had absolutely associated with some of the most desperate characters in the country  brady at first had been unwilling to divulge all that he knew to mr keegan for though he felt no hesitation in betraying his old master he was not desirous to hang him but keegan by degrees got it all out of him and bribed so high that pat at last consented to come forward at the trial and swear to all the circumstances of the meeting at mrs mehans and the attorney lost no time in informing the solicitor who was to conduct the prosecution on behalf of the crown what this witness was able to prove  all this was sad news for father john and his friend mckeon but still they would not despair they talked the matter over and over again in mckeons parlour and tony occasionally almost forgot his punch in his anxiety to put forward and make the most of all those points which he considered to be in thadys favour it was not only the love of justice his regard for the family of the macdermots and father johns eloquence which had enlisted mckeon so thoroughly in thadys interestthough no doubt these three things had great weight with himbut his own personal predilections had also a considerable share in doing so  the three leading resident gentlemen in the neighbourhood were sir michael gibson mr jonas brown and counsellor webb they were the three magistrates who regularly attended the petty sessions at carrick and as they usually held different opinions on all important subjects relative to the locality in which they resided so all their neighbours swore by one of them condemning the other two as little better than fools or knaves  sir michael was by far the richest and would therefore naturally have had the greatest number of followers had it not been that it was usually extremely difficult to find out what his opinion was he was neither a bad nor a good landlordthat is to say his land was seldom let for more than double its value and his agent did not eject his tenants as long as they contrived not to increase the arrears which they owed when he undertook the management of the property but sir michael himself neither looked after their welfare or took the slightest care to see that they were comfortable  on the bench by attempting to agree with both his colleagues he very generally managed to express an opinion different from either of them and as he was of course the chairman the decisions of the bench were in consequence frequently of a rather singular nature however on the whole sir michael was popular for if he benefited none he harmed none and he was considered by many a safe constitutional man with no flighty ideas on any side  jonas brown was hated by the poor in every case he would if he had the power visit every fault committed by them with the severest penalty awarded by the law he was a stern hard cruel man with no sympathy for any one and was actuated by the most superlative contempt for the poor from whom he drew his whole income he was a clever clearheaded avaricious man and he knew that the only means of keeping the peasantry in their present utterly helpless and dependent state was to deny them education and to oppose every scheme for their improvement and welfare he dreaded every movement which tended to teach them anything and when he heard of landlords reducing their rents improving cabins and building schools he would prophesy to his neighbour sir michael that the gentry would soon begin to repent of their folly when the rents they had reduced were not paid the cabins which they had made comfortable were filled with ribbonmen and when the poor had learnt in the schools to disobey their masters and landlords sir michael never contradicted all this and he would probably have become a second jonas brown and much more injurious because so much more extensive in his interests were it not for the counteracting influence of counsellor webb who was in all his opinions diametrically opposed to mr brown  mr webb was a clearheaded and a much more talented man than his brother magistrate he was moreover a kindhearted landlordever anxious to ameliorate the condition of the poorand by no means greedy after money though he was neither very opulent nor very economical but nevertheless with all these high qualities he was hardly the man most fit to do real good in a very poor and ignorant neighbourhood he was in the first place by far too fond of popularity and of being the favourite among the peasantry and in the next he had become so habituated to oppose jonas brown in all his sayings and doings that he now did so whether he was right or wrong  thadys case had been much talked of in the country and the rival magistrates of course held diametrically opposite opinions respecting it  jonas brown had declared at his own table that unless that young man were hanged there would be an end to anything like law in the country his being the son of a landlord made it ten times worse if the landlords themselves turned ribbonmen and taught the tenants all manner of iniquity and the law didnt then interfere it would be impossible to live in the country he for one should leave it here had a most praiseworthy servant of the crowna man who had merited the thanks of the whole country by the fearless manner in which he had performed his duties here he said had this man been murdered in cold blood by a known ribbonman by one who as he understood had a few days before the murder conspired with others to commit it and yet he was told there were a pack of people through the countrypriests and popularity hunters who were not only using their best endeavours to screen the murderer but who absolutely justified the deed by gd he couldnt understand how a man holding the position of a gentleman could so far forget what he owed to his country and himself as to dirty his hands with such a filthy business as this however absurd his general opinions on politics might be as for the mans sister that was all a got up story since the business every one knew that the family had been trying to catch the young man for the girl she had been allowed to walk with captain ussher at all hours night and day and he was doing no more than walking with her when he was basely murdered by her brother as for him jonas brown he hoped and trusted the murderer would be hung as he deserved  the purport of this piece of afterdinner eloquence was duly conveyed to counsellor webb who fully appreciated the remarks about the popularityhunting gentleman who was dirtying his hands up to this time these two men though differing so widely from each other had still kept up a show of courtesy between them but mr browns remarks altogether put an end to it  counsellor webb never again addressed him in friendly terms  he did not however in the least relax his efforts on thadys behalf or express less strongly his opinion on the case he told sir michael one morning in carrick after some public meeting at which all the gentry of the neighbourhood had been present and while many of them and among them mr brown were standing by that he had lately been giving a great deal of very close attention to that very distressing case of young mr macdermot he thought it was the most melancholy and heartrending case he had ever known it was proved beyond possibility of doubt that ussher was eloping with the young mans sister it seemed now to be pretty certain that the girl was herself absolutely senseless at the time the occurrence took place he believed she had changed her mind or got frightened or what not it was now a known fact that she was being dragged senseless in the mans arms when macdermot attacked him and was a brother to stand by and look on at such a sight as that and not protect his sister and punish the miscreant who was endeavouring to dishonour her was mr macdermot to turn his back upon the affair and leave his sister to her fate because forsooth the man who did it was a revenue officer let us bring the matter home to ourselves sir michael he continued suppose you saw that gay young captain jem boyle hurrying through the demesne at knockadrum with one of your own fair flock in his arms violently carrying her off wouldnt you not only knock him down yourself if you could catch him but also set all your people after him begging them to do the same of course you would and what more has this young man done unfortunately he struck too hard but that although we may deplore the circumstance shows no criminality on his part but only the strong indignation which he very properly felt as to the cock and bull story of his being a ribbonman no man of sense could entertain it it appears that a few nights before the occurrence he went to a tenants wedding and unfortunately took a drop too much punch that had been many a good mans case before his and then he got among a lot of men who were uttering vague nonsensical threats against different persons whom they disliked one i hear says that ussher was threatened and anotherand i am told by far the more creditable witnessthat it was keegan the attorney whose name was mentioned it appears that when drunk he promised to join these men in another drinking party which promise he of course never thought of keeping after he was sober and yet there are some who are cruel enough to sayi wont say harsh enough to believe for they cant believe itthat when he attacked ussher in his sisters defence macdermot was only carrying into execution a premeditated plan of murdering him premeditated indeed when it was plain to every one that it was by the merest accident that he happened to be in the avenue at the time people might just as well say that it was he who cut off the attorneys foot the other day though he was in gaol at the time i must say continued the counsellor that should the poor young man fall a victim to the false evidence which i am aware private malice and wretchedly vindictive feeling will supply then the basest murder will really have been committed which ever disgraced this county i dont envy the state of mind of any gentleman who can look forward with a feeling of satisfaction to the prospect of that poor youths being hanged for protecting his sister merely because the seducer was in habits of intimacy with himself or his family  mr brown left the meeting taking no immediate notice of the counsellors philippic it was not however because he did not comprehend the latter part of it or that he meant to overlook it  sir michael was much distressed in making up his mind finally on the subject it was reported however soon after the meeting above alluded to that he had stated to some of his more immediate friends and admirers that he considered it highly discreditable he might say disgraceful for any of the more respectable classes to give any countenance to the illegal meetings which he was afraid were too general through the country and that there was too much reason to fear that the unfortunate man in prison had been guilty in doing so but that there could be no doubt that every one was justifiedhe might add only performed his bounden dutyin protecting the females of his family from injury or violence  now tony mckeon was a tenant both of sir michael and of the counsellor he also held land from other landlords but he had no connexion whatever with mr brown he was not at all the sort of tenant that jonas liked for though he always punctually paid his rent to the day he usually chose to have everything his own way and would take no land except at a fair rent and on a long lease  mr webb however was his chief friend and principal ally in the country sir michael was altogether too grand for him seeing that tony had no idea of being a humble dependent but mr webb would occasionally come and dine with himand often asked him in return mrs webb too was civil to his wife and the girlsalways lent them the dublin pattern for their frills frocks and other fripperyand seldom drove into drumsna without calling the consequence was that the counsellor was a man after tonys own heart though they were of different religions they had generally speaking the same political feelings and opinionsthe same philanthropical principlesand the same popular prejudices and after a few years intimacy in each others neighbourhood mr webb well knew where to find a powerful recruit for any service in which he might wish to enlist one  tony declared that if any one spoke ill of feemys character he should make it personal with himself that he was ready willing and moreover determined to quarrel with any one who dared to apply the opprobrious name of murderer to thady and he had even been heard on one or two occasions to stand up for larry himself and to declare that although he might be a little lightheaded or so he was still a deal better than those muddyminded blackguards at carrick who had driven him to his present state  for a long time feemy had been very ill but after christmas she had apparently got a little stronger she would sit up in her bedroom for a few hours in the day but still she would talk to no one mrs mckeon endeavoured more than once to lead her to the subject which she knew must be nearest her heart thinking that if she could be got to speak of it she would be relieved but in vain in vain she tried to interest her in her brothers fatein vain she tried to make her understand that thadys safetythat his acquittal would in a great degree depend on her being able to prove at the trial that at the time when the occurrence took place she was herself insensible she shuddered violently at the idea of being again questioned and declared with sobs that she should die if she were again dragged to that horrid place when mrs mckeon asked her if she would not make a struggle to save her brothers life she remained mute it was evident that it was for her lover that she was still grieving and that it was not the danger or ignominy of thadys position that afflicted her  mrs mckeon however conceived it to be her duty to persevere with herand at last told her how wrong it was of her to give way to a grief which was in its first stage respected feemy answered her only with tears and on the next morning told her that she had determined to return to ballycloran as she thought she would be better there at home with her father  to this however mrs mckeon would not consent and feemy was told that the doctor had forbidden her to be moved she was therefore obliged to remain satisfied for the present as she had no means of escaping from drumsna but she soon became more sullen than everand at last almost refused to speak to any one  things went on in this way till about the middle of march feemy constantly requested to be allowed to go home which request was as constantly refused when different circumstances acting together gave rise to a dreadful suspicion in mrs mckeons mind she began to fear that ussher before his death had accomplished the poor girls ruin and that she was now in the family way for some few days she was determined to reject the idea and endeavoured to make herself believe that she was mistaken but the more close her observations were the more certain she became that her suspicions were well founded she was much distressed as to what she should do her first and most natural feelings were those of anger against feemy and of dismay at the situation into which her own and her husbands good nature had brought herself and her daughters and she made up her mind that feemy should at once have her wish and return to ballycloran but then she might be mistakenor even if it were too truehow could she turn the poor girl weak ill and miserable out of her house and send her to an empty unprovided barrack inhabited by an infirm idiotical old man where she could receive none of that attention which her situation so much required  she communicated her suspicions to the doctor and after a few days observations he told her that there was too much reason to fear that the case was as she supposed he however strongly advised her to speak to miss macdermot herself on the subject this she did at last most tenderly and with the greatest gentlenessbut still imploring feemy to tell her the truth feemy at first could not speak in reply she threw herself on her bed sobbing most violently and fell from one fit into another till mrs mckeon was afraid that she would choke herself with the violence of her emotion at last however she declared that the accusation brought against her was untrueprotested on her most solemn word and honour that it was not the caseand ended by saying how thankful she was to mrs mckeon for her kindness and protection but that she must now beg her to allow her to return to ballycloran  feemys denial of the charge against her was so firm and so positively made that it very much shook her friends suspicions when feemy begged to be sent home she told her not to agitate herself at presentthat they would all see how she was in a day or twoand then speaking a few kind words to her left her to herself     chapter xxvi  the duel   mr jonas brown was in a towering passion when he left the meeting at which he had listened to but had not ventured to answer counsellor webbs remarks respecting thady macdermot and the supposed intimacy between ussher and the inmates of brown hall he had so openly expressed his wish that the young man might be capitally punishedand this joined to the fact that ussher had not been as intimate at any other house as he had been at brown hall could leave no doubt on the mind of any one who had been present that webbs allusion had been intended for him his first impulse was to challenge his foe at once but his ardour on that point soon cooled a little and he came to the conclusion of sleeping on the matter or at any rate of drinking a bottle or two of wine over it with his sons  as soon as the servant had withdrawn after dinner he began his grievance  by gd fred that ruffian webb is passing all bounds hes not only forgotten the opinions and notions of a gentleman but he has lain down the manners of one too  why what has he done now with all his queer ideas webb can be a gentleman if he pleases said fred  i must say said george the counsellor is a good fellow on the course i dont care how seldom i see him anywhere else  i dont know what you may call being a good fellow or a gentleman replied the father but i know he has insulted me publicly and that in the most gross way and before half the country i dont know whether thats your idea of acting like a gentleman or a good fellow  its what many a gentleman and many a good fellow has done before him said george but if he has insulted you of course he must apologizeor do the other thing  whatlet it alone rejoined fred  no fightand thats what hes a deal the most likely to do said george  be dd said old brown but i think both of you seem glad to hear that your father has been insulted youve neither of you a grain of proper feeling  its with a grain or two of gunpowder id take it said george and id advise you father to do the same a precious deal better thing than good feeling to settle an insult with  but youve not told us what its all about said fred what was the quarrel about  quarrel there was no quarrel at all in the matteri couldnt quarrel with him for i wouldnt speak to him it was about that infernal friend of yours fred that ussher i wish hed never darkened this door  poor devil answered fred theres no use abusing him now hes dead i suppose the row wasnt his fault  it was about him though and the low blackguard that murdered him webb was talking about him making a speech in the publicroom taking the fellows part as im told hes always doing and going on with all the claptrap story about protecting his sisteras if every one in the country didnt know that shed been usshers mistress for months back well that was all nothing to meonly hell be rightly served when he finds every man on his estate has become a ribbonman and every other tenant ready to turn murderer but this wasnt enough for him but at the end of the whole he must declarei forget what it was he saidbut something about usshers intimacy herethat it was a shameful thing of me to be wishing on that account that this macdermot should be hanged as he deserves  did he actually mention brown hall asked fred  no but he put it so that there could be no mistake about it he said he didnt envy my state of mind  well tell him you dont envy his i dont think you could call him out for that said george  by heavens youre enough to provoke a saint continued the father cant you believe me when i tell you he made as direct a cut at brown hall as he could because i cant repeat all his words like a newspaper by gd the plucks gone out of the country entirely if as much had been said to my father when i was your age id have had the fellow who said it out if hed been the best shot in connaught  dont say another word father said george if thats what youre after i thought may be youd like the fun yourself or id have offered id call him out with a heart and a half theres nothing id like better may be id be able to make up a match between diamond and the counsellors brown mare when its done hed be a little soft would webb after such a job as that and wouldnt stand for a few pounds difference  thats nonsense george said the father a little mollified by the sons dutiful offer i dont want any one to take the thing off my hands i dont want to be shelved that waybut i wish you to see the matter in the right light i tell you the man was cursedly insolent fred in fact he said what i dont mean to put up with and the question is what had i better do  he didnt say anything did he asked fred with your name or brown hall in it  no he didnt name them exactly  then i dont think you can call for an apology write him a civil note and beg him to say that he intended no allusion to you or your family in what he said  freds right for once said george thats all you can do as the matter stands now if he wont say that call him out and have done with it  ive no wish to be fighting said the father in fact at my time of life id rather not i was ready enough once but id sooner settle it quietly  why theres no contenting you answered fred just now nothing but pistols and coffee would do for you and then you were in a passion because one of us wouldnt take a challenge for you at once without knowing anything about it and now youre just the other way if you dont like the business theres george will take it off your hands he says  after a considerable quantity of squabbling among this family party it was at last decided that a civil note should be sent to ardrum in which mr webb should be desired to state that he had made no allusion to brown hall accordingly a servant on horseback was dispatched on the monday morning with the following missive      brown hall    sunday evening     mr brown presents his compliments to mr webb and begs    to inform him that certain expressions which fell from    him at the meeting at carrick on saturday respecting the    murder of captain ussher have been thought by many to    have had reference to the family at brown hall mr brown    feels himself assured that mr webb would not so far    forget himself as to make any such allusion in public    to a neighbouring gentleman and magistrate but as mr    webbs words were certainly singular in their reference    to captain usshers intimacy with some family in the    neighbourhood and as many conceive that they were    directly pointed at brown hall mr brown must beg mr    webb to give him his direct assurance in writing that    nothing which fell from him was intended to apply either    to mr brown or his family     to w webb esq    ardrum   mr webb was at home when the servant arrived and only detaining him two minutes sent him back with the following answer      ardrum    monday morning     mr webb presents his compliments to mr brown mr webb    regrets that he cannot comply with the request made in mr    browns letter of yesterdays date     to jonas brown esq    brown hall   the conclave at brown hall on receipt of this laconic epistle unanimously declared that it was tantamount to a declaration of war and that desperate measures must at once be adopted  the sods the only place now father said george by heavens i like him the better for not recanting  hes a cursed good shot said fred would you like to send for keegan before you go out  keegan be dd said george but have blake by for hell wing you as sure as moses  may be not said fred webbs a dd good shot in a gallery but may be he wont allow for the wind on the sod but itll be as well to have the sawbones  no fear of your legs governor for hell fire high the shoulders his spot you may always tell from a mans eye where hell fix the sight of a pistol webb always looks up if his tool lifts a little hell fire over you  yes he might said fred or take you on the headwhich wouldnt be so pleasant im not particularbut id better run my chance myself with a chap that fired low  there youre out answered the brother the low shots the deathshot why man if you did catch a ball in the head youd get over itif it was in the mouth or cheek or neck or anywhere but the temple but your bodys all over tender bits may heaven always keep lead out of my bowelsid sooner have it in my brains  the father fidgetted about very uneasily whilst enduring these pleasant remarks from his affectionate children which it is needless to say they made for his particular comfort and amusement at the present moment at last he lost his temper and exclaimed  d your brains you fooli dont believe youve got any whats the use of the two of you going on that wayyou that were never out in your life i tell you when a mans standing to be fired at he doesnt know nine times in ten whether he fires high or low wholl i get to go out with me  yes and take your message said fred youve a deal to do yet before youre snug home again  well wholl i get to go to him  why wouldnt i do suggested george george at any rate had the merit of being a good son  nonsense said fred if the governor got shot youd be considered a brute if you were cool and a man should be cool then  cool said george id be as cool as a cucumber  nonsense said the father of course i couldnt go out with my own son theres theobald french i went out with his cousin just after waterloo  he cant showhes on his keeping hed be nabbed before he was on the ground  then ill have larkin ive known him since i was a boy  larkins too old for that game now hed be letting them have webb up with his back to the sun  murphy of mullough hes used to these thingsill send over to him  murphys up to snuff but since the affair of the bill he forged dan connollys name to hes queerly thought of it wouldnt do at all governor to send anyone that webbs friend could refuse to meet  ill tell you father whod be proud of the joband hes quite a gentleman now since he got an estate of his ownand thats cynthy keegan itd be great fun to see him stepping the ground and he only with one foot  by heavens george youre a born fool must you have your dd joke when im talking so seriously  upon my soul then if it were myself id send for keegan hed think the compliment so great he wouldnt refuse and itd be such a joke to see him on the ground with his crutches but if you dont like the attorney send to fitzpatrick  hes so young said the father hed do very well for either of you but id want some one steadier  besides said fred webb and fitz are bosom friends i wouldnt wonder if fitz were webbs friend himself  i tell you fathermajor longswords exactly the boy said george send to boyle for him he wants to get a name in the country and the jobll just suit him  youre right for once george said jonas longswords just the man that will answer and accordingly it was at last decided that major longsword was to be the honoured individual he had dined once or twice at brown hall and therefore there was some excuse for calling upon him and a note was accordingly written to him with a great deal of blarney about his station and experience and the inexpediency of entrusting affairs of honour to inexperienced country gentlemen this had the effect of immediately bringing him over to brown hall and on the tuesday morning he was dispatched to ardrum to make what arrangements he pleased with mr webb  to give major longsword his due mr brown could not have made a much better choice for though he was a disciple of that school which thoroughly entertained the now antiquated notion that the worldthat is the world of men in broad clothcould not go on without duels or a pretence of duels still he was one who as a second would do all in his power to prevent an absolute effusion of lead he was a great hand at an apology and could regulate its proper degree of indifference or abjectness to the exact state of the case he could make it almost satisfactory to the receiver without being very disagreeable to the giver he could twaddle about honour for ever without causing bloodshed and would if possible protect a mans reputation and body at the same time  he started on his mission of peace with the determined intention of returning with some document in his pocket which would appease mr browns irritated feelings and add another laurel to the wreath which he considered his due as a peacemaker  he was shown into mr webbs parlour where that gentleman soon joined him and he was not long in making known his business major longsword plumed himself on his manners in such embassies and today he was perfect  now mr webb he continued after a long preamble of course i am not to judge of the propriety of any words you may think fit to use but i am afraid i must admit in this case a somewhati must say a somewhat unwarranted allusion was made to my friend such i can assure you is the general opinion now if you will allow me to say as much i thinki cannot but think you were rightperfectly rightin not disclaiming such an allusion having once made it but i trust indeed i feel confident that a man of your acknowledged sense and general character as a man of the world will not object to give me a linea mere line will sufficeaddressed to myself i wouldnt ask you in such a matter to write to mr browna mere line just stating that you regret having said anything in your fervour which should hurt any ones feelings the matter you know is now in my hands and i pledge myself that shall suffice i really think such a bagatelle as that cannot be objectionable to you were i in your place i can assure you mr webb as a man of honour i should be delighted to do the same  were you in my place major longsword replied the counsellor you would no doubt act with more judgment than i shall do but without wishing to say anything offensive to you i may as well assure you at once that i will give no letter to any one on the subject  but mr webb you cannot deny or justify the allusionthe very pointed allusion  i certainly shall not deny it indeed to you major longsword i have no objection to acknowledge it  and yet youll not just state your regretin a note to myself mind why mr webb you cant but regret it you cant desire bloodshed  indeed major i do not regret it your friend considered himself at liberty to accuse me in privatenot by name but by allusion as you sayof certain feelings and opinions derogatory to me i have retaliated in public i believe now you will own that i consult your convenience best by telling you that major macdonnel of tramore is my friend in this matter he will make all arrangements with you for the immediate termination of this affair  i shall be proud to see the major but still let me hope mr webb that this little affair may be arranged as a magistrate and as a man i may say not exactly in your première jeunesse  as a magistrate and as a man not exactly as you say in my première jeunesse for i was fifty yesterday let me assure you that if mr brown intends to call me out i shall go out if he intends to let me alone i shall be better pleased to be let alone as for a word or a line of retractation or apology i will not give it  but mr webb  forgive me for interrupting you but allow me to suggest that any further remarks you may have to make on the subject had better be made to my friend major macdonnel  would you allow me to put it to you in another light suppose now  major longsword the idea of being uncourteous to any man in my own house is particularly grievous to me but with your pardon i must say that i cannot continue this conversation with you if you will allow me the honour of considering the remainder of your visit one of compliment i shall be proud to increase my acquaintance with a gentleman for whom i entertain so profound a respect  the baffled major was obliged to take the hint to move himself off and have recourse to his brother major major macdonnel received his visitor with a very long face assured him that his principal had left him nothing to do but to arrange the meeting and that however willing he might be to agree to pacific measures himself he had no power to do so the boyle major however found a more willing listener in his colleague than in the counsellor and made many eloquent dissertations but it was all to no purpose he was obliged to return to brown hall signally defeated as he felt himself and with the tidings that a place had been agreed to and that the meeting was to take place at eight am the next morning  i had really hoped mr brown to have been able to settle this little matter amicably indeed i had no doubt about it but i must say a more impracticable gentleman to deal with than mr webb it was never my lot to meet upon such an occasion  the major dined at brown hall and could not but admire the solicitude which the two sons expressed for their fathers safety and the filial manner in which they comforted him during dinner he was somewhat silent and moody but when he got to his wine he recovered his spirits and seemed tolerably happy indeed he conducted himself wonderfully well considering that during the whole evening fred and george would talk of nothing but trepanned skulls false kneecapscork legsbullets that had come out of mens backs ten years after they had entered mens belliessurgeons knivespincers and tourniquetswillsattorneysleaden coffins and the family vault george expressed a great desire to go and see his parent shot fred said that eight oclock was so damnation early or else hed be happy george was so warm in his solicitude that in spite of his fathers declining this mark of his affection he insisted on attending him to the ground and it was only when major longsword gravely assured him that if he george was there he major longsword would not be there too that the anxious son was prevailed on to give up his project  the affair was to come off in the county roscommon about a mile and a half from carrick at the edge of a small copse about a mile on the lefthand side of the boyle road a message had been conveyed to doctor blake to be near the spot with the different instruments that had been so freely named on the previous evening at the hour appointed the military major and his friend arrived in the brown hall chariot and a few minutes afterwards the exmilitary major and his man appeared on the counsellors car had any one walked about the ground with very scrutinising eyes he might have espied doctor blake snugly ensconced under a bank with a cigar in his mouth and a small mahogany box lying at his feet  the carriages had been left a few hundred yards distant and the two servants well knowing what was going to happen discussed cosily and leisurely the chance they either of them had of carrying home a dead master  faix barney said the brown hall whip i believe we stand a baddish chance they do be saying the counsellors mighty handy with the powdher would you plaze to try a blast this cowld morning and he handed him his pipe  and thank ye kindly too dan its a mighty cowld place why thin its thrue for youthe masther is handy with the powdher more power to his elbow this morning  but whisper now barney did he iver shoot many now to your knowing did he shoot em dead i wonder whether mr fred will be keeping on the chariot hes more taste in the gig way im fearing  why thin the counsellor maynt shoot him dead that is av he behaves himself and dont have no blusthering was old jonas much afeard now dan  afeard is it the divil wouldnt fright him maybe after all its the counsellor ll be shot first  oh in course he may said barney oh musha musha wirrasthrue howd i ever be looking the misthress and the young ladies in the face av i was taking him home dead and buried as hes likely to be av he dont hit that owld masther of yours in the very first go off and then the mans air of triumph at the idea of his masters shooting jonas brown turned to despondency as the thought struck him that the counsellor might be shot himself but he soon cheered up again at a brighter reflection  but thatd be the wake dan my thered have been nothing like that in the counthry since old peyton was waked up at castleboy not a man in the county but would be there nor a woman neither and signs on theres not another in the counthry at all like the masther for a poor man  at this moment two shots were heard  virgin marythere they are at it said dan now theyre oncet began in arnest theyll not lave it till theyre both dead or theres not a grain of powdher left bad cess to them majors for bringing thim together couldnt they be fighting theyselles av they plazed and not be setting the real gentry of the counthry at each other like game cocks  had they much powdher i wonder dan was there a dail of ammunition in the carriage  faix their war so that major bad luck to him had his own and master georges horns crammed with powdher and as many bullets in a bag under his coattail as he could wellnigh carry  then theyre one or both as good as dead theyre loading again now ill go bail och that id thrown the owld horse down coming over the bridge and pitched the masther into the wather id be a dail readier getting him out of that than putting the life into him when hes had three or four of them bullets through his skin  its thrue for you barney said the goodnatured dan and as mr fred couldnt well be turning an owld servant like me off the place av he didnt keep up the chariot i wish it maynt be the counsellors luck to be first kilt for hes as good a man as iver trod  in the meantime the two majors had paced the ground with a good deal of official propriety loaded the pistols and exchanged a quantity of courtesies  not so agreeable an occasion as when we last acted together in the field major macdonnel id sooner be clearing the course for my friends horse than measuring the ground for his fire  true indeed major longsword true indeed dont you think youre putting your friend a leetle too much under the shade i dont knowperhaps notbut a foot or two off the trees gives a more equal light thats it  i believe were ready noweh major  quite ready major well have it over in two minutes  i say major and the other major whispered blakes just under the small bush there i hope you wont want him  thank ye major thank yei hope not  and major there can be no necessity for a second shot i thinkeh brown wont want a second shot will he  not at all major not at all a trifling thing like thiswell have it over now in a double crack eh  true major true put your man up and ill give the word  and the majors put up their men with great dexterity and the word was given they both fired each at his adversary but each without attempting to cover the other browns ball whistled harmlessly away without approaching within any dangerous proximity of the counsellors body but not so webbs it was very evident jonas was hit for his body gave a spasmodic jerk forwards his knees bent under him and his head became thrown back somewhat over his shoulders he did not fall himself but his hat did he dropped his pistol to the ground and inserted both his right and his left hand under the tails of his coat  mr brown indulged a notion whether correctly or not i am unable to say but one which i believe to be not uncommon that by presenting his side instead of his front to his adversarys fire he exposed fewer vital parts to danger and if destiny intended him to be wounded he certainly in the present instance was benefited by the above arrangement for he received the bullet in perhaps the least dangerous part of his body  mr brown was a stout compact man well developed and rounded in the fuller parts of his body he piqued himself somewhat on the fair proportions of his nether man he was also somewhat of a dandy and had come out this morning as i believe was the custom on such occasions nearly full dressed he had on a black dress coat black waistcoat and black well fitting trousers and as he turned his side to the counsellor he displayed to advantage the whole of his comely figure  but alas its comeliness was destined for a time to be destroyed mr webbs fire passed directly under the tails of his coat the ball just traversed along his trousers about a foot beneath the waistband cutting them and his drawers and shirt as it were with a knife and wounding the flesh in its course to the depth of perhaps the eighth part of an inch directly major longsword perceived that his man was hit he vociferously called for blake  from the position which mr brown assumed on receiving the fire it was the general opinion of all the party that he was not mortally wounded blake was immediately on the spot and lost no time in supporting him  where is it mr brown where is it can you stand can you walk allow me to support you to the bank you can get a seat there we must sit down at once my dear sir the first thing is to get you to a comfortable seat  comfortable seat and be dd to you was the patients uncivil reply go to hell i tell you as blake continued to lift him im well enough i can walk to the carriage  my dear sir continued the doctor the ball must be in your side at any rate allow me to discover where it is  ball be dd i tell you and he hobbled a little way off from his tormentor the portion of his trousers on the part affected annoyed him sorely when he attempted to walk  permit me to hope said the counsellor coming uppermit me to hope now that this affair seems to be over that you are not seriously hurt had you not better allow doctor blake to ascertain whether the bullet still remains in you had you not better sit down  bother doctor blake sir said mr brown with his hands still under his coat tails  ah i see now said the doctor stooping down i see the wound i think its bleeding nowand i think i may guarantee that theres no danger allow me one minute for the ball may be lodged and he proceeded to lift up the tails of the coat  doctor blake if you touch me again by heavens ill kick you when i want you ill send for you major longsword will you do me the honour to accompany me to my carriageugh dn it  this last exclamation was occasioned by his renewed attempt to walk he managed however at last to get to his carriage and in that to brown hall major longsword who accompanied him declared afterwards to his brother officers at boyle that mr browns efforts to support himself by the armstraps in the carriage were really disagreeable to witness he got home safely however and though he was not competent to attend to his public duties for some considerable time it is believed he was not a great sufferer the brown hall livery servant was seen in the chemists shop the same morning asking for a yard and a half of diaculum which was supplied to him and a new pair of dress trousers somewhat fuller than the last was ordered from the tailor doctor blake was not called in for mr brown found himself with his sons assistance equal to the cure of the wound he had received     chapter xxvii  feemy returns to ballycloran   it will be remembered that father john had promised to take upon himself all the trouble attendant upon the preparation for thadys trial and with the view of redeeming this promise he went up to dublin and spent a week among the lawyers who were to be engaged for the young mans defence the chief among these was one mr omalley and the priest strove hard to imbue that gentleman with his own views of the whole matter the day after that on which father john returned he saw both mr mckeon and the counsellor and explained to them as nearly as he could all that had passed between himself and omalley though they were both greatly interested on thadys account they did not feel the same intense constant anxiety which now quite oppressed the priest and moreover trusting more to their own judgment than he did they were not so inclined to alter their preconceived opinion they both therefore assured father john that they were still quite sanguine as to thadys acquittal this raised his hopes again a little but nevertheless from that time till the trial he was so absorbed by his strong feeling on the subject that he was almost totally unable to attend to the usual duties and employment of his life it was decided that mr webb should use all his endeavours to obtain tidings of corney dolan and ascertain whether in the event of his being summoned he would be able to give any evidence respecting the meeting at mrs mehans which would be of use to thady at the trial in this he was successful and he learnt from that respectable individual that he could swear that usshers name was not mentioned at all  it must be owned that mr dolans manner was not such as to inspire the counsellor with any great admiration for his veracity and his opinion in this respect was strengthened when the witness added that by garra av his honor thought itd be any use in life to mr thady hed swear as how he was asleep all the time or for the matther of that that he was out along wid de gals dancing the livelong night it was with difficulty that mr webb made him understand that he was only to swear to what he believed to be the truth and that if he told a single lie in answer to the numerous questions which would be asked him he would only be endangering mr macdermots life  father john undertook the more difficult task of explaining to feemy what it was she was expected to do at the trial and of making her understand that her brothers life depended on her making an effort to give her evidence in the court clearly and firmly on reaching drumsna he was much distressed to find that she was no longer at mrs mckeons for two days after the conversation which had passed between that lady and her charge in which she declared her suspicions that feemy was enceinte the latter had made a great effort to recover her health or at any rate the appearance of health she left her bed earlier in the morning than she had ever done for the last five months she dressed herself with great care andfor alas mrs mckeons suspicion was but too truefastened her dress with a most dangerous determination to prove that the charge was unfounded patiently she endured all the agonies which this occasioned her during the first day and during the whole evening till the house was at rest and she was secure from being again visited on the next morning she went so far as to come down to breakfast and to undergo tonys somewhat rough congratulation as to her convalescence without betraying her sufferings after breakfast when he was gone out she again opened the subject of her return home and begged mrs mckeon to allow her to have the car to return to ballycloran mrs mckeon again put her off telling her that it would be necessary first to consult the doctor and that he would not be likely to call till the following day in the afternoon mrs mckeon with lyddy and louey went out for a drive and as feemy was apparently so much better they asked her to accompany them but this she declined  its as well for her not to go out before the trial whispered mrs mckeon to her daughters poor girl she has a great deal a great deal indeed to go through yet indeed she had a very great deal to go through a very heavy atonement to pay for her folly and her crime  as soon as the car was gone from the door she hurried up stairs put on her bonnet and cloak took a letter which she had already prepared and opening the door of mrs mckeons own room put it on the table she then crept noiselessly down stairs opened the front door and passed into the street without having been seen or heard by either of the servants who were alone left with her in the house the following is the letter which to her great grief and surprise mrs mckeon found on her table when she returned      dear mrs mckeon     it is because i know youd never let me go back to    ballycloran that ive now gone away without telling    you what i was going to do pray dont be angry with me    indeed im very unhappy but i should be worse if you were    to be angry with me im only a bother and a throuble to    you here and i havnt spirits left even to let you see    how very much obliged i am to you for all your throuble    but indeed i am in my heart my dear mrs mckeon both to    you and to dear lyddy and louey who have been so very    kind to me it is a deal better for me to be at home with    my father my hearts nearly broken with all ive gone    through but hell bear with me for hes used to me give    my compliments to doctor blake pray beg him not to come    to ballycloran i am in his debt a great deal already and    how will i ever pay him besides im a deal better now    as you see in health its only the heart now that ails    me give my kind love to lyddy and louey i felt their    kindness when the sorrow within me wouldnt let me    tell them so now good bye dear mrs mckeon dont be    throubling yourself to come to ballycloran itll be a    poor place now ill send katty for the things     i remain dear mrs mckeon    very very faithfully yours     feemy     psindeedindeedit isnt the case what you were    saying   when mrs mckeon found the letter on her return she was greatly vexed but she could do nothing she couldnt go to ballycloran and fetch feemy by force the falsehood with which the letter concluded was not altogether disbelieved but still she felt by no means certain that her former suspicions were not true and if so perhaps it was better for all parties that feemy should be at home she determined to call at ballycloran when feemy might be supposed to have settled herself and content herself for the present with hearing from the girl who came for the clothes that she had got home safe  when father john called on the saturday she talked over the subject as fully with him as she could without alluding to the matter respecting which she was so much in doubt he declared his intention of seeing feemy on the following monday and of speaking to her strongly on the subject of the trial which was so soon coming on and he begged mrs mckeon to do the same afterwardsas perhaps having become latterly used to her interference feemy might bear from her what she had to be told with more patience than she would from himself  indeed i will father john but do you be gentle with her shes brokenhearted now youll find her very different from the hotheaded creature she was before her sorrows began  i fear she isi fear she is but mrs mckeon has she ever shown a feeling of regarda spark of interest for her noble brotherits that so annoys me in feemy i could feel for herweep for herand forgive her with all my heartall but that  ah father john answered the lady its not for me to preach to you but where would we all be at the last if our judge should say to us i can forgive you all but that  god forbid i should judge her god forbid i should limit that to her which i so much need myself but isnt her heart hardened against her brother oh if you could have seen him as i have done this morningif you could believe how softened is his heart he had never much false pride in itit is nearly all gone now if you could have heard how warmly how affectionately he asks after the sister that wont mention his name if you could know how much more anxious he is on her account and his fathers than on his own feemys coldness and repugnance would strike you as it does me im afraid her chief sorrow is still for the robber that would have destroyed her and has destroyed her brother  of course it is father johnand so it should be im a woman and a mother and you may take my word respecting a womans heart no wife could love her husband more truly than feemy loved that man unworthy as he was he was all in all to her would it not therefore show more heartlessness in her to forget him that is now dead than the brother who killed him of course she loved him better than her brother as every woman loves the man she does love better than all the world how can she forget him be gentle to her father john and i think she will do what you desire  father john promised that he would comply with mrs mckeons advice and he was as good as his word  on reaching the halldoor of mrs mckeons house feemy looked cautiously about her but seeing that no one belonging to the house was in sight she passed on through the little garden into the street she pulled her old veil down over her face and walked on through the village as quickly as she could she felt that every ones eye was on her that all the country was looking at her but she had made up her mind to go through it all and she persevered the last time she had been out of the house was the day she had been taken from ballycloran to the inquest that was a horrid day but the present seemed worse she had now a greater sorrow than any of which she was then conscious and she had to bear it alone unpitied and uncomforted indeed her only rest her only respite from absolute torture was now to consist in being alone and yet bad as the present was there was a worseshe felt that there was a worse in store for her she already anticipated the tortures of that day when she would again be dragged out from her restingplace before the eyes of all mankind and placed in the very middle of the crowd conspicuous above the rest to be stared at bullied and questioned horridly about that dread subject which it even racked her mind to remember would she be able on that long long daydays for what she knewto conceal her shame from all who would be looking at her and to bear in patience the agonies which it would be necessary for her to endure she walked on quickly and was soon out of drumsna and in the lane leading by the cottage to ballycloran by the time she had walked half a mile she was in a dreadful heat although it was still in march for she was so weak and ill that her exertion in proportion to her strength had been immense she sat down by the side of the road for a time and then continued and then again sat down her sufferings were soon so great that she was unable to walk above two hundred yards at a time and she began to fear that she would be utterly unable to get to the house once when she was sitting panting on the bank by the roadside one of the labouring peasants recognised hersaw she was illand offered to get her a country car oh what an agonising struggle she made to answer the man cheerfully when she assured him that she was quite wellthat she was only sitting there for her pleasurethat she required no assistance and that she should walk home directly the man well knew that she was not there for her pleasurethat her brother was in gaol her father on the point of losing his property and that she was weak and in need of rest but he saw that she would sooner be alone and he had the good tact to leave her without pressing his offer for her accommodation  at length she reached the avenue and had to pass the spot where she had sat so long on that fatal night listening for the sound of her lovers horse and watching her brother as he stood swinging his stick before the house she shuddered as she did so but she did walk by the tree where she had then sat shivering and at last once more stood on the steps of her fathers house  the door was fastened inside and she had to knock for admittance this she did three times till she thought she should have fainted on the flags and at last the window of her own sittingroom was raised and mary mcgoverys head was slowly protruded feemy was sitting on the low stone wall which guarded the side of the flags as she heard mary say in a sharp voice  whos thatand what are ye wanting here oh by the mortials but av it aint miss feemy herself come back i declare  and mary ran round and began to draw the bolts of the front door up jumped larry at the unwelcome sound from his accustomed seat by the fire  what in the divils name are ye afther what are ye doing ye owld hag will ye be letting the ruffians in on me and he caught violently hold of marys gown to drag her back before she had accomplished the liberation of the rusty bolts  now go in sir and sit down said mary go in sir will you i tell you its yer own daughter and no ruffian whatever dra the owld man but hell have every rag

its keegan and his hellhounds youre letting in on me  by this time mary had accomplished her object of undoing the door in spite of the old mans exertions and feemy entered weary and worn soiled with the road and pale and wan in spite of the hectic flush which reddened a portion of her cheek  father she said when she saw the old man standing astonished and stupified in the hall father dont ye know mewont ye spake to me  why thin feemy is it yer own self in arnest come back again and wheres yer lover the man ye married ye knowwhat war his namewhy dont ye tell me mary whats the name of the captain feemy married  asy sir asy come in thin and mary led him into his own room and feemy followed in silence with her eyes already filled with tears  wheres yer own husband thin feemy dear ussher

teasing him its well be comfortable now the cowld long nightsfor the captain ll be bringing the whiskey and the groceries with him wont he darling and thady the blackguards out along wid keegan and they cant get in through the door for its always locked and then turning to mary he said why dont you put the locks back you dd jade do you want them to be catching me the first moment im seeing my own darling girl here  feemy could not say a word to her father his absolute idiotcy and the manner in which he referred to ussher quite upset her and she sat down and wept bitterly  what ails you pet continued the old man what ails you alanna they shant touch him dearthere you see the big locks closed now hell be safe from thady now darling  oh miss feemy said mary hes quite beside himself asy now sir asy and dont be talking such nonsense dont ye know the captain got kiltmonths agolast october  killedand who dared to kill my darlings husband whod dare to touch him why wasnt he here why wasnt he inside the big lock  why dont you know and mary gave the old man a violent shake to refresh his memory dont you know mr thady kilt him in the avenue  may his fathers curse blisther him then maybut i think they wor telling me about that before eh feemy he continued with a sigh its a bad time ive been having of it with this tipsy woman since you were gone she dont lave me a moments pace from morning to night bad cess to her but i wish she wor well out of the house ill have you to mind me nowand youll not be bawling and shaking me as she does but shes always dhrunk he added in a whisper  feemy could bear this no longer she was obliged to make her escape from the room into her own in which she found that mary had taken up her temporary residence during so much of the day as she could spare from bawling at and shaking poor larry at dinner time she again went into her fathers room but he took no farther notice of her than if she had been there continually for the last four months he grumbled at his dinner which consisted of nothing but potatoes some milk and an egg and he scolded feemy for having no meat after dinner she mixed him a tumbler of punch for there was still a little of tonys whiskey in the house and whether it was that she made it stronger for him and better than that which mary mcgovery was in the habit of mixing or that the action to which he had been for so many years accustomed roused some pleasant memory within him when he tasted it he said  heavens blessing on you feemy my daughter may you live many happy years with the man you love  feemy soon left him and went to bed and katty who had been dispatched to drumsna returned with her mistresss small box and a kind message from mrs mckeonher kind love to miss macdermot she hoped she had felt the walk of service to her and she would call some time during the next week she had asked no questions of the girl which could lead her to imagine that her mistresss departure from drumsna had been unexpected nor had she said a word to her own servants which could let them suppose that she was surprised at the circumstance  for five or six days feemy remained quiet at ballycloranspending the greater part of her time in her own room but taking her meals such as they were with her father she had no books to read and she was unable to undertake needlework and she passed the long days much as her father didsitting from breakfast till dinner over the fire meditating on the miseries of her condition there was this difference however between themthat the old man felt a degree of triumph at his successful attempt to keep out his foes whereas feemys thoughts were those of unmixed sorrow she had great difficulty too in inducing mary to leave her alone to herself had that woman the slightest particle of softness in her composition anything of the tenderness of a woman about her feemy would have made a confidant of her and her present sufferings would have been immeasurably decreased but mary was such an iron creatureso loud so hard so equable in her temper so impenetrable that feemy could not bring herself to tell her tale of woe which otherwise she would have been tempted to disclose she had therefore the additional labour of keeping her secret from marys prying eyes and mary was nearly as acute as mrs mckeon  about noon on monday feemy was horrorstruck at being told by katty that father john was at the back door asking for her  oh katty tell him to wait awhile say im ill cant youdo dear  why miss i towld him as how you war up and betther thank god since you war home  it was clearly necessary that she should see the priest but she insisted on his not being shown in till she had dressed herself and she again submitted herself to those agonies which she trusted for a time would hide her disgrace which at last must become known to all when this was done she seated herself on the sofa and plucked up all her courage to go through the painful conversation which she knew she was to endure she did not rise as he entered but remained on the sofa with the hectic tint on her face almost suffused into a blush and her hands clasping the calico covering of the cushion as if from that she could get more strength for endurance  father john shook hands with her as he seated himself by her the tears came into his eyes as he observed the sad change which so short a time had made in her the flesh had fallen from her face and the skin now hung loose upon her cheek and jaw bones falling in towards the mouth giving her that lean and careworn look which misery so soon produces her healthy colour too had all fled part of her face was of a dull leaden paleness and though there was a bright colour round her eyes it gave her no appearance of health she looked ten years older than when he had seen her last no wonder mrs mckeon pitied her so deeply she appeared even more pitiable than her brother who was awaiting his doubtful fate in gaolthough with nervous anxiety still with unflinching courage  i am glad to hear youre better feemy mrs mckeon thinks you a great deal better  thank ye father john i believe im well enough now  thats well then but you must take care of yourself feemy no more long walks you should have waited for the car to come home that day mrs mckeons not the least angry if you are more at ease here than at drumsna shes glad for your sake youre here now and she bids me tell you how sorry she is she didnt give you the car the day you asked for it  oh father john mrs mckeons been too kind to me indeed i love her dearly though i could never tell her so give her my kind love i never thought she was so kind a woman  i will feemy indeed i will she is a kind woman and it will please her to the heart to hear how you speak of her she sends you all manner of loves and lyddy and louey too she is sending up a few things for you too patsey ll bring them just till affairs are settled a little she wishes me to tell you she ll be up herself on thursday she wouldnt come before for she thought youd be better pleased to be alone a few days  tell her not to come here this is no place for her now they never open the front door now this is no place for any one now but just father and me but tell her how i love her ill never forget her no not in my grave  but ive another message for you feemy  is it from her  no not from her well as she loves you its from one who loves you better than she does it is from one who loves you better than any ever did since your poor mother died  feemy raised her eyes and clasped her hands as she listened to father johns words and marked his solemn tones no thought of thady entered her mind but some indefinite halfconceived idea respecting ussherthat he had not been killedthat he had come to life againthat some mysterious miracle such as she had read of in novels had taken place and that father john had come with some blessed news which might yet restore her to happiness and tranquillity the illusion was but for a moment though during that moment it completely took possession of her it was as speedily dispelled by father johns concluding words  i mean from your brother  feemy gave a long long sigh as she heard the word she wished for no message from her brother he had robbed her of everything she could not think of him without horror and shuddering  he sends his kindest love to you i told him you were better and he was very glad to hear it though he has many heavy cares of his own to bear i have never seen him but he asks after your health with more anxiety than he thinks of his own prospects now you are better feemy wont you send him some message by mesome kind word which may comfort him in his sorrow  feemy was no hypocrite hypocrisy though she did not know it herself was distasteful to her she had no kind feelings for her brother and she did not know how to make the pretence which might produce kind words so she remained silent  what not a word feemy you who spoke so well so properly so affectionately but now of that good friend of yourshave you not a word of kindness for a most affectionate brother  feemy still remained silent  why feemy what is this dont you love your own brother  she said nothing in reply for a moment or two and then bursting into tears she exclaimed  dont scold me father johndont scold me now or i shall die i try to forgive himi am always trying but why did hewhy did hewhy did he she was unable to finish her sentence from the violence of her sobs and the difficulty of uttering the words which should have concluded it she meant to say why did he kill my lover  dont agitate yourself feemy i dont mean to scold you i dont mean even to vex you more than i can possibly help but i must speak to you about your brother i see the feeling that is in your mind and i will not blame you for it for i believe it is natural but i beseech you to pray that your heart may be softened towards your brother who instead of repugnance deserves from you the warmest affection but though i will not attempt to control your feelings i must tell you that you will be most wicked if you allow them to interfere with the performance of your duties you know your brothers trial is coming on do you not  yes  wednesday fortnight next is the day fixed i believe you know you will have to be a witness  i believe so father john  certainly you will and i wish you now to listen to me that you may know what it is that you will then have to do in the first place you will be asked i presume by one gentleman whether you were willingly eloping with captain ussher feemy shuddered as the name was pronounced and of course you must answer that trulythat you were doing so then another gentleman will ask you whether you were absolutely walking off with him when the blow was struck which killed captain ussher and feemy you must also answer that truly now the question is can you remember what you were doing when the blow was struck tell me now feemy can you remember  no father john i remember nothing from the time when he took me by the arm as i sat upon the tree till thady told me he was dead i remember nothing if they kill me i can tell them nothing  feemy dear dont sob so thats all youll have to say merely say thatmerely say that you were sitting on a tree were you waiting for captain ussher there  yes  and that whilst you were there you saw thady isnt that so  yes  and ussher then raised you by the arm and then you fainted  i dont know what happened to me but i heard nothing and saw nothing till thady lifted me from the ground and told me he was dead  thats all feemy surely theres no great difficulty in saying thatwhen itll save your own brothers life to say so and its only the truth you can say as much in court as youve just said to me cant you mrs mckeon ll be there with youand ill be there with you youll only have to say in court what youve just said to me  ill try father john but you dont know what it is for one like me to be talking with so many horrid faces round onewith the heart dead withinto be asked such horrid questions and everybody listening ill do as you bid me ill go with them when they fetch mebut i know ill die before ive said all they will want me to say  father john tried to comfort and strengthen her but she was in great bodily pain and he soon saw that he had better leave her she had at any rate shown him by her answers to his questions that the evidence she could give would be such as would most tend to thadys acquittal and moreover he perceived from her manner that though the feelings which she entertained towards her brother were of a most painful description she would nevertheless not be actuated by them in any of the answers she might give  on the thursday following mrs mckeon and one of her daughters called at ballycloran and in spite of the bars and bolts with which the front door was barricaded they contrived to make their way into feemys room she remembered that father john had told her that they would call on that day and she was therefore prepared to receive them mrs mckeon brought her some little comforts from drumsna of which she was sadly in want for there was literally nothing at ballycloran but what was supplied by the charity of those who pitied them in their misfortunes and among other things she brought two or three volumes from the library she was very kind to her and did and said all in her power that could in any way console the poor girl though father john had been gentle in his manners and had endeavoured to abstain from saying anything hard still mrs mckeon was more successful in her way of explaining to feemy what it was that she would have to do she promised moreover to come to ballycloran and fetch her and to remain with her and support her during the whole of the painful time that she would either be in the court itself or waiting in the neighbourhood till she should be called on to give her evidence she did not allude either to the manner in which feemy had left drumsna or to the suspicions which she had formerly expressed her whole object now was to relieve as much as possible the despondency and misery so plainly pictured in the poor girls face as she put her arm round her neck and kissed her lips feemys heart yearned towards her newfound friend with a kind of tenderness she had never before felt it was as though she for once experienced a mothers solicitude for her in her sorrows and she longed to throw herself on her knees hide her face in her friends lap and confess it all had she been alone with her she would have done so but there sat louey in the same room and though her conduct to feemy had been everything that was kind she felt that it was not as if she had been absolutely alone with her mother she could not at the same time confess her disgrace to two  mrs mckeon went away after having strongly implored feemy to return with her to drumsna and remain there till the trial was over but this she absolutely refused to doand at last it was settled that mrs mckeon should come for her on the morning on which the trial was to come on and that she should hold herself ready to attend on any day that she might be called for after the commencement of the assizes  the time now wore quickly on when mrs mckeon called it had only wanted a fortnight to the first day on which the trial could take place and as it quickly slipped away day by day to that bourn from which no day returns poor feemys sorrow and agonies became in every way more acute at last on the wednesdaythe day before that on which she was to be or at any rate might be fetchedshe was in such a state that she was unable to support herself in a chair mary mcgovery would not leave her for a moment the woman meant kindly but her presence was only an additional torment she worried and tortured feemy the whole day she talked to her intending to comfort her till she was so bewildered that she could not understand a word that was said and she kept bringing her food and slops declaring that there was nothing like eating for a sore heartthat if ussher was gone there were still as good fish in the sea as ever were caughtand that even if thady were condemned the judge couldnt do more than transport him which would only be sending him out to a better country and faix the one hed laves bad enough for man and baste  about seven in the evening feemy was so weak that she fainted mary who was in the room at the time lifted her on the sofa and when she found that her mistress did not immediately come to herself she began stripping her for the sake of unlacing her stays and thus learnt to a certainty poor feemys secret  mary had a great deal of shrewd common sense of the coarser kind she felt that however well inclined she might be to her mistress she should not keep to herself the circumstance that she had just learnt she knew it was her duty as a woman to make it known to some one and she at once determined to go that evening to mrs mckeon and tell her what it was she had discovered  as soon as feemy had come to herself she got her into bed and having performed the same friendly office for the old man she started off for drumsna and having procured a private audience with mrs mckeon told her what had occurred  mrs mckeon was not at all surprised though she was greatly grieved she merely said  you have done quite right mary to tell me but dont mention it yet to any one else after all this affair is over well see what will be best to do god help her poor girl it were almost better she should die and as mary went down stairs she called her back to her take my silk cloak with you mary tell miss macdermot ive sent it because shell be so cold tomorrowand mary and here she whispered some instruction on the stairs and mind i shall come myself for herbut let her be ready as may be there maynt be a minute to spare  father john was certainly right when he said that mrs mckeon had a kind heart     chapter xxviii  assizes at carrickonshannon   and now the assize week in carrickonshannon had commenced and all was bustle and confusion noise dirt and distraction i have observed that a strong determined regularly setin week of bad weather usually goes the circuit in ireland in company with the judges and barristers making the business of those who are obliged to attend even more intolerable than from its own nature it is always sure to be and so it was in this case  on tuesday afternoon mr baron hamilton and justice kilpatrick entered carrickonshannon one after the other in the company of the high sheriff and a tremendous shower of rain which drenched the tawdry liveries of the servants and gave a most uncomfortable appearance to the whole affair  the grand jury had been in the town since monday morningsettling fiscal businesswrangling about roadstalking of tollschecking county cessesand performing those various patriotic offices which they would fain make the uninitiated believe require so much talent industry and energy and as they were seen stepping over the running gutters and making the best of their way through the splashing streets their physiognomies appeared ominous of nothing good to the criminals whose cases had in the first instance to come before them  every lodging in the town was engaged beds being let sometimes three in a room for the moderate sum of a guinea each for the week the hotels for there are two were crowded from the garrets to the cellars happy the man at such a period who enjoys a bedroom which he can secure with a keyfor without such precaution the rightful possessor is not at all unlikely on entering his own premises to find three or four somewhat rough looking strangers perhaps liberated jurors or witnesses just escaped from the fangs of a counsel sitting in most undisturbed ease on his bed eating bread and butter and drinking bottled porter some huge farmer with dripping frieze coat will be squatted on his pillow his towel spread as tablecloth on the little deal table which has been allotted to him as the only receptacle for his jug basin lookingglass brushes and every other article of the toilet and his carpetbag dressinggown and pantaloons chucked unceremoniously into a corner off the chairs which they had occupied to make way for the damp friends of the big farmer who is seated on the bed this man is now drawing a cork from a bottle of porter the froth of which you are quite sure from the manner in which the bottle is held will chiefly fall upon the sheets between which you are destined to sleepunless some half drunken ruffian regardless of rights of possession and negligent of etiquette deposits himself there before the hour at which you may think good to retire to rest  fruitless and vain would it be for you to endeavour to disturb that convivial party better lock up your bag above all things not forgetting your brushes and as you are a witness yourself go down to the court and admire the ingenious manner in which the great barrister mr allewinde is endeavouring to make that unfortunate and thoroughly disconcerted young man in the witness box swear to a point diametrically opposite to another point to which he has already sworn at the instigation of counsel on the other sideand thereby perjure himself never mind the bustling of eager curious countrymen never mind those noisy numerous policemen with their sunday brasschained caps push on through them all make your way into the centre of the courtgo down there right on to the lawyers benches never mind the seats being fullplunge in if you hesitate look timidask question or hang backyou are lost thrust out expelled and finally banished with ignominy into the tumultuous sea of damp frieze coats which æstuates in the outer court but go on with noise impudence and a full face tread on peoples toes and thrust them back with by your leave and you will find yourself soon seated in direct view of the judge counsel witness and prisoner you will be taken for an attorney or at any rate for an influential court witness if you talk somewhat loud and frown very angrily in the face of the tallest policeman you may by the ignorant even be taken for a barrister  in fact into court you must come there is no other place open to receive you the big room at the hotel in which we have been three times on such different occasions the long big room where mckeon presided over so many drunken spiritswhere poor feemy made her last arrangements with her lover at the balland where so soon afterwards she was brought forward to give her evidence touching his death while his cold body was lying dead on the table before herthis long big room is now set apart for yet another purpose the grand jury are to dine there and already the knives and forks are laid out upon the long deal table the little coffeeroomso called though whiskeyroom or punchroom or porterroom would be much the more appropriate name unless indeed there is a kind of lucus a non lucendo propriety in the appellationis full nearly to suffocation there is not an unoccupied chair or corner of a table to be found  large men half wet throughreeking smelling most unwholesomely as the rain steams up from their clothesare keeping the cold out of their stomachs by various spirituous appliances the room is half covered with damp straw which has been kicked in from the passage the windows are closed and there is a huge fire burning on the other side of that moist mass of humanity on entering the room you feel that you breathe nothing but secondhand rain a sojourn there you find to be impossible the porter drinkers are still in your bedroom even on your bed upstairs what are you to do where are you to go back home you cannot you have a summons in your pocket you have been unfortunately present when mr terence oflanagan squeezed the fair hand of miss letitia murphy false mr terence oflanagan would not come to the matrimonial altar when required fair miss letitia murphy demands damages and you must swear to the fact of the hand having been squeezed as aforesaid who can tell when the case may come on rumour comes from the clerk of the peace town clerk or some other clerk who sits there in pride of place always conspicuous under the judges feet and whispers that letitia murphy spinster is coming on next attorneys clerks have been round diligently to all witnesses especially as it seems to yourself warning you that the important hour is at handthat on no account may you be absent so much as ten minutes walk from the court vainly you think to yourself that it can hardly be of such vital import that you her fathers friend saw little letty murphys hand ensconced one evening in the brawny palm of that false lothario oflanagan yes of serious import is itif not to letty or to terenceyet to that facetious barrister mr olaugher who at your expense is going to amuse the dull court for a brief halfhourand of importance to yourself who are about to become the laughingstock of your county for the next twelve months it is therefore evident that you cannot leave the filthy town with its running guttersthe filthy inn with its steamy stinking atmosphere and bedroom porter drinkers for good and all and let lothario oflanagan spinster letty lawyers allewinde and olaugher with justice kilpatrick settle the matter by themselves their own way but that you must willy nilly in spite of rain crowd and offensive smell stay and help to settle it with them into court therefore return unfortunate witness other shelter have you none and now being a man of strong nervesexcept when put into a chair to be stared at by judge bar grand jury little jury attorney galleries c cyou can push your way into a seat and listen with attention to the quiddities of the legally erudite mr allewinde as on behalf of his client he ingeniously attemptsnay as he himself afterwards boasts to the jury succeeds in making that disconcerted young gentleman in the witness chair commit perjury  mr allewinde is a most erudite lawyer he has been for many years employed by the crown in its prosecutions and with great success he knows well the art of luring on an approver or crown witness to give the information he wants without asking absolutely leading questions he knows well how to bully a witness brought up on the defence out of his senses and make him give evidence rather against than for the prisoner and it is not only witnesses that he bullies but his very brethren of the gown the barristers themselves who are opposed to him at any rate the juniors are doomed to bear the withering force of his caustic remarks  no really i cannot suffer this witness dont answer that question the learned gentleman must be aware that this is irregular my lord i must appeal to you stop stop that can never be evidence and so onthe unfortunate junior who fondly thought that with the pet witness now in the chair he would be surely able to acquit his client finds that he can hardly frame a question which his knowing foe will allow him to ask and the great mr allewinde convicts the prisoner not from the strength of his own case but from his vastly superior legal acquirements  how masterly is he in all the points of his profession as evinced in a criminal court with what becks and smiles and wreathed nods he passes by his brethren on the prosecuting side and takes his seat of honour how charmingly he nods to the judge when his lordship lays down the law on some point in conformity with the opinion expressed by himself how rapidly he throws to the wind the frivolous excuses of some juror wishing to escape the foreseen long nights confinement how great is he on all points of panelsadmissible and inadmissible evidencereplying and not replying how thoroughly he knows the minute practice of the place how he withers any attorney who may dare to speak a word on his own behalf whilst asking questions of a witness on behalf of an otherwise undefended prisoner how unceremoniously he takes the word out of the mouth of the in his opinion hardly competent junior barrister who is with him how demosthenic is his language when addressing the jury on the enormity of all agrarian offences with what frightful fearful eloquence does he depict the miseries of anarchy which are to follow nonpayment of tithes rents and taxes and with what energy does he point out to a jury that their own hearths homes and very existence depend on their vindicating justice in the instance before them  mr allewinde was never greater than in the case now before the court a young farmer of the better class had been served with some disagreeably legal document on account of his nonpayment of an arrear of rent he had at the time about twenty acres of unripe oats on the ground for which the arrear was due and he also held other ground for which he owed no arrear on ascertaining that a distraint was to be put on the ground which owed the rent he attended there with a crowd of countrymen and would not allow the bailiff to put his foot upon the lands the next day the bailiff came again with police in numbers at his heels and found the twenty acres which had yesterday been waving with green crops utterly denuded every blade had been cut and carried in the night and was then stacked on the ground on which no distraint could be levied in twelve hours and those mostly hours of darkness twenty acres had been reaped bound carted carried uncarted and stacked and the bailiff and the policemen had nothing to seize but the long green uneven stubble  the whole country must have been therethe field must have been like a fairgreen the whole nighteach acre must have taken at least six men to reapthere must have been thirty head of cattle of one sort or other dragging it home and there must have been upwards of a hundred women and children binding and loading there could at any rate be no want of evidence to prove the fact one would think so with two or three hundred people with their tools horses and cars but yet when the landlord determined on prosecuting the tenant there was not a person to be found who had seen the corn removednot one in fact people who had not seen as the bailiff had the corn covering the broad field one day and the same field bare the next began to think that the fact was not so and that the miraculous nights work was a fable it was certain that the bailiff had been deterred from entering on the ground but it was also certain that nothing but words had been used to deter him he had not been struck or even pushed he had only been frightened and it seemed somewhat plain that his faint heart only had prevented him from completing his seizureeither that or some pecuniary inducement things were going badly with the bailiff particularly when in answer to mr olaugher he had been obliged to confess that on the morning on which the seizure should have been made he had takena thrifle of sperrits a glass perhapsyes maybe twoyes he had taken two three suggested mr olaugher with a merely raised eyebrow he couldnt say that he had not taken three four again inquired mr olaugher he didnt think he had taken four could he swear he had not taken four he would not swear he hadnt he would not even swear he had not taken fivenor even six so conscientious a bailiff was he but he was nearly sure he hadnt and would swear positively he had not swallowed seven whereupon mr olaugher most illnaturedly put down his morning dram at three quarters of a pint and asked the unhappy bailiff whether that quantity was not sufficient to make him see a crop of oats in an empty field it was going badly with the landlord and bailiff and well with the energetic nightworking fraudulent tenantand would have gone well with him had he not determined to make assurance doubly sure  a young man had been dining out and had returned home at twelve oclock on the night of the supposed miraculous reaping he had at that hour walked home along the lane which skirted the field and had seen no menheard no noisenor perceived either reapers cars horses or any signs of work yet he had passed the very gate of the field through which the corn must have come out had it come out at all such was the effect of this young gentlemans evidence when he was handed over to mr allewinde by mr olaugher with a courteous inquiry of his brother whether he wished to ask that gentleman any questions mr allewinde said that he would ask him a few questions and the young gentleman began to tremble  mr green i think your name is began mr allewinde  yes sir  and then it appeared that mr green absolutely remembered the night of the 12th september had heard the rumour of the corn having been removed but had not observed it growing there when he went to dinner had dined at the house of the prisoners father about a mile beyond the field had certainly passed the very field could positively swear he was perfectly sober was certainly not carried by drunk had not observed the field especially could not say he had looked at the field as he passed had heard of the bailiffs retreat that morning did not think to look at the ground where the mob had been did not observe the place will positively swear he heard nothing was not walking in his sleep could not swear whether the oats were standing at the time or notwhether the gate was open or shutwhether or no men were in the field only he saw none he believed it was moonlight  why man what did you see asked mr allewinde  nothing particular  had you your eyes open  no answer  now by virtue of your oath were your eyes open  no answer  come sir i must and will have an answer on your solemn oath were your eyes open when you walked by that field  at last after various renewed questions the witness says no  did you shut them by accident  after that question had been sufficiently often repeated the witness again said no he had been blinded and in the same way it was at last extracted from him that his ears had been stopped also and that he had been led along the road by the field that he might be able to swear that he had passed the place during the night without either seeing or hearing what was at the moment taking place there  oh that miserable witness one could swear from the glassy look of his eyes that then also during those awful questions he could see nothing the sweat rolled down his miserable face that savage barrister appeared to him as a devil sent direct from the infernals for his express behoof so unmercifully did he tear him and lacerate him twenty times did he make him declare his own shame in twenty different ways oh what a prize for a clever sharp ingenious triumphant counsellor allewinde that wicked false witness with his shallow detected device he played with him like a cat does with a mousenow letting him go for a moment with the vain hope that he was to escapethen again pouncing on him and giving him a fresh tear till at last when the young man was desired to leave the chair one was almost inclined to detest the ingenuity of the ferocious lawyer more than the iniquity of the false witness  this case was now over the bailiff again held up his head the landlord gained his cause the farmer was sent to prison and the blind and deaf witness sneaked out of town in shame and disgrace this came of not letting well alone  the wednesday was now advanced and it was settled that there would not be time for the great murder case as poor thadys affair was called besides mr allewinde was also to conduct that and he wanted some rest after his exertions and as he walked out with triumph some minor cases were brought forward for disposal and mr olaugher rushed into the other court to defend terence oflanagan before mr justice kilpatrick against the assaults made upon his pocket by that willowwearing spinster letitia murphy  in rushed also all the loungers from the other court in such a place as carrickonshannon a breach of promise of marriage case is not an every day treat and consequently men are determined to make the most of it counsellor olaugher runs his hands through his dark grey hair opens wide his light blue eye pulls out the needful papers from that bottomless bag and though but the other moment so signally defeated in the other court with sure trust in his own resources prepares for victory  the case is soon stated mr terence oflanagan with five hundred ayear profit rents out of the town and neigbourhood of mannhamilton has to the palpable evidence of the whole and next baronies been making up as the phrase goes to letty murphy for the last six months this has been no case of bardell v pickwick but a real downright matter of lovemaking on the one side and love made on the other letters too have been written and are now to be read in court to the great edification of the unmarried jury and amusement of the whole assemblage and the deceitful culprit has gone so far as to inform the father murphy that he has a thousand pounds saved to settle if he the father has another to add to it all these things mr omalley puts forward on behalf of the injured letty in his opening speech and then proceeds to bring evidence to prove them  in the first place the father gives his evidence and is crossexamined with great effect by mr olaugher then the letters are read and are agreed by all to be very affectionate proper agreeable loveletters there is no crossquestioning them for though answered they will not answer and our friend who escaped but just now melancholy from the porter drinkers in his bedroom is brought forward to prove the lovemakings of the delinquent  all mr omalleys questions he answers with great readiness and fluency for it was for the purpose of answering them that he came forward he states without hesitation that lovemaking to a considerable extent has been going on that to his knowledge and in his presence most particular attentions have been paid by mr terence to miss letty that they have sat together talked together walked together and whispered together to such an extent that in his the witnesss mind they had for some time past been considered to be a regularly engaged couple and that moreover he had himself seen mr terence oflanagan squeezing the hand of miss letty having declared so much on behalf of the lady he also was handed over to mr olaugher to be made to say what he could on behalf of the gentleman  in answer to different questions he stated that he himself was a middleaged gentleman about fortya bachelor moving in good societysufficiently so to be acquainted with its usages that he was in the habit of finding himself in company with ladiesmarried ladies and single he confessed after some interlocutions that he did prefer the company of the latter and that he preferred the goodlooking to the plainthe young to the old he would not state whether he had made up his own mind on the subject of matrimony and had a very strong objection to inform the jury whether he was engaged was his objection insurmountable yes it was whereupon it was decided by the court that the witness need not answer the question as he could not be called on to criminate himself he had probably however been in love suggested mr olaugher but he wouldnt say that he had a little smitten perhaps perhaps he had was perhaps of a susceptible heart no answer and accustomed to cupids gentler wounds no answer hadnt he usually in his heart a prepossession for some young lady mr olaugher must insist on having an answer to this question as it was absolutely necessary the jury should know the nature of a witnesss temperament whose evidence was chiefly one of opinion and not of facts how could they otherwise know what weight to give to his testimony hadnt he usually a prepossession in his heart for some young lady there was a great deal of hesitation about this question but at last he was got to inform the jury on his oath that he usuallyin fact alwaysdid entertain such a prepossession was he not fond of conversing with the lady who for the time might be the object of this feeling he supposed he was of walking with her no not particularly of walking with her did he never walk with his loved one he didnt think he ever did except by accident werent such happy accidents of frequent occurrence they might be werent they gratifying accidents when they did occur why yes he supposed they were then he was fond of walking with his loved one why taking it in that way he supposed he was mr olaugher supposed so too did he never whisper to this loved object no never what never never what could he swear that he had never whispered to the present object of his adoration he had no object of adoration well then object of love he had no object of love that is he wouldnt say whether he had or not he thought it very hard that he should be asked all these questions well then object of prepossession could he swear that he had never whispered with the present object of his prepossession neverexcept in church that was to say he couldnt tell never except in churchnever walk with her except by accident mr olaugher surmised that the witness was a very cautious fellowquite an old birdnot to be caught with chaff did he never sit by her sit by who by the object of his prepossession he supposed he might at dinner or at a party or a concert or a ball  what sit by the object you love best at a concert and not whisper to her between the tunesand you a connaught man said mr olaugher come mend your reputation a little wasnt that a slip you made when you said now youd never whispered to her at a concert perhaps he had at a concert well now i thought so i thought by your complexion you wouldnt sit by a pretty girl and take no notice of her did you never squeeze a girls hand while you were whispering to her he couldnt remember now on your oath did you never squeeze a girls hand he might have done so did you never put your arm round a girls waist at last the witness owned he might have done even that and now one question and ive done did you never kiss a girl no answer come thats the last after all youve owned you neednt haggle at that out with it man it must come at last did you never kiss a girl alas for the sake of morality the witness was at length obliged to own that he had perpetrated the enormity and asked mr olaugher with a look of great surprise were you never proceeded against for damages was an action for breach of promise of marriage never brought against you  no never the witness had never been in such a predicament  what never you who have declared i wont say unblushingly for heaven knows you have blushed enough about it but openly and on your oath that you have always some different object of affection with whom you walk sit talk and whisper whose hand you squeeze round whose waist you put your arm a crime by the by never imputed to my client whom you even confess that you kiss and yet you sit here secure unassailed unsolicited for damages unengaged as you lead us to suppose what are the fathers and brothers of connaught doing to let such a hydraheaded monster as thou near their doorssuch a wolf into their sheeppens go down thou false lothario go down thou amorous turk and remember that a day of retribution may yet come for yourself  the unfortunate witness hurried out of courtran through the pelting rain to the inncrammed his brushes and pantaloons into the carpetbag in spite of damp farmers and burly porter drinkerspaid a guinea for the bed in which he had never slept and hiring a postcar hurried from the scene of his disgrace regardless of the torrents which were falling  on the wednesday morning for it had been forgotten till then a summons was served on hyacinth keegan to attend as a witness at thadys trial on the prisoners behalf and as he was living in the town the service was quite in sufficient time and there was no possible means by which he could avoid the disagreeable duty which was thus imposed upon him he was much annoyed however for he felt that there were no questions which he could be asked on the subject which it would not annoy him to answer he had been out but little since the day on which he had been so savagely treated at drumleeshindeed he had not been able to go out till quite lately and he now most thoroughly wished that he was bad enough to obtain a medical certificate which would prevent the necessity of his attending in court that however was impossible and he therefore sat himself to consider what answers he would give to the questions they would be most likely to ask him regard for his oath he had none but there were some most disagreeable questions which if asked him he would be obliged to answer with the truth for on those subjects he would be unable to lie without detection his rancour against thady was unabated unless young macdermot were hung he would be unable to avenge the mutilated stump which crippled all his exertions and now rendered his existence miserable  he flattered himself however that bradys evidence would render that event certain and whatever annoying questions might be put to himself on the defence he was determined that brady should swear to enough on the direct examination to ensure his purpose  on the wednesday evening it was decided that thadys case was to come on first in the criminal court on thursday morning and on the same wednesday evening keegan sent for brady into his office  pat was now regularly installed as the attorneys managing man on the property and there was therefore nothing very remarkable in his sending for him although he was going to be a witness on the morrow  did you hear brady said the master that theyve summoned me for the trial tomorrow  iss yer honour they war telling me so up at the court theres dolan is summoned too  whos dolan  hes one of the boys mr keegan as war in it that night at mrs mehans  well and what can he say he cant say macdermot wasnt there he cant do any harm pat for if he was to swear that he wasnt there theres enough to prove that he was  no yer honour it isnt that hell be saying but hell be saying captain usshers name wasnt mentioned or may be that the boys were merely taking their drink innocent like thats what i be afearedand thats what corney ll say youll see av he dont hes the biggest liar in drumleesh  oh theyd soon knock all that out of him besides isnt he one of these potheen boys  faix he is so mr keegan  then theyll not believe himtheyll believe you a deal sooner than him that way but you must be plain about this brady that they were talking about ussher that nightdye hear be dd but if you let them shake you about that youre lost dye hear why dont you answer me eh  oh shure your honour ill be plain enough certain sure the captains name war mentioned  mentioned yes and how was it mentioned didnt you tell me that reynolds and young macdermot were talking broadly about murdhering him didnt they agree to kill himto choke him in a bog holeor blow his brains out  it war your honour they war to put in a bog hole  dn them ill have em before ive done but dont you know that macdermot reynolds and the other fellow agreed to put an end to ussher why you told me so twenty times  i blieve they did but faix i aint shure i heard it all rightly myself yer honour i warnt exactly one of the party  that wont do brady you told me distinctly that reynolds and macdermot swore together to kill the man and you must swear to that in court why the barrister has been told that you can prove it  but mr keegan do you wish me now to go and hang myself you would not wish a poor boy to say anything asd ruin hisself  be dd but some one has been tampering with you you know youll be in no danger as well as i do and by heavens if you flinch now itll be worse for you mind i want you to say nothing but the truth but you know usshers death was settled among them and you must say it out plainlydye hear and i tell you what brady if you give your evidence like a man youll never be the worse of those evenings you spent at mohill at mrs mulreadys you know but if you hesitate or falter as sure as you stand there theyll come against you and then ill not be the man to help you out of the scrape  but mr keegan yer honour they do be saying that iv i brings out all that itll hang the young masther out and out and then ill have his blood upon my conscience  have the divil on your conscience isnt he a murderer out and out and if so shouldnt you tell the truth about it why you fool its only the truth what are you afraid of after telling me so often that you would go through with it without caring a flash for any one  but you see theres so much more of a ruction about it now through the counthry than there war counsellor webb and all thim has made mr thadys name so great that thered be no pace for a boy at all av he war to say a word agin him  then its a coward you are afther all brady  no yer honour im no coward but its a bad thing living in a counthry where all the boys is sworn to stretch you  nonsense pat did they ever stretch me and havent i done as bad and worse to them twenty times theyre trying to frighten you out of your duty and youre going to let them any way i see you are not the man for me i thought you had more pluck in you  why thin mr keegan ive pluck enough but faix i dont like hanging the young man thinand now its out  very wellthen youll be transported for perjury thats all all the things youve to swear to have been sent written out to the counsellor and when you contradict in court what you have already declared to be the truth theyll prosecute you for perjury and a deal of good youll do young macdermot afther all  after a few more arguments of a similar nature brady was again reduced to his allegiance and at last was dismissed having promised to swear stiffly both that usshers death had been agreed on at the meeting at mrs mehans and also that in private conversation with him pat brady macdermot had frequently expressed his determination of being revenged on ussher for the injury he was doing to his sister and hyacinth keegan betook himself to the company of the fair partner of his prosperity and misfortunes comforting himself with the idea that he was sure of success in his attempts to secure thadys conviction and flattering himself that mr omalley could at the worst only ask him some few teasing questions about the property     chapter xxix  thadys trial is commenced   on the same evening namely that immediately before the trial father john visited thady in prison and it was the last time that they were to meet before the fate of the latter was decided the priest had constantly visited the young man in his confinement and had done all in his power to support and cheer his spirits under the horrible circumstances in which he was placed and not without success thady had borne his incarceration and distress with the greatest courage when remaining at aughacashel among the lawless associates with whom he had so foolishly looked for safety he had completely lost his fortitude and power of endurance he was aware that he was doing what was in every sense culpable and he then could not but look on himself as a murderer flying from justice but now he had learned to see what was really criminal in what he had done and what was venial and though the last five months had been spent in prison and though he felt by no means sanguine of his acquittal he had nevertheless never regretted that he had given himself up  father john had again today seen mr omalley who now that he had the affair thoroughly at his fingers ends seemed to be almost sanguine of success and consequently the good priest himself was correspondingly elated  i trust in god thady said he i confidently trust you will be with me at the cottage tomorrow night or at any rate the next the cottage shall be your home for some time my boy if they allow you any home in the country i dont want to give you false hopes but i dont think any jury can convict you im sure mr omalley thinks so too  i dont think so father john it may be so but i dont think so its a comfort to me to know i never meant his death although he was doing what might have tempted me to shoot him av id had a pistol in my hand for as i sit here he was dragging her down the avenue by the waist but i never thought to kill him and though i think they will hang me i feel that i havent the weight of murdher on my hands  you havent thady indeed you may say you havent i that should teach you to repent your sins not to hide them from your own heart tell you that you havent but should they condemn you there are those that will have but god forbidmay god in his great mercy forbid it  but father john whatll feemy do what will the owld man do when i amwhen im gone keegan ll have all now shell be turned out to beg across the world and whatll ever become of her  your fatherll be cared for thady though no one else should see to him i will for your sake hes very infirm youll be astonished when you see him but while he lives and while i have a bit of bread to share with him or a roof to shelter him for your sake he shall never want it  thady pressed the priests hand between his own  what a thing it is to have a friend like you but feemywholl provide for feemy shell be the only one left of the name when im gone therell be nothing left but her house and family ll be gone then and except for poor feemy thered be an end of the whole concern  dont go on that way said father john with tears in his eyes youll be able to see after and live with your own sister yet and who knows but you may yet beat keegan out of ballycloran  oh no father john av they dont hang me out and outav they dont put an end to me altogether ill be transported or sent back here to gaol ill never be at ballycloran again bad as the place is i loved it i think its all the throuble i had with it and with the tinants that made me love it so god forgive mei was hard enough to some of them  father john remained with him till the evening was far advanced and then left him promising to be in court on the morrow  let me see you there father john said he stand near me whilst its going on itll be a comfort to me to have one friend near me among so many strangers and at such a time  i will my boy i must leave the court when feemy is to come for ive promised to be with mrs mckeon when she brings her in but excepting that ill stand as near you as theyll let me  the priest then left his friend and thady was once more alone in his cell about to pass the last of many long tedious nights of suspense there he sat on his iron bedstead in his gloomy cell with his eyes fixed upon vacancy thinking over the different events of his past life and trying to nerve himself for the fate which he too truly believed was in store for him thadys disposition had not been prone to hope he had never been too sanguinenever sanguine enough from the years to which his earliest memory could fall back he had been fighting an earnest hard battle with the worlds cares and though not thoroughly vanquished he had always been worsted he had never experienced what men called luck and he therefore never expected it few men in any rank of life had known so little joy as he had done or had so little pleasure his only object in life had been to drive the wolf from his fathers door and to keep a roof over him and his sister  had patient industry and constant toil been able to have effected this he would have been perhaps not happy but yet not discontented this however circumstances had put out of his power and he felt that the same uncontrollable circumstances had now brought him into his present position he knew little of the grecians doctrine of necessity but he had it in his heart that night when he felt himself innocent and was at the same time assured that all the kind efforts of his friends would not save him from his fatea hangmans rope and the county gallows  there he sat the greater part of that night alone on his cold bedside not knowing whether he was warm or coldnot perceiving whether it was light or dark and no one but god might know the thoughts that passed through his untutored brain or the feelings which kindled his warm though rugged heart did he complain that though honest industrious and patient ignominy and death should be his probable doom had he bitter hatred in his heart for those who had driven him to his fate did he still love those who had evinced so little sympathy with him sympathy ah how could he miss that which he had never felt till father john had blessed him with his kind words his love had not been that conscious love which requires kindness to nurture it and love again to keep it warm he was not aware himself how well he loved his father and his sister his lot had been thrown with them he had passed his life with them and the feelings which in a selfish man are given up to self had with him been turned on those to whose care it had seemed that his life should be dedicated  i do not say that he looked forward to a probable death without a shudder or to so speedy a termination of his career without a wish that unfortunate as it had been it might be prolonged but it was the disgrace and the circumstances of his fate which made by far the greater portion of his misery could he be but once quiet in his grave and have done with it allbe rid of the care turmoil and uneasiness he would have been content could he have been again unbornuncreated he had once repined to father john that existence had been for him a necessary evil and though checked by the priest for the impiety of the thought was it odd if he often thought that he was one of those for whom it would have been better had they never been born  about three or four in the morning he fell asleep and was awakened by father john about eight he dressed himself in his best clothesthose in which he had been accustomed to go to massate his breakfast and about ten oclock was led out of gaol handcuffed into the courthouse the gaol at carrickonshannon is not far from the courthouse and as they are both built on a neck of land running into the river no portion of the town has to be traversed but yet there was a great crowd collected to see the poor fellow pass by this was the first of the bitter moments to which he had so constantly looked forward for the last few months at length however he was in the dock and here the high wooden palings twelve feet above the ground on which he had to stand would screen him from the view of all save the miserable prisoners beside him and the policemen who had brought him inuntil he should be called on to take his place at the bar  after waiting there for about half an hour sitting on the rude benches which surrounded the interior of the dock with his eyes fixed on the red lappets of the gaolers coat which hung over the palings as he sat upon the bar he heard the noise of steps in the court suddenly increased and the sound of voices hushed the judge was taking his seat mr baron hamilton accompanied by a fashionably dressed young gentleman with a white wand entered the court at a sidedoor passed behind the jurybox and sat down on the seat of judgment under the dusty red canopy which for many years had nodded over the wisdom of irelands soundest lawyers  had that piece of red moreen been gifted with an ear to hear and a tongue to tell what an indifferent account would it give of the veracity of judges and of the consciences of lawyers how many offences had it heard stigmatised by his lordship as the most heinous that had ever been brought before him in his judicial capacity how many murderers felons and robbers described as poor harmless innocent foolish boys brought into trouble by a love of frolic how many witnesses vainly endeavouring to tell the truth forced by the ingenuity of lawyers into falsehood and perjury what awful denunciations and what light wit almost in the same breath of what laughter hardly suppressed by judicial authority would it tellwhat agonizing sobs altogether unsuppressable would it describehow many a clever smiling selfsufficient barrister would it from long knowledge have learnt to laugh to scornof how many a sharp attorney would it declare the hidden ways but yards of red moreen are fitting witnesses for judicial gravities and legal exercises they hang profoundly gravelynay all but solemnlyover the exposition of the criminal they lend authority to the wrath and protection to the wit of the wigged they awe the criminal repress the witnesses inspire the juror silence the spectator absorb the dust and tell no tales  and now the judge having taken his place the lesser men in office being duly seated beneath him and the contending barristers having sufficiently dived into their blue bags the prisoner is summoned under various indictments to take his trial for the murder of myles ussher whereupon thady is called upon by the gaoler and rising from his seat takes his stand at the bar in his position there he is just enabled to raise his arm to the railing of the dock and to rest his hand upon it during the ten long horrid wasting hours which he is destined to pass in his present painful position his face is pale andalways thin and sadnow thinner and sadder than ever his eyes wander round the court and as they at length alight on father john who is seated next to mr mckeon on the attorneys benches a kind of gentle smile softens his features and shows how great a relief he feels the presence of a friend to be in answer to the clerk of the crown he declares himself not guilty professes himself ready for his trial and the business of the day commences  the first thing that has to be done is to call over the long panel and the names of all competent persons in the county from whom the jury is to be selected but even preparatory to this the counsel for the defence commence their fight mr olaugher who as the phrase goes is with mr omalley begins by declaring that the list from which the names are read is an illegal lista foolish useless unauthoritative listnothing but balderdash moonshine and waste paperall empty sounds and consisting of a string of names as little to the purpose in the present case as a regimental rollcall the subsheriff who with infinite clerkly care and much subshrieval experience has made out the list opens wide his disturbed ears and begins to feel somewhat uncomfortable mr olaugher goes on to declare that the present list instead of being one properly legally and expressly drawn out for march 183 is only a copy of the one in use during the summer assizes in the last year and assures the judge with much indignant emphasis that he cannot allow his client to submit to the injustice of receiving a verdict from a jury composed under such atrocious circumstances  the objection is listened to with as much gravity as though a statement had been made that the prisoner had been in newfoundland at the time of usshers death and mr allewindes assistant begins to argue the case the subsheriff and his two clerks are put into the chair and have to swear one thing and another books are lugged into courtdirty papers overhauledthick volumes quoted and consultedprecedents urgedobjections answereda great deal of selfconfidence shown at last after a weary hours talk it seems somehow decided that the subsheriff was in the right of itthat the list is correct and that the prisoner may be tried but mr olaugher is not in the least chagrined at the victory of his adversary one would say from his countenance that his only object had been to delay the business for an hour and that he triumphed in his success  the list is accordingly read over and the householders of county leitrim are summoned to appear and answer to their names under a penalty of two pounds a lamentable deficiency however is apparent one only here and there answers to his name as it is called out in the sonorous and practised voice of the clerk of the crown a notice is then given that they will be again invoked under a penalty of ten pounds which in spite of the fear which pervades the minds of jurymen that this will be a lockup affair entailing a bedless night and a meagre supper surreptitiously supplied through the windows of the courthouse has the desired effect and cornelius oreilly patrick tierney anthony reynolds c c reply to the call and the court becomes sufficiently full of strong thickset comfortable men  this is only the long panel now the jury has to be formed to twenty names the prisoner is entitled to object from caprice and mr olaugher is not the man to give up one of the twenty then he can object to as many more as he chooses on showing cause and you may be sure mr olaugher has a great many causes to show one man has lived near young macdermot all his life has been a friend of his must have formed an opinion on the case and is therefore not fit another man has been his enemy and is therefore not fit a third man used to drive with captain ussher twice a week a fourth lived in mohill a fifth at drumsna a sixth did not live in the county at all a seventh had not a house of his own and so on why it appeared there was not a proper juror in the county on all these objections mr olaugher was beaten and as he was beaten on each he indefatigably prepared for the next  then the jurors themselves objected they unblushingly declared themselves unfitasserted that they could not depend upon themselves to give a true verdict and assured the judge that their minds would be improperly biassed by circumstances on one side or the other what atrocious characterswhat selfcondemned miscreants why does not the judge instantly with that stern look he knows so well how to assume turn them out of court bid them make way for honest men and send them home disgraced for ever to their sorrowing families does he do so no indeed he picks his teeth while mr allewinde assures this recusant or the other that he has no doubt but that he will make a most eligible juror and at last with considerable delay a little trial takes place in each case and two other jurymen have to decide on their oaths whether terence murphy stands indifferent between our lord and sovereign the king and the prisoner at the bar and to enable them to decide they have to hear all the evidence in the case  the twelve are at last swornthe proper officer repeating in each case those awful words juror look upon the prisoner prisoner look upon the juror you shall well and truly try and true deliverance make between our lord and sovereign the king and the prisoner at the barso help you god  as this injunction in each case reached thadys ear he moved his eyes upon the man who was then being sworn as if demanding from him that true deliverance to which he felt himself entitled and now the prisoner having pleaded the indictments read and the jury armed with pen ink and paper mr allewinde full of legal dignity and intellectual warmth rises to his subject we will not follow him through the whole of the long narrative which he with great practised perspicuity and in the clearest language laid before the jury for we already know the facts which he had to detail he first of all described the death of ussher then stated that he could prove that the prisoner had killed him and having informed the jury that doubtless the prisoners sister was in the act of eloping with the deceased when he met his death launched out into a powerful description of the present dreadful state of the country he told the jury that it was in his power to prove to them that the prisoner was one of an illegal society who had often threatened ussher and that he had but a day or two previous to the affray met a sworn portion of his own tenants for the purpose of planning the murder he went on to tell the jury that they were not to allow themselves to be deceived by the idea that the murder could not have been premeditated because there existed a presumption that the prisoner was not aware of usshers expected presence in the avenue for that the fact of the murder having been talked over deliberately and then executed afforded the strongest evidence that the prisoner was at the time lying in wait for the deceased and that through the servants or from other means he had made himself cognisant of the projected elopement he then preparatory to examining the witnesses concluded in the following words  gentlemen of the juryyou are probably all aware that the prisoner is from that rank in life to which the greatest number of yourselves belong and you cannot but see that the fact of his being so greatly increases the magnitude of his presumed crime far be it from me to urge you on this account to come to a conviction should the evidence prove in any way deficient but i do implore you if you value the peace of your countrythe comfort of your hearthsthe safety of your housesand the protection of your property not to allow yourselves to be led away by a feeling of false sympathy or to be improperly actuated by the idea that the deed was done in legitimate defence of the prisoners sister if the evidence do not prove that such was the case i do implore you to divest yourselves of any such preconceived notions did the evidence merely go to show that mr ussher was killed by the brother whilst eloping with the sister it would doubtless be fair that the circumstance should be taken into your consideration but when you shall have heard it proved that the death of this unfortunate man was deliberately talked over canvassed and decided on by the very man by whom it was executed you will only fall into the shallow device by which the prisoner has endeavoured to deceive you did you not clearly perceive that he has merely used the fact of his sisters elopement as a favourable opportunity for the completion of his project gentlemen i shall now proceed to call the different witnesses satisfied that when you shall have heard their evidence you will have no difficulty in coming to a verdict in the case  the first witness called was dr blake he stated that he had examined the body the day after ussher had met his death that he had no doubt death had been occasioned by two heavy blows one of which had fractured the skull immediately over the temple and which was of itself quite sufficient to cause instantaneous death that he should presume these blows to have been inflicted with some heavy blunt instrument and that he considered the stick then produced in court and shown to him was such as had probably been used on the occasion  this witness was not crossexamined  biddy was next called and took her seat in the chair with much trepidation but her usual womanly volubility soon returned to her and she gave her evidence fluently enough she stated that her mistress had confided to her her intention of eloping with ussher on the morning of the evening on which he had been killed that in obedience to her mistresss commands she had walked down the road towards mohill and had met ussher in a gig and had put a parcel for her mistress into it that when she returned to the house she believed her masterthat was the prisonerwas in the house in her mistresss sittingroom that shortly after her return she saw him come into the hall that he then told her to go in to his sister and that captain ussher was dead she did not know what became of him after that and that she had not seen him from that moment till the present one  mr olaugher then asked her whether she had told any one of her mistresss intention of eloping with ussher and she replied that she had notthat she had never opened her lips on the subject to any one before she heard the prisoner say that captain ussher was dead she also stated that it was her young masters habit to go out to the stables every night  she also was then allowed to go down and frederick brown was called he proved that ussher had revealed to him his plan of running off with feemy and he stated that not thinking much about it he had told three or four friends of the circumstance and that he could not tell whether or not it might in that manner have got round to the ears of the prisoner  mr olaugher in his crossexamination bothered this young gentleman considerably but as neither the questions nor the answers are material to the story it would be useless to repeat them  the next witness was pat brady and as the verdict to which the jury came depended in a great degree on his evidence it will be given as nearly as possible in detail  having given his name he stated that at the time of usshers death he was in the employment of the prisoner that he had been his confidential servant and was intimate with all his habits that on the night when the deceased was killed at some time he supposed about halfpast nine oclock his master had entered the kitchen at ballycloran and had desired him brady to follow him out into the avenue that his master when in the avenue had told him that he had killed captain ussher  by this time the counsel had ceased asking questions and as the witness was telling his own story we will leave it in his words  i thought it war poking his fun at me yer honoursfor i knowed the captain hadnt been at ballycloran that night and that the masther had been ating his dinner at home so i didnt be taking much notice of what he war saying till we war mostly half down the avenue when mr thady told me the body war there well yer honourswhat with the night and what wid the trees it was amost too dark to see but i felt the mans body with my foot and then i knowd it war thrue enough what the masther was afther saying i axed no questions thin for i knew thered been ill blood betwixt them and when i comed to remember myself i wasnt that much surprised but mr thady axed me what wed be doing wid the body and i cant exactly take upon myself to say what i answered but at last he said as how we would take it down to mrs mehans as keeps the shebeen shop beyond ballycloran he then told me something about miss feemy and the captainas how he was carrying her off by force like and that war why hed stretched him well yer honours at the bottom of the avenue at the gate likethough for the matter of that there aint no gate therewe discovered the brown hall gig and mr freds croptailed bay pony horse standing in the middle of the roadand the masther bid me take the body away to the police at carrick saying he would be off at oncet to the mountains in aughacashel well yer honours this i didi left the captains body with the policei took the gig to brown halland i brought home miss feemys bundle as had been left there in the gig when the captain came out into the avenueand thats the long and the short of what i knows about it yer honoursat laste all i knows about the murder  the prisoner then owned to you continued mr allewinde that it was he who killed captain ussher  shure he made no bones about it allbut told me straight out that hed killed him in the avenue  did he say why he had done so  faix i dont remember his saying thin why hed done itand i didnt think to ask him he was in a flurry like as war nathural and he and i carrying the dead man thatd been hearty only a few minutes afore but shure yer honour knows the thing had been talked over  what thing had been talked over  why the captains death  you mean to say by that that arrangements had been made by certain persons to kill captain ussher  i dont know about arrangements but there war boys through the counthry determined to have a fling at him  now i am going to ask you a question particularly affecting the prisoner and one to which you must give me a direct answer have you ever been in the prisoners company when he and others have expressed their determination to murder captain ussher  faix i dont know about dethermination and murder but ive heard him threatened  have you heard him threatened with murder  ive heard the boys say that he would be undher the sod that day six months  have you heard captain ussher threatened with death in the prisoners presence  i dont know that they ever said death or murder they dont spake out that way av they war going to hole a chap its giving him his quiatis or his gruel theyd be talking about  well now on your oath have you ever in the prisoners presence heard such language used respecting captain ussher as made you think that he was to be killed  didnt i tell yer honour i thought all along how hed be killed  were you ever at mrs mulreadys in mohill  i war  did you ever hear captain usshers name mentioned there  i did  now tell the jury as nearly as you can what was said respecting him there  why a lot of boys swore together over a noggin or two of sperrits to put him undher the sodthats all but shure yer honour mr thady thats him there and he pointed to the dock was niver at mother mulreadys  well but when the boys swore to put the captain under the sod was the prisoners name mentioned  oh it war ofthen  and what was said about him  why yer honour it was this wayand ill tell you all i know about it off handand thin youll not be throubling yer honours self wid all these questions the boys war mostly tenants to mr thady hereand they did be saying that av soav mr thady would jine them in putting down the peelers and the captaintheyd undhertake mr keegand never put a second foot on the lands of ballycloran and they war the more hot about this as they knew mr thady war agin the captain about his sisther for he thought thim two were too thick like and he used to be saying as how ussher war playing his thricks with miss feemy well along of thisand knowing as how the masther were agin mr keegan too they thought hed jine in and to bring him round they swore niver to pay the rint afore he did well yer honour i was one night at the widdys thats mother mulreadys for id gone there knowing as how the tenants d be in it and i war noticing them to be up with the masther on friday next about the rint afther id been telling em all to be up at ballycloran they got swearing that divil a foot theyd stir to the place or divil a penny theyd pay any more because mr thady here war so thick with the captain this war jist afther the row up to loch sheen when three boys war locked up about some squalland this made the rest more bitter agin the captain well when they got swearing this way i axed em why not go to the masther like a man and tell him what they thought wid that they agreed to come up to marys weddingthats mary mcgovery yer honour as is my sisther and who war to be married the thursday and so they parted and a lot on em swore that blessed night that the captain should be under the sod that day six months well yer honour the next morning mr keegan called down to ballycloran about law business and somehow there war words atwixt him and mr thady and from that they got to blows and i blieve somehow mr keegan got the best of it and mr thady was a little hurted and this made him bittherer nor iver  but that did not make him bitterer against captain ussher did it asked a juror  faix thin i think it did yer honour answered pat it seemed to make him bitther altogether agin everybody when i war talking to him aftherwards about coming down to the wedding he seemed to be trating all the world alike but the captain and mr keegan especial well when the supper war over and the boys were begun dancing mr thady come down and immediately comed into the inside room where the men war sitting dhrinking and i war wid them thin one of the men a tinent to mr thady up and tould the masther all as ive tould yer honours of what took place at the widdys in mohill and how av mr thady would jine them to rid the counthry of the captain theyd stand to him and wouldnt let mr keegan on the lands of ballycloran right or wrong wid that there war a dale of shillyshallyingbut at last the masther said as how he would jine the boys in ridding the counthry of the captain and he thin agreed to come down to the widdys the next night or that afther to get the secret signs and the passwords and to take the oaths they war to swear him to wid that he tuk an oath thin niver to tell nothin of what had passed that night after that i dont remember rightly how it war but he got up to look for miss feemy and she war out walking in the road wid the captain well mr thady went down the road afther thimand there war a ruction in the road betwixt thim two but as i warnt there i cant say exactly what was said one side or the other by the time they come agin to mrs mehans door father john thats father magrath you know war there and made the pace betwixt em and thats all i can tell yer honours about it av i war to sit here till doomsday  you said just now said mr allewinde that the prisoner agreed to join the men assembled at mrs mehans in ridding the country of captain ussher now what was meant by ridding the country of him  why isnt it ridding the counthry of him yer honour knows what that means as well as ere a boy in the barony  perhaps i do but you must tell the jury what you mane by it  is it i i didnt mane nothin at all it warnt i as said itor as war ever a going to do it  what did you suppose was the meaning of those who did make use of the phrase  i sposed the boys did mane to get rid of the captain out of the counthry jist that yer honour  but how did you suppose they were to get rid of him  oh yer honour i niver heard the particklars i niver knew nothin of the plan i warnt one of them you know  but the prisoner agreed to join them in any plan or in some plan for ridding the country of captain ussher  he did yer honour shure i said that before  now you said some time ago that when you first discovered that captain ussher had been killed by the prisoner and that when you came to remember yourself you werent much surprised now thank god it is at any rate in this county a very uncommon thing to find that one man has killed another can you tell the jury why you were not surprised at such an event as that  becase i knowed there war illblood betwixt the two  but men do not kill one another whenever they quarrel do they  faix they do sometimes  did you ever of your own knowledge know a man before who killed another  oh dear yes shure i did  well tell us an instance  why there war ould paddy rafferty who war in the cavan militia in the rabellionav he didnt kill scores of the french at ballinamuck hes the biggest liar i ever heard but hes dead now yer honour  supposing that the death of captain ussher had happened a fortnight beforethat the prisoner had killed him a fortnight before the day on which he did kill him would you not have been surprised then  why i dont know that a fortnight makes much difference  answer my question in such a case as that would you not have felt more surprise than you did when the affair did occur  why yer honour i cant answer thatbecase you see it didnt happen then and i couldnt exactly be saying what my feelings might be  at any rate you were not surprised  oh yes i war surprised in course it war a surprise to me when i kicked the dead body but when i come to think over all about the captain i warnt that much surprised  after what had taken place at mrs mehans you did not expect captain ussher would be very long lived  faix he lived longer than i expectedseeing the way he war going on through the counthry  do you remember telling me some time ago speaking of captain usshers death that the thing had been talked over  i blieve i said as much  what did you mean by that  why just that the job had been talked about  what job  why this job  what job tell the jury what job  faix they all know well enough by this time and the witness looked up to the jury or else they oughtnt to be there any way  tell them what job you meannever mind what they know  deed thin youre bothering me so entirely with yer jobs i dont rightly know myself which im maning  think a little then for you must tell them you said the job had been talked over what was it that had been talked over  the witness gave a stolid look at the counsel but answered nothing  come continued mr allewinde what was the job that had been talked over  bad manners to the likes of me but i war niver cute and now im bothered intirely  you mean to tell the jury then that you dont know what you meant when you said the thing had been talked over do you  why i spose it was this thing about captain ussher werent we talking of that then  thats for you to say was it captain usshers death that had been talked over  witness dont answer that question said mr omalley im sure my learned friend will not press it its very seldom he makes such a slip as that  mr allewinde had asked a leading and therefore an unallowable question  why the witness had just said that he supposed it was this thing about captain ussher said mr allewinde  ill say no more about it continued mr omalley feeling perfectly certain that you will not press the question  well said mr allewinde to the witness tell the jury at once what was the thing that had been talked over  why yer honour knows well enough shure werent you saying it yourself only the gentleman here wouldnt let you  well now do you say it  say what  say what was the thing that had been talked over  talked over when yer honour  you told the jury some time since that the prisoner owned to you in the avenue that he had killed captain ussher did you not  faix i didand it was thrue for mehe made no bones about it at all  and you then added that the thing had been talked over what thing was it that had been talked over  ah thats what youre wanting is it deed thin im axing yer pardon for keeping yer honours all this time in suspinse faix thin captain ussher war the thing what war talked over and divil a lie in it for he war talked over ofthen enough  captain ussher had been talked over in such a manner as to prevent your feeling much surprise when you found that the prisoner had killed him isnt that it  jist sofaix id have no difficulty in discoursing wid yer honour av the other gentleman wouldnt put in his say  youll find by and by hell have a great deal more to say  in course and no objection on arth on my part so long as its one at a time  now i think i have only two more questions to ask you if you will give me direct answers to them  twenty av you plaze yer honour  you have said that the tenants of the prisoner had sworn together to put captain ussher under the sod and also that the prisoner had agreed to join the tenants in ridding the country of him was the former phrase that of putting the captain under the sod used in the prisoners presence on the evening of the wedding  there war a lot of thim phrases usedridding the counthrysodding himand all thim sort of disagreeable sayings but i cant swear to any one exactly at mrs mehansthims the sort of words  very well now i think you told us that when the prisoner desired you to take the dead body to the police at carrick he told you he was going to some place where did he say he was going to  to aughacashel  wheres aughacashel  its a mountain behind drumshambo  and did he tell you why he was going to aughacashel  that he mightnt be tuk i spose  i dont want your supposition did the prisoner tell you why he was going to aughacashel  there war some of the tinants there i blieve and he thought hed be safe may be  did the prisoner tell you that he was going to aughacashel because he thought hed be safe there  ill tell you how it war thin we were jist talking together about what hed betther be doing which was nathural and he with the dead body there hed been jist afther killing wid that says he pat says he wheres the stills mostly at work now faith says i i dont exactly be knowing for yer honour i niver turned a penny that way myselfbut says i sich a onell tell you and i mintioned one of the tinants and wheres he said the masther why i heard tell says i that hes in aughacashel but av youll go down to drumleesh youll find out and wid that he went down the road to drumleesh and i druv the body off to carrick  thatll do said mr allewinde ive done with this witness my lord     chapter xxx  the prisoners defence   mr omalley then rose but before he began to crossexamine the witness he addressed the judge  theres a witness in court my lord whom i shall have to examine by and by on the defence and i must request that he may be directed to absent himself during my examination of the witness now in the chair it is material that he should not hear the answers which this witness may give i mean mr hyacinth keegan my lord who is sitting beneath me  keegan was sitting on the bench immediately under that of the barrister among the attorneys employed in court when he heard mr omalleys request to the judge he rose up on his one leg and the judge having ordered him to leave the court he hobbled out with the assistance of his crutch  your name is pat brady i think commenced mr omalley  pat did not reply  why dont you answer my question sir said the counsellor angrily  why i towld what my name war afore thim gintlemen up there knows it well enough and yourself knows it whyd i be saying it agin  well my friend i tell you to begin with i shall ask you many questions youll find considerably more difficult to answer than that and youd better make up your mind to answer them for i mean to get an answer to the questions i shall ask and youll sit in that chair till you do answer them unless youre moved from it into gaol  fire away sir im very well where i am and im thinking i can howld out agin the hunger longer nor yer honer  your name is pat brady  it is  whose servant are you  whose servant  dont you understand what i say whose servant are you  faix thin i dont call myself a servant at all  whos your master then  mr macdermot here was my masther afore this affair  i didnt ask who was your master who is your master now  why mr keegan  mr hyacinth keegan thats just gone out of court hes your master eh  he is  and a very good masterisnt he  betther maybe than yer honourd be and yet perhaps none of the best  answer my questions sir isnt he a good master  faix he is so  how long have you been in his employment  how long  yes how long  why i cant jist say how long  have you been a year  no  six months  no  will you swear that you never were in mr keegans pay before six months ago  i will  you never received any money from mr keegan before six months ago  i did not say that  why if you received his money werent you in his pay  no maybe he gave me a christmasbox or so hes very good to a poor boy like me in that way is mr keegan  in whose employment were you six months ago  in mr macdermots yourself knows that well enough  and mr macdermot and mr keegan were great friends at that time werent they  faix they were not i never seed much frindship betwixt em  did you ever see any enmity between themany quarrellingor what you very properly call bad blood  indeed i did then  i blieve mr macdermotthats the prisonerhad great trust in you hadnt he  i believe he had  you knew all the affairs about the estate  i blieve i did  he told you all his troublesall his money difficulties didnt he  one way or other i blieve i knew the most on em  particularly as to the money due on his fathers property which keegan had to receive he used to talk to you confidentially about those things  well and av he did  but he did so didnt he  faix but i dont know what youre afther i blieve he towld me all about everything  i believe he did indeed and now ill tell you what im after mr macdermot unfortunately believing you to be an honest man told you all his plans and secrets which you in consideration of certain pay which you call christmasboxes sold to the man whom you knew to be your masters enemy isnt that the fact now  no it ant  ah but i say it is the fact and now do you suppose any jury will believe a word youve said after having shown yourself guilty of such treachery as that do you expect the jury to believe you  deed i doevery word lord bless you they knows me  now then tell me can you recall any conversation between yourself and mr keegan since the death of captain ussher relative to this trial  i can  more than one perhaps  oh lor yes twenty maybe  will you tell us any particulars you may remember of the last  a long conversation then ensued but mr omalley could only elicit that brady had of his own accord informed his master of all he knew on the subject and that he had done so because he thought it right he admitted however that mr keegan had expressed a desire that the prisoner might be hung a great many questions were then asked as to the present holding of ballycloran to which brady answered stating with tolerable accuracy the manner in which larry at present lived on the property and the hold which keegan had upon it he moreover stated that the house was in a very bad state of repair and that most of the tenants who were left on the property were unable to pay their rent he then after much hesitation owned that he had overheard what had taken place between keegan and thady in the avenue on the day when the attorney had called at ballycloranthat he had heard the name which keegan had applied to feemy and that he had seen the manner in which thady had been struck  he was then asked whether he himself had not cautioned thady against ussher telling him the reports that were going through the country as to usshers treatment of his sister this he denied stating that it wasnt probable that the likes of him should go to speak to his masther about such things as that he was repeatedly questioned on this point but mr omalley could not shake his evidence brady however owned that in talking to thady about ussher he had called the latter a black protestant and that he had always spoken ill of him and now continued mr omalley i dont wish to ask you any questions by answering which you will criminate yourself but you have already said that you have been a visitor at mrs mulreadys shop  oh yes ive been there  and you have been there when certain persons swore that before twelve months were passed captain ussher should be under the sod  yes i swear i heard thim words and saw the boys take the oath  but to the best of your belief the prisoner was never at this house when such an oath was taken  is it mr thady he was niver at mother mulreadys at all  but he met the party who had taken this oath at your sisters wedding  he did  and the same subject was spoken of there was it  what subject  the propriety of sodding captain ussher  i dont know about propriety  well then the advisability of doing so  oh yer honer i aint no scollard i cant make nothin of thim long words  at any rate they talked of sodding captain ussher at the weddingdidnt they  i niver said so  well but did they  talk of sodding him faix i dont know i dont think they said sodding  did they say killing  i wont say they did  or murdering  no they did not say nothin about murdher  oh they did not say anything about murderor doing for him perhaps the prisoner and the other boys agreed to do for him  maybe they didmaybe you were there only if so i disremember you but thims not the words i swore to  well they didnt agree to sod him or kill him or murder him or do for him what was it they were to do for him  they were to rid the counthry of him  whatmake the country too hot to hold him eh is that what you mean  it dont matter what i mean that warnt what they meant  and how do you know what they meant  why they meant to kill the man you know that as well as i  but i dont know itnor do i think it nor what is more do you think it for you are sharp enough to know that where there are so many figurative terms in use to signify murder it is not probable that had they on this occasion wished to signify murder they would have used a phrase which every one knows expresses an intention to drive a man out of the country yes sir you know that not one of the party would have dared to propose to mr macdermot to have a share in murder you and they talked of murder at mrs mulreadys but you know that for your life you would not have dared to mention it before mr macdermot now tell me how long was the prisoner at the wedding party  maybe three hours  was he sober when he came in  he war  was he sober when he went out  sober when he went out  yes sir was he sober when he went out  i dont think he warnot to say sober  wasnt he mad drunk  mad dhrunk  dont repeat my words sir wasnt he mad drunk  faix thats thrue for you sirtheyre not worth repeating no he war not mad dhrunk  was he drunk and mind sir you are on your oathand there were many others present there who will prove whether you answer this question truly or falsely was he drunk when he left the wedding party  deed then i dont know you can ask thim as war there besides me  but i choose to ask you and i choose that you should answer me was he drunk  dont i tell you that i dont know  on your oath you dont know whether he was drunk or not  he war screwed divil a doubt of that but thin he could walki wouldnt call him dhrunk  wasnt he nearer being so than youd seen him for many months  faix he war i didnt see him so bad since leitrim fair two years back  and now you say that at the wedding the prisoner promised in a day or two to meet the same boys at mrs mulreadys to settle their plans of ridding the country of ussher  yes about that and other things  and the prisoner never kept that appointment  no mr thady niver went there  did you ever say anything to him about not going there  oh i did we were discoursing about it  and what did you say to him on the subject  why i towld him av he guv the boys a promise he oughts never to go back from his word  that is to say you endeavoured to persuade him to go  bydad i dont know about persuading it warnt for the likes of me to persuade him  on your oath sir didnt you endeavour to induce the prisoner to go to mrs mulreadys  i towld him he ought to be as good as his word  yes you did and you think he ought to have gone  may be av hed gone there hed never have stood here this day  you wanted him to go to mrs mulreadys then  wanted no i didnt want nothing about it  you only asked him to go  jist as i towld you i said av he guv the boys his word as a man he shouldnt go from it  did you say anything to him about mr jonas brown  jonas brown  yes mr jonas brown the magistrate  faix i dont know i cant rightly say  think now my man when you were trying to persuade your master to go to the widow mulreadys did you mention mr jonas browns name  dye think i do be counting my words that way how am i to say all the names i mintioned four or five months back  on your solemn oath dont you remember mentioning that gentlemans name to the prisoner with reference to his visit to mrs mulreadys  what jonas browns name  yes  faix i may  dont you know you did  faix i dont  didnt you threaten your master that if he did not attend the meeting some of the boys would swear against him before mr brown for having joined the party and taken the oath at the wedding  what av i did  but did you  maybe i didmaybe i didnt i disremember thim little things  the crossexamination continued for a considerable time but nothing further that was material could be drawn from brady he seemed even more unwilling to answer mr omalley than he had been in replying to mr allewinde and at last he was sent off the table  the next witness called was mcgovery who had been summoned on behalf of the prosecution he was asked whether he had not suspected that some foul play was intended against ussher and he stated in what manner he had in the first place cautioned ussher himselfthen that he had told the same thing to father johnand that after overhearing a portion of the conversation at mrs mehans he had gone to father cullen for the purpose of informing him that he feared there was a conspiracy against mr keegan little however could be learnt from him for he owned that he had no substantial grounds for his suspicions in the first case and that he had chiefly been led to fear an attack upon ussher from knowing his unpopularity and the bad character of many of the guests expected at the wedding mr olaugher tried to make him say that the conversation at mrs mehans had been confined to keegan and the threats which he had heard uttered against him but mcgovery would not say as much as this he stated positively that he had never heard usshers name mentioned but that during a considerable portion of the evening he had been entirely unable to hear a word that the men said he declared however positively that thady was drunk when he left the room and that it appeared to him that he thady had taken very little part in the conversation before he was drunk  when this witness went off the table mr allewinde declared that the case for the prosecution was finishedstating at the same time that he abstained from feelings of delicacy and respect from putting the prisoners sister into the witness box and that he should trouble her with no questions unless she were placed there by the counsel for the defence  mr omalley then rose to address the jury on behalf of the prisoner and spoke to the following effect  gentlemen of the jury it now becomes my duty to address to you such words as may best suit to point out to you the weakness of the evidence against the prisonerto explain to you the different objects we had in our lengthened crossexamination of the witnessesto inform you what we intend to prove on behalf of the prisoner from further witnessesand in fact to put the case before you in a light and point of view differing as widely as i can make it do from that in which my learned friend has presented it to you this you are aware is the general duty and constant object of a counsel endeavouring to obtain a verdict of acquittal from a jury it is a duty in which long practice has made me familiar if not skilful and i never undertook that duty with the same assurance of its facility as that which i now feel after having heard the evidence which has been brought forward on the prosecution i knew beforehand as surely as one can trust to human knowledge that the evidence would fail but knowing the acute legal abilities of my learned friend and the extraordinary avidity which exists among a large class of men for a verdict against the prisoner in this caseremembering i say these things i did not expect such a total break down such an exposure of weakness as that which has been just made before you were my object merely to rescue the prisoner from an ignominious deathhad it been my mere duty on this occasion to obtain an acquittal i should feel no hesitation in requesting his lordship at once to send the case before you with such remarks as the evidence would call forth from him and i should consider that i was only wasting the time of the court in pointing out to you the insufficiency of the evidence in which each of you must perceive that nothing whatever is proved against the prisoner but i have been employed with another object and i must own to you that so great is my own personal anxietyso terrible and so undeserved the present position of that unfortunate young man and so essentially necessary is it for his future happiness that i should effect my present objecti must own to you i say for these reasons that from the time when i first found myself standing in a crowded court to address a jury up to the present moment i have never felt so little selfconfidence or experienced so total a prostration of that assurance which is a lawyers first requisite as i do at present  i have said my object in addressing you is not merely that of obtaining an acquittal and i said so because a mere acquittal will serve that unfortunate young man but little unless he can walk out of this court with such a verdict as damning as it may be to others will altogether cleanse his name from the stain of guilt in this matter unless he can not only save his neck from the halter but also entirely clear his character from the gross charges which have been brought against himhe would as lief go back to the cell whence he has come as return to his fathers house acquitted by the voice of law but condemned by that of opinion  on this account i am debarred from many of the usual resources of counsel pleading for a prisoner i am forbidden to make use of legal points in his favour i am forbidden to effect an escape by the numerous weak points in the enemys plan of attack i am desired to meet him face to face in the open fieldto fight under no banner but that of truth and not to strike my adversary below the belt you are aware that this is a line of conduct as rare as it is difficult in a criminal courtwhen an advocate has to contend for his client against the lawwhere every possible means of success which legal ingenuity can devise is taken in the prosecution and where you are accustomed to hear every legal technicality used in the defence  had i not received instructions of so peculiar a nature i should point out to the jury that no proof has been given direct or circumstantial that the prisoner was the person by whose hands ussher fell instead of doing so i am to declare that he did as he is supposed to have done kill the deceased in the avenue of ballycloran by striking him twice with his stick i am to justify that deed and disprove the charge of his having entered into a conspiracy to murder the man whom he did kill  the prisoner you have been told and are probably all aware is above the rank of men whom you are mostly accustomed to see placed in that dock he is the only son of a gentleman living on his own small estate and has for some years past acted as his fathers sole agent and manager  i must now tell you a few particulars respecting that estate and though of course you cannot receive as evidence what i tell you still this course will be necessary as i shall thereby be enabled to explain to you my object in obtaining answers to certain questions which i have asked or shall ask the answers to which you will take as evidence  in the time of the prisoners grandfather a house was built on this estate by a mr flannelly of this town and the price of the building not having been paid this man the builder obtained a mortgage on the estate for the amount of the debt this is still due though the house as you have heard is falling to the ground and it has so been increased by interest not paid up and by legal charges that it has completely embarrassed the present proprietor who is even now unable to leave his house for fear of arrest mr keegan whose name has often come before you in the evidence and who by and by will be examined himself is the soninlaw of this mr flannelly and owns as i have no doubt i shall be able to prove to you the whole interest in the estate of ballycloran arising from this mortgage  the prisoners time since he ceased to be a boy has been employed in futile endeavours to satisfy the legal claims of this man and i shall prove to you by most undoubtable evidence that his industry in this object has been unceasing and that his conduct as a son and a brother has been beyond all praise but he has failedtimes have been against himlegal costs have so swelled the legal interest as to consume the whole rentsthose rents he has been unable to collect and his life has been one manful struggle against poverty and mr keeganand i could not wish my worst foe two more inveterate enemies  some few days before usshers deathand now i am going to confine myself to that which i am in a position to provemr keegan called on the macdermots for the purpose of proposing certain terms for the adjustment of the debt which were neither more nor less than that he should have the whole estate paying a small weekly stipend for life to the prisoners father the prisoner was willing to agree providing some provision should be made for his sister but the father indignantly spurned the offer and turned mr keegan out of the house in no very gentle manner the prisoner followed him into the avenuestill wishing to come to some arrangement but the attorney was so enraged at the conduct of the father that instead of listening to the son he began abusing the whole family and as you have heard applied the most shameful epithet to the sister with which the tongue of a man can defile the name of a woman he afterwards struck the prisoner who was unarmed heavily with his stick and i have no hesitation in telling you that that quarrel in which no blame appears to have been attributable to the young man placed him in that dock  brady the confidential servant of the prisoner both saw and overheard what took place at this interview as he has told you and he afterwardsas he will not deny though he will not confess itincited his master during the period of his natural irritation to go down to the wedding party to meet a number of his tenants who would be willing to assist him in revenging himself against his enemy keegan the attorney if he would assist them against their enemy ussher the revenue officer and here my client made the one false stepand the only one which i can trace to himand committed that folly from which this bitter foe has thought to ruin him irritated by the blowhis ear still ringing with the infamous name applied to his loved sisterfull of his fathers wrong and his own hard condition he consented to meet men whose object he knew was illegal though what their plans were he was entirely ignorant  with reference to what took place at the wedding i have in the first place to remark that from the character of this man brady i could confidently call upon you to reject every word of his evidence and i shall presently show you in what respects and why you are bound to do so but in the present instance i am satisfied to tell you that my client did attend that meeting but mind that was no illegal meetingit was not secret the door was not locked nor even closed it was a party of men met at the wedding of one of their own station the woman to be married was a sister of the prisoners servant and it was natural that he should be present he directs me positively to tell you that he did attend that meeting though i also tell you with confidence that he committed no crime in doing so and his lordship will corroborate what i tell you  it was however a part of the plan organised against the prisoner that he should be induced to commit an illegal act and he was as you have heard brought when drunk to promise that he would go down to mrs mulreadys to take upon himself illegal oaths and obligations  on the following day he was invited by this same brady to come on a certain evening but macdermot was no longer drunk he was no longer infuriated by the gross outrages he had received and what did he do then did he go to mrs mulreadys to settle the particulars of this murder which he is said to have premeditated did he join these outlaws of whom he is represented to have been the leader did he even send them an encouraging messagea word of fellowship no even by the testimony of this man now so anxious to hang his benefactorthis man who by his own showing was at the same time in the pay of the prisoner and of his enemy keeganhe indignantly repudiated the idea he at once informed this wretchequally a traitor to his confederates and to his masterthat he would have nothing in common with them or their schemes and although threatened with the vengeance of the party and with the authority of a magistrate steadily refused even to enter the house in which they were accustomed to assemble why from what i can learn of the young man and of his daily habits i do not conceive that there is one of yourselves who would not be as likely to join an illegal society as he would patient under povertyindustrious under accumulated sufferingshe has led a life which would not have disgraced a priest he has been ever found sincere in his thoughts moral in his conduct and most unselfish in his actions is this the man to join a set of senseless rioters furious at the imprisonment of their relatives and anxious only to protect their illicit stills and this is no empty praise that what i have said of the prisoner is no more than is his due will be proved to you by evidence which i defy you to doubt well he did not go to mrs mulreadys but he did go to his friend and priest mr magrath and not as a penitent to his confessor but as a friend to a friend told him exactly what had passed lamented his indiscretion and declared his determination never to put himself in the way of repeating it  up to this time my chief object has been to show to you the enmity existing between keegan and the prisonerthe object which the former had in view in ruining the prisoner and that brady was a paid spy employed to entrap him  i shall now come to the deed itself and i shall afterwards refer to what absolutely did take place at the meeting at the wedding i have told you that young macdermot did kill the deceased he struck him with the stick which has been shown to you in court and as he was rising from the blow he struck him again and no doubt the medical witness was right in his opinion that the second blow occasioned instant death  you are however aware that circumstances might exist which would justify any man in taking the life of another if a man were violently to attack you and you were to strike him on the head and kill him you would be justified if you were to kill a man in a fray in fair defence of a third party you would be justified if you were to kill a man by a blow in the quarrel of a moment you would not be guilty of murder but i can fancy no case in which death however much it may be lamented can lay less of the murderers stain upon the hand that inflicts it than one in which a brother interferes to rescue a sister from the violent grasp of a seducer such was precisely the case in the instance now before us my learned friend on the other side has truly told you that miss macdermot the prisoners sister had consented to elope with captain ussher on the evening on which that man was killed you have learnt from evidence which you have no reason to doubt that she had prepared to do so in fact you cannot doubt that she left the house of ballycloran for that purpose this has been provedbut there are circumstances beyond this on which it is essentially necessary that you should have evidence and this evidence can only be given by the young lady herself i shall therefore have to bring her before you when my learned friend told you that he would not call upon her nor question her unless placed in that chair by me he forgot his usual candour and assumed to himself credit for humanity to which he has no title he himself has nothing to learn from her as he will prove to you if he attempts to crossexamine her moreover he was as fully aware as i am myself that the prisoner must rely on her alone for anything like a true account of the affray  the brother and the sister are the only living witnesses of that scene he has within him that high consciousness of innocence and rectitude of intention which has enabled him to bear his sufferings his imprisonment and the misery of his position with a fortitude which i not only admire but envy but that can avail nothing with you from the sisters lips you must hear the only account which you can receive and if we find that she has been unable to recall the dreadful circumstances of that night that fact will bear me out in the history of the occurrence which i am now going to give you  mr omalley then gave as exact an account of the occurrence as he had been able to collect from thady from feemys evidence before the coroner and from such words as mrs mckeon had been able to extract from feemy on the subject he then continued  when the prisoner struck ussher he had come to the knowledge of what the burden was which this man was dragging solely from the words which the man had used miss macdermot was lying senseless in his arms and supporting her by her waist he was forcing her down the avenue the words he used were this is damned nonsenseyou must come now then the brother perceived the fate to which this man wasnot alluringbut forcing his sister at that momentand it was the only one in which the prisoner had to judge of the circumstances of the caseshe was not in the act of eloping willingly she had seen her brothers form and had refused or been unable to rise from the timber on which she was seated she was forced from thence by this man whose death protects him from the language in which his name would otherwise be mentioned she fainted in his arms and only came to her senses to find her lover dead and her brother standing beside her red with his blood yes he had avenged herhe had punished the ruffian for his barbarity towards her and saved his sister from the ignominy to which mr frederick brown told you with so much flippancy that she had been doomed  if this was the young mans conduct was there anything in it that you can even blame which of you would have done otherwise which of you will tell me that in avenging the wrongs of a sister or of a daughter he would pause to measure the weight of his stick or the number of his blows fancy each of you that you see the form of her you love best in the rough grasp of a violent seducer endeavour to bring home to yourselves the feelings to which such a sight would give rise within you and then if you can find that young man guilty of murder because his heart was warm to feel his sisters wrongs and his hand was strong to avenge them  but you have been told that as the prisoner had met certain persons for the purpose of entering into a conspiracy of murdering ussherand that that fact would be proved to youyou are bound to consider that his coming across ussher was not accidental and that the manner in which he attacked that man whilst carrying off his sister was a part of his preconcerted plan i first of all deny that any credible evidence any evidence worthy of the slightest belief has been brought before you to induce you to suppose that the prisoner had even joined any such conspiracy instead of which you have strong circumstantial evidence that he had never done so  you have most of you no doubt heard on various occasions from different learned judges seated on that bench that a crown approvers evidence is to be taken with the greatest caution and only to be believed in detail when corroborated by other evidence or by circumstances now this man brady on whose sole evidence you are desired to convict the prisoner has shown himself an approver of the very worst description you are aware that he was the prisoners servant that he is now mr keegans that there has been long enmity between these men that the former has been an oppressed debtorthe latter a most oppressive creditor mr keegans spirit towards the prisoners family you may learn from the scandalous and unwarrantable language which has been proved to you to have been used by him towards them mr keegans acerbity has been increased by the mutilation he has undergone and which he conceives he owes to his interference with the ballycloran property this man and the witness brady have as you have heard constantly been talking over this trial and the attorney it seems has repeatedly expressed to his servant his ardent wish that the prisoner might be hung this is his expressed eager desire and then this new servant but longused spy comes forward boldly to swear away the prisoners life why it would be ridiculing you to suppose you could believe him then look at the mans character he was a constant attendant at that scene of villany into which he vainly endeavoured to seduce the prisoner at mrs mulreadys it is plain enough that usshers death was a constant theme of discourse at that haunt it is plain enough that a project did exist there to accomplish his murder and is it not plain enough that this man was one of the conspiratorsone of the murderers would he have been admitted to their counselsto their dangerous secretsunless he had been an active participator in their plans would they have taken in his presence a solemn oath to put this unfortunate revenue officer under the sod unless he had joined in that oath of course they would not and this is the man whom they expect you to believe with such confidence that on his unsupported evidence you should condemn the prisoner what i have said to you respecting this respectable witness and his not less respectable master will perhaps be made somewhat plainer to you when you shall have heard the evidence which i hope to extract from the latter now as to the meeting at mrs mehans even were you to believe brady i maintain that nothing whatever has been proved against the prisoner brady states that at mrs mulreadys certain men swore together that at a certain period captain ussher should be under the sod this phrase brings to the mind of every one the conviction that they meant to express murder the man could not be under the sod unless he were dead  but at the wedding when young macdermot was present even by the showing of brady himself the men were afraid to use any such phrase they implored their landlords assistance to help them to rid the country of him to frighten him off to make the place too hot to hold him as i told that wretched reptile whilst in the chair they would have no more dared to propose a scheme of murder to young macdermot even in his drunkenness than they would have to you or to me  now as to the probability of the prisoners having been aware of his sisters project for eloping and having made use of that opportunity for the safe execution of a scheme of murderand this perhaps is the most material point of all for were there good grounds to suppose that he knew that this elopement was to take placethat he took no precautionary steps to prevent itbut that having this previous knowledge he rushed out at the time and killed the man i should be very far from telling you that he was perfectly justified as i do now but i must positively maintain that you cannot come to such a conclusion it has to a degree been proved to you and will be so more clearly that the prisoner had all along shown himself averse to the intimacy which existed between ussher and his sister it is therefore to be presumed that both of them took every means in their power to prevent the prisoner from learning their intention and there is every reason to suppose they were successful  two persons appear to have been told as their services were required both of whom have been examined before youthe servant girl and mr frederick brown the former has sworn that she mentioned it to no one and there is no reason to disbelieve her the latter proved himself not so trustworthy it seems that with that foolish flippancy which distinguishes him he told his friends secret to other friends of his as a good joke but you must remember that mr browns friends were not the prisoners friendsthat they rather were in such different circles that what was said in one would be very little likely to find its way into the other and above all that those to whom mr brown or his friends communicated it would think that the brother was the last person who should be told of it again had the prisoner known the projected elopement and intended to make use of it for the perpetration of a preconcerted murder would hecould he have acted as he did could he have waited for such an unexpected accident as his sisters fainting before he drew near to his victim his sister had walked down the avenue and after waiting some time in the road returned and sat down upon a fallen tree it was whilst so seated that she heard the brother open the halldoor had she as she expected met her lover at the hour appointed they would have been far beyond the prisoners reach before he had left the housewould he have allowed this to be the case had it been his intention to take advantage of the opportunity it is absurd to argue on such a point it is unnecessary almost to call your attention to things which must so manifestly present themselves to you the whole of this case has received additional weight and importance from official authority it has been considered worthy of especial government interference my learned friend has come express from the metropolis for the purpose of conducting ita rumour has been spread abroad that most conclusive evidence would be produced to prove that a prisoner from the better orders of society had joined and headed one of those illegal bodies of men whose existence is supposed to be the cause of the troubles of this distracted country and that he had in unison with these schemes committed a foul and deliberate murder and my learned friend has not hesitated to tell you that it is essentially necessary to use the utmost extent of legal severity that an end may be put to the agrarian outrages which are now becoming so frightfully prevalent in the country has anything been proved to warrant this official zealthis government interference no nothing not one iota but still these paraphernalia of office this more than ordinary anxiety to obtain a verdict may have an effect upon your minds most prejudicial to my client i have no doubt as to your actual verdict i have no doubt that you willnay i know that you mustacquit that young man of murder but i beseech you to remember that though in the indictment he has been charged with murder only he has been by the servant of government by my learned friend on the other side accused of other grievous crimes and i implore you by your verdict to purge his character of the stain which has been so unjustly attached to it if you find on examination of the evidence no cause to suppose that he had been a participator in the councils of such societies i beseech you to do him that justice which can now only be done by the strong expression of your unanimous assurance of absolute innocence i beseech you to reject from your minds those preconceived opinions so injurious to the prisoner with which the present unfortunate state of your country may so naturally have influenced you and to remember that it is your duty as jurors to confine yourself to the individual case before you and that the doctrine laid down by my learned friend that you should make an example in one case for the sake of prevention of crimes in others is most unconstitutional and would imply that whilst the solemn oath you have taken is still vibrating in your ears your object should be far wide from that for which you have been assembledthat of making a fair and true trial between your sovereign and the prisoner i shall now call a few witnesses and then leave the case with confidence in your hands     chapter xxxi  the last witness   when mr omalley had finished his address to the jury it was past seven oclock and the judge suggested that as it would be evidently impracticable to finish the case that night so as to release the jury they might as well at this point adjourn it till the morrow to this mr allewinde readily assented but mr omalley declared that though he was most unwilling to detain his lordship and the court at that late hour he must request permission to be allowed to examine one of his witnesses as otherwise his caution in having had him ordered out of court would have been in vain it was most essential he said that his examination of mr keegan should take place before that man could have an opportunity of conversing with his servant brady whereupon the judge consented to hearing keegans evidence that evening and forthwith the name of hyacinth keegan was called out in a loud voice by the crier and was repeated by every policeman in court till a stranger to the proceedings would have thought that hyacinth keegans society was the one thing desirable in carrickonshannon  it would be drawing this trial out to a weary length to give the whole of his evidence but mr omalleys questions were such as the attorney found it almost impossible to answer he was asked in the first place whether he at present received the rents from ballycloran and then whether he received them on his own behalf the latter he denied but when told that if he denied the fact mr flannelly would be brought forward to prove it he at last owned that mr flannelly had promised to make over that property to him he then denied that any conversation had passed between him and brady as to the nature of the evidence the latter was to give at the trial or that he had expressed any anxiety on any occasion that a verdict might be given against the prisoner he confessed that he might in conversation have attributed the loss of his foot to the influence of the prisoner but he could not remember that he had ever said that macdermot should pay for it with his life in answering the different questions put to him he hesitated and blundered so muchstammered so often and spoke so low that every one in court was convinced that he was perjuring himself but still he persisted in denying everything the only good effect mr omalley could get from his evidence was that the master frequently contradicted what had been said by the servant but then brady had shown so much confidence and selfassurance in his replies and keegan so much hesitation and confusion that it was much more probable that the jury would believe the former than the latter and if so keegans contradicting the statements made by brady would not serve to invalidate the material evidence given by that man  when mr keegan came down from the chair the court broke up for the night and the jury were informed that the sheriff would afford them all the accommodation in his powerand with long faces they were marched away to durance vile  the court which during the trial had been so densely crowded again became desolate and silent baron hamilton with his brother kilpatrick retired to their dinner which they had well earned and the coffeerooms at the hotels again became crammed with hungry guests clamorous for food and the evening was passed in speculations as to what would be the verdict in the case to which they had all been listening  in the barristers messroom all the feuds of the day were forgotten and a most jovial party was assembled as each bottle of claret succeeded the other fresh anecdotes were told and innumerable puns were made mr allewinde was quite great his forensic dignity was all laid aside and he chatted to the juniors with most condescending familiarity  mr olaugher became the originator of incessant peals of laughter all that had taken place during the day he turned into food for merriment not for one moment did he hold his tongue nor once did he say a foolish thing he was the pet of the barroom the connaught bar was famous for mr olaugher and they knew it and were proud of him  of all of them assembled there but one seemed to have any memory of the sadness of the scene that they had that day witnessed how should they or rather how miserable would be a barristers life were he to be affected by the misery which he is so constantly obliged to witness in a criminal court on this occasion however the anxiety which mr omalley had expressed when addressing the jury had not been feigned and the doubt which he felt as to the fate of his client lay heavy on him he was aware that he had failed in shaking bradys testimony and he feared that in spite of all he had done to prove the depravity of that mans character the jury would be too much inclined to believe him  it had been decided that feemy was not to be brought into carrick from drumsna till such time as mr omalley sent out word that she would be required and when he found how late it was before he began his speech he had told father john in court that she would not be wanted on that day she had therefore been left tranquilly at mrs mckeons who had fetched her to her own house from ballycloran on the morning of the trial  when larry macdermot saw the car at the door in which feemy was to go away he was dreadfully wrath he first of all declared that his daughter should not be taken away to mr keegansthat his own son had deserted him and tried to sell the estate and that now they meant to rob him of his daughter and he wept like a child when he was told that unless she went of her own accord the house would be broken open and she would be taken away by force it was in vain that mary mcgovery endeavoured to make him understand that feemys presence was necessary in carrick and that she had to appear as a witness at her brothers trial  whenever thadys trial was spoken ofand mary by continually recurring to the subject had made the old man at last comprehend that his son was to be triedbut whenever it was spoken of now he merely expressed his approbation and a wish that thady might be punished for making friends with such a reptile as keeganfor deserting his father and planning to cheat him out of his house and his property mary took great pains to set him right and bellowed into his ear as if he were deaf instead of stupid twenty times a day that thady was to be tried for usshers death but larry couldnt be got to remember that ussher was dead and would continually ask his daughter when her lover was coming back to live with them and defend them and the property against the machinations of keegan and her brother  all the thursday feemy remained at drumsna every moment expecting that she would be immediately called in to go to carrick she sat the whole day in the drawingroom close by the fire with her friends cloak around her without speaking to any one the girls had come and spoken kindly to her when she first arrived but their mother had told them that they had better not attempt to converse with her mrs mckeon herself sat with her the whole day and spoke to her a gentle word now and again but she purposely abstained from troubling her and she made no allusion whatever to the subject on which she had thought so much and on which her own suspicions had been corroborated by marys information necessary as it was that the poor girl should tell some one this was not the time to press her  there sat feemy ah how different from the girl described in the opening of this tale her cheek was pale and wan and the flesh had gone and the yellow skin fell in from her cheekbone to her mouth giving her almost a ghastly appearance her eyes appeared larger than ever but they were quenched with weeping and dull with grief her hair was drawn back carelessly behind her ears and her lips were thin and bloodless two or three times during the day mrs mckeon had given her half a glass of wine which she had drank on being told to do so and she had once tried to eat a bit of bread but she had soon put it down again for it seemed to choke her  about five oclock mrs mckeon learnt that feemy would not be called for that day and the poor girl was then induced to go to bed but nothing could persuade her to allow any one to assist her it was wonderful how she could have undressed herself and dressed herself the next morning she seemed so weak and powerless  tony and father john got home to dinner about eight they were both in good spirits for mr omalleys speech had been so convincing to them that they conceived it could not but be equally so to the jury they forgot that they had previously assured themselves of thadys evidence and that therefore they were prepared to believe every word said on his behalf but that this would by no means be the case with the jury they were very sanguine and tony insisted that counsellor omalleys health should be drunk with all the honours  on the morning they went early into town they had obtained from the clerk of the peace permission to make use of a small room within the court and here feemy and mrs mckeon were to remain undisturbed till the former was called for then that lady was to bring her into court and even undertook to go upon the table with her and repeat to the jury if she would be allowed to do so the evidence which they were all sure feemy herself would not be able to give in a voice loud enough to be heard by any one when the car stopped at the courthouse in carrickonshannon it was found absolutely necessary to carry her into the room for she had apparently lost all power of action she neither cried nor sobbed now but gazed listlessly before her with her eyes fixed upon vacancy as the two strong men lifted her from the car and supported her between them by her arms up the steps into the courthouse  this will never do said tony to his friend after leaving her in the room this will never do shell never be able to say a word on the table its only cruelty father john bringing her here  but omalley says she must come said father john he says if she can take the oath and speak but three or four words to mrs mckeon that will do  shell never do it shell never be able to take the oath shell have to be carried on the table and when there shell faint poor thady if hes acquitted the first thing hell have to learn will be her disgrace you must tell him of that father john no one else can  poor fellow it will be worse to him than all but she brought him to this and she must save him if she can  i tell you said tony shell never speak a word upon that table wed better tell omalley at once t would be only cruelty to put her there  they both accordingly went to omalley who was now in court and told him that they thought feemy macdermot could not be safely brought there he however still declared that it was imperative for her brothers safety that she should appear even if it were utterly impossible to get her to speak and that as she had been the person in fault and has he had had all the suffering the cruelty would be to him if she were not brought forward  father john returned to the private room and tried to make her speak he kneeled down before her and again began explaining to her the purpose for which she was there and implored her to exert herself to save her brother she once or twice opened her mouth as if speaking but uttered no sound she understood however what the priest said to her for she gently pressed his hand when he took hold of hers and nodded her head to him when he begged her to exert herself  in the meantime mr omalley was continuing the examination of his witnesses the first who appeared on this the second morning of the trial was corney dolan who unfortunately came prepared to swear anything which he thought might benefit the prisoner he said he remembered the evening of the wedding he remembered the conversation at which the prisoner had been present that he was quite sure usshers name wasnt mentionedor at any rate that if mentioned it was not accompanied by any threatthat the only plan of violence alluded to during the evening was that one or two of the boys said that they would duck keegan in a bog hole if he came to receive rents at ballycloran  this was all very well as long as the questions were put to him by mr omalley but he was forced to tell a somewhat different tale when examined by mr allewinde by whom he was made to own that there had been projects abroad for murdering ussher though he still maintained that none of them had been alluded to by the party at mrs mehans he was also made to give himself so bad a character that it was more than probable that the jury would not believe a word he had said  father john was the next he was only called on to prove that thady had been intoxicated when he left the party at mrs mehans and to speak as to character with tears in his eyes he corroborated all that the barrister had said in his speech in praise of his poor young friend he described him as honest industrious and manlypatient under his own wrongs but unable to endure quietly those inflicted on his family  tony mckeon was the next and with the exception of feemy the last and he too had only to speak as to character  just as father john had been getting into the chair a policeman had come into court and whispered to doctor blake who was sitting in one of the lower benches and the doctor immediately got up from his seat and went away with the man  father john had not observed the occurrence but when he was leaving the table and as tony was getting up the latter whispered to him blake has been called out just look to feemy  and at the same moment mr omalley said out aloud  mr magrath if i might trouble you so far would you have the kindness to bring miss macdermot into court i do not anticipate that we shall have much delay with mr mckeons evidence  father john immediately hurried into the room where mrs mckeon had been left with her charge and his heart trembled within him as he remembered the deathlike look the poor girl had when he left her but an hour since and reflected that it was too probably to her aid that doctor blake had been called  and so it was when he entered the room round the door of which a lot of frieze coats had crowded but which was kept shut he found feemy on the ground with her head supported on mrs mckeons lap and blake kneeling beside her endeavouring to pour something into her mouth there was another woman standing in the room and an apothecary whom the doctor had sent for but father john was soon made to understand that medical skill could avail but little and that all the aid which feemy could now receive from her fellowcreatures was to come from him  to describe the scene which immediately followed would be to treat so sacred a subject much too lightly the priest however found that neither life nor reason was extinct she acknowledged the symbol of salvation in which she trusted and received that absolution from her sins which her church considers necessary who can say how deeply she had repented of her misdeeds during the many hours of silent agony which she had endured  her arm was stretched out from her body and her hand was clasped tightly in that of mrs mckeons the moment before she drew her final breath she felt and tried to return the pressure she made one great struggle to speak myles was the single word which her lips had strength to form and with that last effort poor feemy died  in the meantime mckeon had given his evidence in the court and had left the tablemr allewinde having declined to crossexamine either him or father john there was then a pause of some little duration in court during which mr omalley addressing the judge said that miss macdermot the witness now about to be brought forward was unfortunately in a very weak state of health so much so that had her evidence not been essential to her brother he should be most unwilling to have troubled her he then apologised for the delay and asked for and obtained permission for mrs mckeon to be on the table and repeat the answers of the witness to the jury the judge merely premising that it would be necessary that that lady should be sworn to repeat the true answers  there was still some further delay after mr omalley had sat down mr mckeon got up to go and help to bring her into court but just in the doorway he met a man who whispered to him he did not return however but hurried on to the room where he had left his wife and reached it just as the breath left the poor girls body in spite of their distress it was apparent to all that the truth must be immediately made known in the court and mr mckeon was leaving for the purpose of telling mr omalley when father john laid his hand upon his friends shoulder and said  poor thady it will break his heart to hear it it must be kept from him but heaven only knows whats best he must hear it at last go mckeon and tell omalley hell know whats best to do  mckeon returned into court and making his way with difficulty close up to the barrister whispered in his ear that his witness was no more  mr omalley who had been standing instantly sat down as if appalled by the suddenness of the event every one in the court who had seen mckeons face as he entered felt aware that something had happened to feemy  the judge leaned forward over his desk addressing himself particularly to mr omalley and said  is miss macdermot too unwell mr omalley to be brought into court  my lord said he again rising from his seat she has already gone before another judgmentseat macdermot and he turned round to the prisoner in the dock you have borne your sorrows hitherto like a man you must try and bear this alsoyour sister is dead she has fallen the first victimgod forbid that another should be sacrificed my lord my cause is now done there is now no living witness but the prisoner of that scene which i described to you the case must go to the jury as it is  during the time of the whole trial thady had stood upright at the bar with his elbow leaning on the wooden rail and his face resting on his arm he had almost constantly kept his eye upon the speakers occasionally turning his gaze to the place where father john had sat during the trial to see that he had not deserted him during the speech which mr omalley had made on his behalf he had brightened up and looked more cheerful than he had done for many months when that was finished he had felt more sanguine as to his acquittal than he had done at any time since he had first given himself up as a prisoner during the short pause which occurred in court immediately after mckeon left the table he had once or twice looked round to learn if feemy were coming though the high woodwork of the dock would effectually prevent him from seeing her till she was at the table  it will be remembered that feemys extreme illness had never been made known to her brothermuch less her lamentable situation father john had told him that she was unwell but he had not thought it necessary to frighten him at the present time by letting him know how very ill she was the doctors departure from court he did not notice at all father john was sent for to his sister in a manner which caused him no apprehensionand even when mckeon went out to see whether she was coming it never occurred to thady that the delay in his sisters appearance was occasioned by ill health it was only when he saw omalley sit down after hearing some whispered tidings from mckeon that he felt alarmed when the barrister told the judge that his witness had gone before another judgmentseat it was still evident from his face that he did not perfectly comprehend what had happened but there was no misunderstanding the language in which the tidings were immediately afterwards communicated to himself he seemed to make one attempt as if to say something but the feeling of his situation and the paraphernalia of the court awed him into silence and he sank down within the dock to hide his sorrow from the crowd that were gazing at him  there was some considerable delay in the court after this as though all the parties concerned felt unwilling to commence business after the shock which feemys death had occasioned the judge sat back in his chair silent and abstracted as if valuable as he must know his own and the public time to be he felt unable to call on any one to proceed with the case immediately after so sad an event  at last mr allewinde rose and said that no one could regret more than himself the dreadfully tragical manner in which the prisoner had lost the benefit of the evidence which it was expected his sister would have been able to give on his behalf that he conceived that it would be anything but mercy to the prisoner to delay the proceedings in their present stage on account of what had happened moreover he considered that doing so would be illegal he would suggest to the judge to his learned friend on the other side and to the jury whether any legal and available use could be made of the evidence which had been given by the prisoners sister before the coroner  this however mr omalley declined alleging that the questions put to miss macdermot by the coroner were merely intended to elicit evidence that captain ussher had been killed by her brother and that the answers she then gave were of course not such as would be favourable to the prisoner nor were such as could prove those facts which mr omalley had intended to prove mr omalley finished by stating that as far as he was concerned the case was ready to be submitted by his lordship to the jury  mr allewinde however still had the right of reply and he was not the man to allow any chance circumstance to prevent him making use of it he accordingly again got up to address the jury he told them that what he had to say would not keep them long and considering that he was a lawyer and a barrister he kept his word with tolerable fidelity he remarked that the evidence of brady had in no degree been shaken that the subjects in which keegan had been examined had had no reference to the case and that it was quite plain that dolan had come forward to swear to anything which he thought might tend to the prisoners acquittal he made no allusion whatever to father john and tony mckeon and then ended by saying that the unexpected and melancholy death of miss macdermot was an occurrence which could not but fill the breast of every one present with most profound sympathy for the prisonerthat he should abstain from saying a word which might be unnecessarily disagreeable or painful to the feelings of any onebut that the jury must feel that the prisoner would lose nothing from the loss of her evidence of course he continued in a point of law you are bound to look on the case as if miss macdermot had died at the same moment with her betrothed husband for you are aware that you cannot allow anything which my learned friend has told you to be taken into consideration by you in finding your verdict but it will lessen the pain which more or less you must suffer in this sad case to reflect what strong grounds you have for supposing that the sister had she lived could have proved nothing favourable to the brother for had she been able to do so she would have done it when examined before the coroner i shall now trouble you no further his lordship in submitting the case to you will give you doubtless the necessary caution against allowing excited feelings to have any influence over the verdict to which you shall come  mr allewinde then sat down and after the lapse of one or two minutes the judge turned to the jury and spoke his charge to them upon the question he went deliberately through the whole evidencedwelt upon various minor points in the prisoners favourtold them that the prisoner could not be considered as guilty of murder if there was ground to believe that he had committed the act whilst the deceased was forcibly carrying off his sister and that if they believed that the prisoner had never before premeditated the death of the man he killed he could not be considered to have been guilty of the crime for which he was now tried he then went at length into all the points he showed the jury that no evidence whatever had been brought up to prove that the girl was in a senseless state when ussher was attacked and that for anything they had heard proved she might have been walking quietly with him he then went into the evidence given by brady and he stated it as his own opinion that the man was in the main to be believed he argued that his whole evidence both on direct and crossexamination had been given in a manner which seemed to him to show an unwillingness to give more information than he could possibly help on either sidebut still with a determination not to forswear himself but at the same time he told them that this was a question on which each juror should form his own opinion in fact that it was to judge of the value and credibility of evidence that they were summoned it was also he said for them to decide whether the death of the revenue officer was premeditated by the party at mrs mehans when they talked of ridding the country of him he passed very slightly over the remaining evidence merely saying that this was a case in which character could not weigh with them as if the prisoner were guilty his former apparent good character only aggravated his sin he then concluded by telling the jurors that they were bound by solemn oaths to allow nothing to interfere with the truth of their verdictthat they must all deplore the untimely death of the young woman who was to have appeared before them and sympathise with the brother for the loss of his sisterbut that his misfortune in this respect could not lighten his guilt if he were guilty or diminish the sacredness of the duty which each juror owed to his country  when the judge had finished the jury retired to consider their verdict and the other business of the assizes was proceeded with as if nothing peculiar had happened to check the regular routine duties of the court     chapter xxxii  the verdict   it was not very late in the day when the jury retired and it was generally thought that they would come to a verdict in time to escape being immured for a second night but they did not  immediately after hearing the judges charge father john mckeon and webb agreed among them that it was absolutely necessary that old macdermot should be acquainted with his daughters death but who was to take upon himself the sad errand father john had for the last few days been so harassed so worn down by anxiety and was now so depressed by as he conceived the unfavourable tone of the judges charge that he looked like the ghost of himself and yet the duty of seeing old macdermot could fall on no one but himself neither webb nor mckeon knew the ways of the old man and it was more than probable that neither of them would be admitted into the house father john therefore put himself on a car and hurried off to ballycloran making his friend promise that he would wait in carrick for him till his return  father john soon found himself in the presence of larry but he could with difficulty find words to tell him of his bereavement the old man was seated on his bedhe always slept now in the parlourhe had his legs thrust into a tattered pair of breeches and had wornout slippers on his feet and an old and ragged coat into which he had been unable or unwilling to thrust his arms hung over his shoulder but he had no stockings onno cravat round his throat his longworn shirt was unbuttoned over his breast and his face was not only unshorn but was also as well as his hands and feet unwashed and filthy when father john entered the room he was seated on his bed which had not been made since he rose from it he had a pipe in his mouth and a glass of grog in his hand the smell of the room was most offensive and it seemed from the dreadfully close atmosphere that no window had been opened in it for weeks past mary mcgovery followed the priests steps into the room running through numerous apologies as to the state in which the old man was found and assuring him that macdermot was so stupid and so obstinate that it was impossible to get him to do or to understand anything and she forthwith took hold of his shoulders and began shaking him and scolding himbawling into his ear till the poor idiot shook in her grasp  father john at last succeeded in rescuing him from her hands and seating himself in a chair immediately opposite to him he began his sad tale he told him by degrees that his daughter had been taken very illthat she had got worse and worsethat doctor blake had been sent forthat she was found to be in imminent danger but it had no effect on larry he kept on continually thanking father john for his friendly visit saying how kind it was of him to come and sit with an old man like himhow hard it was to be shut up alone with such a dd old jade as mary and then he began telling father john a history of the illtreatment and cruelty he received from herwhich to do mary justice was in the main false for excepting that she shook him and bawled to him by way of rousing his dormant intellect she had always endeavoured to be as kind to him as the nature of her disposition would allow he begged of father john to tell him when ussher and feemy would come back to take care of him asked if feemy hadnt gone away to marry her lover and complained that it was cruel in his own dear girl not to let her old father be present at her wedding  at last the priest saw it was no good trying to break this bad news by degrees to such a man as larry and he told him that his daughter was dead the old man remained silent for a few minutes staring him in the face and father john continued  yes mr macdermot your poor daughter died in mrs mckeons arms  is it feemy said larry my own feemy  it is too true mr macdermot and indeed indeed i feel for you  but it aint true father john said the idiot grinning shure didnt i see her myself when she went away on the car to the wedding and then the old man paused as if thinking and the stupid smile passed off from his face and the saddest cloud one could conceive came over it and he said ah theyre gone away from me theyre gone away to thady and now ill never see them agin he then paused for a moment but after a while a fire came into his eyes and he began again but curse hercurse  this was too horrid father john got up and held his hand before the fathers face as if to forbid him to finish the curse which he was about to utter and the old man trembled like a frightened child upon his seat and sat silent with his eye fixed on the priest  mary had not been present at this interview father john however now found it necessary to call her and to commission her if possible to make the father understand that he had been bereaved of his daughter poor mary was dreadfully distressed herself and for a long time sat sobbing and weeping but by degrees she recovered her tone and commenced the duty which father john had enjoined her to perform but nothing could convince larry of feemys death he felt assured that they were all trying to deceive him and that feemy and her lover had now deserted him as well as thady  when father john returned to carrick anxious yet fearing to hear the verdict he found that the jury had not yet agreed even this was some comfort for it made it evident that there was doubt on the subject and surely thought he if a man doubts on such a subject as this he must ultimately lean to the side of mercy he remained with tony mckeon in court till about eight when they went to the hotel and got their dinnerfor they would not leave the town till the jury were locked up for the night  soon afterwards webb joined them and the three sat together till eleven oclock when it was signified to them that the judge would not receive the verdict that night and that the jury were therefore again to be locked up webb then went home and the priest and his friend both returned to drumsna to sleep  thady had remained in the dock that he might be ready to hear the verdict till the judge left the bench he was then conducted back into the prison and it was so late that the prison regulations did not allow him to see any friend or visitor he was therefore debarred from the comfort which a few kind words from father john would have afforded him after he had heard the news of his sisters death he never once raised himself from the position into which he almost fell rather than sunk during the whole of the long afternoon he remained crouched down in one corner of the benches within the dock when the judge commenced his charge to the jury he had once attempted to rise but he felt that he could no longer endure the gaze of those around him and he remained on his seat till he was taken back to gaol  father john and mckeon agreed that the cause of feemys death should not be told to thadyat any rate till after the verdict had been given if he should be condemned it would only be a useless cruelty to increase his sufferings by telling him of his sisters disgrace should he be acquitted it would then become a question whether or no he might still be suffered to live in ignorance of that which if known would so deeply embitter the remainder of his life  on the friday morning the two friends again took their seat in court waiting anxiously till the jury should send in word that they had come to a unanimous decision  thady was again in the dock and father john was just enabled to say one word to him over the wooden palingto bid him still keep up his courage and to press his hand closely within his own  hour after hour passed on and the dull stupid work of the week went on mr allewindes eloquence mr omalleys energy and mr olaughers wit sounded equally monotonous to the anxious priest and his goodnatured friend though they seemed to listen and indeed endeavoured to do so yet at the close of each trivial case that was tried they had no idea impressed upon them of what had just been going on one oclock strucktwothreefourfiveand yet they remained in the same position and still the jury who had been considering the subject remained undecided  the business in the record court had been closed on the thursday and therefore both the judges heard criminal cases during the whole of friday and by six oclock the business of the assizes was finished and the prisoners are all disposed of with the exception of poor thady it was absolutely necessary that the judges should commence their business at sligo on the following saturday and if the jury did not agree to a verdict before eleven on that morning they would have to be discharged and the case must stand over for a fresh trial at the summer assizes this now seemed almost desirable to father john and mckeon immediately after hearing mr omalleys defence they had felt sure of success but the judges charge had dreadfully robbed them of their hopes and they began to fear the arrival of the foreman  at six baron hamilton left the court saying that either he or his brother would be within call till twelve oclock to receive the verdict and that he would remain in town till eleven the next morning should the jury not have decided before then thady was yet once more taken back to prison in doubt and whilst mckeon went to the inn again to get some dinner ready father john went up to the prison to visit the prisoner in his cell  the young man had to a great degree recovered his selfpossession he told father john that he had given up all hope for himselfthat he believed he had made up his mind perfectly to face death like a brave man he then talked about his sister and lamented grievously that she ill as she was should have been dragged into court with the vain object of saving his life he asked many questions about the manner of her deathher diseasethe state of her feelings towards himselfall which father john found it most difficult to answer and he was just beginning to inquire how his father had borne all the griefs which had accumulated themselves upon him when one of the turnkeys opened the door of the cell and told him that he was to return immediately into courtthat the jury had agreedand that the judge was now going into court to receive the verdict  father john turned deadly pale and leant against the wall for support a hectic red partially suffused the prisoners face and his eyes became somewhat brighter than before a slight shudder passed over his whole frame in spite of all that he had sufferedall that he made up his mind to sufferit was evident that there was a fearful degree of anxiety in his bosom a painful hope still clinging to his heart  the fetters were again fixed on to his legs and he was led away in the midst of a body of policemen into court father john hurried to the same place where he found mr mckeon already seated on one of the dark benches there were but very few there as every one had left it after the business of the day had been concluded some of those who were in town and had heard that the jury were at last unanimous had hurried down but the generality of the strangers who were still remaining in carrick preferred the warmth of the hotel fires to paddling down through the rain dirt and dark even to hear the verdict in a case in which every one was so much interested  the barristers and attorneys seats were wholly deserted by their customary learned occupants there was but one lawyer present and he probably thinking it unprofessional to appear to take more than a lawyers interest in any case was standing by himself in the dark obscurity between the dock and the bottom of one of the galleries this was mr omalleyand though he would not be seen in court after his business there was really over he felt so truly anxious in the matter that he could not wait to hear the verdict from a third party  at length the judge took his seat and the clerk of the crown sat beneath him ready to record the decision of the jury a few lighted candles were stuck about in different parts of the court but they were lost in the obscurity of the large dark dismal building the foreman stood ready with a written and signed paper the judge asked him if they had all come to a unanimous verdict and he answered in the affirmative and handed the paper to the clerk of the peace who glancing his eye upon it and half turning round to the judge said in his peculiar sonorous voice  my lord the prisoner has been found guilty  gentlemen is that your verdict said the judge and they said it was  the prisoner stood up at the bar erect without moving he neither shook nor trembled now if it were not that his lips were pressed quite close together he would have appeared to have heard the verdict without emotion not so father john he had been leaning back anxiously waiting till the one fatal word met his ear and then his head fell forward on the desk and he sobbed like a woman  baron hamilton immediately placed the black cap on his head and proceeded to pronounce the dreadful sentence of death as he did so his voice seemed like some awful measured tone proceeding from an immovable figure or statue placed beneath the dusky canopy so dark was itand so cold and stern so slow and clear were his words and manner he must have felt and felt strongly as he doomed that young man to a sudden and ignominious death for he was no heartless man but so powerfully had he schooled his emotions so entirely had he learnt to lay aside the man in assuming the judge that had he been the stone he looked like he could not have betrayed less of the heart within him  he dwelt at considerable length on the enormity of the offence of which the prisoner had been found guilty he stated his own conviction that the verdict was a just and true one alluded to the irreparable injury such illegal societies as that to which the prisoner too evidently belonged must do in the country assured him that he had no hope for mercy to look for in this world and recommended him to seek it from him who could always reconcile it with his justice to extend it to the repentant sinner he concluded by ordering that he should be taken back to the place from whence he came and be brought from thence to the place of execution on the monday week following and then and there be hung by his neck till he should be dead  the assizes were then finishedthe judge immediately left the courtthe prisoner was taken back to his cellthe lights were extinguishedand when the servants of the sheriff came to lock the door they found mr mckeon still vainly endeavouring to arouse the brokenhearted priest from his ecstasy of sorrow     chapter xxxiii  the end   on saturday morning the little town of carrickonshannon again became quiet and comparatively speaking empty the judges left it very early most of the lawyers had taken wing and flown towards sligo seeking fresh quarries on the previous evening the jury were released and had returned weary to their homes the crowds of litigants and witnesses who had filled the record court had also left on the thursday evening and now those who had been wanted in the criminal court were gone and peace and quiet were restored at eleven oclock neither of the hotels were open the waiters and servants who during the last week had literally not known what a bed was and who during that week had snatched their only disturbed naps before the kitchen fires or under the kitchen dressers were taking their sleep out for the past week it was still raining hard and the long narrow untidy street was still as dirty and disagreeable as ever otherwise there was no resemblance in it to the street of the last few days there was no crowd around the court house nor policemen with cross chains on their caps nor sheriffs servants with dirty tawdry liveries the assizes were over and till next julywhen the judges barristers jury c would all return carrick was doomed to fall back to its usual insignificance as a most uninteresting county town  as father john left the town on the previous evening he sent word up to the governor of the gaol that he would see young macdermot early on the following morning he did not go home to the cottage but again passed the night at mr mckeons at drumsna and a most sad and melancholy night it was after witnessing feemys death and seeing that the body had been decently and properly disposed mrs mckeon had returned home and her husband had found her quite ill from the effects of the scene she had gone through  soon after the two men had made their apology for a dinner mr webb who had had the verdict brought to his own house called and the three sat for some time talking over what possible means there might be still left for saving the young mans life it was at last agreed that webb should go up to dublin on the morrow and make what interest he could to see the lordlieutenant himself as well as the under secretary and endeavour by every means in his power to obtain a pardon  after what had been said by the judge whilst pronouncing the sentence they all felt that there could be no reasonable ground for hope but still they would leave no chance untried and it was therefore settled that the counsellor should start by the morning coach  early the next morning the priest left drumsna for carrick to see thady for the first time since his condemnation mckeon offered to go with him but he declined the offer saying that this morning he would sooner be left alone with his doomed friend he refused too the loan of mckeons car he wanted to collect his thoughts and his energy by the walk for he felt that he had much to do to school his own feelings before he could make his visit a comfort instead of a cause of additional distress to macdermot  about ten oclock he passed through the town and rang the governors bell at the gaol door he was a wellknown visitor there now and when the door was opened he expected at once as usual to be shown the prisoners cell but instead of that he was taken into the governors house  this officer had always been extremely civil to father john and had shown all the kindness in his power and that was no little to the prisoner he expressed himself to the priest greatly distressed at the verdict and the consequent fate of macdermot  its four years father john said he since i had a prisoner in my charge condemned to die its four years since there was an execution here and then the victim was a criminal of the blackest dyea man who had undoubtedly committed a coldblooded longpremeditated murder and then his death weighed heavy on me but i cannot but believe that this young man is innocentat any rate so much more innocent than he wasmy heart has failed me since he was brought back last night condemned  more innocent than he was said father john ah indeed he is if we were all as innocent of guilt as this poor fellow is it would be well for most of us i promised to see him early this morning will you let me go up to him now though god knows i know not what to say to him  yes of course you shall go up now immediately and god grant you may be able to comfort him but you know you cannot see him as you have done always that is you may see him as often as you please but you cannot see him alone  not alone said father john  not now said the governor when brought back capitally condemned he was of necessity put into the condemned cell and when once there no visitor may be left alone with him  how is he to receivehow am i to perform the sacred duties of my profession  when the prisoner is about to confess the turnkey will step outside the door which you can close you know father john continued the governor it is not from my own heart i give these orders you know i would give him every indulgence i could but you also know that i must obey the rules of my office and they imperatively forbid that any visitor shall be left alone with a condemned prisoner  i know it isnt your fault and if it must be so it must but will you desire the man to be sent for for macdermot will be expecting me  in a minute or two the gaoler arrived with his huge keys and with a palpitating heart father john followed him to the condemned cell  the priest during his walk from drumsna had made up his mind exactly as to what he would say on seeing thady how he would mix pity with condolence how he would use such words as might strengthen him in his determination to bear his sufferings with resignation how he would teach him to forget the present in the thoughts of his future prospects but when the iron door was opened and he saw macdermot seated on the one small stone seat in the wall beneath the high ironbarred window when his eye rested on the young mans pale and worn face he forgot all his studied phrases and premeditated conduct his acute grief overcame his ideas of duty and falling on the prisoners bosom he sobbed out my boymy boymy poor murdered boy  it would be useless to attempt to describe at length the scene between them father john remained with him nearly the whole of that daythe patient silent turnkey leaning up against the corner of the cell during the whole time for a long time thady was the most tranquil of the two but at length the priest regained his composure and was able to listen to the various requests of his friend and to say all that could be said to comfort and strengthen him  thadys first request was that he might see his father this father john felt would be impracticable and if accomplished would only be in the highest degree painful larry was now so perfectly a lunatic and at the same time so resolute in his determination not to put himself in the way of being arrested by keegan that it would be impossible either to make him understand the fate which awaited his son or to induce him by any means short of force to leave his own room besides were a meeting to be effected the idiotical father would probably not cease to abuse his son and would certainly not comprehend his tenderness and affection it was difficult to tell the son that his father had so utterly lost his intellects as to be unable to be brought to see him but even this was better than allowing him to think that he was to see him and then deceive him  thady bore this blow even worse than father john had expected that he would do it made him feel so desolateso alone in the world stupid and cross as his father had been for years pastcruel and unjust as he had been on the last time they metstill the long time which had passed since that meeting and the manner in which the interview had been passed by thady made him forget his fathers treatment and only remember that he was his last surviving relative he submitted however to father johns advice and consented not to urge his request  he then talked of his sister and began to speak more feelingly of ussher and to allude to the deed which had brought him to his dreadful doom with more freedom than he had ever done before the facts of his last months residence at ballycloran seemed to be made less obscure than they had been to his minds eye by the distance through which he looked at them he appeared to comprehend more clearly both feemys conduct and that of her lover and he spoke with the greatest affection of the former and with justice to the latter  oh father john he continued after they had been talking together for hours and when they had become so habituated to the presence of the turnkey as almost to forget it no one but yourself can ever know how far murder was from my thoughts that daynor all that i had suffered for having listened for one moment to the plots which them boys were making for his death but who can wonder that i hated him god knows i have forgiven him for all that he has brought on usboth me and feemy but who can wonder that i didnt love him then i knew in my heart he never meant to marry her and oh father john av i hadnt seen her that night what would she have been now i did hate him thenand hadnt i cause and for that one night at the wedding when i was mad with the name they had called my sisther i did think id be glad av the boys that hated him so should murther him at last but when i woke in the morning and remembered that the sounds of murther had been in my ears i felt as though i could never more be quiet or at ase in this world and i never was every mans hand was against me since then father john except yours i felt as i walked through the fields that morning that it was here i should spend my last days and here i am and i was warned of it too i was warned of what would come of it av i meddled with them boys that night at mrs mehans he himself called me out that night when i first got there and tould me what it was brady was afther and i believed him and yet i went for my heart was full of hatred for the man who warned me oh why father john could he not let us alone we were poor but we were no worse but theres an end of us now altogether and perhaps its for the betther as it is  he then earnestly begged father john to attend to his sisters burial and to take some little heed of his father during his few remaining years and all this the priest promised he spoke of the property and of the chance there might be of saving something out of it for the old mans support father john however told him that for his thadys sake and for the love he bore him his father should never want till he wanted himself and though this promise for many long months entailed a heavy burden on the priest he most religiously kept his word  thady then spoke of his own coming death and though he had made up his mind to die and could think without regret of leaving the world where he had known so many sorrows and so few joys still he shuddered when he remembered the gaping crowd which would be assembled to see his expiring convulsions and the horror which he could not but feel when the executioners hands should touch his neck and the dreadful cap should be drawn over his eyes oh that that horrid moment might be overwhen he would still be alivestill sensible to the thoughts of lifebut when the light of the sun would have been for ever excluded and his last thoughts would be wandering between doubtful hopes of heavens mercy and awful fears of his coming agony  the cold sweat stood upon his brow as he endeavoured to explain his feelings to the priest and assiduously patiently warmly and kindly did that friend endeavour to allay his sufferings and make him feel as confident of gods pardon for his sins as he was of the executioners doom he told him also that if possible no crowd should be assembled to gaze at his death and he promised himself to stand by him and hold his hand to the last moment of his life  at six the priest left him promising to see him again on the sunday and on every day till it was all over he then returned to mckeons where he dined  at about ten they were sitting together with mrs mckeon by the fire talking over the affairs of ballycloran and consulting as to what had better be done with larry after the execution when the girl entered and said a man was waiting outside wishing to speak to mr mckeon tony accordingly went out and standing at the backdoor for he would not enter the kitchen with his hat slouched over his face he found pat brady he was very much astonished at seeing this man more especially so as since the trial bradys name had been mentioned with execration by almost every one and particularly by those who like mckeon had taken every opportunity of showing themselves macdermots friends and it would have been thought therefore that mckeons house was one of the last places to which he would be likely to come  pat was the first to speak  theres a word or two i want to spake to you mr mckeon  to speak to me said mr mckeon well what is it  i couldnt just be telling you here av you wouldnt mind stepping out a minute or soits not five minutes id be keeping you  mckeon accordingly went out into the dark yard about thirty paces from the house and brady continued  its about the young masther yer honor  youve said enough about him youve hanged him now what more have you  may i niver see the blessed virgin in glory av i towld a word of a lie agin the masther av i iver towld the truth it was that day an worse luckav id lied then maybe itd been betther for mr thady  it wasnt to tell me that you came hereif youve anything to say let me hear what it is  why then yer honor is mr larry the owld man a going to see the young masther  and what if he is  why jist this thin av he do keegans boys is to saze him as he comes out on the road from ballycloran  gracious god would he arrest the man coming to see his own son for the last time  faix he will mr mckeon so dont let him do it i heard him telling the bailiff  mckeon seemed lost in astonishment at this fresh instance of the attorneys relentless barbarity and brady turned round to go away but after having walked a few yards he came back and said in a hesitating whisper  youll be seeing mr thady afore its all over mr mckeon  well i shall see him  would you mind axing him to pardon a poor boy mr mckeon  may god pardon you brady your master that was has been taught before this to forgive all his enemies but i wouldnt dirty my mouth with your name the last time i see him  sorrow a word of a lie thin i towld mr mckeon  never mind truth or lies its much the same and mckeon returned to the house and told father john what he had heard from brady and the priest and he agreed together that it would be by far the best course to make thady understand that his father could not leave his home to see him for fear of falling into the hands of the attorney  on the next day sunday father john performed mass and preached as usual in the parish chapel when the service was over he addressed his congregation from the altar on the subject of thadys approaching execution and he begged them all as they valued his good opinion not only not to be present at it themselves but also to do all in their power to prevent others from being so the same thing was done in carrick where the priest moreover begged his parishioners not to open their shops on that morning until the execution should be over  the ensuing week passed slowly away father john was with the doomed man constantly and mckeon saw him two or three times on the wednesday mr webb returned from dublin but his journey had been a fruitless one he had seen the lordlieutenant and had been kindly received by him but at the same time he was informed that he could not exercise his privilege of mercy in this case as he had been strongly advised not to do so both by those in office under him and by the judge  macdermot kept up his heart wonderfully through the whole week he never repined nor once even alluded to keegan father john spent the whole of sunday with him it was to be his last in this world the last time he was to watch the light growing out of the darknessand the darkness following the light as the minutes flew by his face became gradually paler and his hand occasionally trembled the brave soldier goes to meet death and meets him without a shudder when he comes the suffering woman patiently awaits him on her bed of sickness and conscious of her malady dies slowly without a struggle a not uncommon fortitude enables men and women to leave their mortal coil and take the dread leap in the dark with apparent readiness and ease but to wait in full health and strength for the arrival of the fixed hour of certain deathto feel the moments sink from under you which are fast bringing you to the executioners handto know that in twelveteneightsix hours by the clock which hurries through the rapid minutes you are to becomenot by gods accomplished visitationnot in any gallant struggle of your ownbut through the stern will of certain powerful mena hideous foul and dislocated corseto know that at one certain ordained moment you are to be made extinctto be violently put an end toto be fully aware that this is your fixed fate and that though strong as a lion you must at that moment die like a dogto await the doom without fearwithout feeling the blood grow cold round the heartwithout a quickened pulse and shaking muscles exceeds the bounds of mortal courage and requires either the ignorant unimaginative indifference of a brute or the superhuman endurance of an enthusiastic martyr  thady was neither the one nor the other and the blood did grow cold round his hearthis pulse quickened and his nerves shook within him but these were involuntary signs of his human nature he spent the day in the performance of his religious duties and made continual efforts to fix his mind on those subjects to which it was directed by the priest and at last he received from him final absolution for his sins with a full assurance in its efficacy and if true and deep repentance can make absolution available the priests assurance was not ill grounded  father cullen at drumsna and different priests in the neighbouring parishes again desired their congregations to absent themselves from the execution and on the sunday evening before the fatal day it was thoroughly understood through the country that it was the wish of the priest that no one should be present  the monday morning came though father john had not been allowed to remain all night in the prisoners cell he did not leave it till eleven and was with him again at six when the gaoler turned the key in the door father john found the prisoner still sleeping on his pallet even the loud noise of the key in the lock and the dropping back of the heavy bolt had failed to awaken him before he left him on the previous evening he had insisted on his partially undressing and he now found him exactly in the position in which he had left him  eight was the hour fixed for the execution and though it seemed cruel to rob him of his last human comfort still as so few minutes of life remained the priest thought it better to rouse him he laid his hand on his shoulder and calling out his christian name gently shook him it was wonderful how soundly the poor fellow slept and at last he jumped up with a smile on his wan face uttering those confused words of acknowledgment which so readily come to the lips of any one conscious of being caught sleeping too late to the neglect of his worldly duties he had been dreamingand in his dreams he was again at ballycloranagain sitting over the warm turf fire talking with his father after his hard days work of their lands and their rents and their difficulties father johns presencethe cold close white wall and his own memory soon made him again conscious of the truth and as he pressed his hands to his forehead remembering that he should never again feel the luxury of sleep the expression of his face was dreadful to be seen  there is nothing further to relate respecting him as the clock struck eight he was standing on the iron grate over the front entrance into carrick gaol he had supported himself firmlythough evidently with difficulty the cap was over his facehis hands were tied behind his backand the rope was round his neck the last sound that met his ear was the final prayer which father john sobbed forth that god would receive him into his mercy the bolt was drawnand thady macdermot was soon no more  not one human form appeared before the gaol that morning not even a passenger crossed over the bridge from halfpast seven till after eight as from thence one might just catch a glimpse of the front of the prison at the end of the bridge stood three or four men guarding the street and cautioning those who came that they could not pass by and as their behests were quietly obeyed the police did not interfere with them among them were joe reynolds and corney dolan and they did not leave their post till they were aware that the body of him to whom they showed this last respect had been removed the shops were closed during the whole day but it was many days before the sad melancholy which attended the execution of thady macdermot wore away from the little town of carrickonshannon    printed by j s virtue city road london
