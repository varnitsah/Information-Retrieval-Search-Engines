59090272	the road  by  jack london  new york macmillan  1907        to  josiah flynt  the real thing blowed in the glass     contents     confession     holding her down     pictures     pinched     the pen     hoboes that pass in the night     roadkids and gaycats     two thousand stiffs     bulls         speakin in general i ave tried em all     the appy roads that take you oer the world     speakin in general i ave found them good     for such as cannot use one bed too long     but must get ence the same as i ave done     an go observin matters till they die                     sestina of the tramproyal     confession   there is a woman in the state of nevada to whom i once lied continuously consistently and shamelessly for the matter of a couple of hours i dont want to apologize to her far be it from me but i do want to explain unfortunately i do not know her name much less her present address if her eyes should chance upon these lines i hope she will write to me  it was in reno nevada in the summer of 1892 also it was fairtime and the town was filled with petty crooks and tinhorns to say nothing of a vast and hungry horde of hoboes it was the hungry hoboes that made the town a hungry town they battered the back doors of the homes of the citizens until the back doors became unresponsive  a hard town for scoffings was what the hoboes called it at that time i know that i missed many a meal in spite of the fact that i could throw my feet with the next one when it came to slamming a gate for a pokeout or a setdown or hitting for a light piece on the street why i was so hard put in that town one day that i gave the porter the slip and invaded the private car of some itinerant millionnaire the train started as i made the platform and i headed for the aforesaid millionnaire with the porter one jump behind and reaching for me it was a dead heat for i reached the millionnaire at the same instant that the porter reached me i had no time for formalities gimme a quarter to eat on i blurted out and as i live that millionnaire dipped into his pocket and gave me  just  precisely  a quarter it is my conviction that he was so flabbergasted that he obeyed automatically and it has been a matter of keen regret ever since on my part that i didnt ask him for a dollar i know that id have got it i swung off the platform of that private car with the porter manoeuvring to kick me in the face he missed me one is at a terrible disadvantage when trying to swing off the lowest step of a car and not break his neck on the right of way with at the same time an irate ethiopian on the platform above trying to land him in the face with a number eleven but i got the quarter i got it  but to return to the woman to whom i so shamelessly lied it was in the evening of my last day in reno i had been out to the racetrack watching the ponies run and had missed my dinner ie the midday meal i was hungry and furthermore a committee of public safety had just been organized to rid the town of just such hungry mortals as i already a lot of my brother hoboes had been gathered in by john law and i could hear the sunny valleys of california calling to me over the cold crests of the sierras two acts remained for me to perform before i shook the dust of reno from my feet one was to catch the blind baggage on the westbound overland that night the other was first to get something to eat even youth will hesitate at an allnight ride on an empty stomach outside a train that is tearing the atmosphere through the snowsheds tunnels and eternal snows of heavenaspiring mountains  but that something to eat was a hard proposition i was turned down at a dozen houses sometimes i received insulting remarks and was informed of the barred domicile that should be mine if i had my just deserts the worst of it was that such assertions were only too true that was why i was pulling west that night john law was abroad in the town seeking eagerly for the hungry and homeless for by such was his barred domicile tenanted  at other houses the doors were slammed in my face cutting short my politely and humbly couched request for something to eat at one house they did not open the door i stood on the porch and knocked and they looked out at me through the window they even held one sturdy little boy aloft so that he could see over the shoulders of his elders the tramp who wasnt going to get anything to eat at their house  it began to look as if i should be compelled to go to the very poor for my food the very poor constitute the last sure recourse of the hungry tramp the very poor can always be depended upon they never turn away the hungry time and again all over the united states have i been refused food by the big house on the hill and always have i received food from the little shack down by the creek or marsh with its broken windows stuffed with rags and its tiredfaced mother broken with labor oh you charitymongers go to the poor and learn for the poor alone are the charitable they neither give nor withhold from their excess they have no excess they give and they withhold never from what they need for themselves and very often from what they cruelly need for themselves a bone to the dog is not charity charity is the bone shared with the dog when you are just as hungry as the dog  there was one house in particular where i was turned down that evening the porch windows opened on the dining room and through them i saw a man eating piea big meatpie i stood in the open door and while he talked with me he went on eating he was prosperous and out of his prosperity had been bred resentment against his less fortunate brothers  he cut short my request for something to eat snapping out i dont believe you want to work  now this was irrelevant i hadnt said anything about work the topic of conversation i had introduced was food in fact i didnt want to work i wanted to take the westbound overland that night  you wouldnt work if you had a chance he bullied  i glanced at his meekfaced wife and knew that but for the presence of this cerberus id have a whack at that meatpie myself but cerberus sopped himself in the pie and i saw that i must placate him if i were to get a share of it so i sighed to myself and accepted his workmorality  of course i want work i bluffed  dont believe it he snorted  try me i answered warming to the bluff  all right he said come to the corner of blank and blank streetsi have forgotten the addresstomorrow morning you know where that burned building is and ill put you to work tossing bricks  all right sir ill be there  he grunted and went on eating i waited after a couple of minutes he looked up with an ithoughtyouweregone expression on his face and demanded  well  i  i am waiting for something to eat i said gently  i knew you wouldnt work he roared  he was right of course but his conclusion must have been reached by mindreading for his logic wouldnt bear it out but the beggar at the door must be humble so i accepted his logic as i had accepted his morality  you see i am now hungry i said still gently tomorrow morning i shall be hungrier think how hungry i shall be when i have tossed bricks all day without anything to eat now if you will give me something to eat ill be in great shape for those bricks  he gravely considered my plea at the same time going on eating while his wife nearly trembled into propitiatory speech but refrained  ill tell you what ill do he said between mouthfuls you come to work tomorrow and in the middle of the day ill advance you enough for your dinner that will show whether you are in earnest or not  in the meantime i began but he interrupted  if i gave you something to eat now id never see you again oh i know your kind look at me i owe no man i have never descended so low as to ask any one for food i have always earned my food the trouble with you is that you are idle and dissolute i can see it in your face i have worked and been honest i have made myself what i am and you can do the same if you work and are honest  like you i queried  alas no ray of humor had ever penetrated the sombre worksodden soul of that man  yes like me he answered  all of us i queried  yes all of you he answered conviction vibrating in his voice  but if we all became like you i said allow me to point out that thered be nobody to toss bricks for you  i swear there was a flicker of a smile in his wifes eye as for him he was aghastbut whether at the awful possibility of a reformed humanity that would not enable him to get anybody to toss bricks for him or at my impudence i shall never know  ill not waste words on you he roared get out of here you ungrateful whelp  i scraped my feet to advertise my intention of going and queried  and i dont get anything to eat  he arose suddenly to his feet he was a large man i was a stranger in a strange land and john law was looking for me i went away hurriedly but why ungrateful i asked myself as i slammed his gate what in the dickens did he give me to be ungrateful about i looked back i could still see him through the window he had returned to his pie  by this time i had lost heart i passed many houses by without venturing up to them all houses looked alike and none looked good after walking half a dozen blocks i shook off my despondency and gathered my nerve this begging for food was all a game and if i didnt like the cards i could always call for a new deal i made up my mind to tackle the next house i approached it in the deepening twilight going around to the kitchen door  i knocked softly and when i saw the kind face of the middleaged woman who answered as by inspiration came to me the story i was to tell for know that upon his ability to tell a good story depends the success of the beggar first of all and on the instant the beggar must size up his victim after that he must tell a story that will appeal to the peculiar personality and temperament of that particular victim and right here arises the great difficulty in the instant that he is sizing up the victim he must begin his story not a minute is allowed for preparation as in a lightning flash he must divine the nature of the victim and conceive a tale that will hit home the successful hobo must be an artist he must create spontaneously and instantaneouslyand not upon a theme selected from the plenitude of his own imagination but upon the theme he reads in the face of the person who opens the door be it man woman or child sweet or crabbed generous or miserly goodnatured or cantankerous jew or gentile black or white raceprejudiced or brotherly provincial or universal or whatever else it may be i have often thought that to this training of my tramp days is due much of my success as a storywriter in order to get the food whereby i lived i was compelled to tell tales that rang true at the back door out of inexorable necessity is developed the convincingness and sincerity laid down by all authorities on the art of the shortstory also i quite believe it was my trampapprenticeship that made a realist out of me realism constitutes the only goods one can exchange at the kitchen door for grub  after all art is only consummate artfulness and artfulness saves many a story i remember lying in a police station at winnipeg manitoba i was bound west over the canadian pacific of course the police wanted my story and i gave it to themon the spur of the moment they were landlubbers in the heart of the continent and what better story for them than a sea story they could never trip me up on that and so i told a tearful tale of my life on the hellship glenmore i had once seen the glenmore lying at anchor in san francisco bay  i was an english apprentice i said and they said that i didnt talk like an english boy it was up to me to create on the instant i had been born and reared in the united states on the death of my parents i had been sent to england to my grandparents it was they who had apprenticed me on the glenmore i hope the captain of the glenmore will forgive me for i gave him a character that night in the winnipeg police station such cruelty such brutality such diabolical ingenuity of torture it explained why i had deserted the glenmore at montreal  but why was i in the middle of canada going west when my grandparents lived in england promptly i created a married sister who lived in california she would take care of me i developed at length her loving nature but they were not done with me those hardhearted policemen i had joined the glenmore in england in the two years that had elapsed before my desertion at montreal what had the glenmore done and where had she been and thereat i took those landlubbers around the world with me buffeted by pounding seas and stung with flying spray they fought a typhoon with me off the coast of japan they loaded and unloaded cargo with me in all the ports of the seven seas i took them to india and rangoon and china and had them hammer ice with me around the horn and at last come to moorings at montreal  and then they said to wait a moment and one policeman went forth into the night while i warmed myself at the stove all the while racking my brains for the trap they were going to spring on me  i groaned to myself when i saw him come in the door at the heels of the policeman no gypsy prank had thrust those tiny hoops of gold through the ears no prairie winds had beaten that skin into wrinkled leather nor had snowdrift and mountainslope put in his walk that reminiscent roll and in those eyes when they looked at me i saw the unmistakable sunwash of the sea here was a theme alas with half a dozen policemen to watch me readi who had never sailed the china seas nor been around the horn nor looked with my eyes upon india and rangoon  i was desperate disaster stalked before me incarnate in the form of that goldearringed weatherbeaten son of the sea who was he what was he i must solve him ere he solved me i must take a new orientation or else those wicked policemen would orientate me to a cell a police court and more cells if he questioned me first before i knew how much he knew i was lost  but did i betray my desperate plight to those lynxeyed guardians of the public welfare of winnipeg not i i met that aged sailorman gladeyed and beaming with all the simulated relief at deliverance that a drowning man would display on finding a lifepreserver in his last despairing clutch here was a man who understood and who would verify my true story to the faces of those sleuthhounds who did not understand or at least such was what i endeavored to playact i seized upon him i volleyed him with questions about himself before my judges i would prove the character of my savior before he saved me  he was a kindly sailormanan easy mark the policemen grew impatient while i questioned him at last one of them told me to shut up i shut up but while i remained shut up i was busy creating busy sketching the scenario of the next act i had learned enough to go on with he was a frenchman he had sailed always on french merchant vessels with the one exception of a voyage on a limejuicer and last of allblessed facthe had not been on the sea for twenty years  the policeman urged him on to examine me  you called in at rangoon he queried  i nodded we put our third mate ashore there fever  if he had asked me what kind of fever i should have answered enteric though for the life of me i didnt know what enteric was but he didnt ask me instead his next question was  and how is rangoon  all right it rained a whole lot when we were there  did you get shoreleave  sure i answered three of us apprentices went ashore together  do you remember the temple  which temple i parried  the big one at the top of the stairway  if i remembered that temple i knew id have to describe it the gulf yawned for me  i shook my head  you can see it from all over the harbor he informed me you dont need shoreleave to see that temple  i never loathed a temple so in my life but i fixed that particular temple at rangoon  you cant see it from the harbor i contradicted you cant see it from the town you cant see it from the top of the stairway because i paused for the effect because there isnt any temple there  but i saw it with my own eyes he cried  that was in i queried  seventyone  it was destroyed in the great earthquake of 1887 i explained it was very old  there was a pause he was busy reconstructing in his old eyes the youthful vision of that fair temple by the sea  the stairway is still there i aided him you can see it from all over the harbor and you remember that little island on the righthand side coming into the harbor i guess there must have been one there i was prepared to shift it over to the lefthand side for he nodded gone i said seven fathoms of water there now  i had gained a moment for breath while he pondered on times changes i prepared the finishing touches of my story  you remember the customhouse at bombay  he remembered it  burned to the ground i announced  do you remember jim wan he came back at me  dead i said but who the devil jim wan was i hadnt the slightest idea  i was on thin ice again  do you remember billy harper at shanghai i queried back at him quickly  that aged sailorman worked hard to recollect but the billy harper of my imagination was beyond his faded memory  of course you remember billy harper i insisted everybody knows him hes been there forty years well hes still there thats all  and then the miracle happened the sailorman remembered billy harper perhaps there was a billy harper and perhaps he had been in shanghai for forty years and was still there but it was news to me  for fully half an hour longer the sailorman and i talked on in similar fashion in the end he told the policemen that i was what i represented myself to be and after a nights lodging and a breakfast i was released to wander on westward to my married sister in san francisco  but to return to the woman in reno who opened her door to me in the deepening twilight at the first glimpse of her kindly face i took my cue i became a sweet innocent unfortunate lad i couldnt speak i opened my mouth and closed it again never in my life before had i asked any one for food my embarrassment was painful extreme i was ashamed i who looked upon begging as a delightful whimsicality thumbed myself over into a true son of mrs grundy burdened with all her bourgeois morality only the harsh pangs of the bellyneed could compel me to do so degraded and ignoble a thing as beg for food and into my face i strove to throw all the wan wistfulness of famished and ingenuous youth unused to mendicancy  you are hungry my poor boy she said  i had made her speak first  i nodded my head and gulped  it is the first time i have ever  asked i faltered  come right in the door swung open we have already finished eating but the fire is burning and i can get something up for you  she looked at me closely when she got me into the light  i wish my boy were as healthy and strong as you she said but he is not strong he sometimes falls down he just fell down this afternoon and hurt himself badly the poor dear  she mothered him with her voice with an ineffable tenderness in it that i yearned to appropriate i glanced at him he sat across the table slender and pale his head swathed in bandages he did not move but his eyes bright in the lamplight were fixed upon me in a steady and wondering stare  just like my poor father i said he had the falling sickness some kind of vertigo it puzzled the doctors they never could make out what was the matter with him  he is dead she queried gently setting before me half a dozen softboiled eggs  dead i gulped two weeks ago i was with him when it happened we were crossing the street together he fell right down he was never conscious again they carried him into a drugstore he died there  and thereat i developed the pitiful tale of my fatherhow after my mothers death he and i had gone to san francisco from the ranch how his pension he was an old soldier and the little other money he had was not enough and how he had tried bookcanvassing also i narrated my own woes during the few days after his death that i had spent alone and forlorn on the streets of san francisco while that good woman warmed up biscuits fried bacon and cooked more eggs and while i kept pace with her in taking care of all that she placed before me i enlarged the picture of that poor orphan boy and filled in the details i became that poor boy i believed in him as i believed in the beautiful eggs i was devouring i could have wept for myself i know the tears did get into my voice at times it was very effective  in fact with every touch i added to the picture that kind soul gave me something also she made up a lunch for me to carry away she put in many boiled eggs pepper and salt and other things and a big apple she provided me with three pairs of thick red woollen socks she gave me clean handkerchiefs and other things which i have since forgotten and all the time she cooked more and more and i ate more and more i gorged like a savage but then it was a far cry across the sierras on a blind baggage and i knew not when nor where i should find my next meal and all the while like a deathshead at the feast silent and motionless her own unfortunate boy sat and stared at me across the table i suppose i represented to him mystery and romance and adventureall that was denied the feeble flicker of life that was in him and yet i could not forbear once or twice from wondering if he saw through me down to the bottom of my mendacious heart  but where are you going to she asked me  salt lake city said i i have a sister therea married sister i debated if i should make a mormon out of her and decided against it her husband is a plumbera contracting plumber  now i knew that contracting plumbers were usually credited with making lots of money but i had spoken it was up to me to qualify  they would have sent me the money for my fare if i had asked for it i explained but they have had sickness and business troubles his partner cheated him and so i wouldnt write for the money i knew i could make my way there somehow i let them think i had enough to get me to salt lake city she is lovely and so kind she was always kind to me i guess ill go into the shop and learn the trade she has two daughters they are younger than i one is only a baby  of all my married sisters that i have distributed among the cities of the united states that salt lake sister is my favorite she is quite real too when i tell about her i can see her and her two little girls and her plumber husband she is a large motherly woman just verging on beneficent stoutnessthe kind you know that always cooks nice things and that never gets angry she is a brunette her husband is a quiet easygoing fellow sometimes i almost know him quite well and who knows but some day i may meet him if that aged sailorman could remember billy harper i see no reason why i should not some day meet the husband of my sister who lives in salt lake city  on the other hand i have a feeling of certitude within me that i shall never meet in the flesh my many parents and grandparentsyou see i invariably killed them off heart disease was my favorite way of getting rid of my mother though on occasion i did away with her by means of consumption pneumonia and typhoid fever it is true as the winnipeg policemen will attest that i have grandparents living in england but that was a long time ago and it is a fair assumption that they are dead by now at any rate they have never written to me  i hope that woman in reno will read these lines and forgive me my gracelessness and unveracity i do not apologize for i am unashamed it was youth delight in life zest for experience that brought me to her door it did me good it taught me the intrinsic kindliness of human nature i hope it did her good anyway she may get a good laugh out of it now that she learns the real inwardness of the situation  to her my story was true she believed in me and all my family and she was filled with solicitude for the dangerous journey i must make ere i won to salt lake city this solicitude nearly brought me to grief just as i was leaving my arms full of lunch and my pockets bulging with fat woollen socks she bethought herself of a nephew or uncle or relative of some sort who was in the railway mail service and who moreover would come through that night on the very train on which i was going to steal my ride the very thing she would take me down to the depot tell him my story and get him to hide me in the mail car thus without danger or hardship i would be carried straight through to ogden salt lake city was only a few miles farther on my heart sank she grew excited as she developed the plan and with my sinking heart i had to feign unbounded gladness and enthusiasm at this solution of my difficulties  solution why i was bound west that night and here was i being trapped into going east it was a trap and i hadnt the heart to tell her that it was all a miserable lie and while i made believe that i was delighted i was busy cudgelling my brains for some way to escape but there was no way she would see me into the mailcarshe said so herselfand then that mailclerk relative of hers would carry me to ogden and then i would have to beat my way back over all those hundreds of miles of desert  but luck was with me that night just about the time she was getting ready to put on her bonnet and accompany me she discovered that she had made a mistake her mailclerk relative was not scheduled to come through that night his run had been changed he would not come through until two nights afterward i was saved for of course my boundless youth would never permit me to wait those two days i optimistically assured her that id get to salt lake city quicker if i started immediately and i departed with her blessings and best wishes ringing in my ears  but those woollen socks were great i know i wore a pair of them that night on the blind baggage of the overland and that overland went west     holding her down   barring accidents a good hobo with youth and agility can hold a train down despite all the efforts of the traincrew to ditch himgiven of course nighttime as an essential condition when such a hobo under such conditions makes up his mind that he is going to hold her down either he does hold her down or chance trips him up there is no legitimate way short of murder whereby the traincrew can ditch him that traincrews have not stopped short of murder is a current belief in the tramp world not having had that particular experience in my tramp days i cannot vouch for it personally  but this i have heard of the bad roads when a tramp has gone underneath on the rods and the train is in motion there is apparently no way of dislodging him until the train stops the tramp snugly ensconced inside the truck with the four wheels and all the framework around him has the cinch on the crewor so he thinks until some day he rides the rods on a bad road a bad road is usually one on which a short time previously one or several trainmen have been killed by tramps heaven pity the tramp who is caught underneath on such a roadfor caught he is though the train be going sixty miles an hour  the shack brakeman takes a couplingpin and a length of bellcord to the platform in front of the truck in which the tramp is riding the shack fastens the couplingpin to the bellcord drops the former down between the platforms and pays out the latter the couplingpin strikes the ties between the rails rebounds against the bottom of the car and again strikes the ties the shack plays it back and forth now to this side now to the other lets it out a bit and hauls it in a bit giving his weapon opportunity for every variety of impact and rebound every blow of that flying couplingpin is freighted with death and at sixty miles an hour it beats a veritable tattoo of death the next day the remains of that tramp are gathered up along the right of way and a line in the local paper mentions the unknown man undoubtedly a tramp assumably drunk who had probably fallen asleep on the track  as a characteristic illustration of how a capable hobo can hold her down i am minded to give the following experience i was in ottawa bound west over the canadian pacific three thousand miles of that road stretched before me it was the fall of the year and i had to cross manitoba and the rocky mountains i could expect crimpy weather and every moment of delay increased the frigid hardships of the journey furthermore i was disgusted the distance between montreal and ottawa is one hundred and twenty miles i ought to know for i had just come over it and it had taken me six days by mistake i had missed the main line and come over a small jerk with only two locals a day on it and during these six days i had lived on dry crusts and not enough of them begged from the french peasants  furthermore my disgust had been heightened by the one day i had spent in ottawa trying to get an outfit of clothing for my long journey let me put it on record right here that ottawa with one exception is the hardest town in the united states and canada to beg clothes in the one exception is washington dc the latter fair city is the limit i spent two weeks there trying to beg a pair of shoes and then had to go on to jersey city before i got them  but to return to ottawa at eight sharp in the morning i started out after clothes i worked energetically all day i swear i walked forty miles i interviewed the housewives of a thousand homes i did not even knock off work for dinner and at six in the afternoon after ten hours of unremitting and depressing toil i was still shy one shirt while the pair of trousers i had managed to acquire was tight and moreover was showing all the signs of an early disintegration  at six i quit work and headed for the railroad yards expecting to pick up something to eat on the way but my hard luck was still with me i was refused food at house after house then i got a handout my spirits soared for it was the largest handout i had ever seen in a long and varied experience it was a parcel wrapped in newspapers and as big as a mature suitcase i hurried to a vacant lot and opened it first i saw cake then more cake all kinds and makes of cake and then some it was all cake no bread and butter with thick firm slices of meat betweennothing but cake and i who of all things abhorred cake most in another age and clime they sat down by the waters of babylon and wept and in a vacant lot in canadas proud capital i too sat down and wept  over a mountain of cake as one looks upon the face of his dead son so looked i upon that multitudinous pastry i suppose i was an ungrateful tramp for i refused to partake of the bounteousness of the house that had had a party the night before evidently the guests hadnt liked cake either  that cake marked the crisis in my fortunes than it nothing could be worse therefore things must begin to mend and they did at the very next house i was given a setdown now a setdown is the height of bliss one is taken inside very often is given a chance to wash and is then setdown at a table tramps love to throw their legs under a table the house was large and comfortable in the midst of spacious grounds and fine trees and sat well back from the street they had just finished eating and i was taken right into the dining roomin itself a most unusual happening for the tramp who is lucky enough to win a setdown usually receives it in the kitchen a grizzled and gracious englishman his matronly wife and a beautiful young frenchwoman talked with me while i ate  i wonder if that beautiful young frenchwoman would remember at this late day the laugh i gave her when i uttered the barbaric phrase twobits you see i was trying delicately to hit them for a light piece that was how the sum of money came to be mentioned what she said twobits said i her mouth was twitching as she again said what twobits said i whereat she burst into laughter wont you repeat it she said when she had regained control of herself twobits said i and once more she rippled into uncontrollable silvery laughter i beg your pardon said she but what  what was it you said twobits said i is there anything wrong about it not that i know of she gurgled between gasps but what does it mean i explained but i do not remember now whether or not i got that twobits out of her but i have often wondered since as to which of us was the provincial  when i arrived at the depot i found much to my disgust a bunch of at least twenty tramps that were waiting to ride out the blind baggages of the overland now two or three tramps on the blind baggage are all right they are inconspicuous but a score that meant trouble no traincrew would ever let all of us ride  i may as well explain here what a blind baggage is some mailcars are built without doors in the ends hence such a car is blind the mailcars that possess end doors have those doors always locked suppose after the train has started that a tramp gets on to the platform of one of these blind cars there is no door or the door is locked no conductor or brakeman can get to him to collect fare or throw him off it is clear that the tramp is safe until the next time the train stops then he must get off run ahead in the darkness and when the train pulls by jump on to the blind again but there are ways and ways as you shall see  when the train pulled out those twenty tramps swarmed upon the three blinds some climbed on before the train had run a carlength they were awkward dubs and i saw their speedy finish of course the traincrew was on and at the first stop the trouble began i jumped off and ran forward along the track i noticed that i was accompanied by a number of the tramps they evidently knew their business when one is beating an overland he must always keep well ahead of the train at the stops i ran ahead and as i ran one by one those that accompanied me dropped out this dropping out was the measure of their skill and nerve in boarding a train  for this is the way it works when the train starts the shack rides out the blind there is no way for him to get back into the train proper except by jumping off the blind and catching a platform where the carends are not blind when the train is going as fast as the shack cares to risk he therefore jumps off the blind lets several cars go by and gets on to the train so it is up to the tramp to run so far ahead that before the blind is opposite him the shack will have already vacated it  i dropped the last tramp by about fifty feet and waited the train started i saw the lantern of the shack on the first blind he was riding her out and i saw the dubs stand forlornly by the track as the blind went by they made no attempt to get on they were beaten by their own inefficiency at the very start after them in the lineup came the tramps that knew a little something about the game they let the first blind occupied by the shack go by and jumped on the second and third blinds of course the shack jumped off the first and on to the second as it went by and scrambled around there throwing off the men who had boarded it but the point is that i was so far ahead that when the first blind came opposite me the shack had already left it and was tangled up with the tramps on the second blind a half dozen of the more skilful tramps who had run far enough ahead made the first blind too  at the next stop as we ran forward along the track i counted but fifteen of us five had been ditched the weedingout process had begun nobly and it continued station by station now we were fourteen now twelve now eleven now nine now eight it reminded me of the ten little niggers of the nursery rhyme i was resolved that i should be the last little nigger of all and why not was i not blessed with strength agility and youth i was eighteen and in perfect condition and didnt i have my nerve with me and furthermore was i not a tramproyal were not these other tramps mere dubs and gaycats and amateurs alongside of me if i werent the last little nigger i might as well quit the game and get a job on an alfalfa farm somewhere  by the time our number had been reduced to four the whole traincrew had become interested from then on it was a contest of skill and wits with the odds in favor of the crew one by one the three other survivors turned up missing until i alone remained my but i was proud of myself no croesus was ever prouder of his first million i was holding her down in spite of two brakemen a conductor a fireman and an engineer  and here are a few samples of the way i held her down out ahead in the darknessso far ahead that the shack riding out the blind must perforce get off before it reaches mei get on very well i am good for another station when that station is reached i dart ahead again to repeat the manoeuvre the train pulls out i watch her coming there is no light of a lantern on the blind has the crew abandoned the fight i do not know one never knows and one must be prepared every moment for anything as the first blind comes opposite me and i run to leap aboard i strain my eyes to see if the shack is on the platform for all i know he may be there with his lantern doused and even as i spring upon the steps that lantern may smash down upon my head i ought to know i have been hit by lanterns two or three times  but no the first blind is empty the train is gathering speed i am safe for another station but am i i feel the train slacken speed on the instant i am alert a manoeuvre is being executed against me and i do not know what it is i try to watch on both sides at once not forgetting to keep track of the tender in front of me from any one or all of these three directions i may be assailed  ah there it comes the shack has ridden out the engine my first warning is when his feet strike the steps of the righthand side of the blind like a flash i am off the blind to the left and running ahead past the engine i lose myself in the darkness the situation is where it has been ever since the train left ottawa i am ahead and the train must come past me if it is to proceed on its journey i have as good a chance as ever for boarding her  i watch carefully i see a lantern come forward to the engine and i do not see it go back from the engine it must therefore be still on the engine and it is a fair assumption that attached to the handle of that lantern is a shack that shack was lazy or else he would have put out his lantern instead of trying to shield it as he came forward the train pulls out the first blind is empty and i gain it as before the train slackens the shack from the engine boards the blind from one side and i go off the other side and run forward  as i wait in the darkness i am conscious of a big thrill of pride the overland has stopped twice for mefor me a poor hobo on the bum i alone have twice stopped the overland with its many passengers and coaches its government mail and its two thousand steam horses straining in the engine and i weigh only one hundred and sixty pounds and i havent a fivecent piece in my pocket  again i see the lantern come forward to the engine but this time it comes conspicuously a bit too conspicuously to suit me and i wonder what is up at any rate i have something else to be afraid of than the shack on the engine the train pulls by just in time before i make my spring i see the dark form of a shack without a lantern on the first blind i let it go by and prepare to board the second blind but the shack on the first blind has jumped off and is at my heels also i have a fleeting glimpse of the lantern of the shack who rode out the engine he has jumped off and now both shacks are on the ground on the same side with me the next moment the second blind comes by and i am aboard it but i do not linger i have figured out my countermove as i dash across the platform i hear the impact of the shacks feet against the steps as he boards i jump off the other side and run forward with the train my plan is to run forward and get on the first blind it is nip and tuck for the train is gathering speed also the shack is behind me and running after me i guess i am the better sprinter for i make the first blind i stand on the steps and watch my pursuer he is only about ten feet back and running hard but now the train has approximated his own speed and relative to me he is standing still i encourage him hold out my hand to him but he explodes in a mighty oath gives up and makes the train several cars back  the train is speeding along and i am still chuckling to myself when without warning a spray of water strikes me the fireman is playing the hose on me from the engine i step forward from the carplatform to the rear of the tender where i am sheltered under the overhang the water flies harmlessly over my head my fingers itch to climb up on the tender and lam that fireman with a chunk of coal but i know if i do that ill be massacred by him and the engineer and i refrain  at the next stop i am off and ahead in the darkness this time when the train pulls out both shacks are on the first blind i divine their game they have blocked the repetition of my previous play i cannot again take the second blind cross over and run forward to the first as soon as the first blind passes and i do not get on they swing off one on each side of the train i board the second blind and as i do so i know that a moment later simultaneously those two shacks will arrive on both sides of me it is like a trap both ways are blocked yet there is another way out and that way is up  so i do not wait for my pursuers to arrive i climb upon the upright ironwork of the platform and stand upon the wheel of the handbrake this has taken up the moment of grace and i hear the shacks strike the steps on either side i dont stop to look i raise my arms overhead until my hands rest against the downcurving ends of the roofs of the two cars one hand of course is on the curved roof of one car the other hand on the curved roof of the other car by this time both shacks are coming up the steps i know it though i am too busy to see them all this is happening in the space of only several seconds i make a spring with my legs and muscle myself up with my arms as i draw up my legs both shacks reach for me and clutch empty air i know this for i look down and see them also i hear them swear  i am now in a precarious position riding the ends of the downcurving roofs of two cars at the same time with a quick tense movement i transfer both legs to the curve of one roof and both hands to the curve of the other roof then gripping the edge of that curving roof i climb over the curve to the level roof above where i sit down to catch my breath holding on the while to a ventilator that projects above the surface i am on top of the trainon the decks as the tramps call it and this process i have described is by them called decking her and let me say right here that only a young and vigorous tramp is able to deck a passenger train and also that the young and vigorous tramp must have his nerve with him as well  the train goes on gathering speed and i know i am safe until the next stopbut only until the next stop if i remain on the roof after the train stops i know those shacks will fusillade me with rocks a healthy shack can dewdrop a pretty heavy chunk of stone on top of a carsay anywhere from five to twenty pounds on the other hand the chances are large that at the next stop the shacks will be waiting for me to descend at the place i climbed up it is up to me to climb down at some other platform  registering a fervent hope that there are no tunnels in the next half mile i rise to my feet and walk down the train half a dozen cars and let me say that one must leave timidity behind him on such a passear the roofs of passenger coaches are not made for midnight promenades and if any one thinks they are let me advise him to try it just let him walk along the roof of a jolting lurching car with nothing to hold on to but the black and empty air and when he comes to the downcurving end of the roof all wet and slippery with dew let him accelerate his speed so as to step across to the next roof downcurving and wet and slippery believe me he will learn whether his heart is weak or his head is giddy  as the train slows down for a stop half a dozen platforms from where i had decked her i come down no one is on the platform when the train comes to a standstill i slip off to the ground ahead and between me and the engine are two moving lanterns the shacks are looking for me on the roofs of the cars i note that the car beside which i am standing is a fourwheelerby which is meant that it has only four wheels to each truck when you go underneath on the rods be sure to avoid the sixwheelersthey lead to disasters  i duck under the train and make for the rods and i can tell you i am mighty glad that the train is standing still it is the first time i have ever gone underneath on the canadian pacific and the internal arrangements are new to me i try to crawl over the top of the truck between the truck and the bottom of the car but the space is not large enough for me to squeeze through this is new to me down in the united states i am accustomed to going underneath on rapidly moving trains seizing a gunnel and swinging my feet under to the brakebeam and from there crawling over the top of the truck and down inside the truck to a seat on the crossrod  feeling with my hands in the darkness i learn that there is room between the brakebeam and the ground it is a tight squeeze i have to lie flat and worm my way through once inside the truck i take my seat on the rod and wonder what the shacks are thinking has become of me the train gets under way they have given me up at last  but have they at the very next stop i see a lantern thrust under the next truck to mine at the other end of the car they are searching the rods for me i must make my getaway pretty lively i crawl on my stomach under the brakebeam they see me and run for me but i crawl on hands and knees across the rail on the opposite side and gain my feet then away i go for the head of the train i run past the engine and hide in the sheltering darkness it is the same old situation i am ahead of the train and the train must go past me  the train pulls out there is a lantern on the first blind i lie low and see the peering shack go by but there is also a lantern on the second blind that shack spots me and calls to the shack who has gone past on the first blind both jump off never mind ill take the third blind and deck her but heavens there is a lantern on the third blind too it is the conductor i let it go by at any rate i have now the full traincrew in front of me i turn and run back in the opposite direction to what the train is going i look over my shoulder all three lanterns are on the ground and wobbling along in pursuit i sprint half the train has gone by and it is going quite fast when i spring aboard i know that the two shacks and the conductor will arrive like ravening wolves in about two seconds i spring upon the wheel of the handbrake get my hands on the curved ends of the roofs and muscle myself up to the decks while my disappointed pursuers clustering on the platform beneath like dogs that have treed a cat howl curses up at me and say unsocial things about my ancestors  but what does that matter it is five to one including the engineer and fireman and the majesty of the law and the might of a great corporation are behind them and i am beating them out i am too far down the train and i run ahead over the roofs of the coaches until i am over the fifth or sixth platform from the engine i peer down cautiously a shack is on that platform that he has caught sight of me i know from the way he makes a swift sneak inside the car and i know also that he is waiting inside the door all ready to pounce out on me when i climb down but i make believe that i dont know and i remain there to encourage him in his error i do not see him yet i know that he opens the door once and peeps up to assure himself that i am still there  the train slows down for a station i dangle my legs down in a tentative way the train stops my legs are still dangling i hear the door unlatch softly he is all ready for me suddenly i spring up and run forward over the roof this is right over his head where he lurks inside the door the train is standing still the night is quiet and i take care to make plenty of noise on the metal roof with my feet i dont know but my assumption is that he is now running forward to catch me as i descend at the next platform but i dont descend there halfway along the roof of the coach i turn retrace my way softly and quickly to the platform both the shack and i have just abandoned the coast is clear i descend to the ground on the offside of the train and hide in the darkness not a soul has seen me  i go over to the fence at the edge of the right of way and watch ah ha whats that i see a lantern on top of the train moving along from front to rear they think i havent come down and they are searching the roofs for me and better than thaton the ground on each side of the train moving abreast with the lantern on top are two other lanterns it is a rabbitdrive and i am the rabbit when the shack on top flushes me the ones on each side will nab me i roll a cigarette and watch the procession go by once past me i am safe to proceed to the front of the train she pulls out and i make the front blind without opposition but before she is fully under way and just as i am lighting my cigarette i am aware that the fireman has climbed over the coal to the back of the tender and is looking down at me i am filled with apprehension from his position he can mash me to a jelly with lumps of coal instead of which he addresses me and i note with relief the admiration in his voice  you sonofagun is what he says  it is a high compliment and i thrill as a schoolboy thrills on receiving a reward of merit  say i call up to him dont you play the hose on me any more  all right he answers and goes back to his work  i have made friends with the engine but the shacks are still looking for me at the next stop the shacks ride out all three blinds and as before i let them go by and deck in the middle of the train the crew is on its mettle by now and the train stops the shacks are going to ditch me or know the reason why three times the mighty overland stops for me at that station and each time i elude the shacks and make the decks but it is hopeless for they have finally come to an understanding of the situation i have taught them that they cannot guard the train from me they must do something else  and they do it when the train stops that last time they take after me hotfooted ah i see their game they are trying to run me down at first they herd me back toward the rear of the train i know my peril once to the rear of the train it will pull out with me left behind i double and twist and turn dodge through my pursuers and gain the front of the train one shack still hangs on after me all right ill give him the run of his life for my wind is good i run straight ahead along the track it doesnt matter if he chases me ten miles hell nevertheless have to catch the train and i can board her at any speed that he can  so i run on keeping just comfortably ahead of him and straining my eyes in the gloom for cattleguards and switches that may bring me to grief alas i strain my eyes too far ahead and trip over something just under my feet i know not what some little thing and go down to earth in a long stumbling fall the next moment i am on my feet but the shack has me by the collar i do not struggle i am busy with breathing deeply and with sizing him up he is narrowshouldered and i have at least thirty pounds the better of him in weight besides he is just as tired as i am and if he tries to slug me ill teach him a few things  but he doesnt try to slug me and that problem is settled instead he starts to lead me back toward the train and another possible problem arises i see the lanterns of the conductor and the other shack we are approaching them not for nothing have i made the acquaintance of the new york police not for nothing in boxcars by watertanks and in prisoncells have i listened to bloody tales of manhandling what if these three men are about to manhandle me heaven knows i have given them provocation enough i think quickly we are drawing nearer and nearer to the other two trainmen i line up the stomach and the jaw of my captor and plan the right and left ill give him at the first sign of trouble  pshaw i know another trick id like to work on him and i almost regret that i did not do it at the moment i was captured i could make him sick what of his clutch on my collar his fingers tightgripping are buried inside my collar my coat is tightly buttoned did you ever see a tourniquet well this is one all i have to do is to duck my head under his arm and begin to twist i must twist rapidlyvery rapidly i know how to do it twisting in a violent jerky way ducking my head under his arm with each revolution before he knows it those detaining fingers of his will be detained he will be unable to withdraw them it is a powerful leverage twenty seconds after i have started revolving the blood will be bursting out of his fingerends the delicate tendons will be rupturing and all the muscles and nerves will be mashing and crushing together in a shrieking mass try it sometime when somebody has you by the collar but be quickquick as lightning also be sure to hug yourself while you are revolvinghug your face with your left arm and your abdomen with your right you see the other fellow might try to stop you with a punch from his free arm it would be a good idea too to revolve away from that free arm rather than toward it a punch going is never so bad as a punch coming  that shack will never know how near he was to being made very very sick all that saves him is that it is not in their plan to manhandle me when we draw near enough he calls out that he has me and they signal the train to come on the engine passes us and the three blinds after that the conductor and the other shack swing aboard but still my captor holds on to me i see the plan he is going to hold me until the rear of the train goes by then he will hop on and i shall be left behindditched  but the train has pulled out fast the engineer trying to make up for lost time also it is a long train it is going very lively and i know the shack is measuring its speed with apprehension  think you can make it i query innocently  he releases my collar makes a quick run and swings aboard a number of coaches are yet to pass by he knows it and remains on the steps his head poked out and watching me in that moment my next move comes to me ill make the last platform i know shes going fast and faster but ill only get a roll in the dirt if i fail and the optimism of youth is mine i do not give myself away i stand with a dejected droop of shoulder advertising that i have abandoned hope but at the same time i am feeling with my feet the good gravel it is perfect footing also i am watching the pokedout head of the shack i see it withdrawn he is confident that the train is going too fast for me ever to make it  and the train is going fastfaster than any train i have ever tackled as the last coach comes by i sprint in the same direction with it it is a swift short sprint i cannot hope to equal the speed of the train but i can reduce the difference of our speed to the minimum and hence reduce the shock of impact when i leap on board in the fleeting instant of darkness i do not see the iron handrail of the last platform nor is there time for me to locate it i reach for where i think it ought to be and at the same instant my feet leave the ground it is all in the toss the next moment i may be rolling in the gravel with broken ribs or arms or head but my fingers grip the handhold there is a jerk on my arms that slightly pivots my body and my feet land on the steps with sharp violence  i sit down feeling very proud of myself in all my hoboing it is the best bit of trainjumping i have done i know that late at night one is always good for several stations on the last platform but i do not care to trust myself at the rear of the train at the first stop i run forward on the offside of the train pass the pullmans and duck under and take a rod under a daycoach at the next stop i run forward again and take another rod  i am now comparatively safe the shacks think i am ditched but the long day and the strenuous night are beginning to tell on me also it is not so windy nor cold underneath and i begin to doze this will never do sleep on the rods spells death so i crawl out at a station and go forward to the second blind here i can lie down and sleep and here i do sleephow long i do not knowfor i am awakened by a lantern thrust into my face the two shacks are staring at me i scramble up on the defensive wondering as to which one is going to make the first pass at me but slugging is far from their minds  i thought you was ditched says the shack who had held me by the collar  if you hadnt let go of me when you did youd have been ditched along with me i answer  hows that he asks  id have gone into a clinch with you thats all is my reply  they hold a consultation and their verdict is summed up in  well i guess you can ride bo theres no use trying to keep you off  and they go away and leave me in peace to the end of their division  i have given the foregoing as a sample of what holding her down means of course i have selected a fortunate night out of my experiences and said nothing of the nightsand many of themwhen i was tripped up by accident and ditched  in conclusion i want to tell of what happened when i reached the end of the division on singletrack transcontinental lines the freight trains wait at the divisions and follow out after the passenger trains when the division was reached i left my train and looked for the freight that would pull out behind it i found the freight made up on a sidetrack and waiting i climbed into a boxcar half full of coal and lay down in no time i was asleep  i was awakened by the sliding open of the door day was just dawning cold and gray and the freight had not yet started a con conductor was poking his head inside the door  get out of that you blanketyblankblank he roared at me  i got and outside i watched him go down the line inspecting every car in the train when he got out of sight i thought to myself that he would never think id have the nerve to climb back into the very car out of which he had fired me so back i climbed and lay down again  now that cons mental processes must have been paralleling mine for he reasoned that it was the very thing i would do for back he came and fired me out  now surely i reasoned he will never dream that id do it a third time back i went into the very same car but i decided to make sure only one sidedoor could be opened the other sidedoor was nailed up beginning at the top of the coal i dug a hole alongside of that door and lay down in it i heard the other door open the con climbed up and looked in over the top of the coal he couldnt see me he called to me to get out i tried to fool him by remaining quiet but when he began tossing chunks of coal into the hole on top of me i gave up and for the third time was fired out also he informed me in warm terms of what would happen to me if he caught me in there again  i changed my tactics when a man is paralleling your mental processes ditch him abruptly break off your line of reasoning and go off on a new line this i did i hid between some cars on an adjacent sidetrack and watched sure enough that con came back again to the car he opened the door he climbed up he called he threw coal into the hole i had made he even crawled over the coal and looked into the hole that satisfied him five minutes later the freight was pulling out and he was not in sight i ran alongside the car pulled the door open and climbed in he never looked for me again and i rode that coalcar precisely one thousand and twentytwo miles sleeping most of the time and getting out at divisions where the freights always stop for an hour or so to beg my food and at the end of the thousand and twentytwo miles i lost that car through a happy incident i got a setdown and the tramp doesnt live who wont miss a train for a setdown any time     pictures      what do it matter where or ow we die     so long as weve our ealth to watch it all                    sestina of the tramproyal   perhaps the greatest charm of tramplife is the absence of monotony in hobo land the face of life is proteanan ever changing phantasmagoria where the impossible happens and the unexpected jumps out of the bushes at every turn of the road the hobo never knows what is going to happen the next moment hence he lives only in the present moment he has learned the futility of telic endeavor and knows the delight of drifting along with the whimsicalities of chance  often i think over my tramp days and ever i marvel at the swift succession of pictures that flash up in my memory it matters not where i begin to think any day of all the days is a day apart with a record of swiftmoving pictures all its own for instance i remember a sunny summer morning in harrisburg pennsylvania and immediately comes to my mind the auspicious beginning of the daya setdown with two maiden ladies and not in their kitchen but in their dining room with them beside me at the table we ate eggs out of eggcups it was the first time i had ever seen eggcups or heard of eggcups i was a bit awkward at first ill confess but i was hungry and unabashed i mastered the eggcup and i mastered the eggs in a way that made those two maiden ladies sit up  why they ate like a couple of canaries dabbling with the one egg each they took and nibbling at tiny wafers of toast life was low in their bodies their blood ran thin and they had slept warm all night i had been out all night consuming much fuel of my body to keep warm beating my way down from a place called emporium in the northern part of the state wafers of toast out of sight but each wafer was no more than a mouthful to menay no more than a bite it is tedious to have to reach for another piece of toast each bite when one is potential with many bites  when i was a very little lad i had a very little dog called punch i saw to his feeding myself some one in the household had shot a lot of ducks and we had a fine meat dinner when i had finished i prepared punchs dinnera large plateful of bones and tidbits i went outside to give it to him now it happened that a visitor had ridden over from a neighboring ranch and with him had come a newfoundland dog as big as a calf i set the plate on the ground punch wagged his tail and began he had before him a blissful halfhour at least there was a sudden rush punch was brushed aside like a straw in the path of a cyclone and that newfoundland swooped down upon the plate in spite of his huge maw he must have been trained to quick lunches for in the fleeting instant before he received the kick in the ribs i aimed at him he completely engulfed the contents of the plate he swept it clean one last lingering lick of his tongue removed even the grease stains  as that big newfoundland behaved at the plate of my dog punch so behaved i at the table of those two maiden ladies of harrisburg i swept it bare i didnt break anything but i cleaned out the eggs and the toast and the coffee the servant brought more but i kept her busy and ever she brought more and more the coffee was delicious but it neednt have been served in such tiny cups what time had i to eat when it took all my time to prepare the many cups of coffee for drinking  at any rate it gave my tongue time to wag those two maiden ladies with their pinkandwhite complexions and gray curls had never looked upon the bright face of adventure as the tramproyal would have it they had worked all their lives on one same shift into the sweet scents and narrow confines of their uneventful existence i brought the large airs of the world freighted with the lusty smells of sweat and strife and with the tangs and odors of strange lands and soils and right well i scratched their soft palms with the callous on my own palmsthe halfinch horn that comes of pullandhaul of rope and long and arduous hours of caressing shovelhandles this i did not merely in the braggadocio of youth but to prove by toil performed the claim i had upon their charity  ah i can see them now those dear sweet ladies just as i sat at their breakfast table twelve years ago discoursing upon the way of my feet in the world brushing aside their kindly counsel as a real devilish fellow should and thrilling them not alone with my own adventures but with the adventures of all the other fellows with whom i had rubbed shoulders and exchanged confidences i appropriated them all the adventures of the other fellows i mean and if those maiden ladies had been less trustful and guileless they could have tangled me up beautifully in my chronology well well and what of it it was fair exchange for their many cups of coffee and eggs and bites of toast i gave full value right royally i gave them entertainment my coming to sit at their table was their adventure and adventure is beyond price anyway  coming along the street after parting from the maiden ladies i gathered in a newspaper from the doorway of some lateriser and in a grassy park lay down to get in touch with the last twentyfour hours of the world there in the park i met a fellowhobo who told me his lifestory and who wrestled with me to join the united states army he had given in to the recruiting officer and was just about to join and he couldnt see why i shouldnt join with him he had been a member of coxeys army in the march to washington several months before and that seemed to have given him a taste for army life i too was a veteran for had i not been a private in company l of the second division of kellys industrial armysaid company l being commonly known as the nevada push but my army experience had had the opposite effect on me so i left that hobo to go his way to the dogs of war while i threw my feet for dinner  this duty performed i started to walk across the bridge over the susquehanna to the west shore i forget the name of the railroad that ran down that side but while lying in the grass in the morning the idea had come to me to go to baltimore so to baltimore i was going on that railroad whatever its name was it was a warm afternoon and part way across the bridge i came to a lot of fellows who were in swimming off one of the piers off went my clothes and in went i the water was fine but when i came out and dressed i found i had been robbed some one had gone through my clothes now i leave it to you if being robbed isnt in itself adventure enough for one day i have known men who have been robbed and who have talked all the rest of their lives about it true the thief that went through my clothes didnt get muchsome thirty or forty cents in nickels and pennies and my tobacco and cigarette papers but it was all i had which is more than most men can be robbed of for they have something left at home while i had no home it was a pretty tough gang in swimming there i sized up and knew better than to squeal so i begged the makings and i could have sworn it was one of my own papers i rolled the tobacco in  then on across the bridge i hiked to the west shore here ran the railroad i was after no station was in sight how to catch a freight without walking to a station was the problem i noticed that the track came up a steep grade culminating at the point where i had tapped it and i knew that a heavy freight couldnt pull up there any too lively but how lively on the opposite side of the track rose a high bank on the edge at the top i saw a mans head sticking up from the grass perhaps he knew how fast the freights took the grade and when the next one went south i called out my questions to him and he motioned to me to come up  i obeyed and when i reached the top i found four other men lying in the grass with him i took in the scene and knew them for what they wereamerican gypsies in the open space that extended back among the trees from the edge of the bank were several nondescript wagons ragged halfnaked children swarmed over the camp though i noticed that they took care not to come near and bother the menfolk several lean unbeautiful and toildegraded women were pottering about with campchores and one i noticed who sat by herself on the seat of one of the wagons her head drooped forward her knees drawn up to her chin and clasped limply by her arms she did not look happy she looked as if she did not care for anythingin this i was wrong for later i was to learn that there was something for which she did care the full measure of human suffering was in her face and in addition there was the tragic expression of incapacity for further suffering nothing could hurt any more was what her face seemed to portray but in this too i was wrong  i lay in the grass on the edge of the steep and talked with the menfolk we were kinbrothers i was the american hobo and they were the american gypsy i knew enough of their argot for conversation and they knew enough of mine there were two more in their gang who were across the river mushing in harrisburg a musher is an itinerant fakir this word is not to be confounded with the klondike musher though the origin of both terms may be the same namely the corruption of the french marche ons to march to walk to mush the particular graft of the two mushers who had crossed the river was umbrellamending but what real graft lay behind their umbrellamending i was not told nor would it have been polite to ask  it was a glorious day not a breath of wind was stirring and we basked in the shimmering warmth of the sun from everywhere arose the drowsy hum of insects and the balmy air was filled with scents of the sweet earth and the green growing things we were too lazy to do more than mumble on in intermittent conversation and then all abruptly the peace and quietude was jarred awry by man  two barelegged boys of eight or nine in some minor way broke some rule of the campwhat it was i did not know and a man who lay beside me suddenly sat up and called to them he was chief of the tribe a man with narrow forehead and narrowslitted eyes whose thin lips and twisted sardonic features explained why the two boys jumped and tensed like startled deer at the sound of his voice the alertness of fear was in their faces and they turned in a panic to run he called to them to come back and one boy lagged behind reluctantly his meagre little frame portraying in pantomime the struggle within him between fear and reason he wanted to come back his intelligence and past experience told him that to come back was a lesser evil than to run on but lesser evil that it was it was great enough to put wings to his fear and urge his feet to flight  still he lagged and struggled until he reached the shelter of the trees where he halted the chief of the tribe did not pursue he sauntered over to a wagon and picked up a heavy whip then he came back to the centre of the open space and stood still he did not speak he made no gestures he was the law pitiless and omnipotent he merely stood there and waited and i knew and all knew and the two boys in the shelter of the trees knew for what he waited  the boy who had lagged slowly came back his face was stamped with quivering resolution he did not falter he had made up his mind to take his punishment and mark you the punishment was not for the original offence but for the offence of running away and in this that tribal chieftain but behaved as behaves the exalted society in which he lived we punish our criminals and when they escape and run away we bring them back and add to their punishment  straight up to the chief the boy came halting at the proper distance for the swing of the lash the whip hissed through the air and i caught myself with a start of surprise at the weight of the blow the thin little leg was so very thin and little the flesh showed white where the lash had curled and bitten and then where the white had shown sprang up the savage welt with here and there along its length little scarlet oozings where the skin had broken again the whip swung and the boys whole body winced in anticipation of the blow though he did not move from the spot his will held good a second welt sprang up and a third it was not until the fourth landed that the boy screamed also he could no longer stand still and from then on blow after blow he danced up and down in his anguish screaming but he did not attempt to run away if his involuntary dancing took him beyond the reach of the whip he danced back into range again and when it was all overa dozen blowshe went away whimpering and squealing among the wagons  the chief stood still and waited the second boy came out from the trees but he did not come straight he came like a cringing dog obsessed by little panics that made him turn and dart away for half a dozen steps but always he turned and came back circling nearer and nearer to the man whimpering making inarticulate animalnoises in his throat i saw that he never looked at the man his eyes always were fixed upon the whip and in his eyes was a terror that made me sickthe frantic terror of an inconceivably maltreated child i have seen strong men dropping right and left out of battle and squirming in their deaththroes i have seen them by scores blown into the air by bursting shells and their bodies torn asunder believe me the witnessing was as merrymaking and laughter and song to me in comparison with the way the sight of that poor child affected me  the whipping began the whipping of the first boy was as play compared with this one in no time the blood was running down his thin little legs he danced and squirmed and doubled up till it seemed almost that he was some grotesque marionette operated by strings i say seemed for his screaming gave the lie to the seeming and stamped it with reality his shrieks were shrill and piercing within them no hoarse notes but only the thin sexlessness of the voice of a child the time came when the boy could stand it no more reason fled and he tried to run away but now the man followed up curbing his flight herding him with blows back always into the open space  then came interruption i heard a wild smothered cry the woman who sat in the wagon seat had got out and was running to interfere she sprang between the man and boy  you want some eh said he with the whip all right then  he swung the whip upon her her skirts were long so he did not try for her legs he drove the lash for her face which she shielded as best she could with her hands and forearms drooping her head forward between her lean shoulders and on the lean shoulders and arms receiving the blows heroic mother she knew just what she was doing the boy still shrieking was making his getaway to the wagons  and all the while the four men lay beside me and watched and made no move nor did i move and without shame i say it though my reason was compelled to struggle hard against my natural impulse to rise up and interfere i knew life of what use to the woman or to me would be my being beaten to death by five men there on the bank of the susquehanna i once saw a man hanged and though my whole soul cried protest my mouth cried not had it cried i should most likely have had my skull crushed by the butt of a revolver for it was the law that the man should hang and here in this gypsy group it was the law that the woman should be whipped  even so the reason in both cases that i did not interfere was not that it was the law but that the law was stronger than i had it not been for those four men beside me in the grass right gladly would i have waded into the man with the whip and barring the accident of the landing on me with a knife or a club in the hands of some of the various women of the camp i am confident that i should have beaten him into a mess but the four men were beside me in the grass they made their law stronger than i  oh believe me i did my own suffering i had seen women beaten before often but never had i seen such a beating as this her dress across the shoulders was cut into shreds one blow that had passed her guard had raised a bloody welt from cheek to chin not one blow nor two not one dozen nor two dozen but endlessly infinitely that whiplash smote and curled about her the sweat poured from me and i breathed hard clutching at the grass with my hands until i strained it out by the roots and all the time my reason kept whispering fool fool that welt on the face nearly did for me i started to rise to my feet but the hand of the man next to me went out to my shoulder and pressed me down  easy pardner easy he warned me in a low voice i looked at him his eyes met mine unwaveringly he was a large man broadshouldered and heavymuscled and his face was lazy phlegmatic slothful withal kindly yet without passion and quite soullessa dim soul unmalicious unmoral bovine and stubborn just an animal he was with no more than a faint flickering of intelligence a goodnatured brute with the strength and mental caliber of a gorilla his hand pressed heavily upon me and i knew the weight of the muscles behind i looked at the other brutes two of them unperturbed and incurious and one of them that gloated over the spectacle and my reason came back to me my muscles relaxed and i sank down in the grass  my mind went back to the two maiden ladies with whom i had had breakfast that morning less than two miles as the crow flies separated them from this scene here in the windless day under a beneficent sun was a sister of theirs being beaten by a brother of mine here was a page of life they could never seeand better so though for lack of seeing they would never be able to understand their sisterhood nor themselves nor know the clay of which they were made for it is not given to woman to live in sweetscented narrow rooms and at the same time be a little sister to all the world  the whipping was finished and the woman no longer screaming went back to her seat in the wagon nor did the other women come to herjust then they were afraid but they came afterward when a decent interval had elapsed the man put the whip away and rejoined us flinging himself down on the other side of me he was breathing hard from his exertions he wiped the sweat from his eyes on his coatsleeve and looked challengingly at me i returned his look carelessly what he had done was no concern of mine i did not go away abruptly i lay there half an hour longer which under the circumstances was tact and etiquette i rolled cigarettes from tobacco i borrowed from them and when i slipped down the bank to the railroad i was equipped with the necessary information for catching the next freight bound south  well and what of it it was a page out of life thats all and there are many pages worse far worse that i have seen i have sometimes held forth facetiously so my listeners believed that the chief distinguishing trait between man and the other animals is that man is the only animal that maltreats the females of his kind it is something of which no wolf nor cowardly coyote is ever guilty it is something that even the dog degenerated by domestication will not do the dog still retains the wild instinct in this matter while man has lost most of his wild instinctsat least most of the good ones  worse pages of life than what i have described read the reports on child labor in the united stateseast west north and south it doesnt matter whereand know that all of us profitmongers that we are are typesetters and printers of worse pages of life than that mere page of wifebeating on the susquehanna  i went down the grade a hundred yards to where the footing beside the track was good here i could catch my freight as it pulled slowly up the hill and here i found half a dozen hoboes waiting for the same purpose several were playing sevenup with an old pack of cards i took a hand a coon began to shuffle the deck he was fat and young and moonfaced he beamed with goodnature it fairly oozed from him as he dealt the first card to me he paused and said  say bo aint i done seen you befo  you sure have i answered an you didnt have those same duds on either  he was puzzled  dye remember buffalo i queried  then he knew me and with laughter and ejaculation hailed me as a comrade for at buffalo his clothes had been striped while he did his bit of time in the erie county penitentiary for that matter my clothes had been likewise striped for i had been doing my bit of time too  the game proceeded and i learned the stake for which we played down the bank toward the river descended a steep and narrow path that led to a spring some twentyfive feet beneath we played on the edge of the bank the man who was stuck had to take a small condensedmilk can and with it carry water to the winners  the first game was played and the coon was stuck he took the small milktin and climbed down the bank while we sat above and guyed him we drank like fish four round trips he had to make for me alone and the others were equally lavish with their thirst the path was very steep and sometimes the coon slipped when part way up spilled the water and had to go back for more but he didnt get angry he laughed as heartily as any of us that was why he slipped so often also he assured us of the prodigious quantities of water he would drink when some one else got stuck  when our thirst was quenched another game was started again the coon was stuck and again we drank our fill a third game and a fourth ended the same way and each time that moonfaced darky nearly died with delight at appreciation of the fate that chance was dealing out to him and we nearly died with him what of our delight we laughed like careless children or gods there on the edge of the bank i know that i laughed till it seemed the top of my head would come off and i drank from the milktin till i was nigh waterlogged serious discussion arose as to whether we could successfully board the freight when it pulled up the grade what of the weight of water secreted on our persons this particular phase of the situation just about finished the coon he had to break off from watercarrying for at least five minutes while he lay down and rolled with laughter  the lengthening shadows stretched farther and farther across the river and the soft cool twilight came on and ever we drank water and ever our ebony cupbearer brought more and more forgotten was the beaten woman of the hour before that was a page read and turned over i was busy now with this new page and when the engine whistled on the grade this page would be finished and another begun and so the book of life goes on page after page and pages without endwhen one is young  and then we played a game in which the coon failed to be stuck the victim was a lean and dyspepticlooking hobo the one who had laughed least of all of us we said we didnt want any waterwhich was the truth not the wealth of ormuz and of ind nor the pressure of a pneumatic ram could have forced another drop into my saturated carcass the coon looked disappointed then rose to the occasion and guessed hed have some he meant it too he had some and then some and then some ever the melancholy hobo climbed down and up the steep bank and ever the coon called for more he drank more water than all the rest of us put together the twilight deepened into night the stars came out and he still drank on i do believe that if the whistle of the freight hadnt sounded hed be there yet swilling water and revenge while the melancholy hobo toiled down and up  but the whistle sounded the page was done we sprang to our feet and strung out alongside the track there she came coughing and spluttering up the grade the headlight turning night into day and silhouetting us in sharp relief the engine passed us and we were all running with the train some boarding on the sideladders others springing the sidedoors of empty boxcars and climbing in i caught a flatcar loaded with mixed lumber and crawled away into a comfortable nook i lay on my back with a newspaper under my head for a pillow above me the stars were winking and wheeling in squadrons back and forth as the train rounded the curves and watching them i fell asleep the day was doneone day of all my days tomorrow would be another day and i was young     pinched   i rode into niagara falls in a sidedoor pullman or in common parlance a boxcar a flatcar by the way is known amongst the fraternity as a gondola with the second syllable emphasized and pronounced long but to return i arrived in the afternoon and headed straight from the freight train to the falls once my eyes were filled with that wondervision of downrushing water i was lost i could not tear myself away long enough to batter the privates domiciles for my supper even a setdown could not have lured me away night came on a beautiful night of moonlight and i lingered by the falls until after eleven then it was up to me to hunt for a place to kip  kip doss flop pound your ear all mean the same thing namely to sleep somehow i had a hunch that niagara falls was a bad town for hoboes and i headed out into the country i climbed a fence and flopped in a field john law would never find me there i flattered myself i lay on my back in the grass and slept like a babe it was so balmy warm that i woke up not once all night but with the first gray daylight my eyes opened and i remembered the wonderful falls i climbed the fence and started down the road to have another look at them it was earlynot more than five oclockand not until eight oclock could i begin to batter for my breakfast i could spend at least three hours by the river alas i was fated never to see the river nor the falls again  the town was asleep when i entered it as i came along the quiet street i saw three men coming toward me along the sidewalk they were walking abreast hoboes i decided like myself who had got up early in this surmise i was not quite correct i was only sixtysix and twothirds per cent correct the men on each side were hoboes all right but the man in the middle wasnt i directed my steps to the edge of the sidewalk in order to let the trio go by but it didnt go by at some word from the man in the centre all three halted and he of the centre addressed me  i piped the lay on the instant he was a flycop and the two hoboes were his prisoners john law was up and out after the early worm i was a worm had i been richer by the experiences that were to befall me in the next several months i should have turned and run like the very devil he might have shot at me but hed have had to hit me to get me hed have never run after me for two hoboes in the hand are worth more than one on the getaway but like a dummy i stood still when he halted me our conversation was brief  what hotel are you stopping at he queried  he had me i wasnt stopping at any hotel and since i did not know the name of a hotel in the place i could not claim residence in any of them also i was up too early in the morning everything was against me  i just arrived i said  well you turn around and walk in front of me and not too far in front theres somebody wants to see you  i was pinched i knew who wanted to see me with that flycop and the two hoboes at my heels and under the direction of the former i led the way to the city jail there we were searched and our names registered i have forgotten now under which name i was registered i gave the name of jack drake but when they searched me they found letters addressed to jack london this caused trouble and required explanation all of which has passed from my mind and to this day i do not know whether i was pinched as jack drake or jack london but one or the other it should be there today in the prison register of niagara falls reference can bring it to light the time was somewhere in the latter part of june 1894 it was only a few days after my arrest that the great railroad strike began  from the office we were led to the hobo and locked in the hobo is that part of a prison where the minor offenders are confined together in a large iron cage since hoboes constitute the principal division of the minor offenders the aforesaid iron cage is called the hobo here we met several hoboes who had already been pinched that morning and every little while the door was unlocked and two or three more were thrust in on us at last when we totalled sixteen we were led upstairs into the courtroom and now i shall faithfully describe what took place in that courtroom for know that my patriotic american citizenship there received a shock from which it has never fully recovered  in the courtroom were the sixteen prisoners the judge and two bailiffs the judge seemed to act as his own clerk there were no witnesses there were no citizens of niagara falls present to look on and see how justice was administered in their community the judge glanced at the list of cases before him and called out a name a hobo stood up the judge glanced at a bailiff vagrancy your honor said the bailiff thirty days said his honor the hobo sat down and the judge was calling another name and another hobo was rising to his feet  the trial of that hobo had taken just about fifteen seconds the trial of the next hobo came off with equal celerity the bailiff said vagrancy your honor and his honor said thirty days thus it went like clockwork fifteen seconds to a hoboand thirty days  they are poor dumb cattle i thought to myself but wait till my turn comes ill give his honor a spiel part way along in the performance his honor moved by some whim gave one of us an opportunity to speak as chance would have it this man was not a genuine hobo he bore none of the earmarks of the professional stiff had he approached the rest of us while waiting at a watertank for a freight should have unhesitatingly classified him as a gaycat gaycat is the synonym for tenderfoot in hobo land this gaycat was well along in yearssomewhere around fortyfive i should judge his shoulders were humped a trifle and his face was seamed by weatherbeat  for many years according to his story he had driven team for some firm in if i remember rightly lockport new york the firm had ceased to prosper and finally in the hard times of 1893 had gone out of business he had been kept on to the last though toward the last his work had been very irregular he went on and explained at length his difficulties in getting work when so many were out of work during the succeeding months in the end deciding that he would find better opportunities for work on the lakes he had started for buffalo of course he was broke and there he was that was all  thirty days said his honor and called another hobos name  said hobo got up vagrancy your honor said the bailiff and his honor said thirty days  and so it went fifteen seconds and thirty days to each hobo the machine of justice was grinding smoothly most likely considering how early it was in the morning his honor had not yet had his breakfast and was in a hurry  but my american blood was up behind me were the many generations of my american ancestry one of the kinds of liberty those ancestors of mine had fought and died for was the right of trial by jury this was my heritage stained sacred by their blood and it devolved upon me to stand up for it all right i threatened to myself just wait till he gets to me  he got to me my name whatever it was was called and i stood up the bailiff said vagrancy your honor and i began to talk but the judge began talking at the same time and he said thirty days i started to protest but at that moment his honor was calling the name of the next hobo on the list his honor paused long enough to say to me shut up the bailiff forced me to sit down and the next moment that next hobo had received thirty days and the succeeding hobo was just in process of getting his  when we had all been disposed of thirty days to each stiff his honor just as he was about to dismiss us suddenly turned to the teamster from lockportthe one man he had allowed to talk  why did you quit your job his honor asked  now the teamster had already explained how his job had quit him and the question took him aback  your honor he began confusedly isnt that a funny question to ask  thirty days more for quitting your job said his honor and the court was closed that was the outcome the teamster got sixty days all together while the rest of us got thirty days  we were taken down below locked up and given breakfast it was a pretty good breakfast as prison breakfasts go and it was the best i was to get for a month to come  as for me i was dazed here was i under sentence after a farce of a trial wherein i was denied not only my right of trial by jury but my right to plead guilty or not guilty another thing my fathers had fought for flashed through my brainhabeas corpus id show them but when i asked for a lawyer i was laughed at habeas corpus was all right but of what good was it to me when i could communicate with no one outside the jail but id show them they couldnt keep me in jail forever just wait till i got out that was all id make them sit up i knew something about the law and my own rights and id expose their maladministration of justice visions of damage suits and sensational newspaper headlines were dancing before my eyes when the jailers came in and began hustling us out into the main office  a policeman snapped a handcuff on my right wrist ah ha thought i a new indignity just wait till i get out on the left wrist of a negro he snapped the other handcuff of that pair he was a very tall negro well past six feetso tall was he that when we stood side by side his hand lifted mine up a trifle in the manacles also he was the happiest and the raggedest negro i have ever seen  we were all handcuffed similarly in pairs this accomplished a bright nickelsteel chain was brought forth run down through the links of all the handcuffs and locked at front and rear of the doubleline we were now a chaingang the command to march was given and out we went upon the street guarded by two officers the tall negro and i had the place of honor we led the procession  after the tomblike gloom of the jail the outside sunshine was dazzling i had never known it to be so sweet as now a prisoner with clanking chains i knew that i was soon to see the last of it for thirty days down through the streets of niagara falls we marched to the railroad station stared at by curious passersby and especially by a group of tourists on the veranda of a hotel that we marched past  there was plenty of slack in the chain and with much rattling and clanking we sat down two and two in the seats of the smokingcar afire with indignation as i was at the outrage that had been perpetrated on me and my forefathers i was nevertheless too prosaically practical to lose my head over it this was all new to me thirty days of mystery were before me and i looked about me to find somebody who knew the ropes for i had already learned that i was not bound for a petty jail with a hundred or so prisoners in it but for a fullgrown penitentiary with a couple of thousand prisoners in it doing anywhere from ten days to ten years  in the seat behind me attached to the chain by his wrist was a squat heavilybuilt powerfullymuscled man he was somewhere between thirtyfive and forty years of age i sized him up in the corners of his eyes i saw humor and laughter and kindliness as for the rest of him he was a brutebeast wholly unmoral and with all the passion and turgid violence of the brutebeast what saved him what made him possible for me were those corners of his eyesthe humor and laughter and kindliness of the beast when unaroused  he was my meat i cottoned to him while my cuffmate the tall negro mourned with chucklings and laughter over some laundry he was sure to lose through his arrest and while the train rolled on toward buffalo i talked with the man in the seat behind me he had an empty pipe i filled it for him with my precious tobaccoenough in a single filling to make a dozen cigarettes nay the more we talked the surer i was that he was my meat and i divided all my tobacco with him  now it happens that i am a fluid sort of an organism with sufficient kinship with life to fit myself in most anywhere i laid myself out to fit in with that man though little did i dream to what extraordinary good purpose i was succeeding he had never been in the particular penitentiary to which we were going but he had done one two and fivespots in various other penitentiaries a spot is a year and he was filled with wisdom we became pretty chummy and my heart bounded when he cautioned me to follow his lead he called me jack and i called him jack  the train stopped at a station about five miles from buffalo and we the chaingang got off i do not remember the name of this station but i am confident that it is some one of the following rocklyn rockwood black rock rockcastle or newcastle but whatever the name of the place we were walked a short distance and then put on a streetcar it was an oldfashioned car with a seat running the full length on each side all the passengers who sat on one side were asked to move over to the other side and we with a great clanking of chain took their places we sat facing them i remember and i remember too the awed expression on the faces of the women who took us undoubtedly for convicted murderers and bankrobbers i tried to look my fiercest but that cuffmate of mine the too happy negro insisted on rolling his eyes laughing and reiterating o lawdy lawdy  we left the car walked some more and were led into the office of the erie county penitentiary here we were to register and on that register one or the other of my names will be found also we were informed that we must leave in the office all our valuables money tobacco matches pocketknives and so forth  my new pal shook his head at me  if you do not leave your things here they will be confiscated inside warned the official  still my pal shook his head he was busy with his hands hiding his movements behind the other fellows our handcuffs had been removed i watched him and followed suit wrapping up in a bundle in my handkerchief all the things i wanted to take in these bundles the two of us thrust into our shirts i noticed that our fellowprisoners with the exception of one or two who had watches did not turn over their belongings to the man in the office they were determined to smuggle them in somehow trusting to luck but they were not so wise as my pal for they did not wrap their things in bundles  our erstwhile guardians gathered up the handcuffs and chain and departed for niagara falls while we under new guardians were led away into the prison while we were in the office our number had been added to by other squads of newly arrived prisoners so that we were now a procession forty or fifty strong  know ye unimprisoned that traffic is as restricted inside a large prison as commerce was in the middle ages once inside a penitentiary one cannot move about at will every few steps are encountered great steel doors or gates which are always kept locked we were bound for the barbershop but we encountered delays in the unlocking of doors for us we were thus delayed in the first hall we entered a hall is not a corridor imagine an oblong cube built out of bricks and rising six stories high each story a row of cells say fifty cells in a rowin short imagine a cube of colossal honeycomb place this cube on the ground and enclose it in a building with a roof overhead and walls all around such a cube and encompassing building constitute a hall in the erie county penitentiary also to complete the picture see a narrow gallery with steel railing running the full length of each tier of cells and at the ends of the oblong cube see all these galleries from both sides connected by a fireescape system of narrow steel stairways  we were halted in the first hall waiting for some guard to unlock a door here and there moving about were convicts with closecropped heads and shaven faces and garbed in prison stripes one such convict i noticed above us on the gallery of the third tier of cells he was standing on the gallery and leaning forward his arms resting on the railing himself apparently oblivious of our presence he seemed staring into vacancy my pal made a slight hissing noise the convict glanced down motioned signals passed between them then through the air soared the handkerchief bundle of my pal the convict caught it and like a flash it was out of sight in his shirt and he was staring into vacancy my pal had told me to follow his lead i watched my chance when the guards back was turned and my bundle followed the other one into the shirt of the convict  a minute later the door was unlocked and we filed into the barbershop here were more men in convict stripes they were the prison barbers also there were bathtubs hot water soap and scrubbingbrushes we were ordered to strip and bathe each man to scrub his neighbors backa needless precaution this compulsory bath for the prison swarmed with vermin after the bath we were each given a canvas clothesbag  put all your clothes in the bags said the guard its no good trying to smuggle anything in youve got to line up naked for inspection men for thirty days or less keep their shoes and suspenders men for more than thirty days keep nothing  this announcement was received with consternation how could naked men smuggle anything past an inspection only my pal and i were safe but it was right here that the convict barbers got in their work they passed among the poor newcomers kindly volunteering to take charge of their precious little belongings and promising to return them later in the day those barbers were philanthropiststo hear them talk as in the case of fra lippo lippi never was there such prompt disemburdening matches tobacco ricepaper pipes knives money everything flowed into the capacious shirts of the barbers they fairly bulged with the spoil and the guards made believe not to see to cut the story short nothing was ever returned the barbers never had any intention of returning what they had taken they considered it legitimately theirs it was the barbershop graft there were many grafts in that prison as i was to learn and i too was destined to become a grafterthanks to my new pal  there were several chairs and the barbers worked rapidly the quickest shaves and haircuts i have ever seen were given in that shop the men lathered themselves and the barbers shaved them at the rate of a minute to a man a haircut took a trifle longer in three minutes the down of eighteen was scraped from my face and my head was as smooth as a billiardball just sprouting a crop of bristles beards mustaches like our clothes and everything came off take my word for it we were a villainouslooking gang when they got through with us i had not realized before how really altogether bad we were  then came the lineup forty or fifty of us naked as kiplings heroes who stormed lungtungpen to search us was easy there were only our shoes and ourselves two or three rash spirits who had doubted the barbers had the goods found on themwhich goods namely tobacco pipes matches and small change were quickly confiscated this over our new clothes were brought to usstout prison shirts and coats and trousers conspicuously striped i had always lingered under the impression that the convict stripes were put on a man only after he had been convicted of a felony i lingered no longer but put on the insignia of shame and got my first taste of marching the lockstep  in single file close together each mans hands on the shoulders of the man in front we marched on into another large hall here we were ranged up against the wall in a long line and ordered to strip our left arms a youth a medical student who was getting in his practice on cattle such as we came down the line he vaccinated just about four times as rapidly as the barbers shaved with a final caution to avoid rubbing our arms against anything and to let the blood dry so as to form the scab we were led away to our cells here my pal and i parted but not before he had time to whisper to me suck it out  as soon as i was locked in i sucked my arm clean and afterward i saw men who had not sucked and who had horrible holes in their arms into which i could have thrust my fist it was their own fault they could have sucked  in my cell was another man we were to be cellmates he was a young manly fellow not talkative but very capable indeed as splendid a fellow as one could meet with in a days ride and this in spite of the fact that he had just recently finished a twoyear term in some ohio penitentiary  hardly had we been in our cell half an hour when a convict sauntered down the gallery and looked in it was my pal he had the freedom of the hall he explained he was unlocked at six in the morning and not locked up again till nine at night he was in with the push in that hall and had been promptly appointed a trusty of the kind technically known as hallman the man who had appointed him was also a prisoner and a trusty and was known as first hallman there were thirteen hallmen in that hall ten of them had charge each of a gallery of cells and over them were the first second and third hallmen  we newcomers were to stay in our cells for the rest of the day my pal informed me so that the vaccine would have a chance to take then next morning we would be put to hard labor in the prisonyard  but ill get you out of the work as soon as i can he promised ill get one of the hallmen fired and have you put in his place  he put his hand into his shirt drew out the handkerchief containing my precious belongings passed it in to me through the bars and went on down the gallery  i opened the bundle everything was there not even a match was missing i shared the makings of a cigarette with my cellmate when i started to strike a match for a light he stopped me a flimsy dirty comforter lay in each of our bunks for bedding he tore off a narrow strip of the thin cloth and rolled it tightly and telescopically into a long and slender cylinder this he lighted with a precious match the cylinder of tightrolled cotton cloth did not flame on the end a coal of fire slowly smouldered it would last for hours and my cellmate called it a punk and when it burned short all that was necessary was to make a new punk put the end of it against the old blow on them and so transfer the glowing coal why we could have given prometheus pointers on the conserving of fire  at twelve oclock dinner was served at the bottom of our cage door was a small opening like the entrance of a runway in a chickenyard through this were thrust two hunks of dry bread and two pannikins of soup a portion of soup consisted of about a quart of hot water with floating on its surface a lonely drop of grease also there was some salt in that water  we drank the soup but we did not eat the bread not that we were not hungry and not that the bread was uneatable it was fairly good bread but we had reasons my cellmate had discovered that our cell was alive with bedbugs in all the cracks and interstices between the bricks where the mortar had fallen out flourished great colonies the natives even ventured out in the broad daylight and swarmed over the walls and ceiling by hundreds my cellmate was wise in the ways of the beasts like childe roland dauntless the slughorn to his lips he bore never was there such a battle it lasted for hours it was shambles and when the last survivors fled to their brickandmortar fastnesses our work was only half done we chewed mouthfuls of our bread until it was reduced to the consistency of putty when a fleeing belligerent escaped into a crevice between the bricks we promptly walled him in with a daub of the chewed bread we toiled on until the light grew dim and until every hole nook and cranny was closed i shudder to think of the tragedies of starvation and cannibalism that must have ensued behind those breadplastered ramparts  we threw ourselves on our bunks tired out and hungry to wait for supper it was a good days work well done in the weeks to come we at least should not suffer from the hosts of vermin we had foregone our dinner saved our hides at the expense of our stomachs but we were content alas for the futility of human effort scarcely was our long task completed when a guard unlocked our door a redistribution of prisoners was being made and we were taken to another cell and locked in two galleries higher up  early next morning our cells were unlocked and down in the hall the several hundred prisoners of us formed the lockstep and marched out into the prisonyard to go to work the erie canal runs right by the back yard of the erie county penitentiary our task was to unload canalboats carrying huge staybolts on our shoulders like railroad ties into the prison as i worked i sized up the situation and studied the chances for a getaway there wasnt the ghost of a show along the tops of the walls marched guards armed with repeating rifles and i was told furthermore that there were machineguns in the sentrytowers  i did not worry thirty days were not so long id stay those thirty days and add to the store of material i intended to use when i got out against the harpies of justice id show what an american boy could do when his rights and privileges had been trampled on the way mine had i had been denied my right of trial by jury i had been denied my right to plead guilty or not guilty i had been denied a trial even for i couldnt consider that what i had received at niagara falls was a trial i had not been allowed to communicate with a lawyer nor any one and hence had been denied my right of suing for a writ of habeas corpus my face had been shaved my hair cropped close convict stripes had been put upon my body i was forced to toil hard on a diet of bread and water and to march the shameful lockstep with armed guards over meand all for what what had i done what crime had i committed against the good citizens of niagara falls that all this vengeance should be wreaked upon me i had not even violated their sleepingout ordinance i had slept outside their jurisdiction in the country that night i had not even begged for a meal or battered for a light piece on their streets all that i had done was to walk along their sidewalk and gaze at their picayune waterfall and what crime was there in that technically i was guilty of no misdemeanor all right id show them when i got out  the next day i talked with a guard i wanted to send for a lawyer the guard laughed at me so did the other guards i really was incommunicado so far as the outside world was concerned i tried to write a letter out but i learned that all letters were read and censured or confiscated by the prison authorities and that shorttimers were not allowed to write letters anyway a little later i tried smuggling letters out by men who were released but i learned that they were searched and the letters found and destroyed never mind it all helped to make it a blacker case when i did get out  but as the prison days went by which i shall describe in the next chapter i learned a few i heard tales of the police and policecourts and lawyers that were unbelievable and monstrous men prisoners told me of personal experiences with the police of great cities that were awful and more awful were the hearsay tales they told me concerning men who had died at the hands of the police and who therefore could not testify for themselves years afterward in the report of the lexow committee i was to read tales true and more awful than those told to me but in the meantime during the first days of my imprisonment i scoffed at what i heard  as the days went by however i began to grow convinced i saw with my own eyes there in that prison things unbelievable and monstrous and the more convinced i became the profounder grew the respect in me for the sleuthhounds of the law and for the whole institution of criminal justice  my indignation ebbed away and into my being rushed the tides of fear i saw at last cleareyed what i was up against i grew meek and lowly each day i resolved more emphatically to make no rumpus when i got out all i asked when i got out was a chance to fade away from the landscape and that was just what i did do when i was released i kept my tongue between my teeth walked softly and sneaked for pennsylvania a wiser and a humbler man     the pen   for two days i toiled in the prisonyard it was heavy work and in spite of the fact that i malingered at every opportunity i was played out this was because of the food no man could work hard on such food bread and water that was all that was given us once a week we were supposed to get meat but this meat did not always go around and since all nutriment had first been boiled out of it in the making of soup it didnt matter whether one got a taste of it once a week or not  furthermore there was one vital defect in the breadandwater diet while we got plenty of water we did not get enough of the bread a ration of bread was about the size of ones two fists and three rations a day were given to each prisoner there was one good thing i must say about the waterit was hot in the morning it was called coffee at noon it was dignified as soup and at night it masqueraded as tea but it was the same old water all the time the prisoners called it water bewitched in the morning it was black water the color being due to boiling it with burnt breadcrusts at noon it was served minus the color with salt and a drop of grease added at night it was served with a purplishauburn hue that defied all speculation it was darn poor tea but it was dandy hot water  we were a hungry lot in the erie county pen only the longtimers knew what it was to have enough to eat the reason for this was that they would have died after a time on the fare we shorttimers received i know that the longtimers got more substantial grub because there was a whole row of them on the ground floor in our hall and when i was a trusty i used to steal from their grub while serving them man cannot live on bread alone and not enough of it  my pal delivered the goods after two days of work in the yard i was taken out of my cell and made a trusty a hallman at morning and night we served the bread to the prisoners in their cells but at twelve oclock a different method was used the convicts marched in from work in a long line as they entered the door of our hall they broke the lockstep and took their hands down from the shoulders of their linemates just inside the door were piled trays of bread and here also stood the first hallman and two ordinary hallmen i was one of the two our task was to hold the trays of bread as the line of convicts filed past as soon as the tray say that i was holding was emptied the other hallman took my place with a full tray and when his was emptied i took his place with a full tray thus the line tramped steadily by each man reaching with his right hand and taking one ration of bread from the extended tray  the task of the first hallman was different he used a club he stood beside the tray and watched the hungry wretches could never get over the delusion that sometime they could manage to get two rations of bread out of the tray but in my experience that sometime never came the club of the first hallman had a way of flashing outquick as the stroke of a tigers clawto the hand that dared ambitiously the first hallman was a good judge of distance and he had smashed so many hands with that club that he had become infallible he never missed and he usually punished the offending convict by taking his one ration away from him and sending him to his cell to make his meal off of hot water  and at times while all these men lay hungry in their cells i have seen a hundred or so extra rations of bread hidden away in the cells of the hallmen it would seem absurd our retaining this bread but it was one of our grafts we were economic masters inside our hall turning the trick in ways quite similar to the economic masters of civilization we controlled the foodsupply of the population and just like our brother bandits outside we made the people pay through the nose for it we peddled the bread once a week the men who worked in the yard received a fivecent plug of chewing tobacco this chewing tobacco was the coin of the realm two or three rations of bread for a plug was the way we exchanged and they traded not because they loved tobacco less but because they loved bread more oh i know it was like taking candy from a baby but what would you we had to live and certainly there should be some reward for initiative and enterprise besides we but patterned ourselves after our betters outside the walls who on a larger scale and under the respectable disguise of merchants bankers and captains of industry did precisely what we were doing what awful things would have happened to those poor wretches if it hadnt been for us i cant imagine heaven knows we put bread into circulation in the erie county pen ay and we encouraged frugality and thrift  in the poor devils who forewent their tobacco and then there was our example in the breast of every convict there we implanted the ambition to become even as we and run a graft saviours of societyi guess yes  here was a hungry man without any tobacco maybe he was a profligate and had used it all up on himself very good he had a pair of suspenders i exchanged half a dozen rations of bread for itor a dozen rations if the suspenders were very good now i never wore suspenders but that didnt matter around the corner lodged a longtimer doing ten years for manslaughter he wore suspenders and he wanted a pair i could trade them to him for some of his meat meat was what i wanted or perhaps he had a tattered papercovered novel that was treasuretrove i could read it and then trade it off to the bakers for cake or to the cooks for meat and vegetables or to the firemen for decent coffee or to some one or other for the newspaper that occasionally filtered in heaven alone knows how the cooks bakers and firemen were prisoners like myself and they lodged in our hall in the first row of cells over us  in short a fullgrown system of barter obtained in the erie county pen there was even money in circulation this money was sometimes smuggled in by the shorttimers more frequently came from the barbershop graft where the newcomers were mulcted but most of all flowed from the cells of the longtimersthough how they got it i dont know  what of his preeminent position the first hallman was reputed to be quite wealthy in addition to his miscellaneous grafts he grafted on us we farmed the general wretchedness and the first hallman was farmergeneral over all of us we held our particular grafts by his permission and we had to pay for that permission as i say he was reputed to be wealthy but we never saw his money and he lived in a cell all to himself in solitary grandeur  but that money was made in the pen i had direct evidence for i was cellmate quite a time with the third hallman he had over sixteen dollars he used to count his money every night after nine oclock when we were locked in also he used to tell me each night what he would do to me if i gave away on him to the other hallmen you see he was afraid of being robbed and danger threatened him from three different directions there were the guards a couple of them might jump upon him give him a good beating for alleged insubordination and throw him into the solitaire the dungeon and in the mixup that sixteen dollars of his would take wings then again the first hallman could have taken it all away from him by threatening to dismiss him and fire him back to hard labor in the prisonyard and yet again there were the ten of us who were ordinary hallmen if we got an inkling of his wealth there was a large liability some quiet day of the whole bunch of us getting him into a corner and dragging him down oh we were wolves believe mejust like the fellows who do business in wall street  he had good reason to be afraid of us and so had i to be afraid of him he was a huge illiterate brute an exchesapeakebayoysterpirate an excon who had done five years in sing sing and a general allaround stupidly carnivorous beast he used to trap sparrows that flew into our hall through the open bars when he made a capture he hurried away with it into his cell where i have seen him crunching bones and spitting out feathers as he bolted it raw oh no i never gave away on him to the other hallmen this is the first time i have mentioned his sixteen dollars  but i grafted on him just the same he was in love with a woman prisoner who was confined in the female department he could neither read nor write and i used to read her letters to him and write his replies and i made him pay for it too but they were good letters i laid myself out on them put in my best licks and furthermore i won her for him though i shrewdly guess that she was in love not with him but with the humble scribe i repeat those letters were great  another one of our grafts was passing the punk we were the celestial messengers the firebringers in that iron world of bolt and bar when the men came in from work at night and were locked in their cells they wanted to smoke then it was that we restored the divine spark running the galleries from cell to cell with our smouldering punks those who were wise or with whom we did business had their punks all ready to light not every one got divine sparks however the guy who refused to dig up went sparkless and smokeless to bed but what did we care we had the immortal cinch on him and if he got fresh two or three of us would pitch on him and give him whatfor  you see this was the workingtheory of the hallmen there were thirteen of us we had something like half a thousand prisoners in our hall we were supposed to do the work and to keep order the latter was the function of the guards which they turned over to us it was up to us to keep order if we didnt wed be fired back to hard labor most probably with a taste of the dungeon thrown in but so long as we maintained order that long could we work our own particular grafts  bear with me a moment and look at the problem here were thirteen beasts of us over half a thousand other beasts it was a living hell that prison and it was up to us thirteen there to rule it was impossible considering the nature of the beasts for us to rule by kindness we ruled by fear of course behind us backing us up were the guards in extremity we called upon them for help but it would bother them if we called upon them too often in which event we could depend upon it that they would get more efficient trusties to take our places but we did not call upon them often except in a quiet sort of way when we wanted a cell unlocked in order to get at a refractory prisoner inside in such cases all the guard did was to unlock the door and walk away so as not to be a witness of what happened when half a dozen hallmen went inside and did a bit of manhandling  as regards the details of this manhandling i shall say nothing and after all manhandling was merely one of the very minor unprintable horrors of the erie county pen i say unprintable and in justice i must also say unthinkable they were unthinkable to me until i saw them and i was no spring chicken in the ways of the world and the awful abysses of human degradation it would take a deep plummet to reach bottom in the erie county pen and i do but skim lightly and facetiously the surface of things as i there saw them  at times say in the morning when the prisoners came down to wash the thirteen of us would be practically alone in the midst of them and every last one of them had it in for us thirteen against five hundred and we ruled by fear we could not permit the slightest infraction of rules the slightest insolence if we did we were lost our own rule was to hit a man as soon as he opened his mouthhit him hard hit him with anything a broomhandle endon in the face had a very sobering effect but that was not all such a man must be made an example of so the next rule was to wade right in and follow him up of course one was sure that every hallman in sight would come on the run to join in the chastisement for this also was a rule whenever any hallman was in trouble with a prisoner the duty of any other hallman who happened to be around was to lend a fist never mind the merits of the casewade in and hit and hit with anything in short lay the man out  i remember a handsome young mulatto of about twenty who got the insane idea into his head that he should stand for his rights and he did have the right of it too but that didnt help him any he lived on the topmost gallery eight hallmen took the conceit out of him in just about a minute and a halffor that was the length of time required to travel along his gallery to the end and down five flights of steel stairs he travelled the whole distance on every portion of his anatomy except his feet and the eight hallmen were not idle the mulatto struck the pavement where i was standing watching it all he regained his feet and stood upright for a moment in that moment he threw his arms wide apart and omitted an awful scream of terror and pain and heartbreak at the same instant as in a transformation scene the shreds of his stout prison clothes fell from him leaving him wholly naked and streaming blood from every portion of the surface of his body then he collapsed in a heap unconscious he had learned his lesson and every convict within those walls who heard him scream had learned a lesson so had i learned mine it is not a nice thing to see a mans heart broken in a minute and a half  the following will illustrate how we drummed up business in the graft of passing the punk a row of newcomers is installed in your cells you pass along before the bars with your punk hey bo give us a light some one calls to you now this is an advertisement that that particular man has tobacco on him you pass in the punk and go your way a little later you come back and lean up casually against the bars say bo can you let us have a little tobacco is what you say if he is not wise to the game the chances are that he solemnly avers that he hasnt any more tobacco all very well you condole with him and go your way but you know that his punk will last him only the rest of that day next day you come by and he says again hey bo give us a light and you say you havent any tobacco and you dont need a light and you dont give him any either half an hour after or an hour or two or three hours you will be passing by and the man will call out to you in mild tones come here bo and you come you thrust your hand between the bars and have it filled with precious tobacco then you give him a light  sometimes however a newcomer arrives upon whom no grafts are to be worked the mysterious word is passed along that he is to be treated decently where this word originated i could never learn the one thing patent is that the man has a pull it may be with one of the superior hallmen it may be with one of the guards in some other part of the prison it may be that good treatment has been purchased from grafters higher up but be it as it may we know that it is up to us to treat him decently if we want to avoid trouble  we hallmen were middlemen and common carriers we arranged trades between convicts confined in different parts of the prison and we put through the exchange also we took our commissions coming and going sometimes the objects traded had to go through the hands of half a dozen middlemen each of whom took his whack or in some way or another was paid for his service  sometimes one was in debt for services and sometimes one had others in his debt thus i entered the prison in debt to the convict who smuggled in my things for me a week or so afterward one of the firemen passed a letter into my hand it had been given to him by a barber the barber had received it from the convict who had smuggled in my things because of my debt to him i was to carry the letter on but he had not written the letter the original sender was a longtimer in his hall the letter was for a woman prisoner in the female department but whether it was intended for her or whether she in turn was one of the chain of gobetweens i did not know all that i knew was her description and that it was up to me to get it into her hands  two days passed during which time i kept the letter in my possession then the opportunity came the women did the mending of all the clothes worn by the convicts a number of our hallmen had to go to the female department to bring back huge bundles of clothes i fixed it with the first hallman that i was to go along door after door was unlocked for us as we threaded our way across the prison to the womens quarters we entered a large room where the women sat working at their mending my eyes were peeled for the woman who had been described to me i located her and worked near to her two eagleeyed matrons were on watch i held the letter in my palm and i looked my intention at the woman she knew i had something for her she must have been expecting it and had set herself to divining at the moment we entered which of us was the messenger but one of the matrons stood within two feet of her already the hallmen were picking up the bundles they were to carry away the moment was passing i delayed with my bundle making believe that it was not tied securely would that matron ever look away or was i to fail and just then another woman cut up playfully with one of the hallmenstuck out her foot and tripped him or pinched him or did something or other the matron looked that way and reprimanded the woman sharply now i do not know whether or not this was all planned to distract the matrons attention but i did know that it was my opportunity my particular womans hand dropped from her lap down by her side i stooped to pick up my bundle from my stooping position i slipped the letter into her hand and received another in exchange the next moment the bundle was on my shoulder the matrons gaze had returned to me because i was the last hallman and i was hastening to catch up with my companions the letter i had received from the woman i turned over to the fireman and thence it passed through the hands of the barber of the convict who had smuggled in my things and on to the longtimer at the other end  often we conveyed letters the chain of communication of which was so complex that we knew neither sender nor sendee we were but links in the chain somewhere somehow a convict would thrust a letter into my hand with the instruction to pass it on to the next link all such acts were favors to be reciprocated later on when i should be acting directly with a principal in transmitting letters and from whom i should be receiving my pay the whole prison was covered by a network of lines of communication and we who were in control of the system of communication naturally since we were modelled after capitalistic society exacted heavy tolls from our customers it was service for profit with a vengeance though we were at times not above giving service for love  and all the time i was in the pen i was making myself solid with my pal he had done much for me and in return he expected me to do as much for him when we got out we were to travel together and it goes without saying pull off jobs together for my pal was a criminaloh not a jewel of the first water merely a petty criminal who would steal and rob commit burglary and if cornered not stop short of murder many a quiet hour we sat and talked together he had two or three jobs in view for the immediate future in which my work was cut out for me and in which i joined in planning the details i had been with and seen much of criminals and my pal never dreamed that i was only fooling him giving him a string thirty days long he thought i was the real goods liked me because i was not stupid and liked me a bit too i think for myself of course i had not the slightest intention of joining him in a life of sordid petty crime but id have been an idiot to throw away all the good things his friendship made possible when one is on the hot lava of hell he cannot pick and choose his path and so it was with me in the erie county pen i had to stay in with the push or do hard labor on bread and water and to stay in with the push i had to make good with my pal  life was not monotonous in the pen every day something was happening men were having fits going crazy fighting or the hallmen were getting drunk rover jack one of the ordinary hallmen was our star oryide he was a true profesh a blowedintheglass stiff and as such received all kinds of latitude from the hallmen in authority pittsburg joe who was second hallman used to join rover jack in his jags and it was a saying of the pair that the erie county pen was the only place where a man could get slopped and not be arrested i never knew but i was told that bromide of potassium gained in devious ways from the dispensary was the dope they used but i do know whatever their dope was that they got good and drunk on occasion  our hall was a common stews filled with the ruck and the filth the scum and dregs of societyhereditary inefficients degenerates wrecks lunatics addled intelligences epileptics monsters weaklings in short a very nightmare of humanity hence fits flourished with us these fits seemed contagious when one man began throwing a fit others followed his lead i have seen seven men down with fits at the same time making the air hideous with their cries while as many more lunatics would be raging and gibbering up and down nothing was ever done for the men with fits except to throw cold water on them it was useless to send for the medical student or the doctor they were not to be bothered with such trivial and frequent occurrences  there was a young dutch boy about eighteen years of age who had fits most frequently of all he usually threw one every day it was for that reason that we kept him on the ground floor farther down in the row of cells in which we lodged after he had had a few fits in the prisonyard the guards refused to be bothered with him any more and so he remained locked up in his cell all day with a cockney cellmate to keep him company not that the cockney was of any use whenever the dutch boy had a fit the cockney became paralyzed with terror  the dutch boy could not speak a word of english he was a farmers boy serving ninety days as punishment for having got into a scrap with some one he prefaced his fits with howling he howled like a wolf also he took his fits standing up which was very inconvenient for him for his fits always culminated in a headlong pitch to the floor whenever i heard the long wolfhowl rising i used to grab a broom and run to his cell now the trusties were not allowed keys to the cells so i could not get in to him he would stand up in the middle of his narrow cell shivering convulsively his eyes rolled backward till only the whites were visible and howling like a lost soul try as i would i could never get the cockney to lend him a hand while he stood and howled the cockney crouched and trembled in the upper bunk his terrorstricken gaze fixed on that awful figure with eyes rolled back that howled and howled it was hard on him too the poor devil of a cockney his own reason was not any too firmly seated and the wonder is that he did not go mad  all that i could do was my best with the broom i would thrust it through the bars train it on dutchys chest and wait as the crisis approached he would begin swaying back and forth i followed this swaying with the broom for there was no telling when he would take that dreadful forward pitch but when he did i was there with the broom catching him and easing him down contrive as i would he never came down quite gently and his face was usually bruised by the stone floor once down and writhing in convulsions id throw a bucket of water over him i dont know whether cold water was the right thing or not but it was the custom in the erie county pen nothing more than that was ever done for him he would lie there wet for an hour or so and then crawl into his bunk i knew better than to run to a guard for assistance what was a man with a fit anyway  in the adjoining cell lived a strange charactera man who was doing sixty days for eating swill out of barnums swillbarrel or at least that was the way he put it he was a badly addled creature and at first very mild and gentle the facts of his case were as he had stated them he had strayed out to the circus ground and being hungry had made his way to the barrel that contained the refuse from the table of the circus people and it was good bread he often assured me and the meat was out of sight a policeman had seen him and arrested him and there he was  once i passed his cell with a piece of stiff thin wire in my hand he asked me for it so earnestly that i passed it through the bars to him promptly and with no tool but his fingers he broke it into short lengths and twisted them into half a dozen very creditable safety pins he sharpened the points on the stone floor thereafter i did quite a trade in safety pins i furnished the raw material and peddled the finished product and he did the work as wages i paid him extra rations of bread and once in a while a chunk of meat or a piece of soupbone with some marrow inside  but his imprisonment told on him and he grew violent day by day the hallmen took delight in teasing him they filled his weak brain with stories of a great fortune that had been left him it was in order to rob him of it that he had been arrested and sent to jail of course as he himself knew there was no law against eating out of a barrel therefore he was wrongly imprisoned it was a plot to deprive him of his fortune  the first i knew of it i heard the hallmen laughing about the string they had given him next he held a serious conference with me in which he told me of his millions and the plot to deprive him of them and in which he appointed me his detective i did my best to let him down gently speaking vaguely of a mistake and that it was another man with a similar name who was the rightful heir i left him quite cooled down but i couldnt keep the hallmen away from him and they continued to string him worse than ever in the end after a most violent scene he threw me down revoked my private detectiveship and went on strike my trade in safety pins ceased he refused to make any more safety pins and he peppered me with raw material through the bars of his cell when i passed by  i could never make it up with him the other hallmen told him that i was a detective in the employ of the conspirators and in the meantime the hallmen drove him mad with their stringing his fictitious wrongs preyed upon his mind and at last he became a dangerous and homicidal lunatic the guards refused to listen to his tale of stolen millions and he accused them of being in the plot one day he threw a pannikin of hot tea over one of them and then his case was investigated the warden talked with him a few minutes through the bars of his cell then he was taken away for examination before the doctors he never came back and i often wonder if he is dead or if he still gibbers about his millions in some asylum for the insane  at last came the day of days my release it was the day of release for the third hallman as well and the shorttimer girl i had won for him was waiting for him outside the wall they went away blissfully together my pal and i went out together and together we walked down into buffalo were we not to be together always we begged together on the maindrag that day for pennies and what we received was spent for shupers of beeri dont know how they are spelled but they are pronounced the way i have spelled them and they cost three cents i was watching my chance all the time for a getaway from some bo on the drag i managed to learn what time a certain freight pulled out i calculated my time accordingly when the moment came my pal and i were in a saloon two foaming shupers were before us id have liked to say goodby he had been good to me but i did not dare i went out through the rear of the saloon and jumped the fence it was a swift sneak and a few minutes later i was on board a freight and heading south on the western new york and pennsylvania railroad     hoboes that pass in the night   in the course of my tramping i encountered hundreds of hoboes whom i hailed or who hailed me and with whom i waited at watertanks boiledup cooked mulligans battered the drag or privates and beat trains and who passed and were seen never again on the other hand there were hoboes who passed and repassed with amazing frequency and others still who passed like ghosts close at hand unseen and never seen  it was one of the latter that i chased clear across canada over three thousand miles of railroad and never once did i lay eyes on him his monica was skysail jack i first ran into it at montreal carved with a jackknife was the skysailyard of a ship it was perfectly executed under it was skysail jack above was bw 91594 this latter conveyed the information that he had passed through montreal bound west on october 15 1894 he had one day the start of me sailor jack was my monica at that particular time and promptly i carved it alongside of his along with the date and the information that i too was bound west  i had misfortune in getting over the next hundred miles and eight days later i picked up skysail jacks trail three hundred miles west of ottawa there it was carved on a watertank and by the date i saw that he likewise had met with delay he was only two days ahead of me i was a comet and tramproyal so was skysail jack and it was up to my pride and reputation to catch up with him i railroaded day and night and i passed him then turn about he passed me sometimes he was a day or so ahead and sometimes i was from hoboes bound east i got word of him occasionally when he happened to be ahead and from them i learned that he had become interested in sailor jack and was making inquiries about me  wed have made a precious pair i am sure if wed ever got together but get together we couldnt i kept ahead of him clear across manitoba but he led the way across alberta and early one bitter gray morning at the end of a division just east of kicking horse pass i learned that he had been seen the night before between kicking horse pass and rogers pass it was rather curious the way the information came to me i had been riding all night in a sidedoor pullman boxcar and nearly dead with cold had crawled out at the division to beg for food a freezing fog was drifting past and i hit some firemen i found in the roundhouse they fixed me up with the leavings from their lunchpails and in addition i got out of them nearly a quart of heavenly java coffee i heated the latter and as i sat down to eat a freight pulled in from the west i saw a sidedoor open and a roadkid climb out through the drifting fog he limped over to me he was stiff with cold his lips blue i shared my java and grub with him learned about skysail jack and then learned about him behold he was from my own town oakland california and he was a member of the celebrated boo ganga gang with which i had affiliated at rare intervals we talked fast and bolted the grub in the halfhour that followed then my freight pulled out and i was on it bound west on the trail of skysail jack  i was delayed between the passes went two days without food and walked eleven miles on the third day before i got any and yet i succeeded in passing skysail jack along the fraser river in british columbia i was riding passengers then and making time but he must have been riding passengers too and with more luck or skill than i for he got into mission ahead of me  now mission was a junction forty miles east of vancouver from the junction one could proceed south through washington and oregon over the northern pacific i wondered which way skysail jack would go for i thought i was ahead of him as for myself i was still bound west to vancouver i proceeded to the watertank to leave that information and there freshly carved with that days date upon it was skysail jacks monica i hurried on into vancouver but he was gone he had taken ship immediately and was still flying west on his worldadventure truly skysail jack you were a tramproyal and your mate was the wind that tramps the world i take off my hat to you you were blowedintheglass all right a week later i too got my ship and on board the steamship umatilla in the forecastle was working my way down the coast to san francisco skysail jack and sailor jackgee if wed ever got together  watertanks are tramp directories not all in idle wantonness do tramps carve their monicas dates and courses often and often have i met hoboes earnestly inquiring if i had seen anywhere such and such a stiff or his monica and more than once i have been able to give the monica of recent date the watertank and the direction in which he was then bound and promptly the hobo to whom i gave the information lit out after his pal i have met hoboes who in trying to catch a pal had pursued clear across the continent and back again and were still going  monicas are the nomderails that hoboes assume or accept when thrust upon them by their fellows leary joe for instance was timid and was so named by his fellows no selfrespecting hobo would select stew bum for himself very few tramps care to remember their pasts during which they ignobly worked so monicas based upon trades are very rare though i remember having met the following moulder blackey painter red chi plumber boilermaker sailor boy and printer bo chi pronounced shy by the way is the argot for chicago  a favorite device of hoboes is to base their monicas on the localities from which they hail as new york tommy pacific slim buffalo smithy canton tim pittsburg jack syracuse shine troy mickey kl bill and connecticut jimmy then there was slim jim from vinegar hill who never worked and never will a shine is always a negro so called possibly from the high lights on his countenance texas shine or toledo shine convey both race and nativity  among those that incorporated their race i recollect the following frisco sheeny new york irish michigan french english jack cockney kid and milwaukee dutch others seem to take their monicas in part from the colorschemes stamped upon them at birth such as chi whitey new

i have encountered buck kid blind kid midget kid holy kid bat kid swift kid cookey kid monkey kid iowa kid corduroy kid orator kid who could tell how it happened and lippy kid who was insolent depend upon it  on the watertank at san marcial new mexico a dozen years ago was the following hobo bill of fare    1 maindrag fair   2 bulls not hostile   3 roundhouse good for kipping   4 northbound trains no good   5 privates no good   6 restaurants good for cooks only   7 railroad house good for nightwork only  number one conveys the information that begging for money on the main street is fair number two that the police will not bother hoboes number three that one can sleep in the roundhouse number four however is ambiguous the northbound trains may be no good to beat and they may be no good to beg number five means that the residences are not good to beggars and number six means that only hoboes that have been cooks can get grub from the restaurants number seven bothers me i cannot make out whether the railroad house is a good place for any hobo to beg at night or whether it is good only for hobocooks to beg at night or whether any hobo cook or noncook can lend a hand at night helping the cooks of the railroad house with their dirty work and getting something to eat in payment  but to return to the hoboes that pass in the night i remember one i met in california he was a swede but he had lived so long in the united states that one couldnt guess his nationality he had to tell it on himself in fact he had come to the united states when no more than a baby i ran into him first at the mountain town of truckee which way bo was our greeting and bound east was the answer each of us gave quite a bunch of stiffs tried to ride out the overland that night and i lost the swede in the shuffle also i lost the overland  i arrived in reno nevada in a boxcar that was promptly sidetracked it was a sunday morning and after i threw my feet for breakfast i wandered over to the piute camp to watch the indians gambling and there stood the swede hugely interested of course we got together he was the only acquaintance i had in that region and i was his only acquaintance we rushed together like a couple of dissatisfied hermits and together we spent the day threw our feet for dinner and late in the afternoon tried to nail the same freight but he was ditched and i rode her out alone to be ditched myself in the desert twenty miles beyond  of all desolate places the one at which i was ditched was the limit it was called a flagstation and it consisted of a shanty dumped inconsequentially into the sand and sagebrush a chill wind was blowing night was coming on and the solitary telegraph operator who lived in the shanty was afraid of me i knew that neither grub nor bed could i get out of him it was because of his manifest fear of me that i did not believe him when he told me that eastbound trains never stopped there besides hadnt i been thrown off of an eastbound train right at that very spot not five minutes before he assured me that it had stopped under orders and that a year might go by before another was stopped under orders he advised me that it was only a dozen or fifteen miles on to wadsworth and that id better hike i elected to wait however and i had the pleasure of seeing two westbound freights go by without stopping and one eastbound freight i wondered if the swede was on the latter it was up to me to hit the ties to wadsworth and hit them i did much to the telegraph operators relief for i neglected to burn his shanty and murder him telegraph operators have much to be thankful for at the end of half a dozen miles i had to get off the ties and let the eastbound overland go by she was going fast but i caught sight of a dim form on the first blind that looked like the swede  that was the last i saw of him for weary days i hit the high places across those hundreds of miles of nevada desert riding the overlands at night for speed and in the daytime riding in boxcars and getting my sleep it was early in the year and it was cold in those upland pastures snow lay here and there on the level all the mountains were shrouded in white and at night the most miserable wind imaginable blew off from them it was not a land in which to linger and remember gentle reader the hobo goes through such a land without shelter without money begging his way and sleeping at night without blankets this last is something that can be realized only by experience  in the early evening i came down to the depot at ogden the overland of the union pacific was pulling east and i was bent on making connections out in the tangle of tracks ahead of the engine i encountered a figure slouching through the gloom it was the swede we shook hands like longlost brothers and discovered that our hands were gloved whered ye glahm em i asked out of an enginecab he answered and where did you they belonged to a fireman said i he was careless  we caught the blind as the overland pulled out and mighty cold we found it the way led up a narrow gorge between snowcovered mountains and we shivered and shook and exchanged confidences about how we had covered the ground between reno and ogden i had closed my eyes for only an hour or so the previous night and the blind was not comfortable enough to suit me for a snooze at a stop i went forward to the engine we had on a doubleheader two engines to take us over the grade  the pilot of the head engine because it punched the wind i knew would be too cold so i selected the pilot of the second engine which was sheltered by the first engine i stepped on the cowcatcher and found the pilot occupied in the darkness i felt out the form of a young boy he was sound asleep by squeezing there was room for two on the pilot and i made the boy budge over and crawled up beside him it was a good night the shacks brakemen didnt bother us and in no time we were asleep once in a while hot cinders or heavy jolts aroused me when i snuggled closer to the boy and dozed off to the coughing of the engines and the screeching of the wheels  the overland made evanston wyoming and went no farther a wreck ahead blocked the line the dead engineer had been brought in and his body attested the peril of the way a tramp also had been killed but his body had not been brought in i talked with the boy he was thirteen years old he had run away from his folks in some place in oregon and was heading east to his grandmother he had a tale of cruel treatment in the home he had left that rang true besides there was no need for him to lie to me a nameless hobo on the track  and that boy was going some too he couldnt cover the ground fast enough when the division superintendents decided to send the overland back over the way it had come then up on a cross jerk to the oregon short line and back along that road to tap the union pacific the other side of the wreck that boy climbed upon the pilot and said he was going to stay with it this was too much for the swede and me it meant travelling the rest of that frigid night in order to gain no more than a dozen miles or so we said wed wait till the wreck was cleared away and in the meantime get a good sleep  now it is no snap to strike a strange town broke at midnight in cold weather and find a place to sleep the swede hadnt a penny my total assets consisted of two dimes and a nickel from some of the town boys we learned that beer was five cents and that the saloons kept open all night there was our meat two glasses of beer would cost ten cents there would be a stove and chairs and we could sleep it out till morning we headed for the lights of a saloon walking briskly the snow crunching under our feet a chill little wind blowing through us  alas i had misunderstood the town boys beer was five cents in one saloon only in the whole burg and we didnt strike that saloon but the one we entered was all right a blessed stove was roaring whitehot there were cosey canebottomed armchairs and a nonetoopleasantlooking barkeeper who glared suspiciously at us as we came in a man cannot spend continuous days and nights in his clothes beating trains fighting soot and cinders and sleeping anywhere and maintain a good front our fronts were decidedly against us but what did we care i had the price in my jeans  two beers said i nonchalantly to the barkeeper and while he drew them the swede and i leaned against the bar and yearned secretly for the armchairs by the stove  the barkeeper set the two foaming glasses before us and with pride i deposited the ten cents now i was dead game as soon as i learned my error in the price id have dug up another ten cents never mind if it did leave me only a nickel to my name a stranger in a strange land id have paid it all right but that barkeeper never gave me a chance as soon as his eyes spotted the dime i had laid down he seized the two glasses one in each hand and dumped the beer into the sink behind the bar at the same time glaring at us malevolently he said  youve got scabs on your nose youve got scabs on your nose youve got scabs on your nose see  i hadnt either and neither had the swede our noses were all right the direct bearing of his words was beyond our comprehension but the indirect bearing was clear as print he didnt like our looks and beer was evidently ten cents a glass  i dug down and laid another dime on the bar remarking carelessly oh i thought this was a fivecent joint  your moneys no good here he answered shoving the two dimes across the bar to me  sadly i dropped them back into my pocket sadly we yearned toward the blessed stove and the armchairs and sadly we went out the door into the frosty night  but as we went out the door the barkeeper still glaring called after us youve got scabs on your nose see  i have seen much of the world since then journeyed among strange lands and peoples opened many books sat in many lecturehalls but to this day though i have pondered long and deep i have been unable to divine the meaning in the cryptic utterance of that barkeeper in evanston wyoming our noses were all right  we slept that night over the boilers in an electriclighting plant how we discovered that kipping place i cant remember we must have just headed for it instinctively as horses head for water or carrierpigeons head for the homecote but it was a night not pleasant to remember a dozen hoboes were ahead of us on top the boilers and it was too hot for all of us to complete our misery the engineer would not let us stand around down below he gave us our choice of the boilers or the outside snow  you said you wanted to sleep and so damn you sleep said he to me when frantic and beaten out by the heat i came down into the fireroom  water i gasped wiping the sweat from my eyes water  he pointed out of doors and assured me that down there somewhere in the blackness id find the river i started for the river got lost in the dark fell into two or three drifts gave it up and returned halffrozen to the top of the boilers when i had thawed out i was thirstier than ever around me the hoboes were moaning groaning sobbing sighing gasping panting rolling and tossing and floundering heavily in their torment we were so many lost souls toasting on a griddle in hell and the engineer satan incarnate gave us the sole alternative of freezing in the outer cold the swede sat up and anathematized passionately the wanderlust in man that sent him tramping and suffering hardships such as that  when i get back to chicago he perorated im going to get a job and stick to it till hell freezes over then ill go tramping again  and such is the irony of fate next day when the wreck ahead was cleared the swede and i pulled out of evanston in the iceboxes of an orange special a fast freight laden with fruit from sunny california of course the iceboxes were empty on account of the cold weather but that didnt make them any warmer for us we entered them through hatchways in the top of the car the boxes were constructed of galvanized iron and in that biting weather were not pleasant to the touch we lay there shivered and shook and with chattering teeth held a council wherein we decided that wed stay by the iceboxes day and night till we got out of the inhospitable plateau region and down into the mississippi valley  but we must eat and we decided that at the next division we would throw our feet for grub and make a rush back to our iceboxes we arrived in the town of green river late in the afternoon but too early for supper before mealtime is the worst time for battering backdoors but we put on our nerve swung off the sideladders as the freight pulled into the yards and made a run for the houses we were quickly separated but we had agreed to meet in the iceboxes i had bad luck at first but in the end with a couple of handouts poked into my shirt i chased for the train it was pulling out and going fast the particular refrigeratorcar in which we were to meet had already gone by and half a dozen cars down the train from it i swung on to the sideladders went up on top hurriedly and dropped down into an icebox  but a shack had seen me from the caboose and at the next stop a few miles farther on rock springs the shack stuck his head into my box and said hit the grit you son of a toad hit the grit also he grabbed me by the heels and dragged me out i hit the grit all right and the orange special and the swede rolled on without me  snow was beginning to fall a cold night was coming on after dark i hunted around in the railroad yards until i found an empty refrigerator car in i climbednot into the iceboxes but into the car itself i swung the heavy doors shut and their edges covered with strips of rubber sealed the car airtight the walls were thick there was no way for the outside cold to get in but the inside was just as cold as the outside how to raise the temperature was the problem but trust a profesh for that out of my pockets i dug up three or four newspapers these i burned one at a time on the floor of the car the smoke rose to the top not a bit of the heat could escape and comfortable and warm i passed a beautiful night i didnt wake up once  in the morning it was still snowing while throwing my feet for breakfast i missed an eastbound freight later in the day i nailed two other freights and was ditched from both of them all afternoon no eastbound trains went by the snow was falling thicker than ever but at twilight i rode out on the first blind of the overland as i swung aboard the blind from one side somebody swung aboard from the other it was the boy who had run away from oregon  now the first blind of a fast train in a driving snowstorm is no summer picnic the wind goes right through one strikes the front of the car and comes back again at the first stop darkness having come on i went forward and interviewed the fireman i offered to shove coal to the end of his run which was rawlins and my offer was accepted my work was out on the tender in the snow breaking the lumps of coal with a sledge and shovelling it forward to him in the cab but as i did not have to work all the time i could come into the cab and warm up now and again  say i said to the fireman at my first breathing spell theres a little kid back there on the first blind hes pretty cold  the cabs on the union pacific engines are quite spacious and we fitted the kid into a warm nook in front of the high seat of the fireman where the kid promptly fell asleep we arrived at rawlins at midnight the snow was thicker than ever here the engine was to go into the roundhouse being replaced by a fresh engine as the train came to a stop i dropped off the engine steps plump into the arms of a large man in a large overcoat he began asking me questions and i promptly demanded who he was just as promptly he informed me that he was the sheriff i drew in my horns and listened and answered  he began describing the kid who was still asleep in the cab i did some quick thinking evidently the family was on the trail of the kid and the sheriff had received telegraphed instructions from oregon yes i had seen the kid i had met him first in ogden the date tallied with the sheriffs information but the kid was still behind somewhere i explained for he had been ditched from that very overland that night when it pulled out of rock springs and all the time i was praying that the kid wouldnt wake up come down out of the cab and put the kibosh on me  the sheriff left me in order to interview the shacks but before he left he said  bo this town is no place for you understand you ride this train out and make no mistake about it if i catch you after its gone   i assured him that it was not through desire that i was in his town that the only reason i was there was that the train had stopped there and that he wouldnt see me for smoke the way id get out of his darn town  while he went to interview the shacks i jumped back into the cab the kid was awake and rubbing his eyes i told him the news and advised him to ride the engine into the roundhouse to cut the story short the kid made the same overland out riding the pilot with instructions to make an appeal to the fireman at the first stop for permission to ride in the engine as for myself i got ditched the new fireman was young and not yet lax enough to break the rules of the company against having tramps in the engine so he turned down my offer to shove coal i hope the kid succeeded with him for all night on the pilot in that blizzard would have meant death  strange to say i do not at this late day remember a detail of how i was ditched at rawlins i remember watching the train as it was immediately swallowed up in the snowstorm and of heading for a saloon to warm up here was light and warmth everything was in full blast and wide open faro roulette craps and poker tables were running and some mad cowpunchers were making the night merry i had just succeeded in fraternizing with them and was downing my first drink at their expense when a heavy hand descended on my shoulder i looked around and sighed it was the sheriff  without a word he led me out into the snow  theres an orange special down there in the yards said he  its a damn cold night said i  it pulls out in ten minutes said he  that was all there was no discussion and when that orange special pulled out i was in the iceboxes i thought my feet would freeze before morning and the last twenty miles into laramie i stood upright in the hatchway and danced up and down the snow was too thick for the shacks to see me and i didnt care if they did  my quarter of a dollar bought me a hot breakfast at laramie and immediately afterward i was on board the blind baggage of an overland that was climbing to the pass through the backbone of the rockies one does not ride blind baggages in the daytime but in this blizzard at the top of the rocky mountains i doubted if the shacks would have the heart to put me off and they didnt they made a practice of coming forward at every stop to see if i was frozen yet  at ames monument at the summit of the rockiesi forget the altitudethe shack came forward for the last time  say bo he said you see that freight sidetracked over there to let us go by  i saw it was on the next track six feet away a few feet more in that storm and i could not have seen it  well the afterpush of kellys army is in one of them cars theyve got two feet of straw under them and theres so many of them that they keep the car warm  his advice was good and i followed it prepared however if it was a con game the shack had given me to take the blind as the overland pulled out but it was straight goods i found the cara big refrigerator car with the leeward door wide open for ventilation up i climbed and in i stepped on a mans leg next on some other mans arm the light was dim and all i could make out was arms and legs and bodies inextricably confused never was there such a tangle of humanity they were all lying in the straw and over and under and around one another eightyfour husky hoboes take up a lot of room when they are stretched out the men i stepped on were resentful their bodies heaved under me like the waves of the sea and imparted an involuntary forward movement to me i could not find any straw to step upon so i stepped upon more men the resentment increased so did my forward movement i lost my footing and sat down with sharp abruptness unfortunately it was on a mans head the next moment he had risen on his hands and knees in wrath and i was flying through the air what goes up must come down and i came down on another mans head  what happened after that is very vague in my memory it was like going through a threshingmachine i was bandied about from one end of the car to the other those eightyfour hoboes winnowed me out till what little was left of me by some miracle found a bit of straw to rest upon i was initiated and into a jolly crowd all the rest of that day we rode through the blizzard and to while the time away it was decided that each man was to tell a story it was stipulated that each story must be a good one and furthermore that it must be a story no one had ever heard before the penalty for failure was the threshingmachine nobody failed and i want to say right here that never in my life have i sat at so marvellous a storytelling debauch here were eightyfour men from all the worldi made eightyfive and each man told a masterpiece it had to be for it was either masterpiece or threshingmachine  late in the afternoon we arrived in cheyenne the blizzard was at its height and though the last meal of all of us had been breakfast no man cared to throw his feet for supper all night we rolled on through the storm and next day found us down on the sweet plains of nebraska and still rolling we were out of the storm and the mountains the blessed sun was shining over a smiling land and we had eaten nothing for twentyfour hours we found out that the freight would arrive about noon at a town if i remember right that was called grand island  we took up a collection and sent a telegram to the authorities of that town the text of the message was that eightyfive healthy hungry hoboes would arrive about noon and that it would be a good idea to have dinner ready for them the authorities of grand island had two courses open to them they could feed us or they could throw us in jail in the latter event theyd have to feed us anyway and they decided wisely that one meal would be the cheaper way  when the freight rolled into grand island at noon we were sitting on the tops of the cars and dangling our legs in the sunshine all the police in the burg were on the reception committee they marched us in squads to the various hotels and restaurants where dinners were spread for us we had been thirtysix hours without food and we didnt have to be taught what to do after that we were marched back to the railroad station the police had thoughtfully compelled the freight to wait for us she pulled out slowly and the eightyfive of us strung out along the track swarmed up the sideladders we captured the train  we had no supper that eveningat least the push didnt but i did just at supper time as the freight was pulling out of a small town a man climbed into the car where i was playing pedro with three other stiffs the mans shirt was bulging suspiciously in his hand he carried a battered quartmeasure from which arose steam i smelled java i turned my cards over to one of the stiffs who was looking on and excused myself then in the other end of the car pursued by envious glances i sat down with the man who had climbed aboard and shared his java and the handouts that had bulged his shirt it was the swede  at about ten oclock in the evening we arrived at omaha  lets shake the push said the swede to me  sure said i  as the freight pulled into omaha we made ready to do so but the people of omaha were also ready the swede and i hung upon the sideladders ready to drop off but the freight did not stop furthermore long rows of policemen their brass buttons and stars glittering in the electric lights were lined up on each side of the track the swede and i knew what would happen to us if we ever dropped off into their arms we stuck by the sideladders and the train rolled on across the missouri river to council bluffs  general kelly with an army of two thousand hoboes lay in camp at chautauqua park several miles away the afterpush we were with was general kellys rearguard and detraining at council bluffs it started to march to camp the night had turned cold and heavy windsqualls accompanied by rain were chilling and wetting us many police were guarding us and herding us to the camp the swede and i watched our chance and made a successful getaway  the rain began coming down in torrents and in the darkness unable to see our hands in front of our faces like a pair of blind men we fumbled about for shelter our instinct served us for in no time we stumbled upon a saloonnot a saloon that was open and doing business not merely a saloon that was closed for the night and not even a saloon with a permanent address but a saloon propped up on big timbers with rollers underneath that was being moved from somewhere to somewhere the doors were locked a squall of wind and rain drove down upon us we did not hesitate smash went the door and in we went  i have made some tough camps in my time carried the banner in infernal metropolises bedded in pools of water slept in the snow under two blankets when the spirit thermometer registered seventyfour degrees below zero which is a mere trifle of one hundred and six degrees of frost but i want to say right here that never did i make a tougher camp pass a more miserable night than that night i passed with the swede in the itinerant saloon at council bluffs in the first place the building perched up as it was in the air had exposed a multitude of openings in the floor through which the wind whistled in the second place the bar was empty there was no bottled firewater with which we could warm ourselves and forget our misery we had no blankets and in our wet clothes wet to the skin we tried to sleep i rolled under the bar and the swede rolled under the table the holes and crevices in the floor made it impossible and at the end of half an hour i crawled up on top the bar a little later the swede crawled up on top his table  and there we shivered and prayed for daylight i know for one that i shivered until i could shiver no more till the shivering muscles exhausted themselves and merely ached horribly the swede moaned and groaned and every little while through chattering teeth he muttered never again never again he muttered this phrase repeatedly ceaselessly a thousand times and when he dozed he went on muttering it in his sleep  at the first gray of dawn we left our house of pain and outside found ourselves in a mist dense and chill we stumbled on till we came to the railroad track i was going back to omaha to throw my feet for breakfast my companion was going on to chicago the moment for parting had come our palsied hands went out to each other we were both shivering when we tried to speak our teeth chattered us back into silence we stood alone shut off from the world all that we could see was a short length of railroad track both ends of which were lost in the driving mist we stared dumbly at each other our clasped hands shaking sympathetically the swedes face was blue with the cold and i know mine must have been  never again what i managed to articulate  speech strove for utterance in the swedes throat then faint and distant in a thin whisper from the very bottom of his frozen soul came the words  never again a hobo  he paused and as he went on again his voice gathered strength and huskiness as it affirmed his will  never again a hobo im going to get a job youd better do the same nights like this make rheumatism  he wrung my hand  goodby bo said he  goodby bo said i  the next we were swallowed up from each other by the mist it was our final passing but heres to you mr swede wherever you are i hope you got that job     roadkids and gaycats   every once in a while in newspapers magazines and biographical dictionaries i run upon sketches of my life wherein delicately phrased i learn that it was in order to study sociology that i became a tramp this is very nice and thoughtful of the biographers but it is inaccurate i became a trampwell because of the life that was in me of the wanderlust in my blood that would not let me rest sociology was merely incidental it came afterward in the same manner that a wet skin follows a ducking i went on the road because i couldnt keep away from it because i hadnt the price of the railroad fare in my jeans because i was so made that i couldnt work all my life on one same shift becausewell just because it was easier to than not to  it happened in my own town in oakland when i was sixteen at that time i had attained a dizzy reputation in my chosen circle of adventurers by whom i was known as the prince of the oyster pirates it is true those immediately outside my circle such as honest baysailors longshoremen yachtsmen and the legal owners of the oysters called me tough hoodlum smoudge thief robber and various other not nice thingsall of which was complimentary and but served to increase the dizziness of the high place in which i sat at that time i had not read paradise lost and later when i read miltons better to reign in hell than serve in heaven i was fully convinced that great minds run in the same channels  it was at this time that the fortuitous concatenation of events sent me upon my first adventure on the road it happened that there was nothing doing in oysters just then that at benicia forty miles away i had some blankets i wanted to get and that at port costa several miles from benicia a stolen boat lay at anchor in charge of the constable now this boat was owned by a friend of mine by name dinny mccrea it had been stolen and left at port costa by whiskey bob another friend of mine poor whiskey bob only last winter his body was picked up on the beach shot full of holes by nobody knows whom i had come down from up river some time before and reported to dinny mccrea the whereabouts of his boat and dinny mccrea had promptly offered ten dollars to me if i should bring it down to oakland to him  time was heavy on my hands i sat on the dock and talked it over with nickey the greek another idle oyster pirate lets go said i and nickey was willing he was broke i possessed fifty cents and a small skiff the former i invested and loaded into the latter in the form of crackers canned corned beef and a tencent bottle of french mustard we were keen on french mustard in those days then late in the afternoon we hoisted our small spritsail and started we sailed all night and next morning on the first of a glorious floodtide a fair wind behind us we came booming up the carquinez straits to port costa there lay the stolen boat not twentyfive feet from the wharf we ran alongside and doused our little spritsail i sent nickey forward to lift the anchor while i began casting off the gaskets  a man ran out on the wharf and hailed us it was the constable it suddenly came to me that i had neglected to get a written authorization from dinny mccrea to take possession of his boat also i knew that constable wanted to charge at least twentyfive dollars in fees for capturing the boat from whiskey bob and subsequently taking care of it and my last fifty cents had been blown in for corned beef and french mustard and the reward was only ten dollars anyway i shot a glance forward to nickey he had the anchor upanddown and was straining at it break her out i whispered to him and turned and shouted back to the constable the result was that he and i were talking at the same time our spoken thoughts colliding in midair and making gibberish  the constable grew more imperative and perforce i had to listen nickey was heaving on the anchor till i thought hed burst a bloodvessel when the constable got done with his threats and warnings i asked him who he was the time he lost in telling me enabled nickey to break out the anchor i was doing some quick calculating at the feet of the constable a ladder ran down the dock to the water and to the ladder was moored a skiff the oars were in it but it was padlocked i gambled everything on that padlock i felt the breeze on my cheek saw the surge of the tide looked at the remaining gaskets that confined the sail ran my eyes up the halyards to the blocks and knew that all was clear and then threw off all dissimulation  in with her i shouted to nickey and sprang to the gaskets casting them loose and thanking my stars that whiskey bob had tied them in squareknots instead of grannies  the constable had slid down the ladder and was fumbling with a key at the padlock the anchor came aboard and the last gasket was loosed at the same instant that the constable freed the skiff and jumped to the oars  peakhalyards i commanded my crew at the same time swinging on to the throathalyards up came the sail on the run i belayed and ran aft to the tiller  stretch her i shouted to nickey at the peak the constable was just reaching for our stern a puff of wind caught us and we shot away it was great if id had a black flag i know id have run it up in triumph the constable stood up in the skiff and paled the glory of the day with the vividness of his language also he wailed for a gun you see that was another gamble we had taken  anyway we werent stealing the boat it wasnt the constables we were merely stealing his fees which was his particular form of graft and we werent stealing the fees for ourselves either we were stealing them for my friend dinny mccrea  benicia was made in a few minutes and a few minutes later my blankets were aboard i shifted the boat down to the far end of steamboat wharf from which point of vantage we could see anybody coming after us there was no telling maybe the port costa constable would telephone to the benicia constable nickey and i held a council of war we lay on deck in the warm sun the fresh breeze on our cheeks the floodtide rippling and swirling past it was impossible to start back to oakland till afternoon when the ebb would begin to run but we figured that the constable would have an eye out on the carquinez straits when the ebb started and that nothing remained for us but to wait for the following ebb at two oclock next morning when we could slip by cerberus in the darkness  so we lay on deck smoked cigarettes and were glad that we were alive i spat over the side and gauged the speed of the current  with this wind we could run this flood clear to rio vista i said  and its fruittime on the river said nickey  and low water on the river said i its the best time of the year to make sacramento  we sat up and looked at each other the glorious west wind was pouring over us like wine we both spat over the side and gauged the current now i contend that it was all the fault of that floodtide and fair wind they appealed to our sailor instinct if it had not been for them the whole chain of events that was to put me upon the road would have broken down  we said no word but cast off our moorings and hoisted sail our adventures up the sacramento river are no part of this narrative we subsequently made the city of sacramento and tied up at a wharf the water was fine and we spent most of our time in swimming on the sandbar above the railroad bridge we fell in with a bunch of boys likewise in swimming between swims we lay on the bank and talked they talked differently from the fellows i had been used to herding with it was a new vernacular they were roadkids and with every word they uttered the lure of the road laid hold of me more imperiously  when i was down in alabama one kid would begin or another coming up on the c  a from kc whereat a third kid on the c  a there aint no steps to the blinds and i would lie silently in the sand and listen it was at a little town in ohio on the lake shore and michigan southern a kid would start and another ever ride the cannonball on the wabash and yet another nope but ive been on the white mail out of chicago talk about railroadinwait till you hit the pennsylvania four tracks no water tanks take water on the fly thats goin some the northern pacifics a bad road now salinas is on the hog the bulls is horstile i got pinched at el paso along with moke kid talkin of pokeouts wait till you hit the french country out of montrealnot a word of englishyou say mongee madame mongee no spika da french an rub your stomach an look hungry an she gives you a slice of sowbelly an a chunk of dry punk  and i continued to lie in the sand and listen these wanderers made my oysterpiracy look like thirty cents a new world was calling to me in every word that was spokena world of rods and gunnels blind baggages and sidedoor pullmans bulls and shacks floppings and chewins pinches and getaways strong arms and bindlestiffs punks and profesh and it all spelled adventure very well i would tackle this new world i lined myself up alongside those roadkids i was just as strong as any of them just as quick just as nervy and my brain was just as good  after the swim as evening came on they dressed and went up town i went along the kids began battering the mainstem for light pieces or in other words begging for money on the main street i had never begged in my life and this was the hardest thing for me to stomach when i first went on the road i had absurd notions about begging my philosophy up to that time was that it was finer to steal than to beg and that robbery was finer still because the risk and the penalty were proportionately greater as an oyster pirate i had already earned convictions at the hands of justice which if i had tried to serve them would have required a thousand years in states prison to rob was manly to beg was sordid and despicable but i developed in the days to come all right all right till i came to look upon begging as a joyous prank a game of wits a nerveexerciser  that first night however i couldnt rise to it and the result was that when the kids were ready to go to a restaurant and eat i wasnt i was broke meeny kid i think it was gave me the price and we all ate together but while i ate i meditated the receiver it was said was as bad as the thief meeny kid had done the begging and i was profiting by it i decided that the receiver was a whole lot worse than the thief and that it shouldnt happen again and it didnt i turned out next day and threw my feet as well as the next one  nickey the greeks ambition didnt run to the road he was not a success at throwing his feet and he stowed away one night on a barge and went down river to san francisco i met him only a week ago at a pugilistic carnival he has progressed he sat in a place of honor at the ringside he is now a manager of prizefighters and proud of it in fact in a small way in local sportdom he is quite a shining light  no kid is a roadkid until he has gone over the hillsuch was the law of the road i heard expounded in sacramento all right id go over the hill and matriculate the hill by the way was the sierra nevadas the whole gang was going over the hill on a jaunt and of course id go along it was french kids first adventure on the road he had just run away from his people in san francisco it was up to him and me to deliver the goods in passing i may remark that my old title of prince had vanished i had received my monica i was now sailor kid later to be known as frisco kid when i had put the rockies between me and my native state  at 1020 pm the central pacific overland pulled out of the depot at sacramento for the eastthat particular item of timetable is indelibly engraved on my memory there were about a dozen in our gang and we strung out in the darkness ahead of the train ready to take her out all the local roadkids that we knew came down to see us offalso to ditch us if they could that was their idea of a joke and there were only about forty of them to carry it out their ringleader was a crackerjack roadkid named bob sacramento was his home town but hed hit the road pretty well everywhere over the whole country he took french kid and me aside and gave us advice something like this were goin to try an ditch your bunch see youse two are weak the rest of the push can take care of itself so as soon as youse two nail a blind deck her an stay on the decks till youse pass roseville junction at which burg the constables are horstile sloughin in everybody on sight  the engine whistled and the overland pulled out there were three blinds on herroom for all of us the dozen of us who were trying to make her out would have preferred to slip aboard quietly but our forty friends crowded on with the most amazing and shameless publicity and advertisement following bobs advice i immediately decked her that is climbed up on top of the roof of one of the mailcars there i lay down my heart jumping a few extra beats and listened to the fun the whole train crew was forward and the ditching went on fast and furious after the train had run half a mile it stopped and the crew came forward again and ditched the survivors i alone had made the train out  back at the depot about him two or three of the push that had witnessed the accident lay french kid with both legs off french kid had slipped or stumbledthat was all and the wheels had done the rest such was my initiation to the road it was two years afterward when i next saw french kid and examined his stumps this was an act of courtesy cripples always like to have their stumps examined one of the entertaining sights on the road is to witness the meeting of two cripples their common disability is a fruitful source of conversation and they tell how it happened describe what they know of the amputation pass critical judgment on their own and each others surgeons and wind up by withdrawing to one side taking off bandages and wrappings and comparing stumps  but it was not until several days later over in nevada when the push caught up with me that i learned of french kids accident the push itself arrived in bad condition it had gone through a trainwreck in the snowsheds happy joe was on crutches with two mashed legs and the rest were nursing skins and bruises  in the meantime i lay on the roof of the mailcar trying to remember whether roseville junction against which burg bob had warned me was the first stop or the second stop to make sure i delayed descending to the platform of the blind until after the second stop and then i didnt descend i was new to the game and i felt safer where i was but i never told the push that i held down the decks the whole night clear across the sierras through snowsheds and tunnels and down to truckee on the other side where i arrived at seven in the morning such a thing was disgraceful and id have been a common laughingstock this is the first time i have confessed the truth about that first ride over the hill as for the push it decided that i was all right and when i came back over the hill to sacramento i was a fullfledged roadkid  yet i had much to learn bob was my mentor and he was all right i remember one evening it was fairtime in sacramento and we were knocking about and having a good time when i lost my hat in a fight there was i bareheaded in the street and it was bob to the rescue he took me to one side from the push and told me what to do i was a bit timid of his advice i had just come out of jail where i had been three days and i knew that if the police pinched me again id get good and soaked on the other hand i couldnt show the white feather id been over the hill i was running fullfledged with the push and it was up to me to deliver the goods so i accepted bobs advice and he came along with me to see that i did it up brown  we took our position on k street on the corner i think of fifth it was early in the evening and the street was crowded bob studied the headgear of every chinaman that passed i used to wonder how the roadkids all managed to wear fivedollar stetson stiffrims and now i knew they got them the way i was going to get mine from the chinese i was nervousthere were so many people about but bob was cool as an iceberg several times when i started forward toward a chinaman all nerved and keyed up bob dragged me back he wanted me to get a good hat and one that fitted now a hat came by that was the right size but not new and after a dozen impossible hats along would come one that was new but not the right size and when one did come by that was new and the right size the rim was too large or not large enough my bob was finicky i was so wrought up that id have snatched any kind of a headcovering  at last came the hat the one hat in sacramento for me i knew it was a winner as soon as i looked at it i glanced at bob he sent a sweeping lookabout for police then nodded his head i lifted the hat from the chinamans head and pulled it down on my own it was a perfect fit then i started i heard bob crying out and i caught a glimpse of him blocking the irate mongolian and tripping him up i ran on i turned up the next corner and around the next this street was not so crowded as k and i walked along in quietude catching my breath and congratulating myself upon my hat and my getaway  and then suddenly around the corner at my back came the bareheaded chinaman with him were a couple more chinamen and at their heels were half a dozen men and boys i sprinted to the next corner crossed the street and rounded the following corner i decided that i had surely played him out and i dropped into a walk again but around the corner at my heels came that persistent mongolian it was the old story of the hare and the tortoise he could not run so fast as i but he stayed with it plodding along at a shambling and deceptive trot and wasting much good breath in noisy imprecations he called all sacramento to witness the dishonor that had been done him and a goodly portion of sacramento heard and flocked at his heels and i ran on like the hare and ever that persistent mongolian with the increasing rabble overhauled me but finally when a policeman had joined his following i let out all my links i twisted and turned and i swear i ran at least twenty blocks on the straight away and i never saw that chinaman again the hat was a dandy a brandnew stetson just out of the shop and it was the envy of the whole push furthermore it was the symbol that i had delivered the goods i wore it for over a year  roadkids are nice little chapswhen you get them alone and they are telling you how it happened but take my word for it watch out for them when they run in pack then they are wolves and like wolves they are capable of dragging down the strongest man at such times they are not cowardly they will fling themselves upon a man and hold on with every ounce of strength in their wiry bodies till he is thrown and helpless more than once have i seen them do it and i know whereof i speak their motive is usually robbery and watch out for the strong arm every kid in the push i travelled with was expert at it even french kid mastered it before he lost his legs  i have strong upon me now a vision of what i once saw in the willows the willows was a clump of trees in a waste piece of land near the railway depot and not more than five minutes walk from the heart of sacramento it is nighttime and the scene is illumined by the thin light of stars i see a husky laborer in the midst of a pack of roadkids he is infuriated and cursing them not a bit afraid confident of his own strength he weighs about one hundred and eighty pounds and his muscles are hard but he doesnt know what he is up against the kids are snarling it is not pretty they make a rush from all sides and he lashes out and whirls barber kid is standing beside me as the man whirls barber kid leaps forward and does the trick into the mans back goes his knee around the mans neck from behind passes his right hand the bone of the wrist pressing against the jugular vein barber kid throws his whole weight backward it is a powerful leverage besides the mans wind has been shut off it is the strong arm  the man resists but he is already practically helpless the roadkids are upon him from every side clinging to arms and legs and body and like a wolf at the throat of a moose barber kid hangs on and drags backward over the man goes and down under the heap barber kid changes the position of his own body but never lets go while some of the kids are going through the victim others are holding his legs so that he cannot kick and thresh about they improve the opportunity by taking off the mans shoes as for him he has given in he is beaten also what of the strong arm at his throat he is short of wind he is making ugly choking noises and the kids hurry they really dont want to kill him all is done at a word all holds are released at once and the kids scatter one of them lugging the shoeshe knows where he can get half a dollar for them the man sits up and looks about him dazed and helpless even if he wanted to barefooted pursuit in the darkness would be hopeless i linger a moment and watch him he is feeling at his throat making dry hawking noises and jerking his head in a quaint way as though to assure himself that the neck is not dislocated then i slip away to join the push and see that man no morethough i shall always see him sitting there in the starlight somewhat dazed a bit frightened greatly dishevelled and making quaint jerking movements of head and neck  drunken men are the especial prey of the roadkids robbing a drunken man they call rolling a stiff and wherever they are they are on the constant lookout for drunks the drunk is their particular meat as the fly is the particular meat of the spider the rolling of a stiff is ofttimes an amusing sight especially when the stiff is helpless and when interference is unlikely at the first swoop the stiffs money and jewellery go then the kids sit around their victim in a sort of powwow a kid generates a fancy for the stiffs necktie off it comes another kid is after underclothes off they come and a knife quickly abbreviates arms and legs friendly hoboes may be called in to take the coat and trousers which are too large for the kids and in the end they depart leaving beside the stiff the heap of their discarded rags  another vision comes to me it is a dark night my push is coming along the sidewalk in the suburbs ahead of us under an electric light a man crosses the street diagonally there is something tentative and desultory in his walk the kids scent the game on the instant the man is drunk he blunders across the opposite sidewalk and is lost in the darkness as he takes a shortcut through a vacant lot no hunting cry is raised but the pack flings itself forward in quick pursuit in the middle of the vacant lot it comes upon him but what is thissnarling and strange forms small and dim and menacing are between the pack and its prey it is another pack of roadkids and in the hostile pause we learn that it is their meat that they have been trailing it a dozen blocks and more and that we are butting in but it is the world primeval these wolves are baby wolves as a matter of fact i dont think one of them was over twelve or thirteen years of age i met some of them afterward and learned that they had just arrived that day over the hill and that they hailed from denver and salt lake city our pack flings forward the baby wolves squeal and screech and fight like little demons all about the drunken man rages the struggle for the possession of him down he goes in the thick of it and the combat rages over his body after the fashion of the greeks and trojans over the body and armor of a fallen hero amid cries and tears and wailings the baby wolves are dispossessed and my pack rolls the stiff but always i remember the poor stiff and his befuddled amazement at the abrupt eruption of battle in the vacant lot i see him now dim in the darkness titubating in stupid wonder goodnaturedly essaying the role of peacemaker in that multitudinous scrap the significance of which he did not understand and the really hurt expression on his face when he unoffending he was clutched at by many hands and dragged down in the thick of the press  bindlestiffs are favorite prey of the roadkids a bindlestiff is a working tramp he takes his name from the roll of blankets he carries which is known as a bindle because he does work a bindlestiff is expected usually to have some small change about him and it is after that small change that the roadkids go the best huntingground for bindlestiffs is in the sheds barns lumberyards railroadyards etc on the edges of a city and the time for hunting is the night when the bindlestiff seeks these places to roll up in his blankets and sleep  gaycats also come to grief at the hands of the roadkid in more familiar parlance gaycats are shorthorns chechaquos new chums or tenderfeet a gaycat is a newcomer on the road who is mangrown or at least youthgrown a boy on the road on the other hand no matter how green he is is never a gaycat he is a roadkid or a punk and if he travels with a profesh he is known possessively as a prushun i was never a prushun for i did not take kindly to possession i was first a roadkid and then a profesh because i started in young i practically skipped my gaycat apprenticeship for a short period during the time i was exchanging my frisco kid monica for that of sailor jack i labored under the suspicion of being a gaycat but closer acquaintance on the part of those that suspected me quickly disabused their minds and in a short time i acquired the unmistakable airs and earmarks of the blowedintheglass profesh and be it known here and now that the profesh are the aristocracy of the road they are the lords and masters the aggressive men the primordial noblemen the blond beasts so beloved of nietzsche  when i came back over the hill from nevada i found that some river pirate had stolen dinny mccreas boat a funny thing at this day is that i cannot remember what became of the skiff in which nickey the greek and i sailed from oakland to port costa i know that the constable didnt get it and i know that it didnt go with us up the sacramento river and that is all i do know with the loss of dinny mccreas boat i was pledged to the road and when i grew tired of sacramento i said goodby to the push which in its friendly way tried to ditch me from a freight as i left town and started on a passear down the valley of the san joaquin the road had gripped me and would not let me go and later when i had voyaged to sea and done one thing and another i returned to the road to make longer flights to be a comet and a profesh and to plump into the bath of sociology that wet me to the skin     two thousand stiffs   a stiff is a tramp it was once my fortune to travel a few weeks with a push that numbered two thousand this was known as kellys army across the wild and woolly west clear from california general kelly and his heroes had captured trains but they fell down when they crossed the missouri and went up against the effete east the east hadnt the slightest intention of giving free transportation to two thousand hoboes kellys army lay helplessly for some time at council bluffs the day i joined it made desperate by delay it marched out to capture a train  it was quite an imposing sight general kelly sat a magnificent black charger and with waving banners to the martial music of fife and drum corps company by company in two divisions his two thousand stiffs countermarched before him and hit the wagonroad to the little burg of weston seven miles away being the latest recruit i was in the last company of the last regiment of the second division and furthermore in the last rank of the rearguard the army went into camp at weston beside the railroad trackbeside the tracks rather for two roads went through the chicago milwaukee and st paul and the rock island  our intention was to take the first train out but the railroad officials coppered our playand won there was no first train they tied up the two lines and stopped running trains in the meantime while we lay by the dead tracks the good people of omaha and council bluffs were bestirring themselves preparations were making to form a mob capture a train in council bluffs run it down to us and make us a present of it the railroad officials coppered that play too they didnt wait for the mob early in the morning of the second day an engine with a single private car attached arrived at the station and sidetracked at this sign that life had renewed in the dead roads the whole army lined up beside the track  but never did life renew so monstrously on a dead railroad as it did on those two roads from the west came the whistle of a locomotive it was coming in our direction bound east we were bound east a stir of preparation ran down our ranks the whistle tooted fast and furiously and the train thundered at top speed the hobo didnt live that could have boarded it another locomotive whistled and another train came through at top speed and another and another train after train train after train till toward the last the trains were composed of passenger coaches boxcars flatcars dead engines cabooses mailcars wrecking appliances and all the riffraff of wornout and abandoned rollingstock that collects in the yards of great railways when the yards at council bluffs had been completely cleaned the private car and engine went east and the tracks died for keeps  that day went by and the next and nothing moved and in the meantime pelted by sleet and rain and hail the two thousand hoboes lay beside the track but that night the good people of council bluffs went the railroad officials one better a mob formed in council bluffs crossed the river to omaha and there joined with another mob in a raid on the union pacific yards first they captured an engine next they knocked a train together and then the united mobs piled aboard crossed the missouri and ran down the rock island right of way to turn the train over to us the railway officials tried to copper this play but fell down to the mortal terror of the section boss and one member of the section gang at weston this pair under secret telegraphic orders tried to wreck our trainload of sympathizers by tearing up the track it happened that we were suspicious and had our patrols out caught redhanded at trainwrecking and surrounded by twenty hundred infuriated hoboes that sectiongang boss and assistant prepared to meet death i dont remember what saved them unless it was the arrival of the train  it was our turn to fall down and we did hard in their haste the two mobs had neglected to make up a sufficiently long train there wasnt room for two thousand hoboes to ride so the mobs and the hoboes had a talkfest fraternized sang songs and parted the mobs going back on their captured train to omaha the hoboes pulling out next morning on a hundredandfortymile march to des moines it was not until kellys army crossed the missouri that it began to walk and after that it never rode again it cost the railroads slathers of money but they were acting on principle and they won  underwood leola menden avoca walnut marno atlantic wyoto anita adair adam casey stuart dexter carlham de soto van meter booneville commerce valley junctionhow the names of the towns come back to me as i con the map and trace our route through the fat iowa country and the hospitable iowa farmerfolk they turned out with their wagons and carried our baggage gave us hot lunches at noon by the wayside mayors of comfortable little towns made speeches of welcome and hastened us on our way deputations of little girls and maidens came out to meet us and the good citizens turned out by hundreds locked arms and marched with us down their main streets it was circus day when we came to town and every day was circus day for there were many towns  in the evenings our camps were invaded by whole populations every company had its campfire and around each fire something was doing the cooks in my company company l were songanddance artists and contributed most of our entertainment in another part of the encampment the glee club would be singingone of its star voices was the dentist drawn from company l and we were mighty proud of him also he pulled teeth for the whole army and since the extractions usually occurred at mealtime our digestions were stimulated by variety of incident the dentist had no anaesthetics but two or three of us were always on tap to volunteer to hold down the patient in addition to the stunts of the companies and the glee club church services were usually held local preachers officiating and always there was a great making of political speeches all these things ran neck and neck it was a fullblown midway a lot of talent can be dug out of two thousand hoboes i remember we had a picked baseball nine and on sundays we made a practice of putting it all over the local nines sometimes we did it twice on sundays  last year while on a lecturing trip i rode into des moines in a pullmani dont mean a sidedoor pullman but the real thing on the outskirts of the city i saw the old stoveworks and my heart leaped it was there at the stoveworks a dozen years before that the army lay down and swore a mighty oath that its feet were sore and that it would walk no more we took possession of the stoveworks and told des moines that we had come to staythat wed walked in but wed be blessed if wed walk out des moines was hospitable but this was too much of a good thing do a little mental arithmetic gentle reader two thousand hoboes eating three square meals make six thousand meals per day fortytwo thousand meals per week or one hundred and sixtyeight thousand meals per shortest month in the calendar thats going some we had no money it was up to des moines  des moines was desperate we lay in camp made political speeches held sacred concerts pulled teeth played baseball and sevenup and ate our six thousand meals per day and des moines paid for it des moines pleaded with the railroads but they were obdurate they had said we shouldnt ride and that settled it to permit us to ride would be to establish a precedent and there werent going to be any precedents and still we went on eating that was the terrifying factor in the situation we were bound for washington and des moines would have had to float municipal bonds to pay all our railroad fares even at special rates and if we remained much longer shed have to float bonds anyway to feed us  then some local genius solved the problem we wouldnt walk very good we should ride from des moines to keokuk on the mississippi flowed the des moines river this particular stretch of river was three hundred miles long we could ride on it said the local genius and once equipped with floating stock we could ride on down the mississippi to the ohio and thence up the ohio winding up with a short portage over the mountains to washington  des moines took up a subscription publicspirited citizens contributed several thousand dollars lumber rope nails and cotton for calking were bought in large quantities and on the banks of the des moines was inaugurated a tremendous era of shipbuilding now the des moines is a picayune stream unduly dignified by the appellation of river in our spacious western land it would be called a creek the oldest inhabitants shook their heads and said we couldnt make it that there wasnt enough water to float us des moines didnt care so long as it got rid of us and we were such wellfed optimists that we didnt care either  on wednesday may 9 1894 we got under way and started on our colossal picnic des moines had got off pretty easily and she certainly owes a statue in bronze to the local genius who got her out of her difficulty true des moines had to pay for our boats we had eaten sixtysix thousand meals at the stoveworks and we took twelve thousand additional meals along with us in our commissaryas a precaution against famine in the wilds but then think what it would have meant if we had remained at des moines eleven months instead of eleven days also when we departed we promised des moines wed come back if the river failed to float us  it was all very well having twelve thousand meals in the commissary and no doubt the commissary ducks enjoyed them for the commissary promptly got lost and my boat for one never saw it again the company formation was hopelessly broken up during the rivertrip in any camp of men there will always be found a certain percentage of shirks of helpless of just ordinary and of hustlers there were ten men in my boat and they were the cream of company l every man was a hustler for two reasons i was included in the ten first i was as good a hustler as ever threw his feet and next i was sailor jack i understood boats and boating the ten of us forgot the remaining forty men of company l and by the time we had missed one meal we promptly forgot the commissary we were independent we went down the river on our own hustling our chewins beating every boat in the fleet and alas that i must say it sometimes taking possession of the stores the farmerfolk had collected for the army  for a good part of the three hundred miles we were from half a day to a day or so in advance of the army we had managed to get hold of several american flags when we approached a small town or when we saw a group of farmers gathered on the bank we ran up our flags called ourselves the advance boat and demanded to know what provisions had been collected for the army we represented the army of course and the provisions were turned over to us but there wasnt anything small about us we never took more than we could get away with but we did take the cream of everything for instance if some philanthropic farmer had donated several dollars worth of tobacco we took it so also we took butter and sugar coffee and canned goods but when the stores consisted of sacks of beans and flour or two or three slaughtered steers we resolutely refrained and went our way leaving orders to turn such provisions over to the commissary boats whose business was to follow behind us  my but the ten of us did live on the fat of the land for a long time general kelly vainly tried to head us off he sent two rowers in a light roundbottomed boat to overtake us and put a stop to our piratical careers they overtook us all right but they were two and we were ten they were empowered by general kelly to make us prisoners and they told us so when we expressed disinclination to become prisoners they hurried ahead to the next town to invoke the aid of the authorities we went ashore immediately and cooked an early supper and under the cloak of darkness we ran by the town and its authorities  i kept a diary on part of the trip and as i read it over now i note one persistently recurring phrase namely living fine we did live fine we even disdained to use coffee boiled in water we made our coffee out of milk calling the wonderful beverage if i remember rightly pale vienna  while we were ahead skimming the cream and while the commissary was lost far behind the main army coming along in the middle starved this was hard on the army ill allow but then the ten of us were individualists we had initiative and enterprise we ardently believed that the grub was to the man who got there first the pale vienna to the strong on one stretch the army went fortyeight hours without grub and then it arrived at a small village of some three hundred inhabitants the name of which i do not remember though i think it was red rock this town following the practice of all towns through which the army passed had appointed a committee of safety counting five to a family red rock consisted of sixty households her committee of safety was scared stiff by the eruption of two thousand hungry hoboes who lined their boats two and three deep along the river bank general kelly was a fair man he had no intention of working a hardship on the village he did not expect sixty households to furnish two thousand meals besides the army had its treasurechest  but the committee of safety lost its head no encouragement to the invader was its programme and when general kelly wanted to buy food the committee turned him down it had nothing to sell general kellys money was no good in their burg and then general kelly went into action the bugles blew the army left the boats and on top of the bank formed in battle array the committee was there to see general kellys speech was brief  boys he said when did you eat last  day before yesterday they shouted  are you hungry  a mighty affirmation from two thousand throats shook the atmosphere then general kelly turned to the committee of safety  you see gentlemen the situation my men have eaten nothing in fortyeight hours if i turn them loose upon your town ill not be responsible for what happens they are desperate i offered to buy food for them but you refused to sell i now withdraw my offer instead i shall demand i give you five minutes to decide either kill me six steers and give me four thousand rations or i turn the men loose five minutes gentlemen  the terrified committee of safety looked at the two thousand hungry hoboes and collapsed it didnt wait the five minutes it wasnt going to take any chances the killing of the steers and the collecting of the requisition began forthwith and the army dined  and still the ten graceless individualists soared along ahead and gathered in everything in sight but general kelly fixed us he sent horsemen down each bank warning farmers and townspeople against us they did their work thoroughly all right the erstwhile hospitable farmers met us with the icy mit also they summoned the constables when we tied up to the bank and loosed the dogs i know two of the latter caught me with a barbedwire fence between me and the river i was carrying two buckets of milk for the pale vienna i didnt damage the fence any but we drank plebian coffee boiled with vulgar water and it was up to me to throw my feet for another pair of trousers i wonder gentle reader if you ever essayed hastily to climb a barbedwire fence with a bucket of milk in each hand ever since that day i have had a prejudice against barbed wire and i have gathered statistics on the subject  unable to make an honest living so long as general kelly kept his two horsemen ahead of us we returned to the army and raised a revolution it was a small affair but it devastated company l of the second division the captain of company l refused to recognize us said we were deserters and traitors and scalawags and when he drew rations for company l from the commissary he wouldnt give us any that captain didnt appreciate us or he wouldnt have refused us grub promptly we intrigued with the first lieutenant he joined us with the ten men in his boat and in return we elected him captain of company m the captain of company l raised a roar down upon us came general kelly colonel speed and colonel baker the twenty of us stood firm and our revolution was ratified  but we never bothered with the commissary our hustlers drew better rations from the farmers our new captain however doubted us he never knew when hed see the ten of us again once we got under way in the morning so he called in a blacksmith to clinch his captaincy in the stern of our boat one on each side were driven two heavy eyebolts of iron correspondingly on the bow of his boat were fastened two huge iron hooks the boats were brought together end on the hooks dropped into the eyebolts and there we were hard and fast we couldnt lose that captain but we were irrepressible out of our very manacles we wrought an invincible device that enabled us to put it all over every other boat in the fleet  like all great inventions this one of ours was accidental we discovered it the first time we ran on a snag in a bit of a rapid the headboat hung up and anchored and the tailboat swung around in the current pivoting the headboat on the snag i was at the stern of the tailboat steering in vain we tried to shove off then i ordered the men from the headboat into the tailboat immediately the headboat floated clear and its men returned into it after that snags reefs shoals and bars had no terrors for us the instant the headboat struck the men in it leaped into the tailboat of course the headboat floated over the obstruction and the tailboat then struck like automatons the twenty men now in the tailboat leaped into the headboat and the tailboat floated past  the boats used by the army were all alike made by the mile and sawed off they were flatboats and their lines were rectangles each boat was six feet wide ten feet long and a foot and a half deep thus when our two boats were hooked together i sat at the stern steering a craft twenty feet long containing twenty husky hoboes who spelled each other at the oars and paddles and loaded with blankets cooking outfit and our own private commissary  still we caused general kelly trouble he had called in his horsemen and substituted three policeboats that travelled in the van and allowed no boats to pass them the craft containing company m crowded the policeboats hard we could have passed them easily but it was against the rules so we kept a respectful distance astern and waited ahead we knew was virgin farming country unbegged and generous but we waited white water was all we needed and when we rounded a bend and a rapid showed up we knew what would happen smash policeboat number one goes on a boulder and hangs up bang policeboat number two follows suit whop policeboat number three encounters the common fate of all of course our boat does the same things but one two the men are out of the headboat and into the tailboat one two they are out of the tailboat and into the headboat and one two the men who belong in the tailboat are back in it and we are dashing on stop you blanketyblankblanks shriek the policeboats how can weblank the blanketyblank river anyway we wail plaintively as we surge past caught in that remorseless current that sweeps us on out of sight and into the hospitable farmercountry that replenishes our private commissary with the cream of its contributions again we drink pale vienna and realize that the grub is to the man who gets there  poor general kelly he devised another scheme the whole fleet started ahead of us company m of the second division started in its proper place in the line which was last and it took us only one day to put the kibosh on that particular scheme twentyfive miles of bad water lay before usall rapids shoals bars and boulders it was over that stretch of water that the oldest inhabitants of des moines had shaken their heads nearly two hundred boats entered the bad water ahead of us and they piled up in the most astounding manner we went through that stranded fleet like hemlock through the fire there was no avoiding the boulders bars and snags except by getting out on the bank we didnt avoid them we went right over them one two one two headboat tailboat headboat tailboat all hands back and forth and back again we camped that night alone and loafed in camp all of next day while the army patched and repaired its wrecked boats and straggled up to us  there was no stopping our cussedness we rigged up a mast piled on the canvas blankets and travelled short hours while the army worked overtime to keep us in sight then general kelly had recourse to diplomacy no boat could touch us in the straightaway without discussion we were the hottest bunch that ever came down the des moines the ban of the policeboats was lifted colonel speed was put aboard and with this distinguished officer we had the honor of arriving first at keokuk on the mississippi and right here i want to say to general kelly and colonel speed that heres my hand you were heroes both of you and you were men and im sorry for at least ten per cent of the trouble that was given you by the headboat of company m  at keokuk the whole fleet was lashed together in a huge raft and after being windbound a day a steamboat took us in tow down the mississippi to quincy illinois where we camped across the river on goose island here the raft idea was abandoned the boats being joined together in groups of four and decked over somebody told me that quincy was the richest town of its size in the united states when i heard this i was immediately overcome by an irresistible impulse to throw my feet no blowedintheglass profesh could possibly pass up such a promising burg i crossed the river to quincy in a small dugout but i came back in a large riverboat down to the gunwales with the results of my thrown feet of course i kept all the money i had collected though i paid the boathire also i took my pick of the underwear socks castoff clothes shirts kicks and skypieces and when company m had taken all it wanted there was still a respectable heap that was turned over to company l alas i was young and prodigal in those days i told a thousand stories to the good people of quincy and every story was good but since i have come to write for the magazines i have often regretted the wealth of story the fecundity of fiction i lavished that day in quincy illinois  it was at hannibal missouri that the ten invincibles went to pieces it was not planned we just naturally flew apart the boilermaker and i deserted secretly on the same day scotty and davy made a swift sneak for the illinois shore also mcavoy and fish achieved their getaway this accounts for six of the ten what became of the remaining four i do not know as a sample of life on the road i make the following quotation from my diary of the several days following my desertion  friday may 25th boilermaker and i left the camp on the island we went ashore on the illinois side in a skiff and walked six miles on the cb  q to fell creek we had gone six miles out of our way but we got on a handcar and rode six miles to hulls on the wabash while there we met mcavoy fish scotty and davy who had also pulled out from the army  saturday may 26th at 211 am we caught the cannonball as she slowed up at the crossing scotty and davy were ditched the four of us were ditched at the bluffs forty miles farther on in the afternoon fish and mcavoy caught a freight while boilermaker and i were away getting something to eat  sunday may 27th at 321 am we caught the cannonball and found scotty and davy on the blind we were all ditched at daylight at jacksonville the c  a runs through here and were going to take that boilermaker went off but didnt return guess he caught a freight  monday may 28th boilermaker didnt show up scotty and davy went off to sleep somewhere and didnt get back in time to catch the kc passenger at 330 am i caught her and rode her till after sunrise to masson city 25000 inhabitants caught a cattle train and rode all night  tuesday may 29th arrived in chicago at 7 am                                       and years afterward in china i had the grief of learning that the device we employed to navigate the rapids of the des moinesthe onetwoonetwo headboattailboat propositionwas not originated by us i learned that the chinese riverboatmen had for thousands of years used a similar device to negotiate bad water it is a good stunt all right even if we dont get the credit it answers dr jordans test of truth will it work will you trust your life to it     bulls   if the tramp were suddenly to pass away from the united states widespread misery for many families would follow the tramp enables thousands of men to earn honest livings educate their children and bring them up godfearing and industrious i know at one time my father was a constable and hunted tramps for a living the community paid him so much per head for all the tramps he could catch and also i believe he got mileage fees ways and means was always a pressing problem in our household and the amount of meat on the table the new pair of shoes the days outing or the textbook for school were dependent upon my fathers luck in the chase well i remember the suppressed eagerness and the suspense with which i waited to learn each morning what the results of his past nights toil had beenhow many tramps he had gathered in and what the chances were for convicting them and so it was when later as a tramp i succeeded in eluding some predatory constable i could not but feel sorry for the little boys and girls at home in that constables house it seemed to me in a way that i was defrauding those little boys and girls of some of the good things of life  but its all in the game the hobo defies society and societys watchdogs make a living out of him some hoboes like to be caught by the watchdogsespecially in wintertime of course such hoboes select communities where the jails are good wherein no work is performed and the food is substantial also there have been and most probably still are constables who divide their fees with the hoboes they arrest such a constable does not have to hunt he whistles and the game comes right up to his hand it is surprising the money that is made out of stonebroke tramps all through the southat least when i was hoboingare convict camps and plantations where the time of convicted hoboes is bought by the farmers and where the hoboes simply have to work then there are places like the quarries at rutland vermont where the hobo is exploited the unearned energy in his body which he has accumulated by battering on the drag or slamming gates being extracted for the benefit of that particular community  now i dont know anything about the quarries at rutland vermont im very glad that i dont when i remember how near i was to getting into them tramps pass the word along and i first heard of those quarries when i was in indiana but when i got into new england i heard of them continually and always with dangersignals flying they want men in the quarries the passing hoboes said and they never give a stiff less than ninety days by the time i got into new hampshire i was pretty well keyed up over those quarries and i fought shy of railroad cops bulls and constables as i never had before  one evening i went down to the railroad yards at concord and found a freight train made up and ready to start i located an empty boxcar slid open the sidedoor and climbed in it was my hope to win across to white river by morning that would bring me into vermont and not more than a thousand miles from rutland but after that as i worked north the distance between me and the point of danger would begin to increase in the car i found a gaycat who displayed unusual trepidation at my entrance he took me for a shack brakeman and when he learned i was only a stiff he began talking about the quarries at rutland as the cause of the fright i had given him he was a young country fellow and had beaten his way only over local stretches of road  the freight got under way and we lay down in one end of the boxcar and went to sleep two or three hours afterward at a stop i was awakened by the noise of the righthand door being softly slid open the gaycat slept on i made no movement though i veiled my eyes with my lashes to a little slit through which i could see out a lantern was thrust in through the doorway followed by the head of a shack he discovered us and looked at us for a moment i was prepared for a violent expression on his part or the customary hit the grit you son of a toad instead of this he cautiously withdrew the lantern and very very softly slid the door to this struck me as eminently unusual and suspicious i listened and softly i heard the hasp drop into place the door was latched on the outside we could not open it from the inside one way of sudden exit from that car was blocked it would never do i waited a few seconds then crept to the lefthand door and tried it it was not yet latched i opened it dropped to the ground and closed it behind me then i passed across the bumpers to the other side of the train i opened the door the shack had latched climbed in and closed it behind me both exits were available again the gaycat was still asleep  the train got under way it came to the next stop i heard footsteps in the gravel then the lefthand door was thrown open noisily the gaycat awoke i made believe to awake and we sat up and stared at the shack and his lantern he didnt waste any time getting down to business  i want three dollars he said  we got on our feet and came nearer to him to confer we expressed an absolute and devoted willingness to give him three dollars but explained our wretched luck that compelled our desire to remain unsatisfied the shack was incredulous he dickered with us he would compromise for two dollars we regretted our condition of poverty he said uncomplimentary things called us sons of toads and damned us from hell to breakfast then he threatened he explained that if we didnt dig up hed lock us in and carry us on to white river and turn us over to the authorities he also explained all about the quarries at rutland  now that shack thought he had us dead to rights was not he guarding the one door and had he not himself latched the opposite door but a few minutes before when he began talking about quarries the frightened gaycat started to sidle across to the other door the shack laughed loud and long dont be in a hurry he said i locked that door on the outside at the last stop so implicitly did he believe the door to be locked that his words carried conviction the gaycat believed and was in despair  the shack delivered his ultimatum either we should dig up two dollars or he would lock us in and turn us over to the constable at white riverand that meant ninety days and the quarries now gentle reader just suppose that the other door had been locked behold the precariousness of human life for lack of a dollar id have gone to the quarries and served three months as a convict slave so would the gaycat count me out for i was hopeless but consider the gaycat he might have come out after those ninety days pledged to a life of crime and later he might have broken your skull even your skull with a blackjack in an endeavor to take possession of the money on your personand if not your skull then some other poor and unoffending creatures skull  but the door was unlocked and i alone knew it the gaycat and i begged for mercy i joined in the pleading and wailing out of sheer cussedness i suppose but i did my best i told a story that would have melted the heart of any mug but it didnt melt the heart of that sordid moneygrasper of a shack when he became convinced that we didnt have any money he slid the door shut and latched it then lingered a moment on the chance that we had fooled him and that we would now offer him the two dollars  then it was that i let out a few links i called him a son of a toad i called him all the other things he had called me and then i called him a few additional things i came from the west where men knew how to swear and i wasnt going to let any mangy shack on a measly new england jerk put it over me in vividness and vigor of language at first the shack tried to laugh it down then he made the mistake of attempting to reply i let out a few more links and i cut him to the raw and therein rubbed winged and flaming epithets nor was my fine frenzy all whim and literary i was indignant at this vile creature who in default of a dollar would consign me to three months of slavery furthermore i had a sneaking idea that he got a drag out of the constable fees  but i fixed him i lacerated his feelings and pride several dollars worth he tried to scare me by threatening to come in after me and kick the stuffing out of me in return i promised to kick him in the face while he was climbing in the advantage of position was with me and he saw it so he kept the door shut and called for help from the rest of the traincrew i could hear them answering and crunching through the gravel to him and all the time the other door was unlatched and they didnt know it and in the meantime the gaycat was ready to die with fear  oh i was a herowith my line of retreat straight behind me i slanged the shack and his mates till they threw the door open and i could see their infuriated faces in the shine of the lanterns it was all very simple to them they had us cornered in the car and they were going to come in and manhandle us they started i didnt kick anybody in the face i jerked the opposite door open and the gaycat and i went out the traincrew took after us  we went overif i remember correctlya stone fence but i have no doubts of recollection about where we found ourselves in the darkness i promptly fell over a gravestone the gaycat sprawled over another and then we got the chase of our lives through that graveyard the ghosts must have thought we were going some so did the traincrew for when we emerged from the graveyard and plunged across a road into a dark wood the shacks gave up the pursuit and went back to their train a little later that night the gaycat and i found ourselves at the well of a farmhouse we were after a drink of water but we noticed a small rope that ran down one side of the well we hauled it up and found on the end of it a galloncan of cream and that is as near as i got to the quarries of rutland vermont  when hoboes pass the word along concerning a town that the bulls is horstile avoid that town or if you must go through softly there are some towns that one must always go through softly such a town was cheyenne on the union pacific it had a national reputation for being horstileand it was all due to the efforts of one jeff carr if i remember his name aright jeff carr could size up the front of a hobo on the instant he never entered into discussion in the one moment he sized up the hobo and in the next he struck out with both fists a club or anything else he had handy after he had manhandled the hobo he started him out of town with a promise of worse if he ever saw him again jeff carr knew the game north south east and west to the uttermost confines of the united states canada and mexico included the manhandled hoboes carried the word that cheyenne was horstile fortunately i never encountered jeff carr i passed through cheyenne in a blizzard there were eightyfour hoboes with me at the time the strength of numbers made us pretty nonchalant on most things but not on jeff carr the connotation of jeff carr stunned our imagination numbed our virility and the whole gang was mortally scared of meeting him  it rarely pays to stop and enter into explanations with bulls when they look horstile a swift getaway is the thing to do it took me some time to learn this but the finishing touch was put upon me by a bull in new york city ever since that time it has been an automatic process with me to make a run for it when i see a bull reaching for me this automatic process has become a mainspring of conduct in me wound up and ready for instant release i shall never get over it should i be eighty years old hobbling along the street on crutches and should a policeman suddenly reach out for me i know id drop the crutches and run like a deer  the finishing touch to my education in bulls was received on a hot summer afternoon in new york city it was during a week of scorching weather i had got into the habit of throwing my feet in the morning and of spending the afternoon in the little park that is hard by newspaper row and the city hall it was near there that i could buy from pushcart men current books that had been injured in the making or binding for a few cents each then right in the park itself were little booths where one could buy glorious icecold sterilized milk and buttermilk at a penny a glass every afternoon i sat on a bench and read and went on a milk debauch i got away with from five to ten glasses each afternoon it was dreadfully hot weather  so here i was a meek and studious milkdrinking hobo and behold what i got for it one afternoon i arrived at the park a fresh bookpurchase under my arm and a tremendous buttermilk thirst under my shirt in the middle of the street in front of the city hall i noticed as i came along heading for the buttermilk booth that a crowd had formed it was right where i was crossing the street so i stopped to see the cause of the collection of curious men at first i could see nothing then from the sounds i heard and from a glimpse i caught i knew that it was a bunch of gamins playing peewee now peewee is not permitted in the streets of new york i didnt know that but i learned pretty lively i had paused possibly thirty seconds in which time i had learned the cause of the crowd when i heard a gamin yell bull the gamins knew their business they ran i didnt  the crowd broke up immediately and started for the sidewalk on both sides of the street i started for the sidewalk on the parkside there must have been fifty men who had been in the original crowd who were heading in the same direction we were loosely strung out i noticed the bull a strapping policeman in a gray suit he was coming along the middle of the street without haste merely sauntering i noticed casually that he changed his course and was heading obliquely for the same sidewalk that i was heading for directly he sauntered along threading the strungout crowd and i noticed that his course and mine would cross each other i was so innocent of wrongdoing that in spite of my education in bulls and their ways i apprehended nothing i never dreamed that bull was after me out of my respect for the law i was actually all ready to pause the next moment and let him cross in front of me the pause came all right but it was not of my volition also it was a backward pause without warning that bull had suddenly launched out at me on the chest with both hands at the same moment verbally he cast the bar sinister on my genealogy  all my free american blood boiled all my libertyloving ancestors clamored in me what do you mean i demanded you see i wanted an explanation and i got it bang his club came down on top of my head and i was reeling backward like a drunken man the curious faces of the onlookers billowing up and down like the waves of the sea my precious book falling from under my arm into the dirt the bull advancing with the club ready for another blow and in that dizzy moment i had a vision i saw that club descending many times upon my head i saw myself bloody and battered and hardlooking in a policecourt i heard a charge of disorderly conduct profane language resisting an officer and a few other things read by a clerk and i saw myself across in blackwells island oh i knew the game i lost all interest in explanations i didnt stop to pick up my precious unread book i turned and ran i was pretty sick but i ran and run i shall to my dying day whenever a bull begins to explain with a club  why years after my tramping days when i was a student in the university of california one night i went to the circus after the show and the concert i lingered on to watch the working of the transportation machinery of a great circus the circus was leaving that night by a bonfire i came upon a bunch of small boys there were about twenty of them and as they talked with one another i learned that they were going to run away with the circus now the circusmen didnt want to be bothered with this mess of urchins and a telephone to police headquarters had coppered the play a squad of ten policemen had been despatched to the scene to arrest the small boys for violating the nine oclock curfew ordinance the policemen surrounded the bonfire and crept up close to it in the darkness at the signal they made a rush each policeman grabbing at the youngsters as he would grab into a basket of squirming eels  now i didnt know anything about the coming of the police and when i saw the sudden eruption of brassbuttoned helmeted bulls each of them reaching with both hands all the forces and stability of my being were overthrown remained only the automatic process to run and i ran i didnt know i was running i didnt know anything it was as i have said automatic there was no reason for me to run i was not a hobo i was a citizen of that community it was my home town i was guilty of no wrongdoing i was a college man i had even got my name in the papers and i wore good clothes that had never been slept in and yet i ranblindly madly like a startled deer for over a block and when i came to myself i noted that i was still running it required a positive effort of will to stop those legs of mine  no ill never get over it i cant help it when a bull reaches i run besides i have an unhappy faculty for getting into jail i have been in jail more times since i was a hobo than when i was one i start out on a sunday morning with a young lady on a bicycle ride before we can get outside the city limits we are arrested for passing a pedestrian on the sidewalk i resolve to be more careful the next time i am on a bicycle it is nighttime and my acetylenegaslamp is misbehaving i cherish the sickly flame carefully because of the ordinance i am in a hurry but i ride at a snails pace so as not to jar out the flickering flame i reach the city limits i am beyond the jurisdiction of the ordinance and i proceed to scorch to make up for lost time and half a mile farther on i am pinched by a bull and the next morning i forfeit my bail in the police court the city had treacherously extended its limits into a mile of the country and i didnt know that was all i remember my inalienable right of free speech and peaceable assemblage and i get up on a soapbox to trot out the particular economic bees that buzz in my bonnet and a bull takes me off that box and leads me to the city prison and after that i get out on bail its no use in korea i used to be arrested about every other day it was the same thing in manchuria the last time i was in japan i broke into jail under the pretext of being a russian spy it wasnt my pretext but it got me into jail just the same there is no hope for me i am fated to do the prisonerofchillon stunt yet this is prophecy  i once hypnotized a bull on boston common it was past midnight and he had me dead to rights but before i got done with him he had ponied up a silver quarter and given me the address of an allnight restaurant then there was a bull in bristol new jersey who caught me and let me go and heaven knows he had provocation enough to put me in jail i hit him the hardest ill wager he was ever hit in his life it happened this way about midnight i nailed a freight out of philadelphia the shacks ditched me she was pulling out slowly through the maze of tracks and switches of the freightyards i nailed her again and again i was ditched you see i had to nail her outside for she was a through freight with every door locked and sealed  the second time i was ditched the shack gave me a lecture he told me i was risking my life that it was a fast freight and that she went some i told him i was used to going some myself but it was no go he said he wouldnt permit me to commit suicide and i hit the grit but i nailed her a third time getting in between on the bumpers they were the most meagre bumpers i had ever seeni do not refer to the real bumpers the iron bumpers that are connected by the couplinglink and that pound and grind on each other what i refer to are the beams like huge cleats that cross the ends of freight cars just above the bumpers when one rides the bumpers he stands on these cleats one foot on each the bumpers between his feet and just beneath  but the beams or cleats i found myself on were not the broad generous ones that at that time were usually on boxcars on the contrary they were very narrownot more than an inch and a half in breadth i couldnt get half of the width of my sole on them then there was nothing to which to hold with my hands true there were the ends of the two boxcars but those ends were flat perpendicular surfaces there were no grips i could only press the flats of my palms against the carends for support but that would have been all right if the cleats for my feet had been decently wide  as the freight got out of philadelphia she began to hit up speed then i understood what the shack had meant by suicide the freight went faster and faster she was a through freight and there was nothing to stop her on that section of the pennsylvania four tracks run side by side and my eastbound freight didnt need to worry about passing westbound freights nor about being overtaken by eastbound expresses she had the track to herself and she used it i was in a precarious situation i stood with the mere edges of my feet on the narrow projections the palms of my hands pressing desperately against the flat perpendicular ends of each car and those cars moved and moved individually up and down and back and forth did you ever see a circus rider standing on two running horses with one foot on the back of each horse well that was what i was doing with several differences the circus rider had the reins to hold on to while i had nothing he stood on the broad soles of his feet while i stood on the edges of mine he bent his legs and body gaining the strength of the arch in his posture and achieving the stability of a low centre of gravity while i was compelled to stand upright and keep my legs straight he rode face forward while i was riding sidewise and also if he fell off hed get only a roll in the sawdust while id have been ground to pieces beneath the wheels  and that freight was certainly going some roaring and shrieking swinging madly around curves thundering over trestles one carend bumping up when the other was jarring down or jerking to the right at the same moment the other was lurching to the left and with me all the while praying and hoping for the train to stop but she didnt stop she didnt have to for the first last and only time on the road i got all i wanted i abandoned the bumpers and managed to get out on a sideladder it was ticklish work for i had never encountered carends that were so parsimonious of handholds and footholds as those carends were  i heard the engine whistling and i felt the speed easing down i knew the train wasnt going to stop but my mind was made up to chance it if she slowed down sufficiently the right of way at this point took a curve crossed a bridge over a canal and cut through the town of bristol this combination compelled slow speed i clung on to the sideladder and waited i didnt know it was the town of bristol we were approaching i did not know what necessitated slackening in speed all i knew was that i wanted to get off i strained my eyes in the darkness for a streetcrossing on which to land i was pretty well down the train and before my car was in the town the engine was past the station and i could feel her making speed again  then came the street it was too dark to see how wide it was or what was on the other side i knew i needed all of that street if i was to remain on my feet after i struck i dropped off on the near side it sounds easy by dropped off i mean just this i first of all on the sideladder thrust my body forward as far as i could in the direction the train was goingthis to give as much space as possible in which to gain backward momentum when i swung off then i swung swung out and backward backward with all my might and let goat the same time throwing myself backward as if i intended to strike the ground on the back of my head the whole effort was to overcome as much as possible the primary forward momentum the train had imparted to my body when my feet hit the grit my body was lying backward on the air at an angle of fortyfive degrees i had reduced the forward momentum some for when my feet struck i did not immediately pitch forward on my face instead my body rose to the perpendicular and began to incline forward in point of fact my body proper still retained much momentum while my feet through contact with the earth had lost all their momentum this momentum the feet had lost i had to supply anew by lifting them as rapidly as i could and running them forward in order to keep them under my forwardmoving body the result was that my feet beat a rapid and explosive tattoo clear across the street i didnt dare stop them if i had id have pitched forward it was up to me to keep on going  i was an involuntary projectile worrying about what was on the other side of the street and hoping that it wouldnt be a stone wall or a telegraph pole and just then i hit something horrors i saw it just the instant before the disasterof all things a bull standing there in the darkness we went down together rolling over and over and the automatic process was such in that miserable creature that in the moment of impact he reached out and clutched me and never let go we were both knocked out and he held on to a very lamblike hobo while he recovered  if that bull had any imagination he must have thought me a traveller from other worlds the man from mars just arriving for in the darkness he hadnt seen me swing from the train in fact his first words were where did you come from his next words and before i had time to answer were ive a good mind to run you in this latter i am convinced was likewise automatic he was a really good bull at heart for after i had told him a story and helped brush off his clothes he gave me until the next freight to get out of town i stipulated two things first that the freight be eastbound and second that it should not be a through freight with all doors sealed and locked to this he agreed and thus by the terms of the treaty of bristol i escaped being pinched  i remember another night in that part of the country when i just missed another bull if i had hit him id have telescoped him for i was coming down from above all holds free with several other bulls one jump behind and reaching for me this is how it happened i had been lodging in a livery stable in washington i had a boxstall and unnumbered horseblankets all to myself in return for such sumptuous accommodation i took care of a string of horses each morning i might have been there yet if it hadnt been for the bulls  one evening about nine oclock i returned to the stable to go to bed and found a crap game in full blast it had been a market day and all the negroes had money it would be well to explain the lay of the land the livery stable faced on two streets i entered the front passed through the office and came to the alley between two rows of stalls that ran the length of the building and opened out on the other street midway along this alley beneath a gasjet and between the rows of horses were about forty negroes i joined them as an onlooker i was broke and couldnt play a coon was making passes and not dragging down he was riding his luck and with each pass the total stake doubled all kinds of money lay on the floor it was fascinating with each pass the chances increased tremendously against the coon making another pass the excitement was intense and just then there came a thundering smash on the big doors that opened on the back street  a few of the negroes bolted in the opposite direction i paused from my flight a moment to grab at the all kinds of money on the floor this wasnt theft it was merely custom every man who hadnt run was grabbing the doors crashed open and swung in and through them surged a squad of bulls we surged the other way it was dark in the office and the narrow door would not permit all of us to pass out to the street at the same time things became congested a coon took a dive through the window taking the sash along with him and followed by other coons at our rear the bulls were nailing prisoners a big coon and myself made a dash at the door at the same time he was bigger than i and he pivoted me and got through first the next instant a club swatted him on the head and he went down like a steer another squad of bulls was waiting outside for us they knew they couldnt stop the rush with their hands and so they were swinging their clubs i stumbled over the fallen coon who had pivoted me ducked a swat from a club dived between a bulls legs and was free and then how i ran there was a lean mulatto just in front of me and i took his pace he knew the town better than i did and i knew that in the way he ran lay safety but he on the other hand took me for a pursuing bull he never looked around he just ran my wind was good and i hung on to his pace and nearly killed him in the end he stumbled weakly went down on his knees and surrendered to me and when he discovered i wasnt a bull all that saved me was that he didnt have any wind left in him  that was why i left washingtonnot on account of the mulatto but on account of the bulls i went down to the depot and caught the first blind out on a pennsylvania railroad express after the train got good and under way and i noted the speed she was making a misgiving smote me this was a fourtrack railroad and the engines took water on the fly hoboes had long since warned me never to ride the first blind on trains where the engines took water on the fly and now let me explain between the tracks are shallow metal troughs as the engine at full speed passes above a sort of chute drops down into the trough the result is that all the water in the trough rushes up the chute and fills the tender  somewhere along between washington and baltimore as i sat on the platform of the blind a fine spray began to fill the air it did no harm ah ha thought i its all a bluff this taking water on the fly being bad for the bo on the first blind what does this little spray amount to then i began to marvel at the device this was railroading talk about your primitive western railroadingand just then the tender filled up and it hadnt reached the end of the trough a tidal wave of water poured over the back of the tender and down upon me i was soaked to the skin as wet as if i had fallen overboard  the train pulled into baltimore as is the custom in the great eastern cities the railroad ran beneath the level of the streets on the bottom of a big cut as the train pulled into the lighted depot i made myself as small as possible on the blind but a railroad bull saw me and gave chase two more joined him i was past the depot and i ran straight on down the track i was in a sort of trap on each side of me rose the steep walls of the cut and if i ever essayed them and failed i knew that id slide back into the clutches of the bulls i ran on and on studying the walls of the cut for a favorable place to climb up at last i saw such a place it came just after i had passed under a bridge that carried a level street across the cut up the steep slope i went clawing hand and foot the three railroad bulls were clawing up right after me  at the top i found myself in a vacant lot on one side was a low wall that separated it from the street there was no time for minute investigation they were at my heels i headed for the wall and vaulted it and right there was where i got the surprise of my life one is used to thinking that one side of a wall is just as high as the other side but that wall was different you see the vacant lot was much higher than the level of the street on my side the wall was low but on the other sidewell as i came soaring over the top all holds free it seemed to me that i was falling feetfirst plump into an abyss there beneath me on the sidewalk under the light of a streetlamp was a bull i guess it was nine or ten feet down to the sidewalk but in the shock of surprise in midair it seemed twice that distance  i straightened out in the air and came down at first i thought i was going to land on the bull my clothes did brush him as my feet struck the sidewalk with explosive impact it was a wonder he didnt drop dead for he hadnt heard me coming it was the manfrommars stunt over again the bull did jump he shied away from me like a horse from an auto and then he reached for me i didnt stop to explain i left that to my pursuers who were dropping over the wall rather gingerly but i got a chase all right i ran up one street and down another dodged around corners and at last got away  after spending some of the coin id got from the crap game and killing off an hour of time i came back to the railroad cut just outside the lights of the depot and waited for a train my blood had cooled down and i shivered miserably what of my wet clothes at last a train pulled into the station i lay low in the darkness and successfully boarded her when she pulled out taking good care this time to make the second blind no more water on the fly in mine the train ran forty miles to the first stop i got off in a lighted depot that was strangely familiar i was back in washington in some way during the excitement of the getaway in baltimore running through strange streets dodging and turning and retracing i had got turned around i had taken the train out the wrong way i had lost a nights sleep i had been soaked to the skin i had been chased for my life and for all my pains i was back where i had started oh no life on the road is not all beer and skittles but i didnt go back to the livery stable i had done some pretty successful grabbing and i didnt want to reckon up with the coons so i caught the next train out and ate my breakfast in baltimore
