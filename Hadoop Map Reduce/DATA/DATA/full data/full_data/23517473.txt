23517473	returning home  by anthony trollope     it is generally supposed that people who live at homegood domestic people who love tea and their armchairs and who keep the parlour hearthrug ever warmit is generally supposed that these are the people who value home the most and best appreciate all the comforts of that cherished institution  i am inclined to doubt this  it is i think to those who live farthest away from home to those who find the greatest difficulty in visiting home that the word conveys the sweetest idea  in some distant parts of the world it may be that an englishman acknowledges his permanent resting place but there are many others in which he will not call his daily house his home  he would in his own idea desecrate the word by doing so  his home is across the blue waters in the little northern island which perhaps he may visit no more which he has left at any rate for half his life from which circumstances and the necessity of living have banished him  his home is still in england and when he speaks of home his thoughts are there  no one can understand the intensity of this feeling who has not seen or felt the absence of interest in life which falls to the lot of many who have to eat their bread on distant soils  we are all apt to think that a life in strange countries will be a life of excitement of stirring enterprise and varied scenesthat in abandoning the comforts of home we shall receive in exchange more of movement and of adventure than would come in our way in our own tame country and this feeling has i am sure sent many a young man roaming  take any spirited fellow of twenty and ask him whether he would like to go to mexico for the next ten years  prudence and his father may ultimately save him from such banishment but he will not refuse without a pang of regret  alas it is a mistake  bread may be earned and fortunes perhaps made in such countries and as it is the destiny of our race to spread itself over the wide face of the globe it is well that there should be something to gild and paint the outward face of that lot which so many are called upon to choose  but for a life of daily excitement there is no life like life in england and the farther that one goes from england the more stagnant i think do the waters of existence become  but if it be so for men it is ten times more so for women  an englishman if he be at guatemala or belize must work for his bread and that work will find him in thought and excitement  but what of his wife  where will she find excitement  by what pursuit will she repay herself for all that she has left behind her at her mothers fireside  she will love her husband  yes that at least if there be not that there will be a hell indeed  then she will nurse her children and talk of herhome  when the time shall come that her promised return thither is within a year or two of its accomplishment her thoughts will all be fixed on that coming pleasure as are the thoughts of a young girl on her first ball for the fortnight before that event comes off  on the central plain of that portion of central america which is called costa rica stands the city of san jose  it is the capital of the republicfor costa rica is a republicand for central america is a town of some importance  it is in the middle of the coffee district surrounded by rich soil on which the sugarcane is produced is blessed with a climate only moderately hot and the native inhabitants are neither cutthroats nor cannibals  it may be said therefore that by comparison with some other spots to which englishmen and others are congregated for the gathering together of money san jose may be considered as a happy region but nevertheless a life there is not in every way desirable  it is a dull place with little to interest either the eye or the ear although the heat of the tropics is but little felt there on account of its altitude men and women become too lifeless for much enterprise  there is no society  there are a few germans and a few englishmen in the place who see each other on matters of business during the day but sombre as life generally is they seem to care little for each others company on any other footing  i know not to what point the aspirations of the germans may stretch themselves but to the english the one idea that gives salt to life is the idea of home  on some day however distant it may be they will once more turn their faces towards the little northern island and then all will be well with them  to a certain englishman there and to his dear little wife this prospect came some few years since somewhat suddenly  events and tidings it matters not which or what brought it about that they resolved between themselves that they would start immediately almost immediately  they would pack up and leave san jose within four months of the day on which their purpose was first formed  at san jose a period of only four months for such a purpose was immediately  it creates a feeling of instant excitement a necessity for instant doing a consciousness that there was in those few weeks ample work both for the hands and thoughtswork almost more than ample  the dear little wife who for the last two years had been so listless felt herself flurried  harry she said to her husband how shall we ever be ready  and her pretty face was lighted up with unusual brightness at the happy thought of so much haste with such an object  and babys things too she said as she thought of all the various little articles of dress that would be needed  a journey from san jose to southampton cannot in truth be made as easily as one from london to liverpool let us think of a month to be passed without any aid from the washerwoman and the greatest part of that month amidst the sweltering heats of the west indian tropics  in the first month of her hurry and flurry mrs arkwright was a happy woman  she would see her mother again and her sisters  it was now four years since she had left them on the quay at southampton while all their hearts were broken at the parting  she was a young bride then going forth with her new lord to meet the stern world  he had then been home to look for a wife and he had found what he looked for in the younger sister of his partner  for he henry arkwright and his wifes brother abel ring had established themselves together in san jose  and now she thought how there would be another meeting on those quays at which there should be no broken hearts at which there should be love without sorrow and kisses sweet with the sweetness of welcome not bitter with the bitterness of parting  and people told herthe few neighbours around herhow happy how fortunate she was to get home thus early in her life  they had been out some tensome twenty years and still the day of their return was distant  and then she pressed her living baby to her breast and wiped away a tear as she thought of the other darling whom she would leave beneath that distant sod  and then came the question as to the route home  san jose stands in the middle of the high plain of costa rica half way between the pacific and the atlantic  the journey thence down to the pacific is by comparison easy  there is a road and the mules on which the travellers must ride go steadily and easily down to punta arenas the port on that ocean  there are inns too on the way places of public entertainment at which refreshment may be obtained and beds or fair substitutes for beds  but then by this route the traveller must take a long additional sea voyage  he must convey himself and his weary baggage down to that wretched place on the pacific there wait for a steamer to take him to panama cross the isthmus and reship himself in the other waters for his long journey home  that terrible unshipping and reshipping is a sore burden to the unaccustomed traveller  when it is absolutely necessarythen indeed it is done without much thought but in the case of the arkwrights it was not absolutely necessary  and there was another reason which turned mrs arkwrights heart against that journey by punt arenas  the place is unhealthy having at certain seasons a very bad nameand here on their outward journey her husband had been taken ill  she had never ceased to think of the fortnight she had spent there among uncouth strangers during a portion of which his life had trembled in the balance  early therefore in those four months she begged that she might not be taken round by punt arenas  there was another route  harry if you love me let me go by the serapiqui  as to harrys loving her there was no doubt about that as she well knew  there was this other route by the serapiqui river and by greytown greytown it is true is quite as unhealthy as punt arenas and by that route ones baggage must be shipped and unshipped into small boats  there are all manner of difficulties attached to it perhaps no direct road to and from any city on the worlds surface is subject to sharper fatigue while it lasts  journeying by this route also the traveller leaves san jose mounted on his mule and so mounted he makes his way through the vast primeval forests down to the banks of the serapiqui river  that there is a track for him is of course true but it is simply a track and during nine months of the twelve is so deep in mud that the mules sink in it to their bellies  then when the river has been reached the traveller seats him in his canoe and for two days is paddled downdown along the serapiqui into the san juan river and down along the san juan till he reaches greytown passing one night at some hut on the river side  at greytown he waits for the steamer which will carry him his first stage on his road towards southampton  he must be a connoisseur in disagreeables of every kind who can say with any precision whether greytown or punt arenas is the better place for a weeks sojourn  for a full month mr arkwright would not give way to his wife  at first he all but conquered her by declaring that the serapiqui journey would be dangerous for the baby but she heard from some one that it could be made less fatiguing for the baby than the other route  a baby had been carried down in a litter strapped on to a mules back  a guide at the mules head would be necessary and that was all  when once in her boat the baby would be as well as in her cradle  what purpose cannot a woman gain by perseverance  her purpose in this instance mrs arkwright did at last gain by persevering  and then their preparations for the journey went on with much flurrying and hot haste  to us at home who live and feel our life every day the manufacture of endless babylinen and the packing of mountains of clothes does not give an idea of much pleasurable excitement but at san jose where there was scarcely motion enough in existence to prevent its waters from becoming foul with stagnation this packing of babylinen was delightful and for a month or so the days went by with happy wings  but by degrees reports began to reach both arkwright and his wife as to this new route which made them uneasy  the wet season had been prolonged and even though they might not be deluged by rain themselves the path would be in such a state of mud as to render the labour incessant  one or two people declared that the road was unfit at any time for a womanand then the river would be much swollen  these tidings did not reach arkwright and his wife together or at any rate not till late amidst their preparations or a change might still have been made  as it was after all her entreaties mrs arkwright did not like to ask him again to alter his plans and he having altered them once was averse to change them again  so things went on till the mules and the boats had been hired and things had gone so far that no change could then be made without much cost and trouble  during the last ten days of their sojourn at san jose mrs arkwright had lost all that appearance of joy which had cheered up her sweet face during the last few months  terror at that terrible journey obliterated in her mind all the happiness which had arisen from the hope of being soon at home  she was thoroughly cowed by the danger to be encountered and would gladly have gone down to punt arenas had it been now possible that she could so arrange it it rained and rained and still rained when there was now only a week from the time they started  oh if they could only wait for another month  but this she said to no one  after what had passed between her and her husband she had not the heart to say such words to him  arkwright himself was a man not given to much talking a silent thoughtful man stern withal in his outward bearing but tenderhearted and loving in his nature  the sweet young wife who had left all and come with him out to that dull distant place was very dear to himdearer than she herself was aware and in these days he was thinking much of her coming troubles  why had he given way to her foolish prayers  ah why indeed  and thus the last few days of their sojourn in san jose passed away from them  once or twice during these days she did speak out expressing her fears her feelings were too much for her and she could not restrain herself  poor mamma she said i shall never see her  and then again harry i know i shall never reach home alive  fanny my darling that is nonsense  but in order that his spoken word might not sound stern to her he took her in his arms and kissed her  you must behave well fanny he said to her the day before they started  though her heart was then very low within her she promised him that she would do her best and then she made a great resolution  though she should be dying on the road she would not complain beyond the absolute necessity of her nature  she fully recognised his thoughtful tender kindness for though he thus cautioned her he never told her that the dangers which she feared were the result of her own choice  he never threw in her teeth those prayers which she had made in yielding to which he knew that he had been weak  then came the morning of their departure  the party of travellers consisted of four besides the baby  there was mr arkwright his wife and an english nurse who was going to england with them and her brother abel ring who was to accompany them as far as the serapiqui river  when they had reached that the real labour of the journey would be over  they had eight mules four for the four travellers one for the baby a spare mule laden simply with blankets so that mrs arkwright might change in order that she should not be fatigued by the fatigue of her beast and two for their luggage  the portion of their baggage had already been sent off by punt arenas and would meet them at the other side of the isthmus of panama  for the last four days the rain had ceasedhad ceased at any rate at san jose  those who knew the country well would know that it might still be raining over those vast forests but now as the matter was settled they would hope for the best  on that morning on which they started the sun shone fairly and they accepted this as an omen of good  baby seemed to lay comfortably on her pile of blankets on the mules back and the face of the tall indian guide who took his place at that mules head pleased the anxious mother  not leave him ever he said in spanish laying his hand on the cord which was fastened to the beasts head and not for one moment did he leave his charge though the labour of sticking close to him was very great  they had four attendants or guides all of whom made the journey on foot  that they were all men of mixed race was probable but three of them would have been called spaniards spaniards that is of costa rica and the other would be called an indian  one of the spaniards was the leader or chief man of the party but the others seemed to stand on an equal footing with each other and indeed the place of greatest care had been given to the indian  for the first four or five miles their route lay along the high road which leads from san jose to punt arenas and so far a group of acquaintances followed them all mounted on mules  here where the ways forked their road leading through the great forests to the atlantic they separated and many tears were shed on each side what might be the future life of the arkwrights had not been absolutely fixed but there was a strong hope on their part that they might never be forced to return to costa rica  those from whom they now parted had not seemed to be dear to them in any especial degree while they all lived together in the same small town seeing each other day by day but nownow that they might never meet again a certain love sprang up for the old familiar faces and women kissed each other who hitherto had hardly cared to enter each others houses  and then the party of the arkwrights again started and its steady work began  in the whole of the first day the way beneath their feet was tolerably good and the weather continued fine  it was one long gradual ascent from the plain where the roads parted but there was no real labour in travelling  mrs arkwright rode beside her babys mule at the head of which the indian always walked and the two men went together in front  the husband had found that his wife would prefer this as long as the road allowed of such an arrangement  her heart was too full to admit of much speaking and so they went on in silence  the first night was passed in a hut by the roadside which seemed to be deserteda hut or rancho as it is called in that country their food they had of course brought with them and here by common consent they endeavoured in some sort to make themselves merry  fanny arkwright said to her it is not so bad after all eh my darling  no she answered only that the mule tires one so  will all the days be as long as that  he had not the heart to tell her that as regarded hours of work that first day must of necessity be the shortest  they had risen to a considerable altitude and the night was very cold but baby was enveloped among a pile of coloured blankets and things did not go very badly with them only this that when fanny arkwright rose from her hard bed her limbs were more weary and much more stiff than they had been when arkwright had lifted her from her mule  on the second morning they mounted before the day had quite broken in order that they might breakfast on the summit of the ridge which separates the two oceans  at this spot the good road comes to an end and the forest track begins and here also they would in truth enter the forest though their path had for some time been among straggling trees and bushes  and now again they rode two and two up to this place of halting arkwright and ring well knowing that from hence their labours would in truth commence  poor mrs arkwright when she reached this restingplace would fain have remained there for the rest of the day  one word in her low plaintive voice she said asking whether they might not sleep in the large shed which stands there  but this was manifestly impossible  at such a pace they would never reach greytown and she spoke no further word when he told her that they must go on  at about noon that day the file of travellers formed itself into the line which it afterwards kept during the whole of the journey and then started by the narrow path into the forest  first walked the leader of the guides then another man following him abel ring came next and behind him the maidservant then the babys mule with the indian ever at its head close at his heels followed mrs arkwright so that the mothers eye might be always on her child and after her her husband then another guide on foot completed the number of the travellers  in this way they went on and on day after day till they reached the banks of the serapiqui never once varying their places in the procession  as they started in the morning so they went on till their noondays rest and so again they made their evening march  in that journey there was no idea of variety no searching after the pleasures of scenery no attempts at conversation with any object of interest or amusement  what words were spoken were those simply needful or produced by sympathy for suffering  so they journeyed always in the same places with one exception  they began their work with two guides leading them but before the first day was over one of them had fallen back to the side of mrs arkwright for she was unable to sit on her mule without support  their daily work was divided into two stages so as to give some hours for rest in the middle of the day  it had been arranged that the distance for each day should not be longshould be very short as was thought by them all when they talked it over at san jose but now the hours which they passed in the saddle seemed to be endless their descent began from that ridge of which i have spoken and they had no sooner turned their faces down upon the mountain slopes looking towards the atlantic than that passage of mud began to which there was no cessation till they found themselves on the banks of the serapiqui river  i doubt whether it be possible to convey in words an adequate idea of the labour of riding over such a path  it is not that any active exertion is necessarythat there is anything which requires doing  the traveller has before him the simple task of sitting on his mule from hour to hour and of seeing that his knees do not get themselves jammed against the trees but at every step the beast he rides has to drag his legs out from the deep clinging mud and the body of the rider never knows one moment of ease  why the mules do not die on the road i cannot say  they live through it and do not appear to suffer  they have their own way in everything for no exertion on the riders part will make them walk either faster or slower than is their wont  on the day on which they entered the forestthat being the second of their journeymrs arkwright had asked for mercy for permission to escape that second stage  on the next she allowed herself to be lifted into her saddle after her midday rest without a word  she had tried to sleep but in vain and had sat within a little hut looking out upon the desolate scene before her with her baby in her lap  she had this one comfort that of all the travellers she the baby suffered the least  they had now left the high grounds and the heat was becoming great though not as yet intense  and then the indian guide looking out slowly over the forest saw that the rain was not yet over  he spoke a word or two to one of his companions in a low voice and in a patois which mrs arkwright did not understand and then going after the husband told him that the heavens were threatening  we have only two leagues said arkwright and it may perhaps hold up  it will begin in an hour said the indian and the two leagues are four hours  and tomorrow asked arkwright  tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow it will still rain said the guide looking as he spoke up over the huge primeval forest  then we had better start at once said arkwright before the first falling drops frighten the women  so the mules were brought out and he lifted his uncomplaining wife on to the blankets which formed her pillion  the file again formed itself and slowly they wound their way out from the small enclosure by which the hut was surroundedout from the enclosure on to a rough scrap of undrained pasture ground from which the trees had been cleared  in a few minutes they were once more struggling through the mud  the name of the spot which our travellers had just left is carablanco  there they found a woman living all alone  her husband was away she told them at san jose but would be back to her when the dry weather came to look up the young cattle which were straying in the forest  what a life for a woman  nevertheless in talking with mrs arkwright she made no complaint of her own lot but had done what little she could to comfort the poor lady who was so little able to bear the fatigues of her journey  is the road very bad mrs arkwright asked her in a whisper  ah yes it is a bad road  and when shall we be at the river  it took me four days said the woman  then i shall never see my mother again and as she spoke mrs arkwright pressed her baby to her bosom  immediately after that her husband came in and they started  their path now led away across the slope of a mountain which seemed to fall from the very top of that central ridge in an unbroken descent down to the valley at its foot  hitherto since they had entered the forest they had had nothing before their eyes but the trees and bushes which grew close around them  but now a prospect of unrivalled grandeur was opened before them if only had they been able to enjoy it  at the bottom of the valley ran a river which so great was the depth looked like a moving silver cord and on the other side of this there arose another mountain steep but unbroken like that which they were passingunbroken so that the eye could stretch from the river up to the very summit  not a spot on that mountain side or on their side either was left uncovered by thick forest which had stood there untouched by man since nature first produced it  but all this was nothing to our travellers nor was the clang of the macaws anything or the roaring of the little congo ape  nothing was gained by them from beautiful scenery nor was there any fear from the beasts of prey  the immediate pain of each step of the journey drove all other feelings from them and their thoughts were bounded by an intense desire for the evening halt  and then as the guide had prophesied the rain began  at first it came in such small soft drops that it was found to be refreshing but the clouds soon gathered and poured forth their collected waters as though it had not rained for months among those mountains  not that it came in big drops or with the violence which wind can give it beating hither and thither breaking branches from the trees and rising up again as it pattered against the ground  there was no violence in the rain  it fell softly in a long continuous noiseless stream sinking into everything that it touched converting the deep rich earth on all sides into mud  not a word was said by any of them as it came on  the indian covered the baby with her blanket closer than she was covered before and the guide who walked by mrs arkwrights side drew her cloak around her knees  but such efforts were in vain  there is a rain that will penetrate everything and such was the rain which fell upon them now  nevertheless as i have said hardly a word was spoken  the poor woman finding that the heat of her cloak increased her sufferings threw it open again  fanny said her husband you had better let him protect you as well as he can  she answered him merely by an impatient wave of her hand intending to signify that she could not speak but that in this matter she must have her way  after that her husband made no further attempt to control her  he could see however that ever and again she would have slipped forward from her mule and fallen had not the man by her side steadied her with his hand  at every tree he protected her knees and feet though there was hardly room for him to move between the beast and the bank against which he was thrust  and then at last that days work was also over and fanny arkwright slipped from her pillion down into her husbands arms at the door of another rancho in the forest  here there lived a large family adding from year to year to the patch of ground which they had rescued from the wood and valiantly doing their part in the extension of civilisation  our party was but a few steps from the door when they left their mules but mrs arkwright did not now as heretofore hasten to receive her baby in her arms  when placed upon the ground she still leaned against the mule and her husband saw that he must carry her into the hut  this he did and then wet mudladen dishevelled as she was she laid herself down upon the planks that were to form her bed and there stretched out her arms for her infant  on that evening they undressed and tended her like a child and then when she was alone with her husband she repeated to him her sad foreboding  harry she said i shall never see my mother again  oh yes fanny you will see her and talk over all these troubles with pleasure  it is very bad i know but we shall live through it yet  you will of course and you will take baby home to her  and face her without you  no my darling  three more days riding or rather two and a half will bring us to the river and then your trouble will be over  all will be easy after that  ah harry you do not know  i do know that it is very bad my girl but you must cheer up  we shall be laughing at all this in a months time  on the following morning she allowed herself to be lifted up speaking no word of remonstrance  indeed she was like a child in their hands having dropped all the dignity and authority of a womans demeanour  it rained again during the whole of this day and the heat was becoming oppressive as every hour they were descending nearer and nearer to the sea level  during this first stage hardly a word was spoken by any one but when she was again taken from her mule she was in tears  the poor servantgirl too was almost prostrate with fatigue and absolutely unable to wait upon her mistress or even to do anything for herself  nevertheless they did make the second stage seeing that their midday resting place had been under the trees of the forest  had there been any hut there they would have remained for the night  on the following day they rested altogether though the place at which they remained had but few attractions  it was another forest hut inhabited by an old spanish couple who were by no means willing to give them room although they paid for their accommodation at exorbitant rates  it is one singularity of places strange and out of the way like such forest tracks as these that money in small sums is hardly valued  dollars there were not appreciated as sixpences are in this rich country  but there they stayed for a day and the guides employed themselves in making a litter with long poles so that they might carry mrs arkwright over a portion of the ground  poor fellows  when once she had thus changed her mode of conveyance she never again was lifted on to the mule  there was strong reason against this days delay  they were to go down the serapiqui along with the post which would overtake them on its banks  but if the post should pass them before they got there it could not wait and then they would be deprived of the best canoe on the water  then also it was possible if they encountered further delay that the steamer might sail from greytown without them and a months residence at that frightful place be thus made necessary  the days rest apparently did little to relieve mrs arkwrights sufferings  on the following day she allowed herself to be put upon the mule but after the first hour the beasts were stopped and she was taken off it  during that hour they had travelled hardly over half a league  at that time she so sobbed and moaned that arkwright absolutely feared that she would perish in the forest and he implored the guides to use the poles which they had prepared  she had declared to him over and over again that she felt sure that she should die and halfdelirious with weariness and suffering had begged him to leave her at the last hut  they had not yet come to the flat ground over which a litter might be carried with comparative ease but nevertheless the men yielded and she was placed in a recumbent position upon blankets supported by boughs of trees  in this way she went through that day with somewhat less of suffering than before and without that necessity for selfexertion which had been worse to her than any suffering  there were places between that and the river at which one would have said that it was impossible that a litter should be carried or even impossible that a mule should walk with a load on his back  but still they went on and the men carried their burden without complaining  not a word was said about money or extra paynot a word at least by them and when arkwright was profuse in his offer their leader told him that they would not have done it for money but for the poor suffering senora they would make exertions which no money would have bought from them  on the next day about noon the post did pass them consisting of three strong men carrying great weights on their backs suspended by bands from their foreheads  they travelled much quicker than our friends and would reach the banks of the river that evening  in their ordinary course they would start down the river close upon daybreak on the following day but after some consultation with the guides they agreed to wait till noon  poor mrs arkwright knew nothing of hours or of any such arrangements now but her husband greatly doubted their power of catching this mail despatch however it did not much depend on their exertions that afternoon their restingplace was marked out for them and they could not go beyond it unless indeed they could make the whole journey which was impossible  but towards evening matters seemed to improve with them  they had now got on to ground which was more open and the men who carried the litter could walk with greater ease  mrs arkwright also complained less and when they reached their restingplace on that night said nothing of a wish to be left there to her fate  this was a place called padregal a cacao plantation which had been cleared in the forest with much labour  there was a house here containing three rooms and some forty or fifty acres round it had been stripped of the forest trees  but nevertheless the adventure had not been a prosperous one for the place was at that time deserted  there were the cacao plants but there was no one to pick the cacao  there was a certain melancholy beauty about the place a few grand trees had been left standing near the house and the grass around was rich and parklike  but it was deserted and nothing was heard but the roaring of the congos  ah me  indeed it was a melancholy place as it was seen by some of that party afterwards  on the following morning they were astir very early and mrs arkwright was so much better that she offered to sit again upon her mule  the men however declared that they would finish their task and she was placed again upon the litter  and then with slow and weary step they did make their way to the river bank  it was not yet noon when they saw the mud fort which stands there and as they drew into the enclosure round a small house which stands close by the river side they saw the three postmen still busy about their packages  thank god said arkwright  thank god indeed said his brother  all will be right with you now  well fanny said her husband as he took her very gently from the litter and seated her on a bench which stood outside the door  it is all over nowis it not  she answered him by a shower of tears but they were tears which brought her relief  he was aware of this and therefore stood by her still holding her by both her hands while her head rested against his side  you will find the motion of the boat very gentle he said indeed there will be no motion and you and baby will sleep all the way down to greytown  she did not answer him in words but she looked up into his face and he could see that her spirit was recovering itself  there was almost a crowd of people collected on the spot preparatory to the departure of the canoes  in the first place there was the commandant of the fort to whom the small house belonged  he was looking to the passports of our friends and with due diligence endeavouring to make something of the occasion by discovering fatal legal impediments to the further prosecution of their voyage which impediments would disappear on the payment of certain dollars  and then there were half a dozen costa rican soldiers men with coloured caps and old muskets ready to support the dignity and authority of the commandant  there were the guides taking payment from abel ring for their past work and the postmen preparing their boats for the further journey  and then there was a certain german there with a german servant to whom the boats belonged  he also was very busy preparing for the river voyage  he was not going down with them but it was his business to see them well started  a singular looking man was he with a huge shaggy beard and shaggy uncombed hair but with bright blue eyes which gave to his face a remarkable look of sweetness  he was an uncouth man to the eye and yet a child would have trusted herself with him in a forest  at this place they remained some two hours  coffee was prepared here and mrs arkwright refreshed herself and her child  they washed and arranged their clothes and when she stepped down the steep bank clinging to her husbands arm as she made her way towards the boat she smiled upon him as he looked at her  it is all over nowis it not my girlhe said encouraging her  oh harry do not talk about it she answered shuddering  but i want you to say a word to me to let me know that you are better  i am bettermuch better  and you will see your mother again will you not and give baby to her yourself  to this she made no immediate answer for she was on a level with the river and the canoe was close at her feet  and then she had to bid farewell to her brother  he was now the unfortunate one of the party for his destiny required that he should go back to san jose alonego back and remain there perhaps some ten years longer before he might look for the happiness of home  god bless you dearest abel she said kissing him and sobbing as she spoke  goodbye fanny he said and do not let them forget me in england  it is a great comfort to think that the worst of your troubles are over  ohshes all right now said arkwright  goodbye old boy and the two brothersinlaw grasped each others hands heartily keep up your spirits and well have you home before long  oh im all right said the other  but from the tone of the voices it was clear that poor ring was despondent at the thoughts of his coming solitude and that arkwright was already triumphing in his emancipation  and then with much care fanny arkwright was stowed away in the boat  there was a great contest about the baby but at last it was arranged that at any rate for the first few hours she should be placed in the boat with the servant  the mother was told that by this plan she would feel herself at liberty to sleep during the heat of the day and then she might hope to have strength to look to the child when they should be on shore during the night  in this way therefore they prepared to start while abel ring stood on the bank looking at them with wishful eyes  in the first boat were two indians paddling and a third man steering with another paddle  in the middle there was much luggage and near the luggage so as to be under shade was the babys soft bed  if nothing evil happened to the boat the child could not be more safe in the best cradle that was ever rocked  with her was the maidservant and some stranger who was also going down to greytown  in the second boat were the same number of men to paddle the indian guide being one of them and there were the mails placed  then there was a seat arranged with blankets cloaks and cushions for mrs arkwright so that she might lean back and sleep without fatigue and immediately opposite to her her husband placed himself you all look very comfortable said poor abel from the bank  we shall do very well now said arkwright  and i do think i shall see mamma again said his wife  thats right old girlof course you will see her  now thenwe are all ready  and with some little assistance from the german on the bank the first boat was pushed off into the stream  the river in this place is rapid because the full course of the water is somewhat impeded by a bank of earth jutting out from the opposite side of the river into the stream but it is not so rapid as to make any recognised danger in the embarkation  below this bank which is opposite to the spot at which the boats were entered there were four or five broken trees in the water some of the shattered boughs of which showed themselves above the surface these are called snags and are very dangerous if they are met with in the course of the stream but in this instance no danger was apprehended from them as they lay considerably to the left of the passage which the boats would take  the first canoe was pushed off by the german and went rapidly away  the waters were strong with rain and it was pretty to see with what velocity the boat was carried on some hundred of yards in advance of the other by the force of the first effort of the paddle  the german however from the bank holloaed to the first men in spanish bidding them relax their efforts for awhile and then he said a word or two of caution to those who were now on the point of starting  the boat then was pushed steadily forward the man at the stern keeping it with his paddle a little farther away from the bank at which they had embarked  it was close under the land that the stream ran the fastest and in obedience to the directions given to him he made his course somewhat nearer to the sunken trees  it was but one turn of his hand that gave the light boat its direction but that turn of the hand was too strong  had the anxious master of the canoes been but a thought less anxious all might have been well but as it was the prow of the boat was caught by some slight hidden branch which impeded its course and turned it round in the rapid river  the whole lengths of the canoe was thus brought against the sunken tree and in half a minute the five occupants of the boat were struggling in the stream  abel ring and the german were both standing on the bank close to the water when this happened and each for a moment looked into the others face  stand where you are shouted the german so that you may assist them from the shore  i will go in  and then throwing from him his boots and coat he plunged into the river  the canoe had been swept round so as to be brought by the force of the waters absolutely in among the upturned roots and broken stumps of the trees which impeded the river and thus when the party was upset they were at first to be seen scrambling among the branches but unfortunately there was much more wood below the water than above it and the force of the stream was so great that those who caught hold of the timber were not able to support themselves by it above the surface  arkwright was soon to be seen some forty yards down having been carried clear of the trees and here he got out of the river on the farther bank  the distance to him was not above forty yards but from the nature of the ground he could not get up towards his wife unless he could have forced his way against the stream  the indian who had had charge of the baby rose quickly to the surface was carried once round in the eddy with his head high above the water and then was seen to throw himself among the broken wood  he had seen the dress of the poor woman and made his effort to save her  the other two men were so caught by the fragments of the boughs that they could not extricate themselves so as to make any exertions ultimately however they also got out on the further bank  mrs arkwright had sunk at once on being precipitated into the water but the buoyancy of her clothes had brought her for a moment again to the surface  she had risen for a moment and then had again gone down immediately below the forked trunk of a huge tree had gone down alas alas never to rise again with life within her bosom  the poor indian made two attempts to save her and then came up himself incapable of further effort  it was then that the german the owner of the canoes who had fought his way with great efforts across the violence of the waters and indeed up against the stream for some few yards made his effort to save the life of that poor frail creature  he had watched the spot at which she had gone down and even while struggling across the river had seen how the indian had followed her and had failed  it was now his turn  his life was in his hand and he was prepared to throw it away in that attempt  having succeeded in placing himself a little above the large tree he turned his face towards the bottom of the river and dived down among the branches  and he also after that was never again seen with the lifeblood flowing round his heart  when the sun set that night the two swollen corpses were lying in the commandants hut and abel ring and arkwright were sitting beside them  arkwright had his baby sleeping in his arms but he sat there for hoursinto the middle of the long nightwithout speaking a word to any one  harry said his brother at last come away and lay down  it will be good for you to sleep  nothing ever will be good again for me said he  you must bear up against your sorrow as other men do said ring  why am i not sleeping with her as the poor german sleeps  why did i let another man take my place in dying for her  and then he walked away that the other might not see the tears on his face  it was a sad nightthat at the commandants hut and a sad morning followed upon it  it must be remembered that they had there none of those appurtenances which are so necessary to make woe decent and misfortune comfortable  they sat through the night in the small hut and in the morning they came forth with their clothes still wet and dirty with their haggard faces and weary stiff limbs encumbered with the horrid task of burying that loved body among the forest trees  and then to keep life in them till it was done the brandy flask passed from hand to hand and after that with slow but resolute efforts they reformed the litter on which the living woman had been carried thither and took her body back to the wild plantation at padregal  there they dug for her her grave and repeating over her some portion of the service for the dead left her to sleep the sleep of death  but before they left her they erected a pallisade of timber round the grave so that the beasts of the forest should not tear the body from its restingplace  when that was done arkwright and his brother made their slow journey back to san jose  the widowed husband could not face his darlings mother with such a tale upon his tongue as that
