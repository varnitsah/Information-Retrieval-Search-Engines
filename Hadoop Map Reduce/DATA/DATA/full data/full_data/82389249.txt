opportunity of saying how much pleasure i owe to your romances  they make one a boy again while one is reading them and the student of the witchs head and of king solomons mines is as young in heart

preface   the writer of these apologues hopes that the rev mr gowles will not be regarded as his idea of a typical missionary  the countrymen of codrington and callaway of patteson and livingstone know better what missionaries may be and often are  but the wrong sort as well as the right sort exists everywhere and mr gowles is not a very gross caricature of the ignorant teacher of heathendom  i am convinced that he would have seen nothing but a set of darkened savages in the ancient greeks  the religious eccentricities of the hellenes are not exaggerated in the end of phaeacia nay mr gowles might have seen odder things in attica than he discovered or chose to record in boothland  to avoid the charge of plagiarism perhaps it should be mentioned that the romance of the first radical was written long before i read tanners narrative of a captivity among the indians  tanner like why why had trouble with the chief medicineman of his community  if my dear kinsman and companion of old days

rev thomas gowles well known in colonial circles where the truth is valued as the boanerges of the pacific departed this life at hackney wick on the 6th of march 1885  the laodiceans in our midst have ventured to affirm that the world at large has been a more restful place since mr gowles was taken from his corner of the vineyard  the boanerges of the pacific was indeed one of those rarelygifted souls souls like a luther or a knox who can tolerate no contradiction and will palter with no compromise where the truth is concerned  papists puseyites presbyterians and pagans alike found in mr gowles an opponent whose convictions were firm as a rock and whose method of proclaiming the truth was as the sound of a trumpet  examples of his singular courage and daring in the work of the ministry abound in the following narrative  born and brought up in the bungletonian communion himself collaterally connected by a sisters marriage with jedediah bungleton the revered founder of the very particular people gowles was inaccessible to the scepticism of the age  his youth it is true had been stormy like that of many a brand afterwards promoted to being a vessel  his worldly education was of the most elementary and indeed eleemosynary description consequently he despised secular learning and science falsely so called  it is recorded of him that he had almost a distaste for those difficult chapters of the epistles in which st paul mentions by name his greek friends and converts  in a controversy with an oxford scholar conducted in the open air under the martyrs memorial in that centre of careless professors gowles had spoken of nicodemus eubulus and stephanas his unmannerly antagonist jeering at these slips of pronunciation gowles uttered his celebrated and crushing retort did paul know greek  the young man his opponent went away silenced if not convinced  such a man was the rev thomas gowles in his home ministry  circumstances called him to that wider field of usefulness the pacific in which so many millions of our dusky brethren either worship owls butterflies sharks and lizards or are led away captive by the seductive pomps of the scarlet woman or lapse languidly into the lap of a bloated and erastian establishment ignorant of the truth as possessed by our community  against all these forms of souldestroying error the rev thomas gowles thundered nobly passing as an admirer said like an evangelical cyclone from the new hebrides to the aleutian islands  it was during one of his missionary voyages in a labour vessel the blackbird that the following singular events occurred events which mr gowles faithfully recorded as will be seen in his missionary narrative we omit as of purely secular interest the description of the storm which wrecked the blackbird the account of the destruction of the steamer with all hands not let us try to hope with all souls on board and everything that transpired till mr gowles found himself alone the sole survivor and bestriding the mast in the midst of a tempestuous sea  what follows is from the record kept on pieces of skin shards of pottery plates of metal papyrus leaves and other strange substitutes for paper used by mr gowles during his captivity    ii  narrative of mr gowles 6   i must now though in sore straits for writing materials and having entirely lost count of time post up my diary or rather commence my narrative  so far as i can learn from the jargon of the strange and lost people among whom providence has cast me this is in their speech the last of the month thargeelyun as near as i can imitate the sound in english  being in doubt as to the true time i am resolved to regard to morrow and every seventh day in succession as the sabbath  the very natives i have observed with great interest keep one day at fixed intervals sacred to the sungod whom they call apollon perhaps the same word as apollyon  on this day they do no manner of work but that is hardly an exception to their usual habits  a less industrious people slaves and all i never met even in the pacific  as to being more than common idle on one day out of seven whether they have been taught so much of what is essential by some earlier missionary or whether they may be the corrupted descendants of the lost tribes whom they do not however at all resemble outwardly being i must admit of prepossessing appearance i can only conjecture  this apollon of theirs in his graven images of which there are many carries a bow and arrows fiery darts of the wicked another point in common between him and apollyon in the pilgrims progress  may i like christian turn aside and quench his artillery  to return to my narrative  when i recovered consciousness after the sinking of the blackbird i found myself alone clinging to the mast  now was i tossed on the crest of the wave now the waters opened beneath me and i sank down in the valleys of the sea  cold numbed and all but lifeless i had given up hope of earthly existence and was nearly insensible when i began to revive beneath the rays of the sun  the sea though still moved by a swell was now much smoother and but for a strange vision i might have believed that i was recovering my strength  i must however have been delirious or dreaming for it appeared to me that a foreign female of prepossessing exterior though somewhat indelicately dressed arose out of the waters close by my side as lightly as if she had been a seagull on the wing  about her head there was wreathed a kind of muslin scarf which she unwound and offered to me indicating that i was to tie it about my waist and it would preserve me from harm  so weak and exhausted was i that without thinking i did her bidding and then lost sight of the female presently as it seemed but i was so drowsy that the time may have been longer than i fancied i caught sight of land from the crest of a wave steep blue cliffs arose far away out of a white cloud of surf and though a strong swimmer i had little hope of reaching the shore in safety  fortunately or rather i should say providentially the current and tiderip carried me to the mouth of a river and with a great effort i got into the shoalwater and finally staggered out on shore  there was a wood hard by and thither i dragged myself  the sun was in mid heavens and very warm and i managed to dry my clothes  i am always most particular to wear the dress of my calling observing that it has a peculiar and gratifying effect on the minds of the natives  i soon dried my tall hat which during the storm i had attached to my buttonhole by a string and though it was a good deal battered i was not without hopes of partially restoring its gloss and air of british respectability as will be seen this precaution was curiously enough the human means of preserving my life  my hat my black clothes my white necktie and the hymnbook i carry would i was convinced secure for me a favourable reception among the natives if of the gentle brown polynesian type whom i expected to find on the island  exhausted by my sufferings i now fell asleep but was soon wakened by loud cries of anguish uttered at no great distance  i started to my feet and beheld an extraordinary spectacle which at once assured me that i had fallen among natives of the worst and lowest type  the dark places of the earth are indeed full of horrid cruelty  the first cries which had roused me must have been comparatively distant though piercing and even now they reached me confused in the notes of a melancholy chant or hymn  but the shrieks grew more shrill and i thought i could distinguish the screams of a woman in pain or dread from the groans drawn with more difficulty from a man  i leaped up and climbing a high part of the river bank i beheld within a couple of hundred yards an extraordinary procession coming from the inner country towards the mouth of the stream  at first i had only a confused view of bright stuffswhite blue and redand the shining of metal objects in the midst of a crowd partly concealed by the dust they raised on their way  very much to my surprise i found that they were advancing along a wide road paved in a peculiar manner for i had never seen anything of this kind among the heathen tribes of the pacific  their dresses too though for the most part mere wraps as it were of coloured stuff thrown round them pinned with brooches and often clinging in a very improper way to the figure did not remind me of the costume what there is of it of samoans fijians or other natives among whom i have been privileged to labour  but these observations give a more minute impression of what i saw than for the moment i had time to take in  the foremost part of the procession consisted of boys many of them almost naked  their hands were full of branches wreathed in a curious manner with strips of white or coloured wools  they were all singing and were led by a woman carrying in her arms a misshapen wooden idol not much unlike those which are too frequent spectacles all over the pacific  behind the boys i could now distinctly behold a man and woman of the polynesian type naked to the waist and staggering with bent backs beneath showers of blows  the people behind them who were almost as light in colour as ourselves were cruelly flogging them with cutting branches of trees round the necks of the unfortunate victimscriminals i presumedwere hung chains of white and black figs and in their hands they held certain herbs figs and cheese for what purpose i was and remain unable to conjecture  whenever their cries were still for a moment the woman who carried the idol turned round and lifted it in her arms with words which i was unable to understand urging on the tormentors to ply their switches with more severity  naturally i was alarmed by the strangeness and ferocity of the natives so i concealed myself hastily in some brushwood behind a large tree  much to my horror i found that the screams groans and singing only drew nearer and nearer  the procession then passed me so close that i could see blood on the backs of the victims and on their faces an awful dread and apprehension  finally the crowd reached the mouth of the river at the very place where i had escaped from the sea  by aid of a small pocketglass i could make out that the men were piling great faggots of green wood which i had noticed that some of them carried on a spot beneath the wash of high tide  when the pile had reached a considerable height the two victims were placed in the middle  then by some means which i was too far off to detect fire was produced and applied to the wild wood in which the unhappy man and woman were enveloped  soon fortunately a thick turbid smoke in which but little flame appeared swept all over the beach  i endeavoured to stop my ears and turned my head away that i might neither see nor hear more of this spectacle which i now perceived to be a human sacrifice more cruel than is customary even among the fijians  when i next ventured to look up the last trails of smoke were vanishing away across the sea the sun gazed down on the bright manycoloured throng who were now singing another of their hymns while some of the number were gathering up ashes human ashes from a blackened spot on the sand and were throwing them into the salt water  the wind tossed back a soft grey dust in their faces mixed with the surf and spray  it was dark before the crowd swept by me again now chanting in what appeared to be a mirthful manner and with faces so smiling and happy that i could scarcely believe they had just taken part in such abominable cruelty  on the other hand a weight seemed to have been removed from their consciences  so deceitful are the wiles of satan who deludes the heathen most in their very religion  tired and almost starved as i was these reflections forced themselves upon me even while i was pondering on the dreadful position in which i found myself  way of escape from the island obviously a very large one there was none  but if i remained all night in the wood i must almost perish of cold and hunger  i had therefore no choice but to approach the barbarous people though from my acquaintance with natives i knew well that they were likely either to kill and eat me or to worship me as a god  either event was too dreadful to bear reflection  i was certain however that owing to the dress of my sacred calling i could not be mistaken for a mere beachcomber or labourhunter and i considered that i might easily destroy the impression natural among savages on first seeing a european that i was a god  i therefore followed the throng from a distance taking advantage for concealment of turns in the way and of trees and underwood beside the road  some four miles walking for which i was very unfit brought us across a neck of land and from high ground in the middle i again beheld the sea  very much to my surprise the cape on which i looked down safe in the rear of the descending multitude was occupied by a kind of city  the houses were not the mere huts of south sea islanders but though built for the most part of carved and painted wood had white stone foundations and were of considerable height  on a rock in the centre of the bay were some stone edifices which i took to be temples or public buildings  the crowd gradually broke up turning into their own dwellings on the shore where by the way some large masted vessels were drawn up in little docks  but while the general public if i may say so slowly withdrew the woman with the idol in her arms accompanied by some elderly men of serious aspect climbed the road up to the central public buildings  moved by some impulse which i could hardly explain i stealthily followed them and at last found myself on a rocky platform a kind of public square open on one side to the sea and shut in on either hand and at the back by large houses with smooth round pillars and decorated with odd coloured carvings  there was in the open centre of the square an object which i recognized as an altar with a fire burning on it  some men came out of the chief building dragging a sheep with chains of flowers round its neck  another man threw something on the fire which burned with a curious smell  at once i recognized the savour of incense against which as employed illegally by the puseyites i had often firmly protested in old days at home  the spirit of a soldier of the truth entered into me weary as i was i rushed from the dusky corner where i had been hidden in the twilight ran to the altar and held up my hand with my hymnbook as i began to repeat an address that had often silenced the papistic mummers in england  before i had uttered half a dozen words the men who were dragging the sheep flew at me and tried to seize me while one of them offered a strangelooking knife at my throat  i thought my last hour had come and the old adam awakening in me i delivered such a blow with my right on the eye of the man with the knife that he reeled and fell heavily against the altar  then assuming an attitude of selfdefence such as was alas too familiar to me in my unregenerate days i awaited my assailants  they were coming on in a body when the veil of the large edifice in front was lifted and a flash of light streamed out on the dusky square as an old man dressed in red hurried to the scene of struggle  he wore a long white beard had green leaves twisted in his hair and carried in his hand a gilded staff curiously wreathed with wool  when they saw him approaching my assailants fell back each of them kissing his own hand and bowing slightly in the direction of the temple as i rightly supposed it to be  the old man who was followed by attendants carrying torches burning was now close to us and on beholding me he exhibited unusual emotions  my appearance no doubt was at that moment peculiar and little creditable as i have since thought to a minister however humble  my hat was thrust on the back of my head my coat was torn my shirt open my necktie twisted round under my ear and my whole attitude was not one generally associated with the peaceful delivery of the message  still i had never conceived that any spectacle however strange and unbecoming could have produced such an effect on the native mind especially in a person who was manifestly a chief or highpriest of some heathen god seeing him pause and turn pale i dropped my hands and rearranged my dress as best i might  the old tohunga as my new zealand flock used to call their priest now lifted his eyes to heaven with an air of devotion and remained for some moments like one absorbed in prayer or meditation he then rapidly uttered some words which of course i could not understand whereon his attendants approached me gently with signs of respect and friendship  not to appear lacking in courtesy or inferior in politeness to savages i turned and raised my hat which seemed still more to alarm the old priest  he spoke to one of his attendants who instantly ran across the square and entered the courtyard of a large house surrounded by a garden of which the tall trees looked over the wall and wooden palisade  the old man then withdrew into the temple and i distinctly saw him scatter with the leafy bough of a tree some water round him as he entered from a vessel beside the door  this convinced me that some of the emissaries of the scarlet woman had already been busy among the benighted people a conjecture however which proved to be erroneous  i was now left standing by the altar the attendants observing me with respect which i feared might at any moment take the blasphemous form of worship  nor could i see how i was to check their adoration and turn it into the proper channel if as happened to captain cook and has frequently occurred since these darkened idolaters mistook me for one of their own deities  i might spurn them indeed but when nicholson adopted that course and beat the fakirs who worshipped him during the indian mutiny his conduct as i have read only redoubled their enthusiasm  however as events proved they never at any time were inclined to substitute me for their heathen divinities very far from it indeed though their peculiar conduct was calculated to foster in my breast this melancholy delusion  i had not been left long to my own thoughts when i marked lights wandering in the garden or courtyard whither the messenger had been sent by the old priest  presently there came forth from the court a man of remarkable stature and with an air of seriousness and responsibility  in his hand he carried a short staff or baton with gold knobs and he wore a thin golden circlet in his hair  as he drew near the veil of the temple was again lifted and the aged priest came forward bearing in his arms a singular casket of wood ornamented with alternate bands of gold and ivory carved with outlandish figures  the torchbearers crowded about us in the darkness and it was a strange spectacle to behold the smoky fiery light shining on the mens faces and the rich coloured dresses or lighting up the white idol of apollon which stood among the laurel trees at the entrance of the temple    iii  the prophecy   the priest and the man with the gold circlet whom i took to be a chief now met and fixing their eyes on me held a conversation of which naturally i understood nothing  i maintained an unmoved demeanour and by way of showing my indifference and also of impressing the natives with the superiority of our civilization i took out and wound up my watch which i was glad to find had not been utterly ruined by the salt water  meanwhile the priest was fumbling in his casket whence he produced a bundle of very ragged and smoky old bits of parchment and scraps of potsherds  these he placed in the hands of his attendants who received them kneeling  from the very bottom of the casket he extracted some thin plates of a greyish metal lead i believe all mouldy stained and ragged  over these he pored and puzzled for some time trying as i guessed to make out something inscribed on this curious substitute for writingpaper  i had now recovered my presence of mind and thinking at once to astonish and propitiate i drew from my pocket wiped and presented to him my spectacles indicating by example the manner of their employment  no sooner did he behold these common articles of everyday use than the priests knees began to knock together and his old hands trembled so that he could scarcely fix the spectacles on his nose  when he had managed this it was plain that he found much less difficulty with his documents  he now turned them rapidly over and presently discovered one thin sheet of lead from which he began to read or rather chant in a slow measured tone every now and then pausing and pointing to me to my hat and to the spectacles which he himself wore at the moment  the chief listened to him gravely and with an expression of melancholy that grew deeper and sadder till the end  it was a strange scene  i afterwards heard the matter of the prophecy as it proved to be which was thus delivered  i have written it down in the language of the natives spelling it as best i might and i give the translation which i made when i became more or less acquainted with their very difficult dialect 23a  it will be seen that the prophecy whatever its origin was strangely fulfilled  perhaps the gods of this people were not mere idols but evil spirits permitted for some wise purpose to delude their unhappy worshippers 23b  this doubtless they might best do by occasionally telling the truth as in my instance  but this theorynamely that the gods of the heathen are perhaps evil and wandering spiritsis for reasons which will afterwards appear very painful to me personally reminding me that i may have sinned as few have done since the days of the early christians  but i trust this will not be made a reproach to me in our connection especially as i have been the humble instrument of so blessed a change in the land of the heathen there being no more of them left  but to return to the prophecy it is given roughly here in english  it ran thusbut when a man having a chimney pot on his head and four eyes appears and when a sailless ship also comes sailing without wind and breathing smoke then will destruction fall upon the scherian island  perhaps from this and other expressions to be offered in a later chapter the learned will be able to determine whether the speech is of the polynesian or the papuan family or whether as i sometimes suspect it is of neither but of a character quite isolated and peculiar  the effect produced on the mind of the chief by the prophecy amazed me as he looked for a native quite a superior and intelligent person  none of them however as i found escaped the influence of their baneful superstitions  approaching me he closely examined myself my dress and the spectacles which the old priest now held in his hands  the two men then had a hurried discussion and i have afterwards seen reason to suppose that the chief was pointing out the absence of certain important elements in the fulfilment of the prophecy  here was i doubtless a man bearing a chimney on his head for in this light they regarded my hat and having four eyes that is including my spectacles a convenience with which they had hitherto been unacquainted  it was undeniable that a prophecy written by a person not accustomed to the resources of civilization could not more accurately have described me and my appearance  but the ship without sails was still lacking to the completion of what had been foretold as the chief seemed to indicate by waving his hand towards the sea  for the present therefore they might hope that the worst would not come to the worst  probably this conclusion brought a ray of hope into the melancholy face of the chief and the old priest himself left off trembling  they even smiled and in their conversation which assumed a lighter tone i caught and recorded in pencil on my shirtcuff for future explanation words which sounded like aiskistos aneer farmakos catharma and thargeelyah 25  finally the aged priest hobbled back into his temple and the chief beckoning me to follow passed within the courtyard of his house    iv  at the chiefs house   the chief leading the way i followed through the open entrance of the courtyard  the yard was very spacious and under the dark shade of the trees i could see a light here and there in the windows of small huts along the walls where as i found later the slaves and the young men of the family slept  in the middle of the space there was another altar i am sorry to say indeed there were altars everywhere  i never heard of a people so religious in their own darkened way as these islanders  at the further end of the court was a really large and even stately house with no windows but a clerestory indicated by the line of light from within flickering between the top of the wall and the beginning of the highpitched roof  light was also streaming through the wide doorway from which came the sound of many voices  the house was obviously full of people and just before we reached the deep verandah a roofed space open to the air in front they began to come out some of them singing they had flowers in their hair and torches in their hands  the chief giving me a sign to be silent drew me apart within the shadow of a plane tree and we waited there till the crowd dispersed and went i presume to their own houses  there were no women among them and the men carried no spears nor other weapons  when the court was empty we walked up the broad stone steps and stood within the doorway  i was certainly much surprised at what i saw  there was a rude magnificence about this house such as i had never expected to find in the south sea islands  nay though i am not unacquainted with the abodes of opulence at home and have been a favoured guest of some of our merchant princes including messrs bunton the eminent haberdashers whose light is so generously bestowed on our connection i admit that i had never looked on a more spacious receptionroom furnished of course in a somewhat savage manner but obviously regardless of expense  the very threshold between the court and the receptionroom to which you descended by steps was made of some dark metal inlaid curiously with figures of beasts and birds also in metal gold as i afterwards learned of various shades of colour and brightness  at first i had some difficulty in making out the details of the vast apartment which lay beyond  i was almost dizzy with hunger and fatigue and my view was further obscured by a fragrant blue smoke which rose in soft clouds from an open fireplace in the middle of the room  singular to say there was no chimney merely a hole in the lofty roof through which most of the smoke escaped  the ceiling itself which was supported by carved rafters was in places quite black with the vapour of many years  the smoke however was thin and as the fuel on the fire and on the braziers was of dry cedar and sandalwood the perfume though heavy was not unpleasant  the room was partly illuminated by the fire itself partly by braziers full of blazing branches of trees but what was most remarkable there were rows of metal images of young men naked i am sorry to say with burning torches in their hands ranged all along the side walls  a good deal of taste in one sense had been expended in making these images and money had clearly been no object  i might have been somewhat dazzled by the general effect had i not reflected that in my own country gas is within reach of the poorest purse while the electric light itself may be enjoyed by the very beggar in the street  here on the contrary the dripping of the wax from the torches the black smoke on the roof the noisy crackling of the sandalwood in the braziers all combined to prove that these natives though ingenious enough in their way were far indeed below the level of modern civilization  the abominable ceremony of the afternoon would have proved as much and now the absence of true comfort even in the dwelling of a chief made me think once more of the hardships of a missionarys career  but i must endeavour to complete the picture of domestic life in the island which i now witnessed for the first time and which will never be seen again by europeans  the walls themselves were of some dark but glittering metal on which designs in lighter metal were inlaid  there were views of the chief going to the chase his bow in his hand of the chief sacrificing to idols of men and young women engaged in the soul destroying practice of promiscuous dancing there were wild beasts lions among others rivers with fish in them mountains trees the sun and moon and stars all not by any means ill designed for the work of natives  the pictures indeed reminded me a good deal of the ugly assyrian curiosities in the british museum as i have seen them when conducting the children of the bungletonian band of hope through the rooms devoted to the remains of bible peoples such as the egyptians hittites and others  red or blue curtains strangely embroidered hung over the doors and trophies of swords shields and spears not of steel but of some darker metal were fixed on the tall pillars that helped to prop the roof  at the top of the wall just beneath the open unglazed spaces which admitted light and air in the daytime and wind and rain in bad weather was a kind of frieze or coping of some deep blue material 30  all along the sides of the hall ran carved seats covered with pretty light embroidered cloths not very different from modern oriental fabrics  the carpets and rugs were precisely like those of india and persia and i supposed that they must have been obtained through commerce  but i afterwards learned that they were beyond doubt of native manufacture  at the further end of the room was a kind of platform or dais on which tables were set with fruit and wine  but much more curious than the furniture of the hall was the group of women sitting by the fire in the centre  there sat in two rows some twenty girls all busily weaving and throwing the shuttle from hand to hand laughing and chattering in low voices  in the midst of them on a high chair of cedarwood decorated with ivory and with an ivory footstool sat a person whom in a civilized country one must have looked on with respect as a lady of high rank  she like her husband the chief had a golden circlet twisted in her hair which was still brown and copious and she wore an appearance of command  at her feet on a stool reclined a girl who was i must confess of singular beauty  doto had long fair hair a feature most unusual among these natives  she had blue eyes and an appearance of singular innocence and frankness  she was at the moment embroidering a piece of work intended as i afterwards learned with deep pain for the covering of one of their idols to whose service the benighted young woman was devoted  often in after days i saw doto stooping above her embroidery and deftly interweaving the green and golden threads into the patterns of beasts and flowers  often my heart went out to this poor child of pagan tribe and i even pleased myself with the hope that some day a reclaimed and enlightened character she might employ her skill in embroidering slippers and braces for a humble vessel  i seemed to see her a helpmate meet for me holding mothers meetings playing hymntunes on the lyre or the double pipes the native instruments and above all winning the islanders from their cruel and abominable custom of exposing their infant children on the mountains  how differently have all things been arranged  but i am wandering from my story  when we reached the group by the fireside who had at first been unaware of our entrance the chiefs wife gave a slight start alarmed doubtless by my appearance  she could never have seen nor even dreamed of such a spectacle as i must have presented haggard ragged faint with hunger and worn with fatigue as i was  the chief motioned to me that i should kneel at his wifes feet and kiss her hand but i merely bowed not considering this a fit moment to protest otherwise against such sacrilegious mummeries  but the womanher name i learned later was ocyaledid not take my attitude in bad part  the startled expression of her face changed to a look of pity and with a movement of her hand she directed doto to bring a large golden cup from the table at the upper end of the room  into this cup she ladled some dark liquid from a bowl which was placed on a small three legged stand or dumb waiter close to her side  next she spilt a little of the wine on the polished floor with an appearance of gravity which i did not understand  it appears that this spilling of wine is a drink offering to their idols  she then offered me the cup which i was about to taste when i perceived that the liquor was indubitably alcoholic  a total abstainer i had i am thankful to say strength enough to resist the temptation thus adroitly thrust upon me  setting down the cup i pointed to the badge of blue ribbon which though damp and colourless remained faithful to my buttonhole  i also made signs i was hungry and would be glad of something to eat  my gestures as far as the blue ribbon went must have been thrown away of course but any one could understand that i was fainting from hunger  the mistress of the house called to one of the spinning girls who rose and went within the door opening from the platform at the upper end of the room  she presently returned with an old woman a housekeeper as we would say and obviously a faithful and familiar servant  after some conversation of which i was probably the topic the old woman hobbled off laughing  she soon came back bringing to my extreme delight a basket with cakes and goat cheese and some cold pork in a dish  i ought perhaps to say here that in spite of the luxury of their appointments and their extraordinary habit of eating and drinking all day to the going down of the sun as one of their own poets says these islanders are by no means good cooks  i have tasted of more savoury meats dressed in coverings of leaves on hot stones in maori pahs or in new caledonian villages than among the comparatively civilized natives of the country where i now found myself  among the common people especially there was no notion of hanging or keeping meat  often have i seen a man kill a hog on the floor of his house cut it up toast it as one may say at the fire and then offer the grilled and frequently under done flesh to his guests  invariably the guests are obliged to witness the slaughter of the animal which is to supply their dinner  this slaughter is performed as a kind of sacrifice the legs of the beast are the portions of the gods and are laid with bits of fat upon the altars  then chops or rather kabobs of meat are hacked off spitted and grilled or roasted at the fire  consequently all the meat tasted in this island is actually meat offered to idols  when i made this discovery the shock was very great and i feared i was repeating a sin denounced from the earliest ages  but what was i to do not the meat only but the vegetables the fruit the grain the very fish which the natives never eat except under stress of great hunger were sacred to one or other of their innumerable idols  i must eat or starve myself to deatha form of suicide  i therefore made up my mind to eat without scruple remembering that the gods of the nations are nothing at all but the fancies of vain dreamers and the invention of greedy and selfseeking priests  these scruples were of later growth after i had learned that their meals were invariably preceded by a sacrifice partly to provide the food partly as grace before meat  on the present occasion i made an excellent supper though put to a good deal of inconvenience by the want of forks which were entirely unknown on the island  finding that i would not taste the alcoholic liquor which the natives always mixed with a large proportion of water doto rose went out and returned with a great bowl of ivywood curiously carved and full of milk  in this permitted beverage as my spirits were rising i drank the young ladys health indicating my gratitude as well as i could  she bowed gracefully and returned to her task of embroidery  meanwhile her father and mother were deep in conversation and paid no attention to me obviously understanding that my chief need was food  i could not but see that the face of the chiefs wife was overclouded probably with anxiety caused by the prophecy of which i was or was taken for the subject  when my hunger was satisfied i fell it seems into a kind of doze from which i was wakened by the noise of people rising moving and pushing back chairs  i collected my senses and perceived that the room was almost dark most of the inmates had gone and the chief was lighting a torch at one of the braziers  this torch he placed in my hand indicating as i understood that i was to put myself under the guidance of two of the young women who had been spinning  at this i was somewhat perplexed but followed where they went before me each of them holding a burning torch  the light flared and the smoke drifted among the corridors till we came within sound of running water  in a lofty green chamber was a large bath of polished marble carved with shapes of men armed with pitchforks and employed in spearing fish  the bath was full of clear water of somewhat higher than tepid heat and the stream welling up in one part flowed out in another not splashing or spilling the young women now brought flasks of oil large sponges such as are common in these seas and such articles of dress as are worn by the men among the natives  but to my astonishment the girls showed no intention of going away and it soon became evident that they meant to assist me in my toilet  i had some difficulty in getting them to understand the indecorum of their conduct or rather for i doubt if they understood it after all in prevailing on them to leave me  i afterwards learned that this custom shocking as it appears to europeans is regarded as entirely right and usual even by the better class of islanders nor to do them justice have i ever heard any imputations on the morality of their women  except among the shepherds and shepherdesses in the rural districts whose conduct was very regardless a high standard of modesty prevailed among the female natives  in this i need not say they were a notable exception among polynesian races  left to my own devices by the retreat of the young women i revelled in the pleasures of the bath and then the question arose how was i to be clothed  i had of course but one shirt with me and that somewhat frayed and worn  my boots too were almost useless from their prolonged immersion in salt water  yet i could not bring myself to adopt the peculiar dress of the natives though the young persons had left in the bathroom changes of raiment such as are worn by the men of rank  these garments were simple and not uncomfortable but as they showed the legs from the knees downwards like kilts i felt that they would be unbecoming to one in my position  almost the chief distinction between civilized man and the savage is the wearing of trousers  when a missionary in tongo and prime minister of king haui ha there i made the absence of breeches in the males an offence punishable by imprisonment  could i on my very first appearance among the islanders tomorrow fly as it were in the face of my own rules and prove false to my wellknown and often expressed convictions i felt that such backsliding was impossible  on mature consideration therefore i made the following arrangement  the garments of the natives when they condescended to wear any were but two in number  first there was a long linen or woollen shirt or smock without sleeves which fell from the neck to some distance below the knees  this shirt i put on  a belt is generally worn into which the folds of the smock can be drawn up or kilted when the wearer wishes to have his limbs free for active exercise  the other garment is simply a large square piece of stuff silken or woollen as it happens in accordance with the weather and the rank of the wearer  in this a man swathes himself somewhat as a highlander does in his plaid pinning it over the shoulder and leaving the arms free  when one is accustomed to it this kind of dress is not uncomfortable and many of the younger braves carried it with a good deal of grace showing some fancy and originality in the dispositions of the folds  though attired in this barbarous guise i did not of course dispense with my trousers which being black contrasted somewhat oddly with my primrosecoloured ki ton as they call the smock and the dark violet clamis or plaid  when the natives do not go bareheaded they usually wear a kind of light soft wideawake but this  i discarded in favour of my hat which had already produced so remarkable an effect on their superstitious minds  now i was dressed as fittingly as possible in the circumstances but i felt that my chief need was a bed to lie down upon  i did not wish to sleep in the bathroom so taking my torch from the stand in which i had placed it i sallied forth into the corridors attired as i have described and carrying my coat under my arm  a distant light and the noise of females giggling which increased most indecorously as i drew near attracted my attention  walking in the direction of the sounds i soon discovered the two young women to whose charge i had been committed by the chief  they appeared to be in high spirits and seizing my arms before i could offer any resistance they dragged me at a great pace down the passage and out into the verandah  here the air was very fragrant and balmy and a kind of comfortable shakedown of mattresses covered with coloured blankets had been laid for me in a corner  i lay down as soon as the sound of the young womens merriment died out in the distance and after the extraordinary events of the night i was soon sleeping as soundly as if i had been in my fathers house at hackney wick    v  a stranger arrives   when i wakened next morning wonderfully refreshed by sleep and the purity of the air i had some difficulty in remembering where i was and how i came there in such a peculiar costume  but the voices of the servants in the house and the general stir of people going to and fro convinced me that i had better be up and ready to put my sickle into this harvest of heathen darkness  little did i think how soon the heathen darkness would be trying to put the sickle into me  i made my way with little difficulty being guided by the sound of the running water to the bathroom and thence into the gardens  these were large and remarkably well arranged in beds and plots of flowers and fruittrees  i particularly admired a fountain in the middle which watered the garden and supplied both the chiefs house and the town  returning by way of the hall i met the chief who saluting me gravely motioned me to one of many small tables on which was set a bowl of milk some cakes and some roasted kids flesh  after i had done justice to this breakfast he directed me to follow him and walking before me with his goldknobbed staff in his hand passed out of the shady court into the public square  here we found a number of aged men seated on unpleasantly smooth and cold polished stones in a curious circle of masonry  they were surrounded by a crowd of younger men shouting laughing and behaving with all the thoughtless levity and merriment of a polynesian mob  they became silent as the chief approached and the old men rose from their places till he had taken a kind of rude throne in the circle  for my part i was obliged to stand alone in their midst and it seemed that they were debating about myself and my future treatment  first the old priest whom i had seen on the night before got up and as i fancied his harangue was very unfavourable to me  he pointed at the inevitable flowercrowned altar which of course was in the centre of the marketplace and from the way he shook a sickle he held in his hand i believe that he was proposing to sacrifice me on the spot  in the midst of his oration two vultures black with white breasts flew high over our heads chasing a dove which they caught and killed right above the marketplace so that the feathers fell down on the altar  the islanders as i afterwards discovered are full of childish superstitions about the flight of birds from which they derive omens as to future events  the old priest manifestly attempted to make political capital against me out of the interesting occurrence in natural history which we had just observed  he hurried to the altar caught up a handful of the bleeding feathers and with sickle in hand was rushing towards me when he tripped over the head of a bullock that had lately been sacrificed and fell flat on his face while the sickle flew far out of his hand  on this the young men who were very frivolous like most of the islanders laughed aloud and even the elders smiled  the chief now rose with his staff in his grasp and pointing first to me and then to the sky was i imagined propounding a different interpretation of the omen from that advanced by the old priest  meantime the latter with a sulky expression of indifference sat nursing his knees which had been a good deal damaged by his unseemly sprawl on the ground  when the chief sat down a very quiet absentminded old gentleman arose  elatreus was his name as i learned later his family had a curious history and he himself afterwards came to an unhappy and terrible end as will be shown in a subsequent part of my narrative  i felt quite at home as if i had been at some vestrymeeting or some committee in the old country when elatreus got up  he was stout very bald and had a way of thrusting his arm behind him and of humming and hawing which vividly brought back to mind the oratory of my native land he had also plainly enough the trick of forgetting what he intended to say and of running off after new ideas a trick very uncommon among these natives who are born public speakers  i flattered myself that this orator was in favour of leniency towards me but nobody was paying much attention to him when a shout was heard from the bottom of the hill on which the square is built  everybody turned round the elders jumped up with some alacrity for the sake of a better view on the polished stones where they had been sitting and so much was the business before the meeting forgotten in the new excitement that i might have run away unnoticed had there been anywhere to run to  but flight was out of the question unless i could get a boat and some provisions and i had neither  i was pleased however to see that i was so lightly and laxly guarded  the cause of the disturbance was soon apparent  a number of brown half naked sturdy sailors with red caps not unlike fezzes on their heads appeared bawling and making for the centre of the square  they were apparently carrying or dragging some person with them some person who offered a good deal of resistance  among the foreign and unintelligible cries and howls which rang through the marketplace my heart leaped up in natural though unsanctified pleasure as i heard the too wellknown but unexpected accents of british profanity  where the somewhere are you blooming sons of beachcombers dragging a brish shailor  shtand off you ragged set of whitewashed christy minstrels you  wheres the brish conshuls  take me you longshore sons of sharks to the brish conshuls  if theres one white man among you let him stand out and hit a chap his own weight  hullo suddenly cried the speaker whom i had recognized as william bludger one of the most depraved and regardless of the whole wicked crew of the blackbirdhullo if here isnt old captain hymnbooka foolish nickname the sailors had given me  he was obviously more than halfdrunk and carried in his hand a black rumbottle probably from all i knew of him not nearly full  his shirt and trousers were torn and dripping apparently he had been washed ashore like myself after the storm and had been found and brought into the town by some of the fishing population  what a blow to all my hopes was the wholly unlookedfor arrival of this tipsy irreclaimable seaman this unawakened bill bludger  i had framed an ideal of what my own behaviour in my trying circumstances ought to be  often had i read how these islanders possess a tradition that a wonderful white man a being all sweetness and lucidity landed in their midst taught them the knowledge of the arts converted them to peace and good manners and at last mysteriously departed promising that he would return again  i had hopessuch things have happenedthat the islanders might take me for this wonderful white man of their traditions come back according to his promise  if this delusion should occur i would not at once undeceive them but take advantage of the situation and so bring them all into the bungletonian fold  i knew there was no time to waste lutheran french or church of england schemers in schooners might even now be approaching the island with their erroneous and deplorable tenets  again i had reckoned if my hopes proved false on attaining not without dignity the crown of the protomartyr of my connection beyond occasional confinement in police cells consequent on the strategic manoeuvres of the salvation army none of us had ever known what it was to suffer in the cause  if i were to be the first to testify with my blood on this unknown soil at least i could meet my doom with dignity  in any case i should be remembered i had reckoned in the island traditions either as an isolated and mysterious benefactor the child of an otherwise unknown race or as a solitary martyr from afar  all these vain hopes of spiritual pride were now blown to the wind by bill bludgers unexpected appearance and characteristic conduct  no delusions about a divine white stranger from afar could survive the appearance and behaviour of so compromising an acquaintance as william he was one white stranger too many  there he was still struggling shouting swearing smelling of rum and making frantic attempts to reach me and shake hands with me  let bygones be bygones captain hymnbook your reverence he screamed heres your jolly good health and song and he put his horrible black bottle to his unchastened lips  here we are captain two englishmen agin a lot o blooming kanekas lets clear out their whole blessed town and steer for sydney  but perceiving that i did not intend to recognize or carouse with him william bludger now changed his tone yah you lilylivered biblereader he exclaimed what are you going about in that toggery for copying mr toole in paw claudian  you call yourself a missionary  jove youre more like a blooming play hactor in a penny gaff  easy then my hearties he added seeing that the fishermen were approaching him again with ropes in their hands  avast stow your handcuffs  in spite of his oaths and struggles the inebriated mariner was firmly bound hand and foot and placed in the centre of the assembly  i only wished that the natives had also gagged him for his language though of course unintelligible to them was profane and highly painful to me  before returning to business the chiefs carefully inspected the black bottle of which they had dispossessed william bludger  a golden vase was producedthey had always plenty of them handyand the dark fluid was poured into this princely receptacle diffusing a strong odour of rum  each chief carefully tasted the stuff and i was pained on gathering from the expression of their countenances that they obviously relished the firewater which has been the ruin of so many peoples in these beautiful but benighted seas  however there was not enough left to go round and it was manifestly unlikely that william bludger had succeeded in conveying larger supplies from the wreck  the meeting now assumed its former air of earnestness and it was not hard to see that the arrival of my unhappy and degraded fellowcountryman had introduced a new element into the debate  man after man spoke and finally the chief rose as i had little doubt to sum up the discussion he pointed to myself and to william bludger alternately and the words which i had already noted thargeelyah and farmakoi frequently recurred in his speech  his ideas seemed to meet with general approval even the old priest laid aside his sickle and beat applause with his hands  he next rose and taking two garlands of beautiful flowers from the horns of the altar placed one wreath on the head of the drunken sailor who had fallen asleep by this time  he then drew near me and i had little doubt that he meant to make me also wear a garland like some woman of rank and fashion at a giddy secular entertainment  whatever his motive might be i was determined to wear nothing of the kind  but here some attendants grappled and held me my hat was lifted from my brows and the circlet of blossoms was carefully entwined all round my hat  the head covering was then replaced the whole assembly forming a circle danced around me and the unconscious bludger and finally the old priest turning his face alternately to me and to the sun intoned a hymn the audience joining in at intervals  my worst fears were apparently being realized  in spite of the compromising appearance and conduct of bludger it seemed beyond doubt that we were both regarded as in some degree divine and sacred resistance on my part was it will be seen impossible  i could not escape from the hands of my tormentors and i was so wholly ignorant at that time of their tongue that i knew not how to disclaim the honours thus blasphemously thrust upon me  i did my best shouting in english i am no thargeelyah  i am no farmakos supposing those words to be the native terms for one or other of their gods  on this the whole assembly even the gravest burst out laughing each man poking his neighbour in the ribs and uttering what i took to be jests at my expense  their behaviour in this juncture and frequently afterwards when i attempted to make them tell me the meaning of the unknown words and of catharma another expression the chief had used greatly perplexed me  i had afterwards too good reason to estimate their dreadful lack of the ordinary feelings of humanity at its true value  however nothing but laughter most unfitting the occasion could be got out of the assembled natives  they now began to return to their homes and bludger crowned with flowers that became him but ill was carried off not as it seemed to me without even a reverential demeanour on the part of his escort  those who surrounded me a kind of bodyguard of six young men had entirely recovered their composure and behaved to me with a deference that was astonishing but reassuring  from this time i ought to say though permitted to go where i would and allowed to observe even their most secret rites enjoying opportunities such as will never fall to another european i was never but once entirely alone  my worshippers as they might almost be called so humble was their demeanour still kept watchful eyes upon me as if i were a being so precious that they were jealous of my every movement  it was now made plain to me by signs that i must wait for some little space before being conveyed to my appointed residence    vi  a backslider  a warning   we had not remained long by ourselves in the square when the most extraordinary procession which i had ever beheld began to climb into the open space from the town beneath  i do not know if i have made it sufficiently clear that the square on the crest of the isolated hill above the sea was occupied only by public buildings such as the temple the house of the chief and a large edifice used as a kind of town hall so to speak  the natives in general lived in much smaller houses many of them little better than huts and divided by extremely narrow and filthy streets on the slopes and along the shores of the bay  it was from these houses and from all the country round that the procession with persons who fell into its ranks as they came was now making its way  almost all the parties concerned were young boys and girls or very young men and women and though their dress was much scantier and less decent than what our ideas of delicacy require it must be admitted that the general aspect of the procession was far from unpleasing  the clothes and wraps which the men and women wore were of various gay colours and were in most cases embroidered quite skilfully with representations of flowers fruits wild beasts and individuals of grotesque appearance  every one was crowned with either flowers or feathers  but most remarkable of all there was scarcely a person in this large gathering who did not bring or lead some wild bird or beast  the girls carried young wild doves young rooks or the nestlings of such small fowls as sparrows and finches  it was a pretty sight to see these poor uninstructed young women flushed with the exertion of climbing and merry flocking into the square each with her pet as i supposed but the tender mercies of the heathen are cruel half hidden in the folds of her gown  of the young men some carried hawks some chained eagles some young vultures  many were struggling too with wild stags and wild goats which they compelled with the utmost difficulty to march in the ranks of the procession  a number of young persons merely bore in their hands such fruits as were in season obviously fine specimens of which they had reason to be proud  others again were carrying little young bears all woolly comfortable looking creatures while the parent bears adult bears at any rate were brought along chained in the rear  my guards or adorers or whatever the young men who looked after me really were led me forward and made signs to me that i was to bring up the rear of the processionbehind the bears which made no attempt as in the case of the prophet to take the part of a minister of the bungletonian connection  what a position for one who would fain have been opening the eyes of this darkened people to better things  but till i had acquired some knowledge of their language i felt my only chance was to acquiesce in everything not positively sinful  the entrance of a menagerie and horticultural exhibition into the townfor thus i explained to myself what was going on before my eyescould not be severely censured by the harshest critic and i prepared to show my affability by joining in an innocent diversion and popular entertainment  soon i found that after all i was not to be absolutely last in the advance of this miscellaneous exhibition nor were the intentions of the people so harmless as i had imagined  this was no affair of cottage window gardens and a distribution of prizes  the crowd which had collected in front of the chiefs house opened suddenly and in the throng of people i detected a movement of excitement and alarm  next i saw the horns of animals mixed with the heads and shoulders of the multitude and then an extraordinary spectacle burst at full speed upon my gaze  four great wild stags plunging rearing and kicking rushed by dragging a small vehicle of unusual shape in which stood to my horror the chiefs beautiful daughter doto  the vehicle passed me like a flash of horns in spite of the attempts of four resolute men who clung at the stags heads to restrain the impetuosity of these coursers  the car i should explainthough i can hardly expect to be believedwas not unlike the floor of a hansom cab from which the seat the roof the drivers perch and everything else should have been removed except the basis the wheels and the splashboard the part on which we generally find the advertisements of messrs mappin and webb  on this floor then doto stood erect holding the reins her yellow hair had become unbound and was floating like a flag behind her and her beautiful face far from displaying any alarm was flushed with pleasure and pride  she was dressed in splendid and glittering attire over which was fastenedso strange were the manners of these islandersthe newlystripped skin of a great black bear  thus dragged by the wild deer doto passed like a flash through the midst of the men and women her stags being maddened to fresh excitement by the sight and smell of the bears and other wild animals  but eager as were the brutes that dragged the precarious carriage they were somewhat tamed by the great steepness of the ascent up which they bounded to the heights at the back of the town  up this path often narrow and excessively dangerous we all took our way and finally after passing through various perilous defiles and skirting many cliffs we arrived at a level space in front of an ancient temple of one of their heathen gods it was built like the others in the settlement below but the white stone had become brown and yellow with time and weather and the colours chiefly red and blue with which the graven images in contempt of the second commandment were painted had faded and grown very dim  on the broad platform in front of this home of evil spirits had been piled a great mound of turf sloping very gradually and smoothly like the terrace of a wellkept lawn to the summit which itself was perhaps a hundred feet in circumference  on this was erected a kind of breastwork of trunks of trees each tree some fifteen feet in length and in the centre of the circular breastwork was an altar as usual under which blazed a fire of great fierceness  from the temple came a very aged woman dressed in bear skins who carried a torch  this torch she lit at the blaze under the altar and a number of the young men lighting their torches at hers set fire to the outer breastwork in which certain open spaces or entrances had been purposely left  no sooner had the trees begun to catch fire which they did slowly being of green wood than the multitude outside with the most horrible and piercing outcries began to drive the animals which they had brought with them into the midst of the flames  the spectacle was one of the most terrible i ever beheld even among this cruel and outlandish people whose abominable inventions contrasted so strangely with the mildness of their demeanour where their religion was not concerned  it was pitiful to see the young birds many of them not yet able to fly flutter into the flames and the stifling smoke and then fall scorched and twittering miserably  the young lambs and other domesticated animals were forced in without much resistance but the great difficulty was to urge the wolves antelopes and other wild creatures into the blaze  the cries of the multitude who bounded about like maniacs armed with clubs and torches rose madly over the strange unusual screams and howls uttered by the wild beasts in their pain and terror  ever and anon some animal would burst through the crowd perhaps half burned and with its fur on fire and would be pursued to a certain distance after which it was allowed to escape by the sacrificers  as i was watching with all my hopes enlisted on its side the efforts of an antelope to escape i heard a roar which was horrible even in that babel of abominable sights and sounds  a great black bear its pelt one sheet of flame its whole appearance if i may be permitted to say so like that of a fiend from the pit forced its way through the throng and bounding madly to the spot where dotos car stood at a little distance rose erect on its hind feet and fixed its claws in the flank of one of the stags the offleader  instantly the team of stags escaping from the hands of the strong men who stood at their heads plunged violently down the narrow and dangerous path which led to the city  i shouted to doto to leap out but she did not hear or did not understand me  with a fixed look of horror on her white face she dropped the useless reins and the vehicle passed out of sight round a corner of the cliff  i had but a moment in which to reflect on what might be done to rescue her  in that moment i providentially spied a doubleedged axe which lay beside me on the grass having fallen from the hands of one of the natives  snatching up this weapon i rushed to the edge of the cliff and looked down  it was almost a sheer precipice broken only by narrow shelves and clefts on some of which grass grew while on others a slight mountainash or a young birch just managed to find foothold  far far beneath hundreds of feet below i could trace the windings of the path up which we had climbed  instantly my plan was conceived  i would descend the cliff risking my life of course but that was now of small value in this hopelessly heathen land and endeavour to save the benighted doto from the destruction to which she was hastening  her car must pass along that portion of the path which lay like a ribbon in the depth below me unless as seemed too probable it chanced to be upset before reaching the spot  to pursue it from behind was manifestly hopeless  these thoughts flashed through my brain more rapidly than even the flight of the maddened red deer and scarcely less swiftly i began scrambling down the face of the cliff  it was really a series of almost hopeless leaps to which i was committed and the axe to which i clung rather impeded than aided me as i let myself drop from one rocky shelf to another catching at the boughs and roots of trees to break my fall  at last i reached the last ledge before the sheer wall of rock which hung above the path  as i let myself down feeling with my feet for any shelf or crack in the wall i heard the blare of the stags and the rattle of the wheels  half intentionally half against my will i left my hold of a treeroot and slid bumping and scratching myself terribly down the slippery and slatey face of the rocky wall till i fell in a mass on the narrow road  in a moment i was on my feet the axe i had thrown in front of me and i grasped it instinctively as i rose  it was not too soon the deer were almost on me  stepping to the side of the way where a rock gave some shelter i dealt a blow at the nearest stag under which he reeled and fell to the ground his companion stumbling over him  in the mad group of rearing beasts i smote right and left at the harness which gave way beneath my strokes and the unhurt stags sped down the glen and then rushed into separate corries of the hills  the car was upset and doto lay pale and bleeding among the hoofs of the stricken deer  i dragged her out of the danger to the side of the path  i felt her pulse which still fluttered  i brought her in my hat water from the stream and finally had the pleasure of seeing her return to life before the first of her friends came wailing and lamenting and tearing their hair down the path  when they found the girl unwounded though still weak and faint their joy knew no bounds though i too plainly perceived that they were returning thanks to the heathen goddess whose priestess doto was  as for me they once more crowned me in the most elaborate and i think unbecoming manner with purple pandanus flowers  then having laid doto on a litter they returned in procession to the town where the girl was taken into the chiefs house  as we parted she held out her hand to me but instantly withdrew it with a deep sigh  i closely watched her  she was weeping  i had noticed before that all the natives as much as possible avoided personal contact with me  this fact coupled with the reverence which they displayed towards me confirmed my impression that they regarded me as something supernatural not of this world and divine  to remove this belief was most certainly my duty but how was it to be done  alas i must now admit that i yielded to a subtle temptation and was led into conduct unworthy of a vessel  sad to say as i search the rewards of my own heart i am compelled to confess that my real desire was not so much to undeceive the peoplefor in their bewildering myriads of foolish beliefs one more or less was of small importanceas to recommend myself to doto  this young woman though not a member of our connection and wholly ignorant of saving truths had begun to find favour in my eyes and i hoped to lead her to the altar altars for that matter being plentiful enough in this darkened land  i should have remembered the words once spoken by a very gracious young woman the daughter of a pious farmer  mother said she i have made up my mind never to let loose my affections upon any man as is not pious and in good circumstances  doto was for an islander in good circumstances but who ah who could call her pious  i endeavoured it is true to convert her but ah did i go to work in the right way  did i draw in awful colours the certain consequences of ignorance of the truth  did i endeavour to strike a salutary terror into her heathen heart  no such would have been a proper course of conduct but such was not mine  i weakly adopted the opposite planthat used by the jesuits in their dealings with the chinese and other darkened peoples  i attempted meanly attempted but as may be guessed with but limited success to give an orthodox nonconformist character to the observances of dotos religion  for example instead of thundering as was my duty at her worldly diversions of promiscuous dancing and ball play i took a part in these secular pursuits fondly persuading myself that my presence discouraged levity and was a check upon unseemly mirth  thus among the young native men and maidens in the windings of the mazy dance might have been seen disporting himself a person of stalwart form whose attire still somewhat faintly indicated his european origin and sacred functions  a hymnbook in my hand instead of a rattle used by the natives i capered gaily through their midst  often and often i led the music instructing my festive flock in english hymns which however i adapted to gay and artless melodies such as theres some one in de house wid dinah or old joe kicking up behind and afore  this kind of entertainment was entirely new to the natives who heartily preferred it to their own dull music resembling what are called i believe gregorians by a bloated and erastian establishment  so far then i may perchance trust that my efforts were not altogether vain and the seed thus sown may in one or two cases have fallen on ground not absolutely stony  but alas  i have little room for hope  i pursued my career of unblushing economyas the jesuits say meaning alas economy of plain truth speakingand of heathen dissipation  few were the dances in which i did not take a part sinking so low as occasionally to oblige with a hornpipe  my blue ribbon had long ago worn out and with it my strict views on temperance  i acquired a liking for the strange drink of the islandersa thick wine and water sometimes mixed with cheese and honey  in fact i was sliding backlike the unfortunate fanti missionary john greedy ma whose case as reported by precious mr grant allen so painfully moved serious circlesi was sliding back to the level of the savagery around me  may these confessions be accepted in the same spirit as they are offered may it partly palliate my guilt that i had apparently no chance of escape from the island and no hope beyond that of converting the natives and marrying doto  i trusted to do it not as of old by open and fearless denunciation but by slowly winning hearts in a secular and sportive capacity before gaining souls  even so have i seen young priests of the prelatical establishment aim at popularity by playing cricket with liberal coalminers of sectarian persuasions  they told me they were in the mission field and one observed that his favourite post in the field was third man  i know not what he meant  but to return to the island  my career of souldestroying amusement ah how hollow was not uninterrupted by warnings  every now and again the mask was raised and i saw clearly the unspeakable horrors of heathen existence  for example in an earlier part of this narrative i have mentioned an old heathen called elatreus a goodnatured dull absentminded man who reminded me of a respectable british citizen  how awful was his end how trebly awful when i reflect how nearly ibut let me not anticipate elatreus was the head and eldest surviving member of a family which had a singular history  i never could make out what the story was but in consequence of some ancient crime the chief of the family was never allowed to enter the town hall  the penalty if he infringed the law was terrible  now it chanced one day that i was wandering down the street my hands full of rare flowers which i had gathered for doto and with four young doves in my hat  it was spring and at that season the young persons of the island expected to receive such gifts from their admirers  i was also followed by eleven little fawns which i had tamed for her and four young whelps of the bear  at the same time in the lightness of my foolish heart i was singing a native song all about one lityerses to the tune of barbara allen  at this moment i observed coming out of a side street old elatreus  he was doddering along his hands behind his back and his nose in the air followed by a small but increasing crowd of the natives who crept stealthily behind at a considerable distance  i paused to watch what was happening  elatreus entered the main street and lounged along till he came opposite the town hall on which some repairs were being made  the door stood wide open  he gazed at it in a vacant but interested way and went up the steps where he stood staring in an absentminded vacant kind of fashion  i could see that the crowd watching him from the corner of the side street was vastly excited  elatreus now passed his hand across his brow seemed vastly puzzled and yawned  then he slowly entered the town hall  with a wild yell of savage triumph the mob rushed in after him and in a few moments came forth again with elatreus bound and manacled  some one sped away and brought the old priest who carried the sickle  he appeared full of joy and lustily intonedfor they have this popish custom of intoningan unintelligible hymn  by this time elatreus had been wreathed and crowned with flowers and the rude multitude for this purpose seized the interesting orchids which i had gathered for my doto  they then dragged the old man pitifully lamenting to the largest altar in the centre of the square  need i say what followed  the scene was too awful  with a horrible expression of joy the priest laid the poor wretch on the great stone altar and with his keen sicklebut it is too horrible     this was the penalty for a harmless act forbidden by a senseless law which elatreusa most respectable man for an idolaterhad broken in mere innocent absence of mind  alas among such a people how could i ever hope alone and unaided to effect any truly regenerating work  yet i was not wholly discouraged indeed my infatuation for doto made me overlook much profligate behaviour that i do not care to mention in a tract which may fall into the hands of the young  one other example of the native barbarity however i must narrate  a respected couple in the vicinity had long been childless  at length their wishes were crowned with success and a little baby girl was born to them  but the priest who had curious ideas of his own insisted on consulting as to this child a certain witch a woman who dwelt apart in a cave where there was a sulphurous hotwater spring surrounded by laurel bushes regarded as sacred by the benighted islanders  this spring or the fumes that arose from it was supposed to confer on the dweller in the cave the gift of prophecy  she was the servant of apollon and was credited with possessing a spirit of divination  the woman after undergoing or simulating an epileptic attack declared in rhythmical language that the babe must not be allowed to live  she averred that it would bring destruction on scheria the native name for the island which i have styled boothland in honour of the salvation army  this was enough for the priests who did not actually slay the infant but exposed it on the side of a mountain where the beasts and birds were likely to have their way with it  now it chanced that i had climbed the hilltop that day to watch for a sail for i never quite lost hope of being taken away by some british or continental vessel  my attendants for a wonder were all absent at some feastcarneia i think they called itof their heathen gods  the time was early summer it only wanted a fortnight of the date as far as i could reckon at which i had first been cast on the island a year before  as i descended the hillside pleased i must own by the warm blight sunlight the colour of the sea and the smell of the aromatic herbspleased and half forgetful of the horrid heathenism that surrounded me i heard a low wail as of an infant  i searched about in surprise and came on a beautiful baby in rich swaddling bands with a gold signet ring tied round its neck  such an occurrence was not very unusual as the natives like most savages were in the habit of keeping down the surplus population by thus exposing their little ones  the history of the island was full of legends of exposed children picked up by the charitable there was oddly enough no prohibition against this and afterwards recognized and welcomed by their families  as any englishman would have done i lifted the dear little thing in my arms and a happy thought occurring to me carried it off as a present to doto who doted on babies as all girls do  the gift proved to be the most welcome that i had ever offered though doto as usual would not accept it from my hands but made me lay it down beside the hearth which they regarded as a sacred place  even if an enemy reached the hearth of his foe he would thenceforth be quite safe in his house  doto then picked up the child warmed and caressed it sent for milk for its entertainment and was full of pleasure in her new pet  she was a dear good girl doto in spite of her heathen training 74  strangely enough as i thought at the time she burst out weeping when i took my leave of her and seemed almost as if she had some secret to impart to me  this at least showed an interest in me and i walked to my home with high presumptuous thoughts  as i passed a certain group of rocks in a lonely uncultivated district while the grey of evening was falling i heard a low whistle  the place had a bad reputation being thought to be haunted  perhaps i had unconsciously imbibed some of the superstitions of the natives for i started in alarm  then i heard an unmistakably british voice cry in a suppressed tone hi  the underwood rustled and i beheld to my astonishment the form the crawling and abject form of william bludger  since the day of his landing we had never once met william having been sent off to a distant part of the island  hi he said again and when i exclaimed naturally hullo he put his finger on his lips and beckoned to me to join him  this i did and found that he was lurking in a cavern under the group of grey weather worn stones  when i entered the cave bludger fell atrembling so violently that he could not speak  he seemed in the utmost alarm his face quite ashen with terror  what is the matter william bludger i asked have you had a call or why do you thrust yourself on me  have you sich a thing as a chaw about ye he asked in tremulous accents  im that done never a drop has passed my lips for three days strike me dead and id give anything for a chaw o tobacco  a sup of drink you have not got captn hymnbook axing your pardon for the liberty  william i said even in this benighted island you set a pitiful example  you have been drinking sir you are reaping what you have sown and only temperance strict undeviating total abstinence rather can restore your health  so help me cried the wretched man except a drop of pramneian 76 i took the morning i cut and runand that was three days agonothing stronger than castoroil berries have crossed my lips  it aint that sir it aint the drink  itsits the thargeelyah  next week sir they are going to roast usyou and meflog us first and roast us after  oh lord  oh lord    vii  flight   flog us first and roast us afterwards  i repeated mechanically the words of william bludger  why you must be mad they are more likely to fall down and worship usme at any rate  no captn replied william thats your mistake  they say were both catharmata thats what they call us and youre no better than me  and what are catharmata i inquired remembering that this word or something like it had been constantly used by the natives in my hearing  well captn it means first and foremost just the offscourings of creation the very dust and sweepings of the shop answered bludger who had somehow regained his confidence  to have a fellowsufferer and to see the pallor which doubtless overspread my features was a source of comfort to this hardened man  at the same time i confess that if william bludger alone had been destined to suffer i could have contemplated the decree with christian resignation  i speak the beggars patter pretty well now bludger went on and i see catharmata means more than just mere dirt  it means two unlucky devils  william i exclaimed  it means saving your presence two poor coves as has no luck like you and me and that can be got rid of once a year at an entertainment they call the thargeelyah i dunno why a kind o friendly lead  they choose fellows as either behaves ill or has no friends to make a fuss about them and they gives them three dozen or more and takes them down to the beach and burns them alive over a slow fire  and then they toss the ashes out to sea and think all the bad luck goes away with the tide  oh i never was in such a hole as this  bludgers words made me shudder  i had never forgotten the hideous sacrifice doubtless the thargeelyah as they called it that greeted me when i was first cast ashore on the island  to think that i had only been saved that i might figure as a victim of some of their heathen gods  oh now the thought came back to me with a bitter repentance that if i had only converted all the islanders they would never have dreamed of sacrificing me in honour of a mere idol  why had i been so lukewarm why had i backslidden why had i endeavoured to make myself agreeable by joining in promiscuous dances when i should have been thundering against pagan idolatry holy water idols sacrifices and the whole abominable system of life on the island  true i might have goaded them into slaying me i might have suffered as a martyr but at the least i would have deserved the martyrs crown  and now i was to perish at the stake without even the precious consolation of being a real martyr and was to be flogged into the bargain  i gave a hollow groan as these reflections passed through my mind and this appeared to afford william bludger some consolation  you dont seem to like it yourself captn whats your advice  were both in the same boat leastways i wish we were in a boat anyhow were both in the same hole  there was no denying this and it was high time to mature some plan of escape  already i must have been missed by my attendants my gaolers rather who would have returned from their festival and would be looking for me everywhere  i bitterly turned over in my mind the facts of our situation ours for as a just punishment of my remissness i was in the same quandary as a drunken dissipated sailor before the mast  if william had but possessed a sweet and tuneful voice often a gift found in the most depraved natures and if i had been able to borrow a harmonium on wheels i would not even now have despaired of converting the whole island in the course of the week  as remarkable feats have been performed with equal alacrity by precious messrs moody and sankey and i am informed that expeditious conversions are by no means infrequent among politicians  but it was vain to think of this resource as william had no voice and knew no hymns while i had no means of access to a perambulating harmonium  ill tell you what it is sir said bludger i have a notion  name it william i replied my heart and manner softened by community in suffering and terror  well if i were you sir i would not go home tonight at all id stop where you are  the beggars wont find you let them hunt as they like they darent come near this place bless you its an arnt by which he meant that it was haunted  well said i but how should we be any better off tomorrow morning  thats just it sir said bludger  well be up with the first stroke of dawn nip down to the harbour get on board a boat and be off before any of them are stirring  but even if we manage to secure a boat i said what about provisions and where are we to sail for  oh never mind that said bill we cant be worse off than we are and ill slip out tonight and lay in some prog in the town  also some grog if i can lay my hands on it he added with an unholy smile  no william i murmured no grog our lives depend on our sobriety  always apreaching the old tubthumper i heard william say to himself but he made no further reference to the subject  it was now quite dark and we lay whispering in the damp hollow under the great stone  our plan was to crawl away at the first blush of dawn when men generally sleep most soundly that william should enter one of the unguarded houses for these people never stole and did not know the meaning of the word thief that he should help himself to provisions and that meanwhile i should have a boat ready to start in the harbour  this larcenous but inevitable programme we carried out after waiting through dreadful hours of cold and shivering anxiety  every cry of a night bird from the marsh or the wood sent my heart into my mouth  i felt inconceivably mean and remorseful my vanity having received a dreadful shock from the discovery that far from being a god i was to be a kind of burntoffering  at last the east grew faintly grey and we started not keeping together but bludger marching cautiously in my rear at a considerable distance we only met one person a dissipated young man who i greatly fear had been paying his court to a shepherdess in the hills  when he shouted a challenge i replied erastes eimi which means i am sorry to say i am a lover and implied that i also had been engaged in low intrigue farewell with good fortune he replied and went on his way singing some catch about amaryllis who i presume was the object of his unhallowed attentions  we slipped into the silent town unwalled and unguarded as it was for as one of their own poets had said we dwell by the wash of the waves far off from toilsome men and with us are no folk conversant  they were a race that knew war only by a vague tradition that they had dwelt at some former age in an island perhaps new zealand where they were subject to constant annoyance from giantsa likely story  thence they had migrated to their present home where only one white man had ever been cast awayone odysseus so their traditions declaredbefore our arrival  him however they had treated hospitably very unlike their contemplated behaviour to bludger and me  i am obliged to make this historical digression that the reader may understand how it happened under providence that we were not detected in passing through the town and how bludger successfully accomplished what i fear was by no means his first burglary  we parted at the chiefs house bill to secure provisions and i to unmoor a boat and bring her round to a lonely bay on the coast where my companion was to join me  i accomplished my task without the slightest difficulty selected a light craftthey did not use canoes but rowed boats like coraclesand was lying at anchor moored with a heavy stone in the bay  the dawn was now breaking in the most beautiful coloursgold purple crimson and greenacross the sea  all nature was still save for the first pipe of awakening birds  there was a delicate fragrance in the air which was at once soft and keen and as i watched the red sunlight on the high cliffs and on the smooth trunks of the palm trees i felt strange to say a kind of reluctance to leave the island  the people apart from their cruel and abominable religion were the gentlest and most peaceful i have ever known  they were beautiful to look upon so finely made and shapely that i have never seen their like their language was exquisitely sweet and melodious and though except hymns i do not care for poetry yet i must admit that some of their compositions in verse were extremely pleasing though they were ignorant of the art of rhyme  all about them was beautifully made and they were ignorant of poverty  i never saw a beggar on the island and christians unhappily do not share their goods with each other and with the poor so freely as did these benighted heathens  often have i laboured to make them understand what our pauper question means but they could not comprehend me  how can a man lack home and food and fire they would say do people not love each other in your country  i explained that we love each other as christians but this did not seem to enlighten their benighted minds  on the other hand it is true that they settle their population question by strangling or exposing the majority of their infant daughters  rocked on the smooth green swell of the sea beneath the white rocks i was brooding over these and many other matters when i heard sudden and violent movements in the deep vegetation on the hillside  the laurel groves were stirred and bill bludger with a basket in his hand bounded down the slope and swam for dear life to the boat  theyre after me he cried and at that moment an arrow quivered in the side of the boat  i helped william on board as well as i might under a shower of arrows from the hilltop most of which owing to the distance were ill directed and fell short or went wide  into the boat at last i got him and thrusting an oar in his direction i said pull for your life and began rowing  to my horror the boat made no way but kept spinning round  a glance in the bow showed me what was the matter william bludger was hopelessly intoxicated  he had got at the jars of wine in the chiefs cellarthalamos they call itand had not taken the precaution of mixing the liquor with water as the natives invariably do when they drink  the excitement of running had sent the alcoholic fumes direct to his brain and now he lay a useless and embarrassing cargo in the bows  meanwhile the shouts of the natives rang nearer and louder and i knew that boats would soon be launched for our capture  i thought of throwing bludger overboard and sculling but determined not to stain what might be my last moments with an act of selfishness  i therefore pulled hard for the open sea but to no avail  on every side boats crowded round me and i should probably have been shot or speared but for the old priest who erect in the bows of the largest vessel kept yelling that we were to be taken alive  alas  i well knew the secret of his cruel mercies  he meant to reserve us for the sacrifice    viii  saved   why should i linger over the sufferings of the miserable week that followed our capture  hauled back to my former home i was again made the object of the mocking reverence of my captors  ah how often in my reckless youth have my serious aunts warned me that i would be a goat at the last  too true too true now i was to be a scapegoat to be driven forth as these ignorant and strangely perverted people believed with the sins of the community on my head those sins which would according to their miserable superstition be expiated by the death and consumed away by the burning of myself and william bludger  the week went by as all weeks must and at length came the solemn day which they call thargeelyah the day more sacred than any other to their idol apollon  long before sunrise the natives were astir indeed i do not think they went to bed at all but spent the night in hideous orgies i know that tossing sleepless through the weary hours i heard the voices of young men and women singing on the hillsides and among the myrtle groves which are holy to the most disreputable of their deities a female named aphrodighty  harps were twanging too and i heard the refrain of one of the native songs tonight they love who never loved before tonight let him who loves love all the more  the words have unconsciously arranged themselves even in english as poetry those who know thomas gowles best best know how unlikely it is that he would willingly dabble in the worldly art of versefashioning  think of my reflections with a painful shameful and above all undeserved death before me while all the fragrant air was ringing with lascivious merriment  my impression is that as all the sins of the year were in their opinion to be got rid of next day and tossed into the sea with the ashes of bludger and myself the natives had made up their mindsan eligible opportunity now presenting itselfto be as wicked as they knew how  alas though i have not dwelt on this painful aspect of their character they knew how only too well  the sun rose at last and flooded the island when i perceived that from every side crowds of revellers were pressing together to the place where i lay in fetters  they had a wild dissipated air flowers were wreathed and twisted in their wet and dewy locks which floated on the morning wind  many of the young men were merely dressedif dressed it could be calledin the skins of leopards panthers bears goats and deer tossed over their shoulders  in their hands they all held wet dripping branches of fragrant trees many of them tipped with pine cones and wreathed with tendrils of the vine  others carried switches of which i divined the use only too clearly and the women were waving over their heads tame serpents which writhed and wriggled hideously  it was an awful spectacle  i was dragged forth by these revellers many of them were intoxicated and in a momenti blush even now to think of iti was stripped naked nothing was left to me but my hat and spectacles which for some religious reason i presume i was fortunately allowed to retain  then i was driven with blows which hurt a great deal into the marketplace and up to the great altar where william bludger also naked was lying more dead than alive  william i said solemnly what cheer  he did not answer me  even in that supreme moment it was not difficult to discern that william had been looking on the wine when it was red and had not confined himself to mere ocular observation  i tried to make him remember he was an englishman that the honour of our country was in our hands and that we should die with the courage and dignity befitting our race  these were strange consolations and exhortations for me to offer in such an extremity but now it had come to the last pass it is curious what mere worldly thoughts hurried through my mind  my words were wasted the natives seized william and forced him to his feet  then while a hymn was sung they put chains of black and white figs round our necks and thrust into our hands pieces of cheese figs and certain peculiar herbs  this formed part of what may well be called the ritual of this cruel race  may ritualists heed my words and turn from the errors of their ways  too well i knew all that now awaited us  all that i had seen and shuddered at on the day of my landing on the island was now practised on self and partner  we had to tread the long paved way to the distant cove at the rivers mouth we had to endure the lashes from the switches of wild fig  the priestess carrying the wooden idol walked hard by us and cried out whenever the blows fell fewer or lighter that the idol was waxing too heavy for her to bear  then they redoubled their cruelties  it was a wonderfully lovely day  in the blue heaven there was not a cloud  we had reached the rivers mouth and were fast approaching the stakes that had already been fixed in the sands for our execution nay the piles of green wood were already being heaped up by the young men there was there could be no hope and weary and wounded i almost welcomed the prospect of death however cruel  suddenly the blows ceased to shower on me and i heard a cry from the lips of the old priest and turning about i saw that the eyes of all the assembled multitude were fixed on a point on the horizon  looking automatically in the direction towards which they were gazing i beheldoh joy oh wonderi beheld a long trail of cloud floating level with the sea  it was the smoke of a steamer  too late too late i thought and bitterly reflected that had the vessel appeared but an hour earlier the attention of my cruel captors might have been diverted to such a spectacle as they had never seen before  but it was not too late  perched on a little hillock and straining his gaze to the south the old priest was speaking loudly and excitedly  the crowd deserted us and gathered about him  i threw myself on the sand weary hopeless parched with thirst and racked with pain  bludger was already lying in a crumpled mass at my feet  i think he had fainted  i retained consciousness but that was all  the fierceness of the sun beat upon me the sky and sea and shore swam before me in a mist presently i heard the voice of the priest raised in the cadences which he favoured when he was reading texts out of their sacred books if books they could be called  i looked at him with a faint curiosity and perceived that he held in his hands the wooden casket adorned with strangely carved bands of gold and ivory which i had seen on the night of my arrival on the island  from this he had selected the old grey scraps of metal scratched as i was well aware with what they conceived to be ancient prophecies  i was now sufficiently acquainted with the language to understand the verses which he was chanting and which i had already heard without comprehending them  they ran thus in english  but when a man having a chimney pot on his head and four eyes appears in scheria and when a ship without sails also comes sailing without wind and breathing smoke then shall destruction fall on the island  he had not ended when it was plain even to those ignorant people that the prophecy was about to be fulfilled  from the long narrow black line of the steamer which had approached us with astonishing speed sailing without wind and breathing smoke there burst six flashes of fire followed by a peal like thunder and six tall fountains as the natives fancied of seawater rose and fell in the bay where the shells had lighted  it was plain that the commander of the vessel finding himself in unknown seas and hard by an unvisited country was determined to strike terror and command respect by this salute  the noise of the broadside had scarcely died away when the natives fled disappeared like magic leaving many of their garments behind them  they were making for their town which was concealed from the view of the rapidly nearing steamer  from her mast i could now see flaunting the slight breeze the dear old union jack and the banner of the salvation navy 95  my resolution was taken in a moment  bludger had now recovered consciousness and was picking up heart  i thrust into his hands one of the branches with which we had been flogged fastened to it a cloak of one of the natives bade him keep waving it from a rocky promontory and rushing down to the sea i leaped in and swam with all my strength towards the vessel  weak as i was my new hopes gave me strength and presently from the crest of a wave i saw that the people of the steamer were lowering a boat and rowing towards me  in a few minutes they had reached me my countrymens hands were in mine they dragged me on board they pulled back to their vessel and i stood entirely undressed on the deck of a british ship  so long had i lived among people heedless of modesty that i was rushing with open arms towards the officer on the quarterdeck who was dressed as a bishop when i heard a scream of horror  i turned round in time to see the bishops wife fleeing precipitately to the cabin and driving her children and governess in front of her  then all the horror of the situation flooded my heart and brain and i fell fainting on the quarterdeck  when i recovered my consciousness i found myself plainly but comfortably dressed in the ordinary costume except the hat which lay beside me of a dean in the church of england  my wounds had been carefully attended to william bludger had been taken on board and i was surrounded by the kind faces of my benefactors including the bishops consort  my apologies for my somewhat sudden and unceremonious intrusion were cut short by the arrival of tea and a slight collation suitable for an invalid  in an hour i was walking the quarterdeck with the bishop in command of the william wilberforce armed steam yacht of north shields fitted out for the purposes of the salvation navy  from the worthy prelate in command of the william wilberforce i learned much concerning his own past career and the nature of his enterprise as i directed the navigation of the vessel through the shoals and reefs which lay about the harbour of the island  the bishop a purely brevet title would refresh his memory now and then from a penny biography of himself with which he was provided and the following in brief is a record of his life and adventures  thomas sloggins that was his name from his earliest infancy had been possessed with a passion for doing good to others a passion alas but too rarely reciprocated  i pass over many affecting details of his adventures as a ministering child how he endeavoured to win his father from tobacco by breaking his favourite pipes how he strove to wean his elder brother from cruel fieldsports by stuffing the joints of his fishingrod with gravel with many other touching incidents  being almost entirely uneducated young sloggins when he reached mans estate conceived that he would most benefit his fellowcreatures by combining the professions of the pulpit and the pressby preaching on sundays and at odd times while he acted as outdoor reporter to the rowdy puritan on every lawful day  being a man of great earnestness and enterprise he soon rose in the ranks of the salvation navy and at one time commanded an evangelical barge on the benighted canals of our country  finally he made england almost too hot to hold him by the original forms of his benevolence while at the same time he acquired the utmost esteem and confidence of many wealthy philanthropists and excellent if impulsive ladies  these good people provided him with that wellequipped and armed steam yacht the william wilberforce which he manned with a crew of converted characters they certainly looked as if they must have needed a great deal of converting and he had now for months been cruising in the south pacific  a local cyclone had driven the william wilberforce out of her reckoning and hence the appearance of that vessel in the very nick of time to achieve my rescue  when the bishop had finished his story i briefly recapitulated to him my own adventures and we agreed that the conversion of the island must be our earliest task  to begin with we steered into the harbour where a vast multitude of the natives were assembled in arms and awaited our approach with a threatening demeanour  our landing was opposed but a few welldirected volleys from a gardiner gun which did not jam caused the hostile force to disperse and we landed in great state  marching on the chiefs house we were received with an abject submission that i had scarcely expected  the people were absolutely cowed more by the fulfilment of the prophecy i think than even by the execution done by our gardiner machine gun  at the bishops request i delivered a harangue in the native tongue declaring that we only required the british flag to be hoisted on the palace and the immediate disendowment of the heathen church as in those parts established  i was listened to in uneasy silence but my demand for lodgings in the palace was acceded to and in a few hours the bishop with his wife and children were sumptuously housed under the roof of the chief  the ladies of the chiefs family showed great curiosity in watching and endeavouring to converse with our friends  i was amused to see how soon the lighthearted islanders appeared to forget their troubles and apprehensions  doto in particular became quite devoted to the prelates elder daughter the youngest of the bishops family was suffering from measles and would never be out of her company  thus all seemed to fare merrily presents were brought to usflowers fruit the feathers of rare birds and ornaments of native gold were literally showered upon the ladies of the party  the chief promised to call a meeting of his counsellors on the morrow and all seemed going on well when alas measles broke out in the palace  the infant whom i had presented to dotothe infant whom i had found on the mountain sidewas the first sufferer  then doto caught the disease herself then her mother then the chief  in vain we attempted to nurse and tend them in vain we expended the contents of the ships medicine chest on the invalids  the malady having as it were an entirely new field to work upon raged like the most awful pestilence  through all ranks of the people it spread like wildfire many died none could be induced to take the most ordinary precautions  the natives became as it were mad under the torments of fever and the burning heat of the unaccustomed malady they rushed about quite unclad for the sake of the deceptive coolness and hundreds of them cast themselves into the sea and into the river  it was my sad lot to see my dear doto diethe first of the sufferers in the palace to succumb to the disease  meanwhile the bishop and myself being entirely absorbed in attendance on the sick the crew of the william wilberforce i deeply regret to say escaped from all restraint and forgot what was due to themselves and their profession  they revelled with the most abandoned of the natives and disease and drink ravaged the once peaceful island  every sign of government and order vanished  the old priest built a huge pile of firewood and laying himself there with the images of the gods set fire to the whole and perished with his own false religion  after this event the island ceased to be a safe residence for ourselves among the mountains as i learned where the pestilence had not yet penetrated the shepherds and the wilder tribes were gathering in arms one night we stole on board the william wilberforce leaving the city desolate filled with the smoke of funeral pyres and the wailing of men and women  there was a dreadful sultry stillness in the air and all day long wild beasts had been dashing madly into the sea and the sky had been obscured by flights of birds  on all the crests of the circle of surrounding hills we saw in the growing darkness the beacons and camp fires of the insurgents from the interior  just before the dawn the william wilberforce was attacked by the whole mass of the natives in boats and rafts  but we had not been unprepared for this movement nor were the resources of science unequal to the occasion  we had surrounded the william wilberforce with a belt or cordon of torpedoes and as each of the assaulting boats touched the boom a terrible explosion shook the water into fountains of foam and the waves were strewn with scalded wounded and mutilated men  meanwhile we bombarded the city and the harbour and the night passed amid the most awful sounds and sightsfire smoke yells of anger and pain cries of the native leaders encouraging their men and shouts from our own people who had to repel the boarders when the boom was at last forced with pikes and cutlasses  just before the dawn a strange thing happened  a great glowing coal as it seemed fell with a hissing crash on the deck of the william wilberforce and others dropped with a strange sound and a dreadful odour of burning in the water all around us  had the natives discovered some mode of retaliating on our use of firearms  i looked in the direction of their burning city and beheld on the sharp peak of the highest mountain now visible in the grey morning light an object like a gigantic pinetree of fire  the blazing trunk rose slim and straight from the mountain crest and at a vast height developed a wilderness of burning branches  fearful hollow sounds came from the hill its sides were seamed with racing cataracts of living lava of coursing and leaping flames which rolled down with incredible swiftness and speed towards the doomed city  then the waters of the harbour were smitten and shaken and the william wilberforce rocked and heaved as in the most appalling storm though all the winds were silent while a mighty wave swept far inland towards the streams of fire  there was no room for doubt a volcanic eruption was occurring and a submarine earthquake as not uncommonly happens had also taken place  our only hope was in immediate flight  presently steam was got up and we steamed away into the light of the glowing east leaving behind us only a burning island and a fire like an ugly dawn flaring in the western sky  when we returned in the evening boothlandas i may now indeed call it for scheria has ceased to bewas one black smoking cinder  hardly a tree or a recognizable rock remained to show that this had once been a peaceful home of men  the oracle or prophecy of the old priest had been horribly though of course quite accidentally fulfilled        little remains to be told  on my return home i chanced to visit the british museum and there much to my surprise observed an old piece of stone chipped with the characters or letters in use among the natives of scheria  why said i reading the words aloud these are the characters which the natives employed on my island  these said the worthy official who accompanied me  why these are the most archaic greek letters which have yet been discovered inscriptions from beneath the lava beds of santorin  i cant help that i said  the polynesians used them too and you see i can read them easily though i dont know greek  i then told him the whole story of my connection with the island and of the unfortunate results of the contact between these poor people and our superior modern civilization  i have rarely seen a man more affected by any recital than was the head of the classical department of the museum by my artless narrative  when i described the sacrifice i saw on landing in the island he exclaimed great heavens the attic thargelia  he grew more and more excited as i went on and producing a greek book pausanias he showed me that the sacrifice of wild beasts was practised sixteen hundred years ago in honour of artemis elaphria  the killing of old elatreus for entering the town hall reminded him of a custom in achaea pthiotis  when i had finished my tale he burst out into violent and libellous language  you have destroyed he said with your miserable modern measles and gardiner guns the last remaining city of the ancient greeks  the winds cast you on the shore of phaeacia the island sung by homer and in your brutal ignorance you never knew it  you have ruined a happy harmless and peaceful people and deprived archaeology of an opportunity that can never never return  i do not know about archaeology but as for harmless and peaceful people i leave it to my readers to say whether the islanders were anything of the sort  i learn that the government has just refused to give the museum a grant of five thousand pounds to be employed in what are called excavations in ancient phaeacia diggings that is in boothland  with so many darkened people still ignorant of our enlightened civilization i think the grant would be a shameful waste of public money 106        we publish the original text of the prophecy repeatedly alluded to by mr gowles  the learned say that no equivalent occurs for the line about his four eyes and it is insinuated in a literary journal of eminence that mr gowles pilfered the notion from goods glass eye in a secular romance called king solomons mines which mr gowles we are sure never heard of in his lifeed  the prophecy     the prophecy in greek  not reproduced     in the wrong paradise an occidental apologue   in the drawingroom or as it is more correctly called the dormitory of my club i had been reading a volume named sur lhumanite posthume by m dassier a french follower of comte  the mixture of positivism and ghoststories highly diverted me  moved by the sagacity and pertinence of m dassiers arguments for a limited and fortuitous immortality i fell into such an uncontrollable fit of laughter as caused i could see first annoyance and then anxiety in those members of my club whom my explosion of mirth had awakened  as i still chuckled and screamed it appeared to me that the noise i made gradually grew fainter and more distant seeming to resound in some vast empty space even more funereal and melancholy than the dormitory of my club the tepidarium it has happened to most people to laugh themselves awake out of a dream and every one who has done so must remember the ghastly hollow and maniacal sound of his own mirth  it rings horribly in a quiet room where there has been as the veddahs of ceylon say is the case in the world at large nothing to laugh at  dean swift once came to himself after a dream laughing thus hideously at the following conceit i told apronia to be very careful especially about the legs  well the explosions of my laughter crackled in a yet more weird and lunatic fashion about my own ears as i slowly became aware that i had died of an excessive sense of the ludicrous and that the space in which i was so inappropriately giggling was indeed the forecourt of the house of hades  as i grew more absolutely convinced of this truth and began dimly to discern a strange world visible in a sallow light like that of the london streets when a black fog hangs just over the houses my hysterical chuckling gradually died away  amusement at the poor follies of mortals was succeeded by an awful and anxious curiosity as to the state of immortality and the life after death  already it was certain that the manes are somewhat and that annihilation is the dream of people sceptical through lack of imagination  the scene around me now resolved itself into a high grey upland country bleak and wild like the waste pastoral places of liddesdale  as i stood expectant i observed a figure coming towards me at some distance  the figure bore in its hand a gun and as i am shortsighted i at first conceived that he was the gamekeeper  this affair i tried to say to myself is only a dream after all i shall wake and forget my nightmare  but still the man drew nearer and i began to perceive my error gamekeepers do not usually paint their faces red and green neither do they wear scalplocks a tuft of eagles feathers moccasins and buffalo hide cloaks embroidered with representations of war and the chase  this was the accoutrement of the stranger who now approached me and whose coppercoloured complexion indicated that he was a member of the red indian or as the late mr morgan called it the ganowanian race  the strangers attire was old and clouted the barrel of his flintlock musket was rusted and the stock was actually overgrown with small funguses  it was a peculiarity of this man that everything he carried was more or less broken and outworn  the barrel of his piece was riven his tomahawk was a mere shard of rusted steel on many of his accoutrements the vapour of fire had passed  he approached me with a stately bearing and after saluting me in the fashion of his people gave me to know that he welcomed me to the land of spirits and that he was deputed to carry me to the paradise of the ojibbeways  but sir i cried in painful confusion there is here some great mistake  i am no ojibbeway but an agnostic the afterlife of spirits is only as one of our great teachers says an hypothesis based on contradictory probabilities and i really must decline to accompany you to a place of which the existence is uncertain and which if it does anywhere exist would be uncongenial in the extreme to a person of my habits  to this remonstrance my ojibbeway virgil answered in effect that in the enormous passenger traffic between the earth and the next worlds mistakes must and frequently do occur  quisque suos patimur manes as the roman says is the rule but there are many exceptions  many a man finds himself in the paradise of a religion not his own and suffers from the consequences  this was in brief the explanation of my guide who could only console me by observing that if i felt ill at ease in the ojibbeway paradise i might perhaps be more fortunate in that of some other creed  as for your agnostics said he their main occupation in their own next world is to read the poetry of george eliot and the philosophical works of mr j s mill  on hearing this i was much consoled for having missed the entrance to my proper sphere and i prepared to follow my guide with cheerful alacrity into the paradise of the ojibbeways  our track lay at first along the path of souls and the still grey air was only disturbed by a faint rustling and twittering of spirits on the march  we seemed to have journeyed but a short time when a red light shone on the left hand of the way  as we drew nearer this light appeared to proceed from a prodigious strawberry a perfect mountain of a strawberry  its cool and shining sides seemed very attractive to a thirsty soul  a red man dressed strangely in the feathers of a raven stood hard by and loudly invited all passersby to partake of this refreshment  i was about to excavate a portion of the monstrous strawberry being partial to that fruit when my guide held my hand and whispered in a low voice that they who accepted the invitation of the man that guarded the strawberry were lost  he added that into whatever paradise i might stray i must beware of tasting any of the food of the departed  all who yield to the temptation must inevitably remain where they have put the food of the dead to their lips  you said my guide with a slight sneer seem rather particular about your future home and you must be especially careful to make no error  thus admonished i followed my guide to the river which runs between our world and the paradise of the ojibbeways  a large stump of a tree lies half across the stream the other half must be crossed by the agility of the wayfarer little children do but badly here and an ojibbeway woman said my guide can never be consoled when her child dies before it is fairly expert in jumping  such young children they cannot expect to meet again in paradise  i made no reply but was reminded of some good and unhappy women i had known on earth who were inconsolable because their babes had died before being sprinkled with water by a priest  these babes they like the ojibbeway matrons could not expect to meet again in paradise to a grownup spirit the jump across the mystic river presented no difficulty and i found myself instantly among the wigwams of the ojibbeway heaven  it was a remarkably large village and as far as the eye could see huts and tents were erected along the river  the sound of magic songs and of drums filled all the air and in the fields the spirits were playing lacrosse  all the people of the village had deserted their homes and were enjoying themselves at the game  outside one hut however a perplexed and forlorn phantom was sitting and to my surprise i saw that he was dressed in european clothes  as we drew nearer i observed that he wore the black garb and white necktie of a minister in some religious denomination and on coming to still closer quarters i recognized an old acquaintance the rev peter mcsnadden  now peter had been a jined member of that mysterious u p kirk which according to the author of lothair was founded by the jesuits for the greater confusion of scotch theology  peter i knew had been active as a missionary among the red men in canada but i had neither heard of his death nor could conceive how his shade had found its way into a paradise so inappropriate as that in which i encountered him  though never very fond of peter my heart warmed to him as the heart sometimes does to an acquaintance unexpectedly met in a strange land  coming cautiously behind him i slapped peter on the shoulder whereon he leaped up with a wild unearthly yell his countenance displaying lively tokens of terror when he recognized me he first murmured i thought it was these murdering apaches again and it was long before i could soothe him or get him to explain his fears and the circumstance of his appearance in so strange a final home  sir said peter its just some terrible mistake  for twenty years was i preaching to these poor painted bodies anent heaven and hell and trying to win them from their fearsome notions about a place where they would play at the ba on the sabbath and the like shameful heathen diversions  many a time did i round it to them about a far far other place     where congregations neer break up    and sermons never end  and now lo and behold here i am in their heathenish gehenna where the sabbathday is just clean neglected indeed i have lost count myself and do not know one day from the other  oh man its just rideeclous a bodyi mean a souldoes not know where to turn  here peter whose accent i cannot attempt to reproduce he was a paisley man burst into honest tears  though i could not but agree with peter that his situation was just rideeclous i consoled him as well as i might saying that a man should make the best of every position and that where there was life there was hope a sentiment of which i instantly perceived the futility in this particular instance  ye do not know the worst the rev mr mcsnadden went on  i am here to make them sport like samson among the philistines  their paradise would be no paradise to them if they had not a paleface as they say to scalp and tomahawk  and i am that paleface  before you can say scalpingknife these awful apaches may be on me taking my scalp and other leeberties with my person  it grows again my scalp does immediately but thats only that they may take it some other day  the full horror of mr mcsnaddens situation now dawned upon me but at the same time i could not but perceive that without the presence of some paleface to torturepeter or anotherparadise would indeed be no paradise to a red indian  in the same way tertullian or some other early father has remarked that the pleasures of the blessed will be much enhanced by what they observe of the torments of the wicked  as i was reflecting thus two wild yells burst upon my hearing  one came from a band of apache spirits who had stolen into the ojibbeway village the other scream was uttered by my unfortunate friend  i confess that i fled with what speed i might nor did i pause till the groans of the miserable peter faded in the distance he was indeed a man in the wrong paradise  in my anxiety to avoid sharing the fate of peter at the hands of the apaches i had run out of sight and sound of the ojibbeway village  when i paused i found myself alone on a wide sandy tract at the extremity of which was an endless thicket of dark poplartrees a grove dear to persephone  here and there in the dank sand half buried by the fallen generations of yellow poplarleaves were pits dug a cubit every way and there were many ruinous altars of ancient stones  on some were engraved figures of a divine pair a king and queen seated on a throne while men and women approached them with cakes in their hands or with the sacrifice of a cock  while i was admiring these strange sights i beheld as it were a moving light among the deeps of the poplar thicket and presently saw coming towards me a young man clad in white raiment and of a radiant aspect  in his hand he bore a golden wand whereon were wings of gold  the first down of manhood was on his lip he was in that season of life when youth is most gracious  then i knew him to be no other than hermes of the golden rod the guide of the souls of men outworn  he took my hand with a word of welcome and led me through the gloom of the poplar trees  like thomas the rhymer on his way to fairyland     we saw neither sun nor moon    but we heard the roaring of the sea  this eternal swowing of a flode was the sound made by the circling stream of oceanus as he turns on his bed washing the base of the white rock and the sands of the region of dreams  so we fleeted onwards till we came to marvellous lofty gates of black adamant that rose before us like the steep side of a hill  on the left side of the gates we beheld a fountain flowing from beneath the roots of a white cypresstree and to this fountain my guide forbade me to draw near  there is another yonder he said pointing to the right hand a stream of still water that issues from the lake of memory and there are guards who keep that stream from the lips of the profane  go to them and speak thus i am the child of earth and of the starry sky yet heavenly is my lineage and this yourselves know right well  but i am perishing with thirst so give me speedily of that still water which floweth forth of the mere of memory  and they will give thee to drink of that spring divine and then shalt thou dwell with the heroes and the blessed  so i did as he said and went before the guardians of the water  now they were veiled and their voices when they answered me seemed to come from far away thou comest to the pure from the pure they said and thou art a suppliant of holy persephone  happy and most blessed art thou advance to the reward of the crown desirable and be no longer mortal but divine  then a darkness fell upon me and lifted again like mist on the hills and we found ourselves in the most beautiful place that can be conceived a meadow of that short grass which grows on some shores beside the sea  there were large spaces of fine and solid turf but where the little streams flowed from the delicatetinted distant mountains there were narrow valleys full of all the flowers of a southern spring  here grew narcissus and hyacinths violets and creeping thyme and crocus and the crimson rose as they blossomed on the day when the milkwhite bull carried off europa  beyond the level land beside the sea between these coasts and the faroff hills was a steep lonely rock on which were set the shining temples of the grecian faith  the blue seas that begirt the coasts were narrow and ran like rivers between many islands not less fair than the country to which we were come while other isles each with its crest of clearcut hills lay westward far away and receding into the place of the sunset  then i recognized the fortunate islands spoken of by pindar and the paradise of the greeks  round these the ocean breezes blow and golden flowers are glowing some from the land on trees of splendour and some the water feedeth with wreaths whereof they entwine their hands 124  and as pindar says again for them shineth below the strength of the sun while in our world it is night and the space of crimsonflowered meadows before their city is full of the shade of frankincensetrees and of fruits of gold  and some in horses and in bodily feats and some in dice and some in harpplaying have delight and among them thriveth all fair flowering bliss and fragrance ever streameth through the lovely land as they mingle incense of every kind upon the altars of the gods  in this beautiful country i took great delight now watching the young men leaping and running and they were marvellously good over a short distance of ground now sitting in a chariot whereto were harnessed steeds swifter than the wind like those that homer says the gods gave glorious gifts to peleus  and the people young and old received me kindly welcoming me in their greek speech which was like the sound of music  and because i had ever been a lover of them and of their tongue my ears were opened to understand them though they spoke not greek as we read it  now when i had beheld many of the marvels of the fortunate islands and had sat at meat with those kind hosts though i only made semblance to eat of what they placed before me and had seen the face of rhadamanthus of the golden hair who is the lord of that country my friends told me that there was come among them one of my own nation who seemed most sad and sorrowful and they could make him no mirth  then they carried me to a house in a grove and all around it a fair garden and a well in the midst  now stooping over the well that he might have sight of his own face was a most wretched man  he was pale and very meagre he had black rings under his eyes and his hair was long limp and greasy falling over his shoulders  he was clad somewhat after the manner of the old greeks but his raiment was wofully illmade and illgirt upon him nor did he ever seem at his ease  as soon as i beheld his sallow face i knew him for one i had seen and mocked at in the world of the living  he was a certain figgins and he had been honestly apprenticed to a photographer but being a weak and vain young fellow he had picked up modern notions about art the nude plasticity and the like in the photographers workroom whereby he became a weariness to the photographer and to them that sat unto him  being dismissed from his honest employment this chitterling must needs become a model to some painters that were near as ignorant as himself  they talked to him about the greeks about the antique about paganism about the renaissance till they made him as much the child of folly as themselves  and they painted him as antinous as eros as sleep and i know not what but whatever name they called him he was always the same lankhaired dowdy effeminate pastyfaced photographers young man  then he must needs take to writing poems all about greece and the free ways of the old greeks and lais and phryne and therein he made aeolus rhyme to control us  for of greek this fellow knew not a word and any greek that met him had called him a greek text and bidden him begone to the crows for a cursed fellow and one that made false quantities in every greek name he uttered  but his little poems were much liked by young men of his own sort and by some of the young women  now death had come to figgins and here he was in the fortunate islands the very paradise of those greeks about whom he had always been prating while he was alive  and yet he was not happy  a little lyre lay beside him in the grass and now and again he twanged on it dolorously and he tried to weave himself garlands from the flowers that grew around him but he knew not the art and ever and anon he felt for his buttonhole wherein to stick a lily or the like  but he had no buttonhole  then he would look at himself in the well and yawn and wish himself back in his friends studios in london  i almost pitied the wretch and going up to him i asked him how he did  he said he had never been more wretched  why i asked was your mouth not always full of the greek spirit and did you not mock the christians and their religion  and as to their heaven did you not say that it was a tedious place full of pious old ladies and philistines  and are you not got to the paradise of the greeks  what then ails you with your lot  sir said he to be plain with you i do not understand a word these fellows about me say and i feel as i did the first time i went to paris before i knew enough french to read the masters poems 128  again every one here is mirthful and gay and there is no man with a divinely passionate potentiality of pain  when i first came here they were always asking me to run with them or jump against them and one fellow insisted i should box with him and hurt me very much  my potentiality of pain is considerable  or they would have me drive with them in these dangerous open chariotsme that never rode in a hansom cab without feeling nervous  and after dinner they sing songs of which i do not catch the meaning of one syllable and the music is like nothing i ever heard in my life  and they are all abominably active and healthy  and such of their poets as i admiredin bohns cribs of coursethe poets of the anthology are not here at all and the poets who are here are tremendous proud toffs here figgins relapsed into his natural style as it was before he became a neopagan poet and wont say a word to a cove  and im sick of the greeks and the fortunate islands are a blooming fraud and oh for paradise give me pentonville  with these words perhaps the only unaffected expression of genuine sentiment poor figgins had ever uttered he relapsed into a gloomy silence  i advised him to cultivate the society of the authors whose selected works are in the greek delectus and to try to make friends with xenophon whose greek is about as easy as that of any ancient  but i fear that figgins like the rev peter mcsnadden is really suffering a kind of punishment in the disguise of a reward and all through having accidentally found his way into what he foolishly thought would be the right paradise for him  now i might have stayed long in the fortunate islands yet beautiful as they were i ever felt like odysseus in the island of fair circe  the country was lovely and the land desirable but the christian souls were not there without whom heaven itself were no paradise to me  and it chanced that as we sat at the feast a maiden came to me with a pomegranate on a plate of silver and said sir thou hast now been here for the course of a whole moon yet hast neither eaten nor drunk of what is set before thee  now it is commanded that thou must taste if it were but a seed of this pomegranate or depart from among us  then making such excuses as i might i was constrained to refuse to eat for no soul can leave a paradise wherein it has tasted food  and as i spoke the walls of the fair hall wherein we sat which were painted with the effigies of them that fell at thermopylae and in arcadion wavered and grew dim and darkness came upon me  the first of my senses which returned to me was that of smell and i seemed almost drowned in the spicy perfumes of araby  then my eyes became aware of a green soft fluttering as of the leaves of a great forest but quickly i perceived that the fluttering was caused by the green scarfs of a countless multitude of women  they were fine women in the popular sense of the term and were of the school of beauty admired by the faithful of islam and known to mr bailey in martin chuzzlewit as crumby  these fond attendant nymphs carried me into gardens twain in each two gushing springs in each fruit and palms and pomegranates  there were the blessed reclining precisely as the prophet has declared on beds the linings whereof are brocade and the fruit of the two gardens within reach to cull  there also were the maids of modest glances previously indifferent to the wooing of man or ginn bright and largeeyed maids kept in their tents reclining on green cushions and beautiful carpets  about the golden couches went eternal youths with goblets and ewers and a cup of flowing wine  no headache shall they feel therefrom says the compassionate prophet nor shall their wits be dimmed  and all that land is misty and fragrant with the perfume of the softest latakia and the gardens are musical with the bubbling of countless narghiles and i must say that to the christian soul which enters that paradise the whole place has certainly a rather curious air as of a highly transcendental cremorne  there could be no doubt however that the faithful were enjoying themselves amazinglyright lucky fellows as we read in the new translation of the koran  yet even here all was not peace and pleasantness for i heard my name called by a small voice in a tone of patient subdued querulousness  looking hastily round i with some difficulty recognized in a green turban and silk gown to match my old college tutor and professor of arabic  poor old jones had been the best and the most shy of university men  as there was never any undergraduate in his time it is different now who wished to learn arabic his place had been a sinecure and he had chiefly devoted his leisure to drawing pupils who were too late for college chapel  the sight of a lady of his acquaintance in the streets had at all times been alarming enough to drive him into a shop or up a lane and he had not survived the creation of the first batch of married fellows  how he had got into this thoroughly wrong paradise was a mystery which he made no attempt to explain  a nice place this eh he said to me  nice gardens remind me of magdalene a good deal  it seems however to be decidedly rather gay just now dont you think so  commemoration week perhaps  a great many young ladies up certainly a good deal of cup drunk in the gardens too  i always did prefer to go down in commemoration week myself never was a dancing man  there is a great deal of dancing here but the young ladies dance alone rather like what is called the ballet i believe at the opera  i must say the young persons are a little forward a little embarrassing it is to be alone here especially as i have forgotten a good deal of my arabic  dont you think my dear fellow you and i could manage to give them the slip  run away from them eh  he uttered a timid little chuckle and at that moment an innumerable host of houris began a ballet daction illustrative of a series of events in the career of the prophet  it was obvious that my poor uncomplaining old friend was really very miserable  the thornless loto trees were all thorny to him and the talh trees with piles of fruit the outspread shade and water outpoured could not comfort him in his really very natural shyness  a happy thought occurred to me  in early and credulous youth i had studied the works of cornelius agrippa and petrus de abano  their lessons which had not hitherto been of much practical service recurred to my mind  stooping down i drew a circle round myself and my old friend in the fragrant white blossoms which were strewn so thick that they quite hid the grass  this circle i fortified by the usual signs employed as benvenuto cellini tells us in the conjuration of evil spirits  i then proceeded to utter one of the common forms of exorcism instantly the myriad houris assumed the forms of irritated demons the smoke from the uncounted narghiles burned thick and black the cries of the frustrated ginns who were no better than they should be rang wildly in our ears the palmtrees shook beneath a mighty wind the distant summits of the minarets rocked and wavered and with a tremendous crash the paradise of the faithful disappeared        as i rang the bell and requested the clubwaiter to carry away the smoking fragments of the moderatorlamp which i had accidentally knocked over in awaking from my nightmare i reflected on the vanity of men and the unsubstantial character of the future homes that their fancy has fashioned  the ideal heavens of modern poets and novelists and of ancient priests come no nearer than the drugged dreams of the angekok and the biraark of greenland and queensland to that rest and peace whereof it has not entered into the mind of man to conceive  to the wrong man each of our pictured heavens would be a hell and even to the appropriate devotee each would become a tedious purgatory     a cheap nigger   i   have you seen the clayville dime  moore chucked me a very shabby little sheet of printed matter  it fluttered feebly in the warm air and finally dropped on my recumbent frame  i was lolling in a hammock in the shade of the verandah  i did not feel much inclined for study but i picked up the clayville dime and lazily glanced at that periodical while moore relapsed into the pages of ixtlilxochitl  he was a literary character for a planter had been educated at oxford where i made his acquaintance and had inherited from his father with a large collection of indian and mexican curiosities a taste for the ancient history of the new world  sometimes i glanced at the newspaper sometimes i looked out at the pleasant southern garden where the fountain flashed and fell among weeping willows and laurels orangetrees and myrtles  hullo i cried suddenly disturbing moores aztec researches here is a queer affair in the usually quiet town of clayville  listen to this and i read aloud the following par as i believe paragraphs are styled in newspaper offices     instinct and accidentas colonel randolph was driving through our    town yesterday and was passing captain joness sampleroom where the    colonel lately shot moses widlake in the street the horses took alarm    and started violently downhill  the colonel kept his seat till    rounding the corner by the clayville bank when his wheels came into    collision with that edifice and our gallant townsman was violently    shot out  he is now lying in a very precarious condition  this may    relieve tom widlake of the duty of shooting the colonel in revenge for    his father  it is commonly believed that colonel randolphs horses    were maddened by the smell of the blood which has dried up where old    widlake was shot  much sympathy is felt for the colonel  neither of    the horses was injured  clayville appears to be a lively kind of place i said  do you often have shootings down here  we do said moore rather gravely it is one of our institutions with which i could dispense  and do you carry iron as the greeks used to say or go heeled as your citizens express it  no i dont neither pistol nor knife  if any one shoots me he shoots an unarmed man  the local bullies know it and they have some scruple about shooting in that case  besides they know i am an awkward customer at close quarters  moore relapsed into his mexican historian and i into the newspaper  here is a chance of seeing one of your institutions at last i said  i had found an advertisement concerning a lot of negroes to be sold that very day by public auction in clayville  all this of course was before the war  well i suppose you ought to see it said moore rather reluctantly  he was gradually emancipating his own servants as i knew and was even suspected of being a director of the underground railroad to canada  peter he cried will you be good enough to saddle three horses and bring them round  peter a darkey boy who had been hanging about in the garden grinned and went off  he was a queer fellow peter a plantation humourist well taught in all the then unpublished lore of uncle remus  peter had a way of his own too with animals and often aided moore in collecting objects of natural history  did you get me those hornets peter said moore when the black returned with the horses  got em safe massa in a little box replied peter who then mounted and followed at a respectful distance as our squire  without many more words we rode into the forest which lay between clayville and moores plantation  through the pine barrens ran the road and on each side of the way was luxuriance of flowering creepers  the sweet faint scent of the white jessamine and the homely fragrance of honeysuckle filled the air and the wild white roses were in perfect blossom  here and there an aloe reminded me that we were not at home and dwarf palms and bayonet palmettoes with the small pointed leaf of the live oak combined to make the scenery look foreign and unfamiliar there was a soft haze in the air and the suns beams only painted as it were the capitals of the tall pillarlike pines while the road was canopied and shaded by the skeins of grey moss that hung thickly on all the boughs  the trees grew thinner as the road approached the town  dusty were the ways and sultry the air when we rode into clayville and were making for the noisy middle marketplace  clayville was but a small border town though it could then boast the presence of a squadron of cavalry sent there to watch the border ruffians  the square was neither large nor crowded but the spectacle was strange and interesting to me  men who had horses or carts to dispose of were driving or riding about noisily proclaiming the excellence of their wares  but buyers were more concerned like myself with the slavemarket  in the open air in the middle of the place a long table was set  the crowd gathered round this and presented types of various sorts of citizens  the common mean white was spitting and staringa man fallen so low that he had no nigger to wallop and was thus even more abject because he had no natural place and functions in local society than the slaves themselves the local drunkard was uttering sagacities to which no mortal attended two or three speculators were bidding on commission and there were a few planters some of them mounted and a mixed multitude of tradesmen loafers barkeepers newspaper reporters and idlers in general  at either end of the long table sat an auctioneer who behaved with the traditional facetiousness of the profession  as the lots came on for sale they mounted the platform generally in family parties  a party would fetch from one thousand to fifteen hundred dollars according to its numbers and condition  the spectacle was painful and monstrous most of the lots bore the examination of their points with a kind of placid dignity and only showed some little interest when the biddings grew keen and flattered their pride  the sale was almost over and we were just about to leave when a howl of derision from the mob made us look round  what i saw was the apparition of an extremely aged and debilitated black man standing on the table  what moore saw to interest him i could not guess but he grew pale and uttered an oath of surprise under his breath though he rarely swore  then he turned his horses head again towards the auctioneer that merry tradesman was extolling the merits of nearly his last lot  a very remarkable specimen gentlemen  admirers of the antique cannot dispense with this curious niggervery old and quite imperfect  like so many of the treasures of greek art which have reached us he has had the misfortune to lose his nose and several of his fingers  how much offered for this exceptional lotunmarried and without encumbrances of any kind he is dumb too and may be trusted with any secret  take him off howled some one in the crowd  order his funeral  chuck him into the next lot  what gentlemen no bids for this very eligible nigger  with a few more rags he would make a most adequate scarecrow  while this disgusting banter was going on i observed a planter ride up to one of the brokers and whisper for some time in his ear  the planter was a bad but unmistakable likeness of my friend moore worked over so to speak with a loaded brush and heavily glazed with old bourbon whisky after giving his orders to the agent he retired to the outskirts of the crowd and began flicking his long dusty boots with a serviceable cowhide whip  well gentlemen we must really adopt the friendly suggestion of judge lee and chuck this nigger into the next lot  so the auctioneer was saying when the broker to whom i have referred cried out ten dollars  this is more like business cried the auctioneer  ten dollars offered  what amateur says more than ten dollars for this lot  his extreme age and historical reminiscences alone if he could communicate them would make him invaluable to the student  to my intense amazement moore shouted from horseback twenty dollars  what you want a cheap nigger to get your hand in do you you blank blanked abolitionist cried a man who stood near  he was a big dirty looking bully at least half drunk and attending not unnecessarily to his toilet with the point of a long heavy knife  before the words were out of his mouth moore had leaped from his horse and delivered such a righthanded blow as that wherewith the wandering beggarman smote irus of old in the courtyard of odysseus laertes son on his neck beneath the ear he smote him and crushed in the bones and the red blood gushed up through his mouth and he gnashed his teeth together as he kicked the ground  moore stooped picked up the bowie knife and sent it glittering high through the air  take him away he said and two rough fellows laughing carried the bully to the edge of the fountain that played in the corner of the square  he was still lying crumpled up there when we rode out of clayville  the bidding of course had stopped owing to the unaffected interest which the public took in this more dramatic interlude  the broker it is true had bid twentyfive dollars and was wrangling with the auctioneer  you have my bid mr brinton sir and there is no other offer  knock down the lot to me  you wait your time mr isaacs said the auctioneer  no man can do two things at once and do them well  when squire moore has settled with dick bligh he will desert the paths of military adventure for the calmer and more lucrative track of commercial enterprise  the auctioneers command of long words was considerable and was obviously of use to him in his daily avocations  when he had rounded his period moore was in the saddle again and nodded silently to the auctioneer  squire moore bids thirty dollars  thirty dollars for this once despised but now appreciated fellowcreature rattled on the auctioneer  the agent nodded again  forty dollars bid said the auctioneer  fifty cried moore  the broker nodded  sixty  the agent nodded again  the bidding ran rapidly up to three hundred and fifty dollars  the crowd were growing excited and had been joined by every child in the town by every draggled and sunburnt woman and the drinkingbar had disgorged every loafer who felt sober enough to stay the distance to the centre of the square  my own first feelings of curiosity had subsided  i knew how strong and burning was moores hatred of oppression and felt convinced that he merely wished at any sacrifice of money to secure for this old negro some peaceful days and a quiet deathbed  the crowd doubtless took the same obvious view of the case as i did and was now eagerly urging on the two competitors  never say die isaacs  stick to it squire the niggers well worth the dollars  so they howled and now the biddings were mounting towards one thousand dollars when the sulky planter rode up to the neighbourhood of the tablemuch to the inconvenience of the galleryand whispered to his agent  the conference lasted some minutes and at the end of it the agent capped moores last offer one thousand dollars with a bid of one thousand two hundred  fifteen hundred said moore amidst applause  look here mr knockemdown cried mr isaacs its hot and thirsty work sitting nodding here i likes my ease on a warm day so just you reckon that i see the squire and go a hundred dollars more as long as i hold up my pencil  he stuck a long gnawed pencil erect between his finger and thumb and stared impertinently at moore  the squire nodded and the bidding went on in this silent fashion till the bids had actually run up to three thousand four hundred dollars  all this while the poor negro whose limbs no longer supported him crouched in a heap on the table turning his haggard eye alternately on moore and on the erect and motionless pencil of the broker  the crowd had become silent with excitement unable to stand the heat and agitation moores unfriendly brother had crossed the square in search of a short drink  moore nodded once more  three thousand six hundred dollars bid cried the auctioneer and looked at isaacs  with a wild howl isaacs dashed his pencil in the air tossed up his hands and thrust them deep down between his coat collar and his body uttering all the while yells of pain  dont you bid mr isaacs asked the auctioneer without receiving any answer except semitic appeals to holy abraham blended with aryan profanity  come said moore very severely his pencil is down and he has withdrawn his bid  there is no other bidder knock the lot down to me  no more offers said the auctioneer slowly looking all round the square  there were certainly no offers from mr isaacs who now was bounding like the gadstung io to the furthest end of the place  this fine bucknegro warranted absolutely unsound of wind and limb going going a shameful sacrifice for a poor three thousand six hundred dollars  going goinggone  the hammer fell with a sharp decisive sound  a fearful volley of oaths rattled after the noise like thunder rolling away in the distance  moores brother had returned from achieving a short drink just in time to see his coveted lot knocked down to his rival  we left the spot with the negro in the care of peter as quickly as might be  i wonder said moore as we reached the inn and ordered a trap to carry our valuable bargain home ini wonder what on earth made isaacs run off like a maniac  massa whispered peter yesterday i jes caught yer brer hornet aloafin around in the wood  come wi me says i and bottled him in this yer pasteboard box showing one which had held turkish tobacco when i saw that hebrew jew wouldnt stir his pencil i jes crept up softly and dropped brer hornet down his neck  then he jes rose and went  specs he and brer hornet had business of their own  peter said moore you are a good boy but you will come to a bad end    ii   as we rode slowly homeward behind the trap which conveyed the dearbought slave moore was extremely moody and disinclined for conversation  is your purchase not rather an expensive one i ventured to ask to which moore replied shortly  no think he is perhaps the cheapest nigger that was ever bought  to put any more questions would have been impertinent and i possessed my curiosity in silence till we reached the plantation  here moores conduct became decidedly eccentric  he had the black man conveyed at once into a cool dark strong room with a heavy iron door where the new acquisition was locked up in company with a sufficient meal  moore and i dined hastily and then he summoned all his negroes together into the court of the house  look here boys he cried all these treesand he pointed to several clumps must come down immediately and all the shrubs on the lawn and in the garden  fall to at once those of you that have axes and let the rest take hoes and knives and make a clean sweep of the shrubs  the idea of wholesale destruction seemed not disagreeable to the slaves who went at their work with eagerness though it made my heart ache to see the fine old oaks beginning to fall and to watch the green garden becoming a desert  moore first busied himself with directing the women who under his orders piled up mattresses and bags of cotton against the parapets of the verandahs  the house stood on the summit of a gradually sloping height and before the moon began to set for we worked without intermission through the evening and far into the night there was nothing but a bare slope of grass all round the place while smoke and flame went up from the piles of fallen timber  the plantation in fact was ready to stand a short siege  moore now produced a number of rifles which he put with ammunition into the hands of some of the more stalwart negroes  these he sent to their cabins which lay at a distance of about a furlong and a half on various sides of the house  the men had orders to fire on any advancing enemy and then to fall back at once on the main building which was now barricaded and fortified  one lad was told to lurk in a thicket below the slope of the hill and invisible from the house  if wild bills men come on and you give them the slip cry thrice like the bob white said moore if they take you cry once  if you get off run straight to clayville and give this note to the officer commanding the cavalry  the hour was now about one in the morning by three the dawn would begin in spite of his fatigues moore had no idea of snatching an hours rest he called up peter who had been sleeping coiled up like a black cat in the smokingroom and bade him take a bath and hot water into the room where gumbo the newly purchased black had all this time been left to his own reflections  soap him and lather him well peter said moore wash him white if you can and let me know when hes fit to come near  peter withdrew with his stereotyped grin to make his preparations  presently through the open door of the smokingroom we heard the sounds of energetic splashings mingled with the inarticulate groans of the miserable gumbo  moore could not sit still but kept pacing the room smoking fiercely  presently peter came to the door  niggers clean now massa  bring me a razor then said moore and leave me alone with him        when moore had retired with the razor into the chamber where his purchase lay i had time to reflect on the singularity of the situation in every room loaded rifles were ready all the windows were cunningly barricaded and had sufficient loopholes  the peaceful planters house had become a castle a dreadful quiet had succeeded to the hubbub of preparation and my host yesterday so pleasant was now locked up alone with a dumb negro and a razor  i had long ago given up the hypothesis that gumbo had been purchased out of pure philanthropy  the disappointment of baffled cruelty in moores brother would not alone account for the necessity of such defensive preparations as had just been made  clearly gumbo was not a mere fancy article but a negro of real value whose person it was desirable to obtain possession of at any risk or cost  the ghastly idea occurred to me suggested i fancy by moores demand for a razor that gumbo at some period of his career must have swallowed a priceless diamond  this gem must still be concealed about his person and moore must have determined by foul means as no fair means were available to become its owner  when this fancy struck me i began to feel that it was my duty to interfere  i could not sit by within call had poor gumbo been capable of calling and allow my friend to commit such a deed of cruelty  as i thus parleyed with myself the heavy iron door of the storeroom opened and moore came out with the razor bloodless thank heaven in his hand  anxiety had given place to a more joyous excitement  well i said interrogatively  well alls well  that man has as i felt sure the secret of the pyramid  i now became quite certain that moore in spite of all his apparent method had gone out of his mind  it seemed best to humour him especially as so many loaded rifles were lying about     he has seen the mystry hid    under egypts pyramid  i quoted but my dear fellow as the negro is dumb i dont see how you are to get the secret out of him  i did not say he knew it answered moore crossly i said he had it  as to egypt i dont know what you are talking about  at this moment we heard the crack of rifles and in the instant of silence which followed came the note of the bob white  once it shrilled and we listened eagerly then the notes came twice rapidly and a sound of voices rose up from the negro outposts who had been driven in and were making fast the one door of the house that had been left open  from the negroes we learned that our assailants bill hicocks band of border ruffians specially engaged for this occasion had picketed their horses behind the dip of the hill and were advancing on foot  moore hurried to the roof to reconnoitre  the dawn was stealing on and the smoke from the still smouldering trees which we had felled and burned rose through the twilight air  moore you hound cried a voice through the smoke of the furthest pile we have come for your new nigger  will you give him up or will you fight  moores only reply was a bullet fired in the direction whence the voice was heard  his shot was answered by a perfect volley from men who could just be discerned creeping through the grass about four hundred yards out  the bullets rattled harmlessly against wooden walls and iron shutters or came with a thud against the mattress fortifications of the verandah  the firing was all directed against the front of the house  i see their game said moore  the front attack is only a feint  when they think we are all busy here another detachment will try to rush the place from the back and to set fire to the building  well give them their kail through the reek  moores dispositions were quickly made  he left me with some ten of the blacks to keep up as heavy a fire as possible from the roof against the advancing skirmishers  he posted himself with six fellows on whom he could depend in a room of one of the wings which commanded the back entrance  as many men with plenty of readyloaded rifles were told off to a room in the opposite wing  both parties were thus in a position to rake the entrance with a cross fire  moore gave orders that not a trigger should be pulled till the still invisible assailants had arrived on his side between the two projecting wings  then fire into them and let every one choose his man  on the roof our business was simple enough  we lay behind bags of cotton firing as rapidly and making as much show of force as possible while women kept loading for us  our position was extremely strong as we were quite invisible to men crouching or running hurriedly far below our practice was not particularly good still three or four of the skirmishers had ceased to advance and this naturally discouraged the others who were aware of course that their movement was only a feint the siege had now lasted about half an hour and i had begun to fancy that moores theory of the attack was a mistake and that he had credited the enemy with more generalship than they possessed when a perfect storm of fire broke out beneath us from the rooms where moore and his company were posted  dangerous as it was to cease for a moment from watching the enemy i stole across the roof and looking down between two of the cotton bags which filled the open spaces of the balustrades i saw the narrow ground between the two wings simply strewn with dead or wounded men  the cross fire still poured from the windows though here and there a marksman tried to pick off the fugitives  rapidly did i cross the roof to my post  to my horror the skirmishers had advanced as if at the signal of the firing and were now running up at full speed and close to the walls of the house  at that moment the door opened and moore heading a number of negroes picked off the leading ruffian and rushed out into the open  the other assailants fired hurriedly and without aim thendaunted by the attack so suddenly carried into their midst and by the appearance of one or two of their own beaten comradesthe enemy turned and fairly bolted  we did not pursue  far away down the road we heard the clatter of hoofs and thin and clear came the thricerepeated cry of the bob white  dicks coming back with the soldiers said moore and now i think we may look after the wounded        i did not see much of moore that day  the fact is that i slept a good deal and moore was mysteriously engaged with gumbo  night came and very much needed quiet and sleep came with it  then we passed an indolent day and i presumed that adventures were over and that on the subject of the secret of the pyramid moore had recovered his sanity  i was just taking my bedroom candle when moore said dont go to bed yet you will come with me wont you and see out the adventure of the cheap nigger  you dont mean to say the story is to be continued i asked  continued  why the fun is only beginning moore answered  the night is cloudy and will just suit us  come down to the branch  the branch as moore called it was a strong stream that separated as i knew his lands from his brothers  we walked down slowly and reached the broad boat which was dragged over by a chain when any one wanted to cross  at the scow as the ferryboat was called peter joined us he ferried us deftly over the deep and rapid water and then led on as rapidly as if it had been daylight along a path through the pines  how often i came here when i was a boy said moore but now i might lose myself in the wood for this is my brothers land and i have forgotten the way  as i knew that mr bob moore was confined to his room by an accident through which an ounce of lead had been lodged in a portion of his frame i had no fear of being arrested for trespass  presently the negro stopped in front of a cliff  here is the sachems cave said moore  youll help us to explore the cave wont you  i did not think the occasion an opportune one for exploring caves but to have withdrawn would have demanded a moral courage as people commonly say when they mean cowardice which i did not possess  we stepped within a narrow crevice of the great cliff  moore lit a lantern and went in advance the negro followed with a flaring torch  suddenly an idea occurred to me which i felt bound to communicate to moore  my dear fellow i said in a whisper is this quite sportsmanlike  you know you are after some treasure real or imaginary and i put it to you as a candid friend is not this just a little bit like poaching  your brothers land you know  what i am looking for is in my own land said moore  the river is the march  come on  we went on now advancing among fairy halls glistering with stalactites or paved with silver sand and finally pushing our way through a concealed crevice down dank and narrow passages in the rock  the darkness increased the pavement plashed beneath our feet and the drip drip of water was incessant  we are under the riverbed said moore in a kind of natural thames tunnel  we made what speed we might through this combination of the valley of the shadow with the slough of despond and soon were on firmer ground again beneath moores own territory  probably no other white men had ever crawled through the hidden passage and gained the further penetralia of the cave which now again began to narrow  finally we reached four tall pillars of about ten feet in height closely surrounded by the walls of rock  as we approached these pillars that were dimly discerned by the torchlight our feet made a faint metallic jingling sound among heaps of ashes which strewed the floor  moore and i went up to the pillars and tried them with our knives  they were of wood all soaked and green with the eternal damp  peter said moore go in with the lantern and try if you can find anything there  peter had none of the superstitions of his race or he would never have been our companion  all right massa me look for brer spook  so saying peter walked into a kind of roofed overroom open only at the front and examined the floor with his lantern stamping occasionally to detect any hollowness in the ground  nothing here massa but this dead fellows legbone and little bits of broken jugs and the dauntless peter came out with his ghastly trophy  moore seemed not to lose heart  perhaps he said there is something on the roof  peter give me a back  peter stooped down beside one of the wooden pillars and firmly grasped his own legs above the knee  moore climbed on the improvised ladder and was just able to seize the edge of the roof as it seemed to be with his hands  now steady peter he exclaimed and with a spring he drew himself up till his head was above the level of the roof  then he uttered a cry and leaping from peters back retreated to the level where we stood in some confusion  good god he said what a sight  what on earth is the matter i asked  look for yourself if you choose said moore who was somewhat shaken and at the same time irritated and ashamed  grasping the lantern i managed to get on to peters shoulders and by a considerable gymnastic effort to raise my head to the level of the ledge and at the same time to cast the light up and within  the spectacle was sufficiently awful  i was looking along a platform on which ten skeletons were disposed at full length with the skulls still covered with long hair and the fleshless limbs glimmering white and stretching back into the darkness  on the right hand and crouching between a skeleton and the wall of the chamber what we had taken for a roof was the floor of a room raised on pillars i saw the form of a man  he was dressed in gay colours and as he sat with his legs drawn up his arms rested on his knees  on the first beholding of a dreadful thing our instinct forces us to rush against it as if to bring the horror to the test of touch  this instinct wakened in me  for a moment i felt dazed and then i continued to stare involuntarily at the watcher of the dead  he had not stirred my eyes became accustomed to the dim and flickering light which the lantern cast in that dark place  hold on peter i cried and leaped down to the floor of the cave  its all right moore i said  dont you remember the picture in old lafitaus moeurs des sauvages americains  we are in a buryingplace of the cherouines and the seated man is only the kywash which is an image of woode keeping the deade  ass that i am cried moore  i knew the cave led us from the sachems cave to the sachems mound and i forgot for a moment how the fellows disposed of their dead  we must search the platform  peter make a ladder again  moore mounted nimbly enough this time  i followed him  the kywash had no more terrors for us and we penetrated beyond the fleshless dead into the further extremity of the sepulchre  here we lifted and removed vast piles of deerskin bags and of mats filled as they were with the dreadful dust that once was man  as we reached the bottom of the first pile something glittered yellow and bright beneath the lantern  moore stooped and tried to lift what looked like an enormous plate  he was unable to raise the object still weighed down as it was with the ghastly remnants of the dead  with feverish haste we cleared away the debris and at last lifted and brought to light a huge and massive disk of gold divided into rays which spread from the centre each division being adorned with strange figures in relieffigures of animals plants and what looked like rude hieroglyphs  this was only the firstfruits of the treasure  a silver disk still larger and decorated in the same manner was next uncovered and last in a hollow dug in the flooring of the sepulchre we came on a great number of objects in gold and silver which somewhat reminded us of indian idols  these were thickly crusted with precious stones and were accompanied by many of the sacred emeralds and opals of old american religion  there were also some extraordinary manuscripts if the term may be applied to picture writing on prepared deerskins that were now decaying  we paid little attention to cloaks of the famous featherwork now a lost art of which one or two examples are found in european museums  the gold and silver and precious stones as may be imagined overcame for the moment any ethnological curiosity        dawn was growing into day before we reached the mouth of the cave again and after a series of journeys brought all our spoil to the light of the upper air  it was quickly enough bestowed in bags and baskets  then aided by three of moores stoutest hands whom we found waiting for us in the pine wood we carried the whole treasure back and lodged it in the strong room which had been the retreat of gumbo    iii   the conclusion of my story shall be very short  what was the connection between gumbo and the spoils of the sachems mound and how did the treasures of the aztec temple of the sun come to be concealed in the burial place of the red man  all this moore explained to me the day after we secured the treasures  my father said moore was as you know a great antiquarian and a great collector of mexican and native relics  he had given almost as much time as brasseur de bourbourg to mexican hieroglyphics and naturally had made nothing out of them  his chief desire was to discover the secret of the pyramidnot the pyramids of egypt as you fancied but the pyramid of the sun tonatiuh at teohuacan  to the problem connected with this mysterious structure infinitely older than the empire of montezuma which cortes destroyed he fancied he had a clue in this scroll  moore handed me a prepared sheet of birch bark like those which the red men use for their rude picture writings  it was very old but the painted characters were still brilliant and even a tyro could see that they were not indian but of the ancient mexican description  in the upper lefthand corner was painted a pyramidal structure above which the sun beamed  eight men over whose heads the moon was drawn were issuing from the pyramid the two foremost bore in their hands effigies of the sun and moon each of the others seemed to carry smaller objects with a certain religious awe  then came a singular chart which one might conjecture represented the wanderings of these men bearing the sacred things of their gods  in the lowest corner of the scroll they were being received by human beings dressed unlike themselves with head coverings of feathers and carrying bows in their hands  this scroll moore went on my father bought from one of the last of the red men who lingered on here a prey to debt and whisky  my father always associated the drawings with the treasures of teohuacan which according to him must have been withdrawn from the pyramid and conveyed secretly to the north the direction from which the old toltec pyramid builders originally came  in the north they would find no civilized people like themselves he said but only the indians  probably however the indians would receive with respect the bearers of mysterious images and rites and my father concluded that the sacred treasures of the sun might still be concealed among some wandering tribe of red men he had come to this conclusion for some time when i and my brother returned from school hastily summoned back to find him extremely ill he had suffered from a paralytic stroke and he scarcely recognized us but we made out partly from his broken and wandering words partly from old tom peters father now dead that my fathers illness had followed on a violent fit of passion  he had picked up it seems from some indians a scroll which he considered of the utmost value and which he placed in a shelf of the library  now old gumbo was a houseservant at that time and dumb as he was and stupid as he was my father had treated him with peculiar kindness  unluckily gumbo yielded to the favourite illusion of all servants white and black male and female that anything they find in the library may be used to light a fire with one chilly day gumbo lighted the fire with the newly purchased indian birch scroll  my father when he heard of this performance lost all selfcommand  in his ordinary temper the most humane of men he simply raged at gumbo  he would teach him he said to destroy his papers  and it appeared from what we could piece together for old tom was very reticent and my father very incoherent that he actually branded or tattooed a copy of what gumbo had burnt on the niggers body  but i interrupted your father knew all the scroll had to tell him else he could not have copied it on gumbo  so why was he in such a rage  you said moore with some indignation are not a collector and you cant understand a collectors feelings  my father knew the contents of the scroll but what of that  the scroll was the first edition the real original and gumbo had destroyed it  job would have lost his temper if job had been a collector  let me go on  my brother and i both conjectured that the scroll had some connection with the famous riches of the sun and the secret of the pyramid of teohuacan  probably we thought it had contained a chart now transferred to gumbos frame of the hidingplace of the treasure  however in the confusion caused by my fathers illness death and burial gumbo escaped and being an unusually stupid nigger he escaped due southwest  here he seems to have fallen into the hands of some slaveholding indians who used him even worse than any white owners would have done and left him the mere fragment you saw  he filtered back here through the exchange of commerce the higgling of the market and as soon as i recognized him at the sale i made up my mind to purchase him  so did my brother but thanks to peter and his hornets i became gumbos owner  on examining him after he was well washed on the night of the attack i found this chart as you may call it branded on gumbos back  here moore made a rapid tracing on a sheet of paper  i concluded that the letters s m introduced by my father of course as the indian scroll must have been before letters referred to the sachems mound which is in my land that the sun above referred to the treasures of the sun that s c stood for the sachems cave and that the cave led under the river within the mound  we might have opened the mound by digging on our own land but it would have been a long job and must have attracted curiosity and brought us into trouble  so you see the chart gumbo destroyed was imprinted by my father on his black back and though he knew nothing of the secret he distinctly had it  yes said i but why did you ask for a razor when you were left alone with gumbo  why said moore i knew gumbo was marked somewhere and somehow but the place and manner i didnt know  and my father might have remembered the dodge of histiaeus in herodotus he might have shaved gumbos head tattooed the chart on that and then allowed the natural covering to hide the secret on the place where the wool ought to grow     the romance of the first radical   a prehistoric apologue      titius  le premier qui supprime un abus comme on dit est toujours    victime du service quil rend     un homme du peuple  cest de sa faute  pourquoi se mele til de ce    qui ne le regarde pasle pretre de nemi  the devil according to dr johnson and other authorities was the first whig  history tells us less about the first radicalthe first man who rebelled against the despotism of unintelligible customs who asserted the rights of the individual against the claims of the tribal conscience and who was eager to see society organized offhand on what he thought a rational method  in the absence of history we must fall back on that branch of hypothetics which is known as prehistoric science  we must reconstruct the romance of the first radical from the hints supplied by geology and by the study of radicals at large and of contemporary savages among whom no radical reformer has yet appeared  in the following little apologue no trait of manners is invented  the characters of our romance lived shortly after the close of the last glacial epoch in europe when the ice had partly withdrawn from the face of the world and when land and sea had almost assumed their modern proportions  at this period europe was inhabited by scattered bands of human creatures who roamed about its surface much as the black fellows used to roam over the australian continent  the various groups derived their names from various animals and other natural objects such as the sun the cabbage serpents sardines crabs leopards bears and hyaenas it is important for our purpose to remember that all the children took their family name from the mothers side  if she were of the hyaena clan the children were hyaenas  if the mother were tattooed with the badge of the serpent the children were serpents and so on  no two persons of the same family name and crest might marry on pain of death the man of the bear family who dwelt by the mediterranean might not ally himself with a woman of the bear clan whose home was on the shores of the baltic and who was in no way related to him by consanguinity  these details are dry but absolutely necessary to the comprehension of the first radicals stormy and melancholy career  we must also remember that among the tribes there was no fixed or monarchical government  the little democratic groups were much influenced by the medicinemen or wizards who combined the functions of the modern clergy and of the medical profession  the old men too had some power the braves or warriors constituted a turbulent oligarchy the noisy outcries of the old women corresponded to the utterances of an intelligent daily press but the real ruler was a body of strange and despotic customs the nature of which will become apparent as we follow the fortunes of the first radical    the youth of whywhy   whywhy as our hero was commonly called in the tribe was born long before romulus built his wall in a cave which may still be observed in the neighbourhood of mentone  on the warm shores of the mediterranean protected from winds by a wall of rock the group of which whywhy was the offspring had attained conditions of comparative comfort  the remains of their dinners many feet deep still constitute the flooring of the cave and the tourist as he pokes the soil with the point of his umbrella turns up bits of bone shreds of chipped flint and other interesting relics  in the big cave lived several little families all named by the names of their mothers  these ladies had been knocked on the head and dragged home according to the marriage customs of the period from places as distant as the modern marseilles and genoa  why why with his little brothers and sisters were named serpents were taught to believe that the serpent was the first ancestor of their race and that they must never injure any creeping thing  when they were still very young the figure of the serpent was tattooed over their legs and breasts so that every member of primitive society who met them had the advantage of knowing their crest and highly respectable family name  the birth of whywhy was a season of discomfort and privation  the hill tribe which lived on the summit of the hill now known as the tete du chien had long been aware that an addition to the population of the cave was expected  they had therefore prepared according to the invariable etiquette of these early times to come down on the cave people maltreat the ladies steal all the property they could lay hands on and break whatever proved too heavy to carry  good manners of course forbade the cave people to resist this visit but etiquette permitted and in new caledonia still permits the group to bury and hide its portable possessions  canoes had been brought into the little creek beneath the cave to convey the women and children into a safe retreat and the men were just beginning to hide the spears bone daggers flint fishhooks mats shell razors nets and so forth when whywhy gave an early proof of his precocity by entering the world some time before his arrival was expected  instantly all was confusion  the infant his mother and the other non combatants of the tribe were bundled into canoes and paddled through a tempestuous sea to the site of the modern bordighiera  the men who were not with the canoes fled into the depths of the gorge saint louis which now severs france from italy  the hill tribe came down at the double and in a twinkling had made hay to borrow a modern agricultural expression of all the personal property of the cave dwellers  they tore the nets the use of which they did not understand they broke the shell razors they pouched the opulent store of flint arrowheads and bone daggers and they tortured to death the pigs which the cave people had just begun to try to domesticate  after performing these rites which were perfectly legalindeed it would have been gross rudeness to neglect themthe hill people withdrew to their windswept home on the tete du chien  philosophers who believe in the force of early impressions will be tempted to maintain that whywhys invincible hatred of established institutions may be traced to these hours of discomfort in which his life began  the very earliest years of whywhy unlike those of mr john stuart mill whom in many respects he resembled were not distinguished by proofs of extraordinary intelligence  he rather promptly however showed signs of a sceptical character  like other sharp children whywhy was always asking metaphysical conundrums  who made men  who made the sun  why has the cavebear such a hoarse voice  why dont lobsters grow on treeshe would incessantly demand  in answer to these and similar questions the mother of whywhy would tell him stories out of the simple mythology of the tribe  there was quite a store of traditional replies to inquisitive children replies sanctioned by antiquity and by the authority of the medicinemen and in this lore whywhys mother was deeply versed  thus for example whywhy would ask his mother who made men  she would reply that long ago pundjel the first man made two images of human beings in clay and stuck on curly bark for hair  he then danced a corroboree round them and sang a song  they rose up and appeared as fullgrown men  to this statement hallowed by immemorial belief why why only answered by asking who made pundjel  his mother said that pund jel came out of a plot of reeds and rushes  whywhy was silent but thought in his heart that the whole theory was boshbosh to use the early reduplicative language of these remote times  nor could he conceal his doubts about the deluge and the frog who once drowned all the world here is the story of the frogonce long ago there was a big frog  he drank himself full of water  he could not get rid of the water  once he saw a sandeel dancing on his tail by the seashore  it made him laugh so that he burst and all the water ran out  there was a great flood and every one was drowned except two or three men and women who got on an island  past came the pelican in a canoe he took off the men but wanting to marry the woman kept her to the last  she wrapped up a log in a possum rug to deceive the pelican and swam to shore and escaped the pelican was very angry he began to paint himself white to show that he was on the war trail when past came another pelican did not like his looks and killed him with his beak  that is why pelicans are partly black and white if you want to know my little dear said the mother of whywhy  many stories like this were told in the cave but they found no credit with whywhy  when he was but ten years old his inquiring spirit showed itself in the following remarkable manner  he had always been informed that a serpent was the mother of his race and that he must treat serpents with the greatest reverence  to kill one was sacrilege  in spite of this he stole out unobserved and crushed a viper which had stung his little brother  he noticed that no harm ensued and this encouraged him to commit a still more daring act  none but the old men and the warriors were allowed to eat oysters  it was universally held that if a woman or a child touched an oyster the earth would open and swallow the culprit  not daunted by this prevalent belief whywhy one day devoured no less than four dozen oysters opening the shells with a flint spearhead which he had secreted in his waistband  the earth did not open and swallow him as he had swallowed the oysters and from that moment he became suspicious of all the ideas and customs imposed by the old men and wizards  two or three touching incidents in domestic life which occurred when why why was about twelve years old confirmed him in the dissidence of his dissent for the first radical was the first dissenter  the etiquette of the age which survives among the yorubas and other tribes made it criminal for a woman to see her husband or even to mention his name when therefore the probable father of whywhy became weary of supporting his family he did not need to leave the cave and tramp abroad  he merely ceased to bring in treefrogs grubs roots and the other supplies which whywhys mother was accustomed to find concealed under a large stone in the neighbourhood of the cave  the poor pious woman who had always religiously abstained from seeing her lords face and from knowing his name was now reduced to destitution  there was no one to grub up pignuts for her nor to extract insects of an edible sort from beneath the bark of trees  as she could not identify her invisible husband she was unable to denounce him to the wizards who would for a consideration have frightened him out of his life or into the performance of his duty  thus even with the aid of whywhy existence became too laborious for her strength and she gradually pined away  as she lay in a halffainting and almost dying state whywhy rushed out to find the most celebrated local medicineman in half an hour the chief medicineman appeared dressed in the skin of a wolf tagged about with bones skulls dead lizards and other ornaments of his official attire  you may see a picture very like him in mr catlins book about the mandans  armed with a drum and a rattle he leaped into the presence of the sick woman uttering unearthly yells  his benevolent action and bedside manner were in accordance with the medical science of the time  he merely meant to frighten away the evil spirit which according to the received hypothesis was destroying the mother of whywhy  what he succeeded in doing was to make whywhys mother give a faint scream after which her jaw fell and her eyes grew fixed and staring  the grief of whywhy was profound  reckless of consequences he declared with impious publicity that the law which forbade a wife to see her own husband and the medical science which frightened poor women to death were cruel and ridiculous  as whywhy though a promising child was still under age little notice was taken of remarks which were attributed to the petulance of youth  but when he went further and transgressed the law which then forbade a brother to speak to his own sister on pain of death the general indignation was no longer repressed  in vain did whywhy plead that if he neglected his sister no one else would comfort her  his life was spared but the unfortunate little girls bones were dug up by a german savant last year in a condition which makes it only too certain that cannibalism was practised by the early natives of the mediterranean coast  these incidents then namely the neglect of his unknown father the death of his mother and the execution of his sister confirmed whywhy in the belief that radical social reforms were desirable  the coming of age of whywhy was celebrated in the manner usual among primitive people  the ceremonies were not of a character to increase his pleasure in life nor his respect for constituted authority  when he was fourteen years of age he was pinned during his sleep by four adult braves who knocked out his front teeth shaved his head with sharp chips of quartzite cut off the first joint of his little finger and daubed his whole body over with clay  they then turned him loose imposing on him his name of whywhy and when his shaven hair began to show through the clay daubing the women of the tribe washed him and painted him black and white  the indignation of whywhy may readily be conceived why he kept asking should you shave a fellows head knock out his teeth cut off his little finger daub him with clay and paint him like a pelican because he is fourteen years old  to these radical questions the braves who had all lost their own front teeth replied that this was the custom of their fathers  they tried to console him moreover by pointing out that now he might eat oysters and catch himself a bride from some hostile tribe or give his sister in exchange for a wife  this was little comfort to whywhy  he had eaten oysters already without supernatural punishment and his sister as we have seen had suffered the extreme penalty of the law  nor could our hero persuade himself that to club and carry off a hostile girl in the dark was the best way to win a loving wife  he remained single and became a great eater of oysters    the manhood of whywhy   as time went on our hero developed into one of the most admired braves of his community  no one was more successful in battle and it became almost a proverb that when whywhy went on the warpath there was certain to be meat enough and to spare even for the women  whywhy though a radical was so far from perfect that he invariably complied with the usages of his time when they seemed rational and useful  if a little tattooing on the arm would have saved men from a horrible disease he would have had all the tribe tattooed  he was no bigot  he kept his word and paid his debts for no one was ever very advanced all at once  it was only when the ceremonious or superstitious ideas of his age and race appeared to him senseless and mischievous that he rebelled or at least hinted his doubts and misgivings  this course of conduct made him feared and hated both by the medicinemen or clerical wizards and by the old women of the tribe  they naturally tried to take their revenge upon him in the usual way  a charge of heresy of course could not well be made for in the infancy of our race there were neither courts of arches nor general assemblies but it was always possible to accuse whywhy of malevolent witchcraft the medicinemen had not long to wait for an opportunity  an old woman died as old women will and every one was asking who sent the evil spirit that destroyed poor old dada  in whywhys time no other explanation of natural death by disease or age was entertained  the old womans grave was dug and all the wizards intently watched for the first worm or insect that should crawl out of the mould  the headwizard soon detected a beetle making as he alleged in the direction where whywhy stood observing the proceedings  the wizard at once denounced our hero as the cause of the old womans death  to have blenched for a moment would have been ruin  but whywhy merely lifted his hand and in a moment a spear flew from it which pinned his denouncer ignominiously to a pinetree  the funeral of the old woman was promptly converted into a free fight in which there was more noise than bloodshed  after this event the medicinemen left whywhy to his own courses and waited for a chance of turning public opinion against the sceptic  the conduct of whywhy was certainly calculated to outrage all conservative feeling  when on the warpath or in the excitement of the chase he had even been known to address a tribesman by his name as old cow or flying cloud or what not instead of adopting the orthodox nomenclature of the classificatory system and saying third cousin by the mothers side thrice removed will you lend me an arrow or whatever it might be  on tabudays once a week when the rest of the people in the cave were all silent sedentary and miserable from some superstitious feeling which we can no longer understand whywhy would walk about whistling or would chip his flints or set his nets  he ought to have been punished with death but no one cared to interfere with him  instead of dancing at the great corroborees or religious ballets of his people he would sit out with a girl whose sad romantic history became fatally interwoven with his own  in vain the medicinemen assured him that pundjel the great spirit was angry  whywhy was indifferent to the thunder which was believed to be the voice of pundjel  his behaviour at the funeral of a celebrated brave actually caused what we would call a reformation in burial ceremonies  it was usual to lay the corpses of the famous dead in a cave where certain of the tribesmen were sent to watch for forty days and nights the decaying body  this ghastly task was made more severe by the difficulty of obtaining food  everything that the watchers were allowed to eat was cooked outside the cave with complicated ceremonies  if any part of the ritual was omitted if a drop or a morsel were spilled the whole rite had to be done over again from the beginning  this was not all  the chief medicineman took a small portion of the meat in a long spoon and entered the sepulchral cavern  in the dim light he approached one of the watchers of the dead danced before him uttered a mysterious formula of words and made a shot at the hungry mans mouth with a long spoon  if the shot was straight if the spoon did not touch the lips or nose or mouth the watcher made ready to receive a fresh spoonful  but if the attempt failed if the spoon did not go straight to the mark the mourners were obliged to wait till all the cooking ceremonies were performed afresh when the feeding began again  now whywhy was a mourner whom the chief medicineman was anxious to spite as children say and at the end of three days watching our hero had not received a morsel of food  the spoon had invariably chanced to miss him  on the fourth night whywhy entertained his fellowwatchers with a harangue on the imbecility of the whole proceeding  he walked out of the cave kicked the chief medicineman into a ravine seized the pot full of meat brought it back with him and made a hearty meal  the other mourners half dead with fear expected to see the corpse they were waking arise girn and take some horrible revenge  nothing of the sort occurred and the burials of the cave dwellers gradually came to be managed in a less irksome way    the loves of verva and whywhy   no man however intrepid can offend with impunity the most sacred laws of society  whywhy proved no exception to this rule  his decline and fall date we may almost say from the hour when he bought a fairhaired blueeyed female child from a member of a tribe that had wandered out of the far north  the tribe were about to cook poor little verva because her mother was dead and she seemed a bouche inutile  for the price of a pair of shell fishhooks a bone dagger and a bundle of grassstring why why who had a tender heart ransomed the child  in the cave she lived an unhappy life as the other children maltreated and tortured her in the manner peculiar to pitiless infancy  such protection as a man can give to a child the unlucky little girl received from whywhy  the cave people like most savages made it a rule never to punish their children  whywhy got into many quarrels because he would occasionally box the ears of the mischievous imps who tormented poor verva the fairhaired and blueeyed captive from the north  there grew up a kind of friendship between whywhy and the child she would follow him with doglike fidelity and with a stealthy tread when he hunted the red deer in the forests of the alpine maritimes  she wove for him a belt of shells strung on stout fibres of grass  in this belt whywhy would attend the tribal corroborees where as has been said he was inclined to sit out with verva and watch rather than join in the grotesque dance performed as worship to the bear  as verva grew older and ceased to be persecuted by the children she became beautiful in the unadorned manner of that early time  her friendship with whywhy began to embarrass the girl and our hero himself felt a quite unusual shyness when he encountered the captive girl among the pines on the hillside  both these untutored hearts were strangely stirred and neither whywhy nor verva could imagine wherefore they turned pale or blushed when they met or even when either heard the others voice  if whywhy had not distrusted and indeed detested the chief medicineman he would have sought that worthys professional advice  but he kept his symptoms to himself and verva also pined in secret  these artless persons were in love without knowing it  it is not surprising that they did not understand the nature of their complaint for probably before whywhy no one had ever been in love courtship had consisted in knocking a casual girl on the head in the dark and the only marriage ceremony had been that of capture  affection on the side of the bride was out of the question for as we have remarked she was never allowed so much as to see her husbands face probably the institution of falling in love has been evolved in and has spread from various early centres of human existence  among the primitive ligurian races however whywhy and verva must be held the inventors and alas the protomartyrs of the passion  love like murder will out and events revealed to whywhy and verva the true nature of their sentiments  it was a considerable exploit of whywhys that brought him and the northern captive to understand each other  the brother of whywhy had died after partaking too freely of a member of a hostile tribe  the cave people of course expected whywhy to avenge his kinsman  the brother they said must have been destroyed by a boilya or vampire and as somebody must have sent that vampire against the lad somebody must be speared for it  such are primitive ideas of medicine and justice  an ordinary brave would have skulked about the dwellings of some neighbouring human groups till he got a chance of knocking over a child or an old woman after which justice and honour would have been satisfied  but whywhy declared that if he must spear somebody he would spear a man of importance  the forms of a challenge were therefore notched on a piece of stick which was solemnly carried by heralds to the most renowned brave of a community settled in the neighbourhood of the modern san remo  this hero might have very reasonably asked why should i spear whywhy because his brother overate himself  the laws of honour however which even at this period had long been established forbade a gentleman when challenged to discuss the reasonableness of the proceeding  the champions met on a sandy plain beside a little river near the modern ventimiglia  an amphitheatre of rock surrounded them and far beyond the valley was crowned by the ancient snow of an alpine peak  the tribes of either party gathered in the rocky amphitheatre and breathlessly watched the issue of the battle  each warrior was equipped with a shield a sheaf of spears and a heavy pointed club  at thirty paces distance they began throwing and the spectators enjoyed a beautiful exposition of warlike skill  both men threw with extreme force and deadly aim while each defended himself cleverly with his shield  the spears were exhausted and but one had pierced the thigh of whywhy while his opponent had two sticking in his neck and left arm  then like two meeting thunderclouds the champions dashed at each other with their clubs  the sand was whirled up around them as they spun in the wild dance of battle and the clubs rattled incessantly on the heads and shields  twice whywhy was down but he rose with wonderful agility and never dropped his shield  a third time he stooped beneath a tremendous whack but when all seemed over grasped a handful of sand and flung it right in his enemys eyes  the warrior reeled blinded and confused when whywhy gave point with the club in his antagonists throat the blood leaped out and both fell senseless on the plain        when the slow mist cleared from before the eyes of whywhy he found himself he was doubtless the first hero of the many heroes who have occupied this romantic position stretched on a grassy bed and watched by the blue eyes of verva  where were the sand the stream the hostile warrior the crowds of friends and foes  it was vervas part to explain the champion of the other tribe had never breathed after he received the clubthrust and the chief medicineman had declared that whywhy was also dead  he had suggested that both champions should be burned in the desolate spot where they lay that their boilyas or ghosts might not harm the tribes  the lookerson had gone to their several and distant caves to fetch fire for the ceremony they possessed no means of striking a light and verva unnoticed had lingered beside whywhy and laid his bleeding head in her lap  whywhy had uttered a groan and the brave girl dragged him from the field into a safe retreat among the woods not far from the stream  whywhy had been principally beaten about the head and his injuries therefore were slight  after watching the return of the tribesmen and hearing the chief medicineman explain that whywhys body had been carried away by the bad blackfellow with a tail who lives under the earth whywhy enjoyed the pleasure of seeing his kinsmen and his foes leave the place to its natural silence  then he found words and poured forth his heart to verva  they must never be sunderedthey must be man and wife  the girl leaned her golden head on whywhys dark shoulder and sniffed at him for kissing was an institution not yet evolved  she wept  she had a dreadful thing to tell himthat she could never be his  look at this mark she said exposing the inner side of her arm  whywhy looked shuddered and turned pale  on vervas arm he recognized almost defaced the same tattooed badge that wound its sinuous spirals across his own broad chest and round his manly legs  it was the mark of the serpent  both were serpents both unknown to whywhy though not to verva bore the same name the same badge and if whywhy had been a religious man both would have worshipped the same reptile  marriage between them then was a thing accursed man punished it by death  whywhy bent his head and thought  he remembered all his youththe murder of his sister for no crime the killing of the serpent and how no evil came of it the eating of the oysters and how the earth had not opened and swallowed him  his mind was made up  it was absolutely certain that his tribe and vervas kin had never been within a thousand miles of each other  in a few impassioned words he explained to verva his faith his simple creed that a thing was not necessarily wrong because the medicinemen said so and the tribe believed them  the girls own character was all trustfulness and whywhy was the person she trusted  oh whywhy dear she said blushing for she had never before ventured to break the tribal rule which forbade calling any one by his name oh whywhy you are always right     and oer the hills and far away       beyond their utmost purple rim    beyond the night across the day       through all the world she followed him    la mort whywhy   two years had passed like a dream in the pleasant valley which in far later ages the romans called vallis aurea and which we call vallauris here at a distance of some thirty miles from the cave and the tribe dwelt in fancied concealment whywhy and verva  the clear stream was warbling at their feet in the bright blue weather of spring the scent of the may blossoms was poured abroad and lying in the hollow of why whys shield a pretty little baby with whywhys dark eyes and vervas golden locks was crowing to his mother  whywhy sat beside her and was busily making the first european pipkin with the clay which he had found near vallauris  all was peace        there was a low whizzing sound something seemed to rush past whywhy and with a scream verva fell on her face  a spear had pierced her breast  with a yell like that of a wounded lion whywhy threw himself on the bleeding body of his bride  for many moments he heard no sound but her long loud and unconscious breathing  he did not mark the yells of his tribesmen nor feel the spears that rained down on himself nor see the hideous face of the chief medicineman peering at his own  verva ceased to breathe  there was a convulsion and her limbs were still then whywhy rose  in his right hand was his famous club the watcher of the fords in his left his shield  these had never lain far from his hand since he fled with verva  he knew that the end had come as he had so often dreamt of it he knew that he was trapped and taken by his offended tribesmen  his first blow shattered the head of the chief medicineman  then he flung himself all bleeding from the spears among the press of savages who started from every lentisk bush and tuft of tall flowering heath  they gave back when four of their chief braves had fallen and whywhy lacked strength and will to pursue them  he turned and drew vervas body beneath the rocky wall and then he faced his enemies  he threw down shield and club and raised his hands  a light seemed to shine about his face and his first word had a strange tone that caught the ear and chilled the heart of all who heard him  listen he said for these are the last words of why why  he came like the water and like the wind he goes he knew not whence and he knows not whither  he does not curse you for you are that which you are  but the day will come and here whywhys voice grew louder and his eyes burned the day will come when you will no longer be the slave of things like that dead dog and here he pointed to the shapeless face of the slain medicineman  the day will come when a man shall speak unto his sister in loving kindness and none shall do him wrong  the day will come when a woman shall unpunished see the face and name the name of her husband  as the summers go by you will not bow down to the hyaenas and the bears and worship the adder and the viper  you will not cut and bruise the bodies of your young men or cruelly strike and seize away women in the darkness  yes and the time will be when a man may love a woman of the same family name as himselfbut here the outraged religion of the tribesmen could endure no longer to listen to these wild and blasphemous words  a shower of spears flew out and why why fell across the body of verva  his own was like a marsh full of reeds said the poet of the tribe in a song which described these events so thick the spears stood in it        when he was dead the tribe knew what they had lost in whywhy  they bore his body with that of verva to the cave there they laid the loverswhywhy crowned with a crown of seashells and with a piece of a rare magical substance iron at his side 208  then the tribesmen withdrew from that now holy ground and built them houses and forswore the follies of the medicinemen as whywhy had prophesied  many thousands of years later the cave was opened when the railway to genoa was constructed and the bones of whywhy with the crown and the fragment of iron were found where they had been laid by his repentant kinsmen  he had bravely asserted the rights of the individual conscience against the dictates of society he had lived and loved and died not in vain  last april i plucked a rose beside his cave and laid it with another that had blossomed at the door of the last house which covered the homeless head of shelley  the prophecies of whywhy have been partially fulfilled  brothers if they happen to be on speaking terms may certainly speak to their sisters though we are still alas forbidden to marry the sisters of our deceased wives  wives may see their husbands though in society they rarely avail themselves of the privilege  young ladies are still forbidden to call young men at large by their christian names but this tribal law and survival of the classificatory system is rapidly losing its force  burials in the savage manner to which whywhy objected will soon doubtless be permitted to conscientious nonconformists in the graveyards of the church of england  the teeth of boys are still knocked out at public and private schools but the ceremony is neither formal nor universal  our advance in liberty is due to an army of forgotten radical martyrs of whom we know less than we do of mr bradlaugh     a duchesss secret   when i was poor and honest and a novelist i little thought that i should ever be rich and something not very unlike a duke and as to honesty but an indifferent character  i have had greatness thrust on me  i am like simpcox in the dramatis personae of henry iv an impostor and yet i scarcely know how i could have escaped this deplorable though lucrative position  love is a great master says the mort darthur and i perhaps may claim sympathy and pity as a victim of love  the following unaffected lines in which only names and dates are disguised contain all the apology i can offer to a censorious world  two or three years ago i was dependent on literature for my daily bread i was a regular manofallwork  having the advantage of knowing a clerk in the foreign office who went into society he had been my pupil at the university i picked up a good deal of scandalous gossip which i published in the pimlico postboy a journal of fashion  i was also engaged as sporting prophet to the tipster and was not less successful than my contemporaries as a vaticinator of future events  at the same time i was contributing a novel anonymously to the fleet street magazine a very respectable publication though perhaps a little dull the editor had expressly requested me to make things rather more lively and i therefore gave my imagination free play in the construction of my plot  i introduced a beautiful girl daughter of a preacher in the shaker community  her hand was sought in marriage by a sporting baronet who had seen her as he pursued the chase through the pathless glens of the new forest  this baronet she married after suffering things intolerable from the opposition of the shakers  here i had a good deal of padding about shakers and their ways and near the end of the sixth chapter my heroine became the wife of sir william buckley  but the baronet proved a perfect william rufus for variegated and versatile blackguardism  lady buckleys life was made impossible by his abominable conduct  at this juncture my heroine chanced to be obliged to lunch at a railway refreshmentroom  my last chapter had described the poor lady lunching lonely in the bleak and gritty waiting room of swilby junction lonely except for the company of her little boy  i showed how she fell into a strange and morbid vein of reflection suggested by the qualities of the local sherry  if she was to live her lord and master sir w buckley must die  and i described how a fiendish temptation was whispered to her by the glass of local sherry  williams constitution strong as it is she murmured inwardly could never stand a dozen of that sherry  suppose he chanced to partake of itaccidentallyrather late in the evening  amidst these reflections i allowed the december instalment of the baronets wife to come to a conclusion in the fleet street magazine  obviously crime was in the wind  it is my habit to read the agony column as it is flippantly called the second column in the outer sheet of the times  who knows but he may there see something to his advantage and besides the mysterious advertisements may suggest ideas for plots  one day i took up the agony column as usual at my club and to my surprise read the following advertisement  f s msherry wine  wreck of the jingowretched boy stay your unhallowed hand  would you expose an erring mothers secret  author will please communicate with messrs mantlepiece and co solicitors uptononthewold  as soon as i saw this advertisement as soon as my eyes fell on sherry wine and author i felt that here was something for me  f s m puzzled me at first but i read it fleet street magazine by a flash of inspiration  wretched boy seemed familiar and unappropriatei was twentyninebut what of that  of course i communicated with messrs mantlepiece saying that i had reason for supposing that i was the author alluded to in the advertisement  as to the words wreck of the jingo they entirely beat me but i hoped that some light would be thrown on their meaning by the respectable firm of solicitors  it did occur to me that if any one had reasons for communicating with me it would have been better and safer to address a letter to me under cover to the editor of the fleet street magazine  but the public have curious ideas on these matters  two days after i wrote to messrs mantlepiece i received a very guarded reply in which i was informed that their client wished to make my acquaintance and that a carriage would await me if i presented myself at uptononthewold station by the train arriving at 545 on friday  well i thought to myself i may as well do a weekending as some people call it with my anonymous friend as anywhere else  at the same time i knew that the carriage might be hired by enemies to convey me to the pauper lunatic asylum or to west ham the place where people disappear mysteriously  i might be the victim of a rivals jealousy and many men novelists of most horrible imaginings envied my talents and success or a nihilist plot might have drawn me into its machinery  but i was young and i thought i would see the thing out  my journey was unadventurous if you except a row with a german who refused to let me open the window  but this has nothing to do with my narrative and is not a false scent to make a guileless reader keep his eye on the teuton  some novelists permit themselves these artifices which i think untradesmanlike and unworthy  when i arrived at upton the stationmaster made a charge at my carriage and asked me if i was the gentleman for the towers  the whole affair was so mysterious that i thought it better to answer in the affirmative  my luggage a gladstone bag was borne by four stately and liveried menials to a roomy and magnificent carriage in which everything from the ducal crown on the silver footwarmers to the four splendid bays breathed of opulence directed and animated by culture  i dismissed all thoughts of the pauper lunatic asylum and the nihilists and was whirled through miles of park and up an avenue lighted by electricity  we reached the baronial gateway of the towers a vast gothic pile in the later manner of inigo jones and a seneschal stood at the foot of a magnificent staircase to receive me  i had never seen a seneschal before but i recognized him by the peeled white wand he carried by his great silver chain and his black velvet coat and kneebreeches  your lordships room says the seneschal obviously an old and confidential family servant is your old onethe tapestried chamber her grace is waiting anxiously for you  then two menials marched with my gladstone bag to the apartment thus indicated  for me i felt in a dream or like a man caught up into the fairyland of the arabian nights  her grace was all very wellthe aristocracy always admired my fictitious creations but your lordship why your lordship  then the chilling idea occurred to me that i had not been the gentleman for the towers that i was in the position of the hero of happy thoughts when he went to the dukes by mistake for the humble home of the plyte frazers  but i was young  her grace could not eat me and i determined as i said before to see it out  i dressed very deliberately and that process over was led by the worthy seneschal into a singular octagonal boudoir hung with soft dark blue arras  the only person in the room was a gaunt middleaged lady in deep mourning  though i knew no more of the british aristocracy than mr w d howells of new york i recognized her for the duchess by her nose which resembled those worn by the duchesses of mr du maurier  as soon as we were alone she rose drew me to her bosom much to my horror looked at me long and earnestly and at last exclaimed how changed you are percy  my name is thomasthomas cobson  before i could reply she was pouring out reproaches on me for having concealed my existence and revealed in my novel what she spoke of as the secret  when she grew not calm but fatigued i ventured to ask why she had conferred on me the honour of her invitation and how i had been unfortunate enough to allude to affairs of which i had certainly no knowledge  her reply was given with stately dignity  you need not pretend she said to have forgotten what i told you in this very room before you left england for an african tour in the jingo  i then revealed to you the secret of my life the secret of the dukes death your horror when you heard how that most unhappy man compelled me to free myself from his tyranny by a method which his habits rendered only too easyin short by a dose of cheap sherry was deep and natural  oh percy you did not kiss your mother before starting on your illomened voyage  as soon as i heard of the wreck of the jingo and that you were the only passenger drowned i recognized an artifice un vieux truc by which you hoped to escape from a mother of whom you were ashamed  you had only pretended to be the victim of oceans rage  people who are drowned in novels always do reappear and percy your mother is an old novelreader  my agents have ever since been on your track but it was reserved for me to discover the last of the birkenheads in the anonymous author of the baronets wife  that romance in which you have had the baseness to use your knowledge of a mothers guilt as a motif in your twopenny plot unveiled to me the secret of your hidden existence  you must stop the story or alter the following numbers you must give up your discreditable mode of life  heavens that a birkenhead should be a literary character  and you must resume your place in my house and in society  here the duchess of stalybridge paused she had quite recovered that repose of manner and icy hauteur which i understand is the heritage of the house of birkenhead  for my part i had almost lost the modest confidence which is i believe hereditary in the family of cobson  it was a scene to make the boldest stand aghast  here was an unknown lady of the highest rank confessing a dreadful crime to a total stranger and recognizing in that stranger her son and the heir to an enormous property and a title as oldas old as british dukedoms however old they may be  ouida would have said heir to a title older than a thousand centuries but i doubt if the english duke is so ancient as that or a direct descendant of the dukes of edom mentioned in holy writ  i began pouring out an incoherent flood of evidence to show that i was only thomas cobson and had never been any one else but at that moment a gong sounded and a young lady entered the room  she also was dressed in mourning and the duchess introduced her to me as my cousin miss birkenhead  gwyneth was a child percy said my august hostess when you went to africa  i shook hands with my cousin with as much composure as i could assume for to tell the truth i was not only moved by my recent adventures but i had on the spot fallen hopelessly in love with my new relative  it was le coup de foudre of a french writer on the affectionsm stendhal  miss birkenhead had won my heart from the first moment of our meeting  why should i attempt to describe a psychological experience as rare as instantaneous conversion or more so  miss birkenhead was tall and dark with a proud pale face and eyes which unmistakably indicated the possession of a fine sense of humour  proud pale people seldom look when they first meet a total strangerstill more a longlost cousinas if they had some difficulty in refraining from mirth  miss birkenheads face was as fixed and almost as pure as marble but i read sympathy and amusement and kindness in her eyes  presently the door opened again and an elderly man in the dress of a priest came in  to him i was presented  your old governor percy  for a moment my unhappy middleclass association made me suppose that the elderly ecclesiastic was my old guvnormy father the late duke  but an instants reflection proved to me that her grace meant tutor by governor  i am ashamed to say that i now entered into the spirit of the scene shook the holy man warmly by the hand and quoted a convenient passage from horace  he appeared to fall into the trap and began to speak of old recollections of my boyhood  stately liveried menials now greatly to my surprise brought in tea  i was just declining tea for i expected dinner in a few minutes when a voice a sweet low voice whispered  take some  i took some providentially as it turned out  again i was declining teacake when i could have sworn i heard the same voice so low that it seemed like the admonition of a passing spirit say  take some  i took some for i was exceedingly hungry and then the conversation lapsed began again vaguely and lapsed again  we all know that wretched quarter of an hour or half hour which unpunctual guests make us pass in famine and fatigue while they keep dinner waiting  upon my word we waited till halfpast eleven before dinner was announced  but for the tea i must have perished for like the butler in sir george dasents novel i likes my meals regular  the duchess had obviously forgotten all about dinner  there was a spinningwheel in the room and she sat and span like an elderly fate when dinner was announced at last i began to fear it would never end the menu covered both sides of the card  the duchess ate little and hardly anything was drunk  at last the ladies left us about one in the morning  i saw my chance and began judiciously to draw the chaplain  it appeared that the duchess did not always dine at halfpast eleven  the feast was a movable one from eight oclock onwards  the duchess and the establishment had got into these habits during the old dukes time  a very strange man the old duke rarely got up till eight in the evening often prolonged breakfast till next day  but i need not tell you all this percy my old pupil said the chaplain and he winked as a clergyman ought not to wink  my dear sir cried i encouraged by this performance for heavens sake tell me what all this means  in this socalled nineteenth century in our boasted age of progress what does the duchess mean by her invitation to me and by her conduct at large  indeed why is she at large  the chaplain drew closer to me  did ye ever hear of a duchess in a madhouse said he and i owned that i never had met with such an incident in my reading unless there is one in websters plays somewhere  well then who is to make a beginning asked the priest  the duchess has not a relation in the world but miss birkenhead the only daughter of a son of the last duke but one  the late duke was a dreadful man and he turned the poor duchesss head with the life he led her  the drowning of her only son in the jingo finished the business  she has got that story abouthere he touched the decanter of sherry i noddedshe has got that story into her head and she believes her son is alive otherwise she is as sane and unimaginative asasas mr chaplin said he with a flash of inspiration  happily you are an honest man or you seem like one and wont take advantage of her delusion  this was all i could get out of the chaplain indeed there was no more to be got  i went to bed but not to sleep  next day and many other days i spent wrestling in argument with the duchess  i brought her my certificate of baptism my testamurs in smalls and greats an old passport a bill of pooles anything i could think of to prove my identity  she was obdurate and only saidif you are not percy how do you know my secret  i had in the meantime to alter the intended course of my novelthe baronets wife  the baronet was made to become a reformed character  but in all those days at the lonely towers and in the intervals of arguing with the poor duchess i could not but meet gwyneth birkenhead  we met not as cousins for miss birkenhead had only too clearly appreciated the situation from the moment she first met me the old seneschal too was in the secret i dont know what the rest of the menials thought  they were accustomed to the duchess  but if gwyneth and i did not meet as cousins we met as lighthearted young people in a queer situation and in a strange dismal old house     we could not in the selfsame mansion dwell       without some stir of heart some malady    we could not sit at meals but feel how well       it soothed each to be the other by  indeed i could not sit at meals without being gratefully reminded of gwyneths advice about taking some on the night of my first arrival at the towers  these queer happy times ended  one day a party of archaeologists came to visit the towers  they were members of a society for badgering the proprietors of old houses and they had been lunching at uptononthewold  after luncheon they invaded the towers personally conducted by mr bulkin a very learned historian bulkin had nearly plucked me in modern history and when i heard his voice afar off i arose and fled swiftly  unluckily the duchess chanced by an unprecedented accident to be in the library a room which the family never used and which was therefore exhibited to curious strangers  into this library bulkin precipitated himself followed by his admirers and began to lecture on the family portraits  beginning with the crusaders painted by lorenzo credi he soon got down to modern times  he took no notice of the duchess whom he believed to be a housekeeper but posting himself between the unfortunate lady and the door gave a full account of the career of the late duke  this was more than the duchess who knew all about the subject of the lecture could stand but mr bulkin referring her to his own appendices finished his address and offered the duchess halfacrown as he led his troop to other victories  from this accident the duchess never recovered  her spirits at no time high sank to zero and she soon passed peacefully away  she left a will in which her personal property about 40000 pounds a year was bequeathed to gwyneth as my beloved son percy has enough for his needs the revenues of the dukedom of stalybridge being about 300000 pounds per annum before the agricultural depression  she might well have thought i needed no more  of course i put in no claim for these estates messuages farms mines and so forth nor for my hereditary ducal pension of 15000 pounds  but gwyneth and i are not uncomfortably provided for and i no longer contribute paragraphs of gossip to the pimlico postboy nor yet do i vaticinate in the columns of the tipster  perhaps i ought to have fled from the towers the morning after my arrival  and i declare that i would have fled but for gwyneth and love that is a great master     the house of strange stories   the house of strange stories as i prefer to call it though it is not known by that name in the county seems the very place for a ghost  yet though so many peoples have dwelt upon its site and in its chambers though the ancient elizabethan oak and all the queer tables and chairs that a dozen generations have bequeathed might well be tenanted by ancestral spirits and disturbed by rappings it is a curious fact that there is not a ghost in the house of strange stories  on my earliest visit to this mansion i was disturbed i own by a not unpleasing expectancy  there must one argued be a shadowy lady in green in the bedroom or just as one was falling asleep the spectre of a jesuit would creep out of the priests hole where he was starved to death in the spacious times of great elizabeth and would search for a morsel of bread  the priest was usually starved out sentinels being placed in all the rooms and passages till at last hunger and want of air would drive the wretched man to give himself up for the sake of change of wretchedness  then perhaps he was hanged or he died in our hands as one of elizabeths officers euphemistically put it when the jesuit was tortured to death in the tower  no house of seven gables across the atlantic can have quite such memories as these yet oddly enough i do not know of more than one ghost of a jesuit in all england  he appeared to a learned doctor in a library and the learned doctor described the phantom not long ago in the athenaeum  does the priest of your priesthole walk i asked the squire one winter evening in the house of strange stories  darkness had come to the rescue of the pheasants about four in the afternoon and all of us men and women were sitting at afternoon tea in the firelit study drowsily watching the flicker of the flame on the black panelling  the characters will introduce themselves as they take part in the conversation  no said the squire even the priest does not walk  somehow very few of the jesuits have left ghosts in country houses  they are just the customers you would expect to walk but they dont  there is to be sure one priestly ghoststory which you may or may not know and i tell it here though i dont believe it just as i heard it from the bishop of dunchester himself  according to this most affable and distinguished prelate now no more he once arrived in a large country house shortly before dinnertime he was led to his chamber he dressed and went downstairs  not knowing the plan of the house he found his way into the library a chamber lined with the books of many studious generations  here the learned bishop remained for a few minutes when the gong sounded for dinner and a domestic entering the apartment showed the prelate the way to the drawingroom where the other guests were now assembled  the bishop when the company appeared complete and was beginning to manoeuvre towards the diningroom addressed his host whom we shall call lord birkenhead and observed that the ecclesiastic had not yet appeared  what ecclesiastic asked his lordship  the priest replied the bishop whom i met in the library  upon this lord birkenheads countenance changed somewhat and with a casual remark he put the question by  after dinner when the ladies had left the men to their wine lord birkenhead showed some curiosity as to the ecclesiastic and learned that he had seemed somewhat shy and stiff yet had the air of a man just about to enter into conversation  at that moment said the bishop i was summoned to the drawingroom and did not at first notice that my friend the priest had not followed me  he had an interesting and careworn face added the bishop  you have certainly seen the family ghost said lord birkenhead he only haunts the library where as you may imagine his retirement is but seldom disturbed  and indeed the habits of the great in england are not studious as a rule  then i must return lord birkenhead to your library said the bishop and that without delay for this appears to be a matter in which the services of one of the higher clergy however unworthy may prove of incalculable benefit  if i could only hope answered lord birkenhead who was a catholic with a deep sigh that his reverence would recognize anglican orders  the bishop was now as may be fancied on his mettle and without further parley retired to the library  the rest of the men awaited his return and beguiled the moments of expectation with princely havannas  in about half an hour the bishop reappeared and a close observer might have detected a shade of paleness on his apostolic features yet his face was radiant like that of a good man who has performed a good action being implored to relieve the anxiety of the company the worthy prelate spoke as follows  on entering the library which was illuminated by a single lamp i found myself alone  i drew a chair to the fire and taking up a volume of m renans which chanced to be lying on the table i composed myself to detect the sophistries of this brilliant but unprincipled writer  thus by an effort of will i distracted myself from that state of expectant attention to which modern science attributes such phantoms and spectral appearances as can neither be explained away by a morbid condition of the liver nor as caused by the common rat mus rattus  i should observe by the way said the learned bishop interrupting his own narrative that scepticism will in vain attempt to account by the latter cause namely rats for the spectres lemures simulacra and haunted houses of the ancient greeks and romans  with these supernatural phenomena as they prevailed in athens and rome we are well acquainted not only from the mostellaria of plautus but from the numerous ghoststories of pliny plutarch the philopseudes of lucian and similar sources  but it will at once be perceived and admitted even by candid men of science that these spiritual phenomena of the classical period cannot plausibly nor even possibly be attributed to the agency of rats when we recall the fact that the rat was an animal unknown to the ancients  as the learned m selys longch observes in his etudes de micromammalogie paris 1839 p 59 the origin of the rat is obscure the one thing certain is that the vermin was unknown to the ancients and that it arrived in europe introduced perhaps by the crusaders after the middle ages  i think added the prelate looking round not without satisfaction that i have completely disposed of the rat hypothesis as far at least as the ghosts of classical tradition are concerned  your reasoning bishop replied lord birkenhead is worthy of your reputation but pray pardon the curiosity which entreats you to return from the simulacra of the past to the ghost of the present  i had not long been occupied with m renan said the bishop thus adjured when i became aware of the presence of another person in the room  i think my eyes had strayed from the volume as i turned a page to the table on which i perceived the brown strong hand of a young man looking up i beheld my friend the priest who was indeed a man of some twentyseven years of age with a frank and open though somewhat careworn aspect  i at once rose and asked if i could be of service to him in anything and i trust i did not betray any wounding suspicion that he was other than a man of flesh and blood  you can indeed my lord relieve me of a great burden said the young man and it was apparent enough that he did acknowledge the validity of anglican orders  will you kindly take from the shelf that volume of cicero de officiis he said pointing to a copy of an elzevir variorum editionnot the small duodecimo elzevirremove the paper you will find there and burn it in the fire on the hearth  certainly i will do as you say but will you reward me by explaining the reason of your request  in me said the appearance you behold francis wilton priest  i was born in 1657 and after adventures and an education with which i need not trouble you found myself here as chaplain to the family of the lord birkenhead of the period  it chanced one day that i heard in confession from the lips of lady birkenhead a tale so strange moving and but for the sacred circumstances of the revelation so incredible that my soul had no rest for thinking thereon  at last neglecting my vow and fearful that i might become forgetful of any portion of so marvellous a narrative i took up my pen and committed the confession to the security of manuscript  litera scripta manet  scarcely had i finished my unholy task when the sound of a distant horn told me that the hunt to which pleasure i was passionately given approached the demesne  i thrust the written confession into that volume of cicero hurried to the stable saddled my horse with my own hands and rode in the direction whence i heard the music of the hounds  on my way a locked gate barred my progress  i put rupert at it he took off badly fell and my spirit passed away in the fall  but not to the place of repose did my sinful spirit wing its flight  i found myself here in the library where naturally scarcely any one ever comes except the maids  when i would implore them to destroy the unholy document that binds me to earth they merely scream nor have i found any scion of the house nor any guest except your lordship of more intrepid resolution or more charitable mood  and now i trust you will release me  i rose for i had seated myself during his narrative my heart was stirred with pity i took down the cicero and lit on a sheet of yellow paper covered with faded manuscript which of course i did not read  i turned to the hearth tossed on the fire the sere old paper which blazed at once and then hearing the words pax vobiscum i looked round  but i was alone  after a few minutes devoted to private ejaculations i returned to the diningroom and that is all my story  your maids need no longer dread the ghost of the library  he is released  will any one take any more wine asked lord birkenhead in tones of deep emotion  no  then suppose we join the ladies  well said one of the ladies the girton girl when the squire had finished the prelates narrative i dont call that much of a story what was lady birkenheads confession about  thats what one really wants to know  the bishop could not possibly have read the paper said the bachelor of arts one of the guests not as a gentleman nor a bishop  i wish i had had the chance said the girton girl  perhaps the confession was in latin said the bachelor of arts  the girton girl disdained to reply to this unworthy sneer  i have often observed she said in a reflective voice that the most authentic and best attested bogies dont come to very much  they appear in a desultory manner without any context so to speak and like other difficulties require a context to clear up their meaning  these efforts of the girton girl to apply the methods of philology to spectres were received in silence  the women did not understand them though they had a strong personal opinion about their learned author  the only ghost i ever came across or rather came within measurable distance of never appeared at all so far as one knew  miss lebas has a story said the squire wont she tell us her story  the ladies murmured do please  it really cannot be called a ghoststory remarked miss lebas it was only an uncomfortable kind of coincidence and i never think of it without a shudder  but i know there is not any reason at all why it should make any of you shudder so dont be disappointed  it was the long vacation before last said the girton girl and i went on a readingparty to bantry bay with wyndham and toole of somerville and clare of lady margarets  leighton coached us  dear me  with all these young men my dear asked the maiden aunt  they were all women of my year except miss leighton of newnham who was our coach answered the girton girl composedly  dear me  i beg your pardon for interrupting you said the maiden aunt  well termtime was drawing near and bantry bay was getting pretty cold when i received an invitation from lady garryowen to stay with them at dundellan on my way south  they were two very dear old hospitable irish ladies the last of their race lady garryowen and her sister miss patty  they were so hospitable that though i did not know it dundellan was quite full when i reached it overflowing with young people  the house has nothing very remarkable about it a grey plain building with remains of the chateau about it and a high park wall  in the garden wall there is a small round tower just like those in the precinct wall at st andrews  the ground floor is not used  on the first floor there is a furnished chamber with a deep round niche almost a separate room like that in queen marys apartments in holy rood  the first floor has long been fitted up as a bedroom and dressingroom but it had not been occupied and a curious old spinningwheel in the corner which has nothing to do with my story if you can call it a story must have been unused since 98 at least  i reached dublin lateour train should have arrived at halfpast sixit was ten before we toiled into the station  the dundellan carriage was waiting for me and after an hours drive i reached the house  the dear old ladies had sat up for me and i went to bed as soon as possible in a very comfortable room  i fell asleep at once and did not waken till broad daylight between seven and eight when as my eyes wandered about i saw by the pictures on the wall and the names on the books beside my bed that miss patty must have given up her own room to me  i was quite sorry and as i dressed determined to get her to let me change into any den rather than accept this sacrifice  i went downstairs and found breakfast ready but neither lady garryowen nor miss patty  looking out of the window into the garden i heard for the only time in my life the wild irish keen over the dead and saw the old nurse wailing and wringing her hands and hurrying to the house  as soon as she entered she told me with a burst of grief and in language i shall not try to imitate that miss patty was dead  when i arrived the house was so full that there was literally no room for me  but dundellan was never beaten yet the old ladies had said there was still the room in the tower  but this room had such an evil reputation for being haunted that the servants could hardly be got to go near it at least after dark and the dear old ladies never dreamed of sending any of their guests to pass a bad night in a place with a bad name  miss patty who had the courage of a bayard did not think twice she went herself to sleep in the haunted tower and left her room to me and when the old nurse went to call her in the morning she could not waken miss patty  she was dead  heartdisease they called it  of course added the girton girl as i said it was only a coincidence but the irish servants could not be persuaded that miss patty had not seen whatever the thing was that they believed to be in the garden tower i dont know what it was  you see the context was dreadfully vague a mere fragment  there was a little silence after the girton girls story  i never heard before in my life said the maiden aunt at last of any host or hostess who took the haunted room themselves when the house happened to be full  they always send the stranger within their gates to it and then pretend to be vastly surprised when he does not have a good night  i had several bad nights myself once  in ireland too  tell us all about it judy said her brother the squire  no murmured the maiden aunt  you would only laugh at me  there was no ghost  i didnt hear anything  i didnt see anything  i didnt even smell anything as they do in that horrid book the haunted hotel  then why had you such bad nights  oh i felt said the maiden aunt with a little shudder  what did you feel aunt judy  i know you will laugh said the maiden aunt abruptly entering on her nervous narrative  i felt all the time as if somebody was looking through the window  now you know there couldnt be anybody  it was in an irish country house where i had just arrived and my room was on the second floor  the window was oldfashioned and narrow with a deep recess  as soon as i went to bed my dears i felt that some one was looking through the window and meant to come in  i got up and bolted the window though i knew it was impossible for anybody to climb up there and i drew the curtains but i could not fall asleep  if ever i began to dose i would waken with a start and turn and look in the direction of the window  i did not sleep all night and next night though i was dreadfully tired it was just the same thing  so i had to take my hostess into my confidence though it was extremely disagreeable my dears to seem so foolish  i only told her that i thought the air or something must disagree with me for i could not sleep  then as some one was leaving the house that day she implored me to try another room where i slept beautifully and afterwards had a very pleasant visit  but the day i went away my hostess asked me if i had been kept awake by anything in particular for instance by a feeling that some one was trying to come in at the window  well i admitted that i had a nervous feeling of that sort and she said that she was very sorry and that every one who lay in the room had exactly the same sensation  she supposed they must all have heard the history of the room in childhood and forgotten that they had heard it and then been consciously reminded of it by reflex action  it seems my dears that that is the new scientific way of explaining all these things presentiments and dreams and wraiths and all that sort of thing  we have seen them before and remember them without being aware of it  so i said id never heard the history of the room but she said i must have and so must all the people who felt as if some one was coming in by the window  and i said that it was rather a curious thing they should all forget they knew it and all be reminded of it without being aware of it and that if she did not mind id like to be reminded of it again  so she said that these objections had all been replied to just as clergymen always say in sermons and then she told me the history of the room  it only came to this that three generations before the family butler whom every one had always thought a most steady respectable man dressed himself up like a ghost or like his notion of a ghost and got a ladder and came in by the window to steal the diamonds of the lady of the house and he frightened her to death poor woman  that was all  but ever since people who sleep in the room dont sleep so to speak and keep thinking that some one is coming in by the casement  thats all and i told you it was not an interesting story but perhaps you will find more interest in the scientific explanation of all these things  the story of the maiden aunt so far as it recounted her own experience did not contain anything to which the judicial faculties of the mind refused assent  probably the bachelor of arts felt that something a good deal more unusual was wanted for he instantly started without being asked on the following narrative  i also was staying said the bachelor of arts at the home of my friends the aristocracy in scotland  the name of the house and the precise rank in the peerage of my illustrious host it is not necessary for me to give  all however who know those more than feudal and baronial halls are aware that the front of the castle looks forth on a somewhat narrow drive bordered by black and funereal pines  on the night of my arrival at the castle although i went late to bed i did not feel at all sleepy  something perhaps in the mountain air or in the vicissitudes of baccarat may have banished slumber  i had been in luck and a pile of sovereigns and notes lay in agreeable confusion on my dressingtable  my feverish blood declined to be tranquillized and at last i drew up the blind threw open the latticed window and looked out on the drive and the pinewood  the faint and silvery blue of dawn was just wakening in the sky and a setting moon hung with a peculiarly ominous and wasted appearance above the crests of the forest  but conceive my astonishment when i beheld on the drive and right under my window a large and wellappointed hearse with two white horses with plumes complete and attended by mutes whose black staffs were tipped with silver that glittered pallid in the dawn  i exhausted my ingenuity in conjectures as to the presence of this remarkable vehicle with the white horses so unusual though when one thinks of it so appropriate to the chariot of death  could some belated visitor have arrived in a hearse like the lady in miss ferriers novel could one of the domestics have expired and was it the intention of my host to have the body thus honourably removed without casting a gloom over his guests  wild as these hypotheses appeared i could think of nothing better and was just about to leave the window and retire to bed when the driver of the strange carriage who had hitherto sat motionless turned and looked me full in the face  never shall i forget the appearance of this man whose sallow countenance closeshaven dark chin and small black moustache combined with i know not what of martial in his air struck into me a certain indefinable alarm  no sooner had he caught my eye than he gathered up his reins just raised his whip and started the mortuary vehicle at a walk down the road  i followed it with my eyes till a bend in the avenue hid it from my sight  so wrapt up was my spirit in the exercise of the single sense of vision that it was not till the hearse became lost to view that i noticed the entire absence of sound which accompanied its departure  neither had the bridles and trappings of the white horses jingled as the animals shook their heads nor had the wheels of the hearse crashed upon the gravel of the avenue  i was compelled by all these circumstances to believe that what i had looked upon was not of this world and with a beating heart i sought refuge in sleep  next morning feeling far from refreshed i arrived among the latest at a breakfast which was a desultory and movable feast  almost all the men had gone forth to hill forest or river in pursuit of the furred finned or feathered denizens of the wilds  you speak interrupted the schoolboy like a printed book  i like to hear you speak like that  drive on old man  drive on your hearse  the bachelor of arts drove on without noticing this interruption  i tried to lead up to the hearse he said in conversation with the young ladies of the castle  i endeavoured to assume the languid and preoccupied air of the guest who in ghoststories has had a bad night with the family spectre  i drew the conversation to the topic of apparitions and even to warnings of death  i knew that every family worthy of the name has its omen the oxenhams a white bird another house a brass band whose airy music is poured forth by invisible performers and so on  of course i expected some one to cry oh weve got a hearse with white horses for that is the kind of heirloom an ancient house regards with complacent pride  but nobody offered any remarks on the local omen and even when i drew near the topic of hearses one of the girls my cousin merely quoted speak not like a deathshead good doll my name is adolphus and asked me to play at lawntennis  in the evening in the smokingroom it was no better nobody had ever heard of an omen in this particular castle  nay when i told my story for it came to that at last they only laughed at me and said i must have dreamed it  of course i expected to be wakened in the night by some awful apparition but nothing disturbed me  i never slept better and hearses were the last things i thought of during the remainder of my visit  months passed and i had almost forgotten the vision or dream for i began to feel apprehensive that after all it was a dream  so costly and elaborate an apparition as a hearse with white horses and plumes complete could never have been got up regardless of expense for one occasion only and to frighten one undergraduate yet it was certain that the hearse was not the old family coach  my entertainers had undeniably never heard of it in their lives before  even tradition at the castle said nothing of a spectral hearse though the house was credited with a white lady deprived of her hands and a luminous boy  here the bachelor of arts paused and a shower of chaff began  is that really all asked the girton girl  why this is the third ghoststory tonight without any ghost in it  i dont remember saying that it was a ghoststory replied the bachelor of arts but i thought a little anecdote of a mere warning might not be unwelcome  but where does the warning come in asked the schoolboy  thats just what i was arriving at replied the narrator when i was interrupted with as little ceremony as if i had been mr gladstone in the middle of a most important speech  i was going to say that in the easter vacation after my visit to the castle i went over to paris with a friend a fellow of my college  we drove to the hotel dalsace i believe there is no hotel of that name if there is i beg the spirited proprietors pardon and assure him that nothing personal is intended we marched upstairs with our bags and baggage and jolly high stairs they were  when we had removed the soil of travel from our persons my friend called out to me i say jones why shouldnt we go down by the lift 256  all right said i and my friend walked to the door of the mechanical apparatus opened it and got in  i followed him when the porter whose business it is to personally conduct the inmates of the hotel entered also and was closing the door  his eyes met mine and i knew him in a moment  i had seen him once before  his sallow face black closely shaven chin furtive glance and military bearing were the face and the glance and bearing of the driver of that awful hearse  in a momentmore swiftly than i can tell youi pushed past the man threw open the door and just managed by a violent effort to drag my friend on to the landing  then the lift rose with a sudden impulse fell again and rushed with frightful velocity to the basement of the hotel whence we heard an appalling crash followed by groans  we rushed downstairs and the horrible spectacle of destruction that met our eyes i shall never forget  the unhappy porter was expiring in agony but the warning had saved my life and my friends  i was that friend said ithe collector of these anecdotes and so far i can testify to the truth of joness story  at this moment however the gong for dressing sounded and we went to our several apartments after this emotional specimen of evenings at home     in castle perilous   what we suffer from most said the spectre when i had partly recovered from my fright is a kind of aphasia  the spectre was sitting on the armchair beside my bed in the haunted room of castle perilous  i dont know said i as distinctly as the chattering of my teeth would permit that i quite follow you  would you mindexcuse mehanding me that flask which lies on the table near you     thanks  the spectre without stirring so arranged the a priori sensuous schemata of time and space 261 that the silver flask which had been well out of my reach was in my hand  i poured half the contents into a cup and offered it to him  no spirits he said curtly  i swallowed eagerly the heady liquor and felt a little more like myself  you were complaining i remarked of something like aphasia  i was he replied  you know what aphasia is in the human subject  a paralysis of certain nervous centres which prevents the patient though perfectly sane from getting at the words which he intends to use and forces others upon him  he may wish to observe that it is a fine morning and may discover that his idea has taken the form of an observation about the roman calendar under the emperor justinian  that is aphasia and we suffer from what i presume is a spiritual modification of that disorder  yet tonight i responded you are speaking like a printed book  tonight said the spectre acknowledging the compliment with a bow the conditions are peculiarly favourable  not to me i thought with a sigh  and i am able to manifest myself with unusual clearness  then you are not always in such form as i am privileged to find you in i inquired  by no means replied the spectre  sometimes i cannot appear worth a cent  often i am invisible to the naked eye and even quite indiscernible by any of the senses  sometimes i can only rap on the table or send a cold wind over a visitors face or at most pull off his bedclothes like the spirit which appeared to caligula and is mentioned by suetonius and utter hollow groans  thats exactly what you did i said when you wakened me  i thought i should have died  i cant say how distressed i am answered the spectre  it is just an instance of what i was trying to explain  we dont know how we are going to manifest ourselves  dont apologize i replied for a constitutional peculiarity  to what do you attribute your success to night  partly to your extremely receptive condition partly to the whisky you took in the smokingroom but chiefly to the magnetic environment  then you do not suffer at all from aphasia just now  not a touch of it at this moment thank you but as a rule we all do suffer horribly  this accounts for everything that you embodied spirits find remarkable and enigmatic in our conduct  we mean something straight enough but our failure is in expression  just think how often you go wrong yourselves though your spirits have a brain to play on like the musician with a piano  now we have to do as well as we can without any such mechanical advantage as a brain of cellular tissuehere he suddenly took the form of a white lady with a black sack over her head and disappeared in the wainscot  excuse me he said a moment afterwards quite in his ordinary voice i had a touch of it i fancy  i lost the thread of my argument and am dimly conscious of having expressed myself in some unusual and more or less incoherent fashion  i hope it was nothing at all vulgar or distressing  nothing out of the way in haunted houses i assure you i replied merely a white lady with a black sack over her head  oh that was it he answered with a sigh i often am afflicted in that way  dont mind me if i turn into a luminous boy or a very old man in chains or a lady in a green gown and highheeled shoes or a headless horseman or a mauth hound or anything of that sort  they are all quite imperfect expressions of our naturesymptoms in short of the malady i mentioned  then the appalling manifestations to which you allude are not the apparitions of the essential ghost  it is not in those forms that he appears among his friends  certainly not said the spectre and it would be very promotive of good feeling between men and disembodied spirits if this were more generally known  i myself  here he was interrupted by an attack of spirit rappings  a brisk series of sharp faint taps of a kind i never heard before resounded from all the furniture of the room 265  while the disturbance continued the spectre drummed nervously with his fingers on his knee  the sounds ended as suddenly as they had begun and he expressed his regrets  it is a thing i am subject to he remarked nervous i believe but to persons unaccustomed to it alarming  it is rather alarming i admitted  a mere fit of sneezing he went on but you are now able to judge from the events of tonight how extremely hard it is for us with the best intentions to communicate coherently with the embodied world  why there is the puddifant ghostin lord puddifants family you know he has been trying for generations to inform his descendants that the drainage of the castle is execrable  yet he can never come nearer what he means than taking the form of a shadowy hearseandfour and driving round and round castle puddifant at midnight  and old lady wadhams ghost what a sufferer that woman is  she merely desires to remark that the family diamonds lost many years ago were never really taken abroad by the valet and sold  he only had time to conceal them in a secret drawer behind the diningroom chimneypiece  now she can get no nearer expressing herself than producing a spirited imitation of the music of the bagpipes which wails up and down the house and frightens the present sir robert wadham and his people nearly out of their wits  and thats the way with almost all of us there is literally no connection as a rule between our expressions and the things we intend to express you know how the psychical society make quite a study of rappings and try to interpret them by the alphabet  well these as i told you are merely a nervous symptom annoying no doubt but not dangerous  the only spectres almost that manage to hint what they really mean are banshees  they intend to herald an approaching death i asked  they do and abominably bad taste i call it unless a man has neglected to insure his life and then i doubt if a person of honour could make use of information fromfrom that quarter  banshees are chiefly the spectres of attached and anxious old family nurses women of the lower orders and completely destitute of tact  i call a banshee rather a curse than a boon and a blessing to men  like most old family servants they are apt to be presuming  it occurred to me that the complacent spectre himself was not an unmixed delight to the inhabitants of castle perilous or at least to their guests for they never lay in the green chamber themselves  can nothing be done i asked sympathetically to alleviate the disorders which you say are so common and distressing  the old system of spiritual physic replied the spectre is obsolete and the holywater cure in particular has almost ceased to number any advocates except the rev dr f g lee whose books said this candid apparition appear to me to indicate superstitious credulity  no i dont know that any new discoveries have been made in this branch of therapeutics  in the last generation they tried to bolt me with a bishop like putting a ferret into a rabbitwarren you know  nothing came of that and lately the psychical society attempted to ascertain my weight by an ingenious mechanism  but they prescribed nothing and made me feel so nervous that i was rapping at large and knocking furniture about for months  the fact is that nobody understands the complaint nor can detect the cause that makes the ghost of a man who was perfectly rational in life behave like an uneducated buffoon afterwards the real reason as i have tried to explain to you is a solution of continuity between subjective thought and will on the side of the spectre and objective expression of themconfound it  here he vanished and the sound of heavy feet was heard promenading the room and balls of incandescent light floated about irresolutely accompanied by the appearance of a bearded man in armour  the door which i had locked and bolted before going to bed kept opening and shutting rapidly so as to cause a draught and my dog fled under the bed with a long low howl  i do hope remarked the spectre presently reappearing that these interruptions only fresh illustrations of our malady have not frightened your dog into a fit  i have known very valuable and attached dogs expire of mere unreasoning terror on similar unfortunate occasions  im sure i dont wonder at it i replied but i believe bingo is still alive in fact i hear him scratching himself  would you like to examine him asked the spectre  oh thanks i am sure he is all right i answered for nothing in the world would have induced me to get out of bed while he was in the room do you object to a cigarette  not at all not at all but lady perilous i assure you is a very old fashioned chatelaine  however if you choose to risk it  i found my cigarettecase in my hand opened it and selected one of its contents which i placed between my lips  as i was looking round for a matchbox the spectre courteously put his forefinger to the end of the cigarette which lighted at once  perhaps you wonder he remarked why i remain at castle perilous the very one of all my places which i never could bear while i was aliveas you call it  i had a delicacy about asking i answered  well he continued i am the family genius  i might have guessed that i said  he bowed and went on  it is hereditary in our house and i hold the position of genius till i am relieved  for example when the family want to dig up the buried treasure under the old bridge i thunder and lighten and cause such a storm that they desist  why on earth do you do that i asked  it seems hardly worth while to have a genius at all  in the interests of the family morality  the money would soon go on the turf and on dice drink etc if they excavated it and then i work the curse and bring off the prophecies and so forth  what prophecies  oh the rigmarole the old family seer came out with before they burned him for an unpalatable prediction at the time of the 15  he was very much vexed about it of course and he just prophesied any nonsense of a disagreeable nature that came into his head  you know what these crofter fellows areungrateful vindictive rascals  he had been in receipt of outdoor relief for years  well he prophesied stuff like this when the owl and the eagle meet on the same blasted rowan tree then a lassie in a white hood from the east shall make the burn of crosscleugh run full red and drivel of that insane kind  well you cant think what trouble that particular prophecy gave me  it had to be fulfilled of course for the family credit and i brought it off as near as i flatter myself it could be done  lady perilous was telling me about it last night i said with a shudder  it was a horrible affair  yes no doubt no doubt a cruel business  but how i am to manage some of them im sure i dont know  theres one of them in rhyme  let me see how does it go     when mackenzie lies in the perilous ha    the wild red cock on the roof shall craw    and the lady shall flee ere the day shall daw    and the land shall girn in the deed mans thraw  the crowing of the wild red cock means that the castle shall be burned down of course im beginning to know his style by this time and the lady is to elope and the lairdthats lord perilousis to expire in the deed mans thraw that is the name the old people give the secret room  and all this is to happen when a mackenzie a member of a clan with which we are at feud sleeps in the haunted chamberwhere we are just now  by the way what is your name  i dont know what made me reply allan mackenzie  it was true but it was not politic  by jove said the spectre eagerly  heres a chance  i dont suppose a mackenzie has slept here for those hundred years  and now how is it to be done  setting fire to the castle is simplehere i remembered how he had lighted my cigarettebut who on earth is to elope with lady perilous  shes fifty if shes a day and evangelical a tout casser  oh no the thing is out of the question  it really must be put off for another generation or two  there is no hurry  i felt a good deal relieved  he was clearly a being of extraordinary powers and might for anything i knew have made me run away with lady perilous  and then when the pangs of remorse began to tell on her ladyship never a very lively woman at the best of timeshowever the spectre seemed to have thought better of it  dont you think it is rather hard on a family i asked to have a family genius and prophecies and a curse and  and everything handsome about them he interrupted me by exclaiming and you call yourself a mackenzie of megasky  what has become of family pride  why you yourselves have gruagach of the red hand in the hall and he i can tell you is a very different sort of spectre from me prechristian you knowone of the oldest ghosts in rossshire  but as to hard on a family why noblesse oblige  considering that you are the family genius you dont seem to have brought them much luck i put in for the house of perilous is neither rich in gold nor very distinguished in history  yes but just think what they would have been without a family genius if they are what they are with one  besides the prophecies are really responsible he added with the air of one who says i have a partnermr jorkins  do you mind telling me one thing i asked eagerly  what is the mystery of the secret chamberi mean the room whither the heir is taken when he comes of age and he never smiles again nor touches a card except at baccarat  never smiles again said the spectre  doesnt he  are you quite certain that he ever smiled before  this was a new way of looking at the question and rather disconcerted me  i did not know the master of perilous before he came of age said i but i have been here for a week and watched him and lord perilous and i never observed a smile wander over their lips  and yet little tompkins he was the chief social buffoon of the hour has been in great force and i may say that i myself have occasionally provoked a grin from the goodnatured  thats just it said the spectre  the perilouses have no sense of humournever had  i am entirely destitute of it myself  even in scotland even here this family failing has been remarkedbeen the subject i may say of unfavourable comment  the perilous of the period lost his head because he did not see the point of a conundrum of macbeths  we felt some time in the fifteenth century that this peculiarity needed to be honourably accounted for and the family developed that story of the secret chamber and the horror in the house there is nothing in the chamber whateverneither a family idiot aged three hundred years nor a skeleton nor the devil nor a wizard nor missing titledeeds  the affair is a mere formality to account creditably for the fact that we never see anything to laugh atnever see the joke  some people cant see ghosts you know lucky people thought i and some cant see jokes  this is very disappointing i said  i cant help it said the spectre the truth often is  did you ever hear the explanation of the haunted house in berkeley square  yes said i  the bell was heard to ring thrice with terrific vehemence and on rushing to the fatal scene they found him beautiful in death  fudge replied the spectre  the lease and furniture were left to an old lady who was not to underlet the house nor sell the things  she had a house of her own in albemarle street which she preferred and so the house in berkeley square was never let till the lease expired  thats the whole affair  the house was empty and political economists could conceive no reason for the waste of rent except that it was haunted  the rest was all miss broughtons imagination in tales for christmas eve  he had evidently got on his hobby and was beginning to be rather tedious  the contempt which a genuine old family ghost has for mere parvenus and impostors is not to be expressed in mere words apparently for mauthhounds of prodigious size and blackness with white birds and other disastrous omens now began to display themselves profusely in the haunted chamber  accustomed as i had become to regard all these appearances as mere automatic symptoms i confess that i heard with pleasure the crow of a distant cock  you have enabled me to pass a most instructive evening most agreeable too i am sure i remarked to the spectre but you will pardon me for observing that the first cock has gone  dont let me make you too late for any appointment you may have about this timeanywhere  oh you still believe in that old superstition about cockcrow do you he sneered  i thought you had been too well educated  it faded on the crowing of the cock did it indeed and that in denmark tooalmost within the arctic circle  why in those high latitudes and in summer a ghost would not have an hour to himself on these principles  dont you remember the cock lord dufferin took north with him which crowed at sunrise and ended by crowing without intermission and going mad when the sun did not set at all  you must observe that any rule of that sort about cockcrow would lead to shocking irregularities and to an early closing movement for spectres in summer which would be ruinous to businesssimply ruinousand in these days of competition intolerable  this was awful for i could see no way of getting rid of him  he might stay to breakfast or anything  by the way he asked who does the cock at the lyceum just now  it is a small but very exacting partact i scene i  cock crows  i believe mr irving has engaged a real fowl to crow at the right moment behind the scenes i said  he is always very particular about these details  quite right too  the cock by kind permission of the aylesbury dairy company is on the bills  they have no cock at the francais mounet sully would not hear of it  i knew nothing about it but if this detestable spectre was going to launch out concerning art and the drama there would be no sleep for me  then the glowworm he saidhave they a real glowworm for the ghosts business act i scene 5 when he says           fare thee well at once    the glowworm shows the matin to be near    and gins to pale his ineffectual fire  did it ever strike you how inconsistent that is  clearly the ghost appeared in winter dont you remember how they keep complaining of the weather     for this relief much thanks tis bitter cold  and     the air bites shrewdly it is very cold  horatio blows on his hands to warm them at the francais i interrupted  quite right good business said he and yet they go on about the glow worms in the neighbourhood  most incongruous  how does furnivall take it  an interpolation by middleton  i dont like to be rude but i admit that i hate being bothered about shakespeare and i yawned  good night he said snappishly and was gone  presently i heard him again just as i was dropping into a doze  you wont think in the morning that this was all a dream will you can i do anything to impress it on your memory  suppose i shrivel your left wrist with a touch of my hand  or shall i leave a sable score of fingers four burned on the table  something of that sort is usually done  oh pray dont take the trouble i said  im sure lady perilous would not like to have the table injured and she might not altogether believe my explanation  as for myself ill be content with your word for it that you were really here  can i bury your bones for you or anything  very well as you must be off good night  no thanks he replied  by the way ive had an idea about my apparitions in disguise  perhaps it is my unconscious self that does them  you have read about the unconscious self in the spectator  then he really went  a nun in grey who moaned and wrung her hands remained in the room for a short time but was obviously quite automatic  i slept till the hot water was brought in the morning     the great gladstone myth 283   in the postchristian myths of the teutonic race settled in england no figure appears more frequently and more mysteriously than that of gladstone or mista gladstone  to unravel the true germinal conception of gladstone and to assign to all the later accretions of myth their provenance and epoch are the problems attempted in this chapter  it is almost needless when we consider the perversity of men and the lasting nature of prejudice to remark that some still see in gladstone a shadowy historical figure  just as our glorious mythical bismarck has been falsely interpreted as the shadowy traditional arminius the arminius of tacitus not of leo adolescens projected on the mists of the brocken so gladstone has been recognized as a human hero of the fourth dynasty in this capacity he has been identified with gordon probably the north wind with spurgeon 284 whom i have elsewhere shown to be a river god and with livingstone  in the last case the identity of the suffix stone and the resemblance of the ideas of joy and of vitality lend some air of speciousness to a fundamental error  livingstone is ohne zweifel a mythical form of the midnight sun now fabled to wander in the dark continent as bishop of natal the land of the suns birthplace now alluded to as lost in the cloudland of comparative mythology  of all these cobwebs spun by the spiders of sciolism the euhemeristic or spencerian viewthat gladstone is an historical personagehas attracted most attention  unluckily for its advocates the whole contemporary documents of the victorian dynasty have perished when an overeducated and overrated populace headed by two mythical figures wat tyler and one jo 285a rose in fury against the school boards and the department they left nothing but tattered fragments of the literature of the time  consequently we are forced to reconstruct the gladstonian myth by the comparative methodthat is by comparing the relics of old ritual treatises hymns imprecations and similar religious texts with works of art altars and statues and with popular traditions and folklore  the results again are examined in the light of the vedas the egyptian monuments and generally of everything that to the unscientific eye seems most turbidly obscure in itself and most hopelessly remote from the subject in hand  the aid of philology will not be rejected because longus or longinus has 285b meanly argued that her services must be accepted with cautious diffidence  on the contrary philology is the only real key to the labyrinths of postchristian myth  the philological analysis of the name of gladstone is attempted with very various results by roth kuhn schwartz and other contemporary descendants of the old scholars  roth finds in glad the scotch word gled a hawk or falcon  he then adduces the examples of the hawkindra from the rig veda and of the hawkheaded osiris both of them indubitably personifications of the sun  on the other hand kuhn with schwartz fixes his attention on the suffix stone and quotes from a fragment attributed to shakespeare the alldreaded thunderstone  schwartz and kuhn conclude in harmony with their general system that gladstone is really and primarily the thunderbolt and secondarily the spirit of the tempest  they quote an isolated line from an early lay about the pilot who weathered the storm which they apply to gladstone in his human or political aspect when the stormspirit had been anthropomorphised and was regarded as an ancestral politician  but such scanty folklore as we possess assures us that the storm on the other hand weathered gladstone and that the poem quoted refers to quite another person also named william and probably identical with william tellthat is with the sun which of course brings us back to roths view of the hawk or solar gladstone though this argument in his own favour has been neglected by the learned mythologist  he might also if he cared adduce the solar stone of delphi fabled to have been swallowed by cronus  kuhn indeed lends an involuntary assent to this conclusion ueber entwick der myth when he asserts that the stone swallowed by cronus was the setting sun  thus we have only to combine our information to see how correct is the view of roth and how much to be preferred to that of schwartz and kuhn gladstone philologically considered is the hawkstone combining with the attributes of the hawkindra and hawkosiris those of the delphian sunstone which we also find in the egyptian ritual for the dead 287 the ludicrous theory that gladstone is a territorial surname derived from some place gledstane falkenstein can only be broached by men ignorant of even the grammar of science dabblers who mark with a pencil the pages of travellers and missionaries  we conclude then that gladstone is primarily the hawksun or sunhawk  from philology we turn to the examination of literary fragments which will necessarily establish our already secured position that gladstone is the sun or so much the worse for the fragments  these have reached us in the shape of burned and torn scraps of paper covered with printed texts which resolve themselves into hymns and imprecations or curses it appears to have been the custom of the worshippers of gladstone to salute his rising at each dawn with printed outcries of adoration and delight resembling in character the osirian hymns  these are sometimes couched in rhythmical language as when we read     gla dstone the pillar of the peoples hopes  to be compared with a very old text referring obscurely to the peoples william and a popular bill doubtless one and the same thing as has often been remarked  among the epithets of gladstone which occur in the hymns we find versatile accomplished philanthropic patriotic statesmanlike subtle eloquent illustrious persuasive brilliant clear unambiguous resolute  all of those are obviously intelligible only when applied to the sun  at the same time we note a fragmentary curse of the greatest importance in which gladstone is declared to be the beloved object of the divine figure from the north or the great white czar  this puzzled the learned till a fragment of a mythological disquisition was recently unearthed  in this text it was stated on the authority of brinton that the great white hare worshipped by the red indians was really when correctly understood the dawn  it is needless to observe when one is addressing students that great white hare in algonkin manibozho becomes great white czar in victorian english  thus the divine figure from the north or white czar with whom gladstone is mythically associated turns out to be the great white hare or dawn hero of the algonkins  the sun gladstone may naturally and reasonably be spoken of in mythical language as the friend of the dawn  this proverbial expression came to be misunderstood and we hear of a liberal statesman gladstone and of his affection for a russian despot  the case is analogous to apollos fabled love for daphne  dahana the dawn  while fragments of laudatory hymns are common enough it must not be forgotten that dirges or curses dirae are also discovered in the excavations  these dirae were put forth both morning and evening and it is interesting to note that the imprecations vented at sunset evening papers in the old mythical language are even more severe and unsparing than those uttered morning papers at dawn  how are the imprecations to be explained  the explanation is not difficult nothing is difficultto a comparative mythologist gladstone is the sun the enemy of darkness  but darkness has her worshippers as well as light  set no less than osiris was adored in the hymns of egypt perhaps by kings of an invading semitic tribe  now there can be no doubt that the enemies of gladstone the rishis or hymn writers who execrated him were regarded by his worshippers as a darkened class foes of enlightenment  they are spoken of as the stupid party as obscurantist and so forth with the usual amenity of theological controversy  it would be painful and is unnecessary to quote from the curses whether matins or vespers of the children of night  their language is terribly severe and doubtless was regarded as blasphemy by the sunworshippers  gladstone is said to have no conscience no sense of honour to be so fugitive and evasive in character that one might almost think the moon rather than the sun was the topic under discussion  but as roth points out this is easily explained when we remember the vicissitudes of english weather and the infrequent appearances of the sun in that climate  by the curses uttered as they were in the morning when night has yielded to the star of day and at evening when day is in turn vanquished by night our theory of the sun gladstone is confirmed beyond reach of cavil indeed the solar theory is no longer a theory but a generally recognized fact  evidence which is bound to be confirmatory reaches us from an altar and from works of art  the one altar of gladstone is by some explained as the pedestal of his statue while the anthropological sciolists regard it simply as a milestone  in speaking to archaeologists it is hardly necessary even to touch on this preposterous fallacy sufficiently confuted by the monument itself  on the road into western england between the old sites of bristol and london excavations recently laid bare the very interesting monument figured here  sketch of monument image1jpg  though some letters or hieroglyphs are defaced there can be no doubt that the inscription is correctly read g o m  the explanation which i have proposed zeitschrift fur ang ant is universally accepted by scholars  i read gladstonio optimo maximo to gladstone best and greatest a form of adoration or adulation which survived in england like municipal institutions the game laws and trial by jury from the date of the roman occupation  it is a plausible conjecture that gladstone stepped into the shoes of jupiter optimus maximus  hence we may regard him like osiris as the sum of the monotheistic conception in england  this interpretation is so manifest that could science sneer we might laugh at the hazardous conjectures of smatterers  they as usual are greatly divided among themselves  the spencerian or euhemeristic schoolif that can be called a school           where blind and naked ignorance    delivers brawling judgments all day long    on all things unashamed  protests that the monument is a pedestal of a lost image of gladstone the inscription g o m is read grand old man and it is actually hinted that this was the petit nom or endearing title of a real historical politician  weak as we may think such reasonings we must regard them as at least less unscholarly than the hypothesis that the inscription should be read     90 m  meaning ninety miles from london  it is true that the site whence the monument was excavated is at a distance of ninety miles from the ruins of london but that is a mere coincidence on which it were childish to insist  scholars know at what rate such accidents should be estimated and value at its proper price one clear interpretation like g o m gladstonio optimo maximo  it is of course no argument against this view that the authors of the dirae regard gladstone as a maleficent being  how could they do otherwise  they were the scribes of the opposed religion  diodorus tells us about an ethiopian sect which detested the sun  a parallel as usual is found in egypt where set or typhon is commonly regarded as a maleficent spirit the enemy of osiris the midnight sun  none the less it is certain that under some dynasties set himself was adoredthe deity of one creed is the satan of its opponents  a curious coincidence seems to show as bergaigne thinks that indra the chief indoaryan deity was occasionally confounded with vrittra who is usually his antagonist  the myths of egypt as reported by plutarch say that set or typhon forced his way out of his mothers side thereby showing his natural malevolence even in the moment of his birth  the myths of the extinct algonkins of the american continent repeat absolutely the same tale about malsumis the brother and foe of their divine hero glooskap  now the rig veda iv 18 13 attributes this act to indra and we may infer that indra had been the typhon or set or glooskap of some aryan kindred before he became the chief and beneficent god of the kusika stock of indoaryans  the evil myth clung to the good god  by a similar process we may readily account for the imprecations and for the many profane and blasphemous legends in which gladstone is represented as oblique mysterious and equivocal  compare apollo loxias  the same class of ideas occurs in the myths about gladstone in opposition as the old mythical language runs that is about the too ardent sun of summer when in opposition he is said to have found himself in a condition of more freedom and less responsibility and to have made it hot for his enemies expressions transparently mythical  if more evidence were wanted it would be found in the myth which represents gladstone as the opponent of huxley  as every philologist knows huxley by grimms law is huskley the hero of a husk myth as ralston styles it a brilliant being enveloped in a husk probably the night or the thundercloud  the dispute between gladstone and huskley as to what occurred at the creation is a repetition of the same dispute between wainamoinen and joukahainen in the kalewala of the finns  released from his husk the opponent becomes beaconsfield  the field of light or radiant sky  in works of art gladstone is represented as armed with an axe  this of course is probably a survival from the effigies of zeus labrandeus den man auf munsen mit der streitaxt erblickt preller i 112  we hear of axes being offered to gladstone by his worshippers  nor was the old custom of clothing the image of the god as in the sixth book of the iliad neglected  we read that the people of a scotch manufacturing town galashiels presented the midlothian gladstone a local hero with trouserings which the hero graciously accepted  indeed he was remarkably unlike death as described by aeschylus of all gods death only recks not of gifts  gladstone on the other hand was the centre of a lavish system of sacrificeloaves of bread axes velocipedes books in vast and overwhelming numbers were all dedicated at his shrine  hence some have identified him with irving also a deity propitiated as we read in josephus hatton by votive offerings  in a later chapter i show that irving is really one of the asvins of vedic mythology the great twin brethren or in mythic language the corsican brothers compare myriantheus on the asvins  his inseparable companion is wilsonbarrett  among animals the cow is sacred to gladstone and in works of art gems and vases or jampots he is represented with the cow at his feet like the mouse of horus of apollo smintheus and of the japanese god of plenty see an ivory in the henley collection  how are we to explain the companionship of the cow  at other times the sunhero sits between the horns of the cowgoddess dilemma worshipped at westminster  compare brugsch religion und mythologie der alten aegypter p 168 die darstellungen zeigen uns den sonnengott zwischen den hornern der kuh sitzend  the idea of le page renouf and of pierret and de rouge is that the cow is a symbol of some gladstonian attribute perhaps squeezability a quality attributed to the hero by certain irish minstrels  i regard it as more probable that the cow is as in the veda the raincloud released from prison by gladstone as by indra  at the same time the cow in the veda stands for heaven earth dawn night cloud rivers thunder sacrifice prayer and soma  we thus have a wide field to choose from nor is our selection of very much importance as any or all of these interpretations will be welcomed by sanskrit scholars  the followers of mclennan have long ago been purged out of the land by the edict of oxford against this sect of mythological heretics they would doubtless have maintained that the cow was gladstones totem or family crest and that like other totemists he was forbidden to eat beef  it is curious that on some old and worn coins we detect a halfobliterated male figure lurking behind the cow  the inscription may be read jo or io and appears to indicate io the cowmaiden of greek myth see the prometheus of aeschylus  another proof of the mythical character of gladstone is the number of his birthplaces  many cities claimed the honour of being his cradle exactly as in the cases of apollo and irving  their claims were allowed by the deity  compare callimachus hymn to apollo  in addressing scholars it is needless to refute the euhemeristic hypothesis worthy of the abbe banier that the cow is a real cow offered by a real historical gladstone or by his companion jo to the ignorant populace of the rural districts  we have already shown that jo is a mythological name  the tendency to identify gladstone with the cow as the dawn with the sun is a natural and edifying tendency but the position must not be accepted without further inquiry  the sungod in egyptian myth is a bull but there is a difference which we must not overlook between a bull and a cow  caution prudence a tranquil balancing of all available evidence and an absence of preconceived opinionsthese are the guiding stars of comparative mythology     my friend the beachcomber   been in some near things in the islands said my friend the beachcomber i fancy i have  the beachcomber then produced a piece of luggage like a small gladstone bag which he habitually carried and thence he extracted a cigar about the size of the butt of a light troutrod  he took a vesuvian out of a curious brown hollowed nutshell mounted in gold the beachcomber like mycenae in homer was polychrysos rich in gold in all his equipments and occupied himself with the task of setting fire to his weed  the process was a long one and reminded me of the arts by which the beach combers native friends fire the root of a tree before they attack it with their stone tomahawks  however there was no use in trying to hurry the ancient mariner  he was bound to talk while his cigar lasted thereby providing his hearer with plenty of what is called copy in the profession of letters  the beachcomber was a big man loose in physique only of course broad and blackbearded his face about the colour of a gunstock  we called him by the nickname he bore 304 he bore it very goodnaturedly because he had spent the years of his youth among the countless little islands of the south seas especially among those which lie at the back of beyond that is on the far side of the broad shoulder of queensland  in these regions the white man takes his life and whatever native property he can annex in his hand caring no more for the aborigines protection society than for the kyrle company for diffusing stampedleather hangings and moorish lustre plates among the poor of the eastend  the common beachcomber is usually an outcast from that civilization of which in the islands he is the only pioneer sometimes he deals in rum sometimes in land most frequently in black birdsthat is in coolies as it is now usual to call slaves  not of course that all coolies are slaves  my friend the beachcomber treated his dusky labourers with distinguished consideration fed them well housed them well taught them the game of cricket and dismissed them when the term of their engagement was up to their island homes  he was in fact a planter with a taste for observing wild life in outofthe way places  yes i have been in some near things he went on when the trunk of his cigar was fairly ignited  do you see these two front teeth  the beachcomber opened wide a cavernous mouth  the late mr macadam who invented the system of making roads called by his name allowed no stone to be laid on the way which the stonebreaker could not put in his mouth  the beachcomber could almost have inserted a milestone  i did not see these two front teeth because like the spanish fleet they were not in sight  but i understood my friend to be drawing my attention to their absence  i see the place where they have been i answered  well that was a near go said the beachcomber  i was running for my life before a pack of screeching naked beggars in the admiralty islands  i had emptied my revolver and my cartridges government ones were all in a parcela confounded government parcelfastened with a strong brass wire  wheres the good of giving you cartridges which you need in a hurry if you need them at all in a case you cant open without a special instrument  well as i ran and the spears whizzed round me i tore at the wire with my teeth  it gave at last or my head would now be decorating a stake outside the chiefs pah  but my teeth gave when the brass cord gave and ill never lift a heavy table with them again  but you got out the cartridges  oh yes  i shot two of the beggars and purwailed on them to stop and then i came within sight of the boats and thompson shouted and the others bolted  what a voice that fellow had  it reminded me of that greek chap i read about at school he went and faced the trojans with nothing in his hand and they hooked it when they only heard him roar poor thompson and the beachcomber drank in silence to the illustrious dead  who shot him  a scientific kind of poop a botanizing shaloot that was travelling around with a tin box on his back collecting beetles and birdskins poor thompson this was how it happened  he was the strongest fellow i ever saw he could tear a whole pack of cards across with his hands  that man was all muscle  he and i had paddled this botanizing creature across to an island where some marooned fellow had built a hut and we kept a little whisky in a bunk and used the place sometimes for shooting or fishing  it was latish one night the botanist had not come home i fell asleep and left thompson with the whisky  i was awakened by hearing a shot and there lay thompson stonedead a bullet in his forehead and the naturalist with a smoking revolver in his hand and trembling like an aspen leaf  it seems he had lost his way and by the time he got home thompson was mad drunk and came for him with his fists  if once he hit you just in play it was death and the stranger knew that  thompson had him in a corner and i am bound to say that shooting was his only chance  poor old thompson  and what was done to the other man  done why there was no one to do anything unless i had shot him or marooned him  no law runs in these parts  thompson was the best partner i ever had he was with me in that lark with the tabooed pig  what lark  oh ive often spun you the yarn  never  well it was like this  thompson and i and some other chaps started in a boat with provisions just prospecting about the islands  so we went in and out among the straitshorrid places clear water full of sharks and nothing but mangroves on every side  one of these sounds is just like another  once i was coming home in a coasting steamer and got them to set me down on a point that i believed was within halfamile of my place  well i was landed and i began walking homewards when i found i was on the wrong track miles and miles of mangrove swamp cut up with a dozen straits of salt water lay between me and the station  the first stretch of water i came to gad  i didnt like it  i kept prospecting for sharks very close before i swam it with my clothes on my head  i was in awful luck all the way thoughnot one of them had a snap at me  but about the taboo pig  revenons a nos cochons  im coming to that  well we landed at an island we had never been on before where there was a village of coast natives  a crowd of beehive shaped huts you know the wall about three feet high and all the rest roof wattle and clay and moss built as neat as a birdsnest outside not very sweet inside  so we landed and got out the grub and marched up to the village  not a soul to be seen not a black in the place  their gear was all cleaned out too there wasnt a net nor a spear nor a mat nor a bowl theyre great beggars for making pipkins not a blessed fetich stone even in the whole place  you never saw anything so forsaken  but just in the middle of the row of huts you might call it a street if you liked there lay as happy as if he was by the fireside among the children in galway a great big fat beast of a hog  well we couldnt make out what had become of the people  thought we had frightened them away only then theyd have taken the hog  suddenly out of some corner comes a black fellow making signs of peace  he held up his hands to show he had no weapon in them and then he held up his feet ditto  why on earth did he hold up his feet  to show he wasnt trailing a spear between his toes that is a common dodge of theirs  we made signs to him to come up and up he came speaking a kind of pigeon english  it seems he was an interpreter by trade paying a visit to his native village so we tried to get out of him what it was all about  just what we might have expected  a kid had been born in the village that day  what had the birth of a kid got to do with it  its like this dont you know  every tribe is divided into coast natives and bush natives  one set lives by the sea and is comparatively what you might call civilized  the other set their cousins live in the bush and are a good deal more savage  now when anything out of the way especially anything of a fortunate kind happens in one division of the tribe the other division pops down on them loots everything it can lay hands on maltreats the women breaks whats too heavy to carry and generally plays the very mischief  the birth of a child is always celebrated in that way  and dont the others resist  resist  no  it would be the height of rudeness  do you resist when people leave cards at your house with kind inquiries  its just like that a way they have of showing a friendly interest  but what can be the origin of such an extraordinary custom  i dont know  guess it has a kind of civilizing effect as youll see  resources of civilization get handed on to the bush tribes but that cant be what it was started for  however recently the tribes have begun to run cunning and they hide themselves and all their goods when they have reason to expect a friendly visit  this was what they had done the day we landed  but while we were jawing with the interpreter we heard a yell to make your hair stand on end  the bush tribe came down on the village all in their war paintwhite clay an arrangement as you say in black and white  down they came rushed into every hut rushed out again found nothing and an awful rage they were in  they said this kind of behaviour was most ungentlemanly why where was decent feeling where was neighbourliness  while they were howling they spotted the hog and made for him in a minute here was luncheon anyhowpork chops  so they soon had a fire set a light to one of the houses in fact and heaped up stones thats how they cook  they cut you up in bits wrap them in leaves  en papillotte  just that and broil you on the hot stones  they cook everything that way  are they cannibals  oh yes in wartime  or criminals theyll eat  ive often heard the queer yell a native will give quite a peculiar cry when he is carrying a present of cold prisoner of war from one chief to another  he cries out like that to show what his errand is at the border of the village property  before entering the mark i said for i had been reading sir henry maine  the pah the beggars about me call it said the beachcomber perhaps some niggers youve been reading about call it the mark  i dont know but to be done with this pig  the fire was ready and they were just going to cut the poor beasts throat with a greenstone knife when the interpreter up and told them hands off  thats a taboo pig says he a black fellow that died six months ago that pig belonged to  when he was dying and leaving his property to his friends he was very sorry to part with the pig so he made him taboo nobody can touch him  to eat him is death  of course this explained why that pig had been left when all the other live stock and portable property was cleared out  nobody would touch a taboo pig and that pig i tell you was tabooed an inch thick  the man he belonged to had been a tohunga and still walked in the shape of a lizard  well the interpreter acting most fairly i must say explained all this to the bush tribe and we went down to the boat and lunched presently a smell of roast pork came drifting down on the wind  they had been hungry and mad after their march and they were cooking the taboo pig  the interpreter grew as white as a kaneka can he knew something would happen  presently the bush fellows came down to the boat licking their lips there hadnt been much more than enough to go round and they accepted some of our grub and took to it kindly  lets offer them some rum says thompson he never cruised without plenty aboard  no no says i tea give them tea  but thompson had a keg of rum out and a tin can and served round some pretty stiff grog now would you believe it these poor devils had never tasted spirits before  most backward race they were  but they took to the stuff and got pretty merry till one of them tried to move back to the village  he staggered up and down and tumbled against rocks and finally he lay flat and held on tight  the others most of them were no better as soon as they tried to move  a rare fright they were in  they began praying and mumbling praying of all things to the soul of the taboo pig  they thought they were being punished for the awful sin they had committed in eating him  the interpreter improved the occasion  he told them their faults pretty roundly  hadnt he warned them  didnt they know the pig was taboo  did any good ever come of breaking a taboo  the soberer fellows sneaked off into the bush the others lay and snoozed till the coast tribe came out of hiding and gave it to them pretty warm with throwing sticks and the flat side of waddies  i guess the belief in taboo wont die out of that bush tribe in a hurry  it was like the companions of odysseus devouring the oxen of the sun i said  very likely replied the beachcomber  never heard of the parties theyre superstitious beggars these kanekas  youve heard of buying a thing for a song  well i got my station for a whistle  they believe that spirits twitter and whistle and youll hardly get them to go out at night even with a boiled potato in their hands which they think good against ghosts for fear of hearing the bogies  so i just went whistling bonny dundee at nights all round the location i fancied and after a week of that not a nigger would go near it  they made it over to me gratis with an address on my courage and fortitude  i gave them some blankets in and thats how real property used to change hands in the pacific     footnotes   1  from wandering sheep the bungletonian missionary record  6  1884  date unknown  month probably june  23a  the original text of this prophecy is printed at the close of mr gowless narrative  23b  it has been suggested to me that some travelled priest or conjurer of this strange race may have met europeans seen hats spectacles steamers and so forth and may have written the prophecy as a warning of the dangers of our civilization  in that case the forgery was very cunningly managed as the document had every appearance of great age and the alarm of the priest was too natural to have been feigned  25  how terribly these words were afterwards to be interpreted the
