tales originally appeared under a different name     a london life     i   it was raining apparently but she didnt mindshe would put on stout shoes and walk over to plash she was restless and so fidgety that it was a pain there were strange voices that frightened herthey threw out the ugliest intimationsin the empty rooms at home she would see old mrs berrington whom she liked because she was so simple and old lady davenant who was staying with her and who was interesting for reasons with which simplicity had nothing to do then she would come back to the childrens teashe liked even better the last halfhour in the schoolroom with the bread and butter the candles and the red fire the little spasms of confidence of miss steet the nurserygoverness and the society of scratch and parson their nicknames would have made you think they were dogs her small magnificent nephews whose flesh was so firm yet so soft and their eyes so charming when they listened to stories plash was the dowerhouse and about a mile and a half through the park from mellows it was not raining after all though it had been there was only a grayness in the air covering all the strong rich green and a pleasant damp earthy smell and the walks were smooth and hard so that the expedition was not arduous  the girl had been in england more than a year but there were some satisfactions she had not got used to yet nor ceased to enjoy and one of these was the accessibility the convenience of the country within the lodgegates or without them it seemed all alike a parkit was all so intensely property the very name of plash which was quaint and old had not lost its effect upon her nor had it become indifferent to her that the place was a dowerhousethe little redwalled ivied asylum to which old mrs berrington had retired when on his fathers death her son came into the estates laura wing thought very ill of the custom of the expropriation of the widow in the evening of her days when honour and abundance should attend her more than ever but her condemnation of this wrong forgot itself when so many of the consequences looked rightbarring a little dampness which was the fate sooner or later of most of her unfavourable judgments of english institutions iniquities in such a country somehow always made pictures and there had been dowerhouses in the novels mainly of fashionable life on which her later childhood was fed the iniquity did not as a general thing prevent these retreats from being occupied by old ladies with wonderful reminiscences and rare voices whose reverses had not deprived them of a great deal of becoming hereditary lace in the park halfway suddenly laura stopped with a paina moral pangthat almost took away her breath she looked at the misty glades and the dear old beeches so familiar they were now and loved as much as if she owned them they seemed in their unlighted december bareness conscious of all the trouble and they made her conscious of all the change a year ago she knew nothing and now she knew almost everything and the worst of her knowledge or at least the worst of the fears she had raised upon it had come to her in that beautiful place where everything was so full of peace and purity of the air of happy submission to immemorial law the place was the same but her eyes were different they had seen such sad bad things in so short a time yes the time was short and everything was strange laura wing was too uneasy even to sigh and as she walked on she lightened her tread almost as if she were going on tiptoe  at plash the house seemed to shine in the wet airthe tone of the mottled red walls and the limited but perfect lawn to be the work of an artists brush lady davenant was in the drawingroom in a low chair by one of the windows reading the second volume of a novel there was the same look of crisp chintz of fresh flowers wherever flowers could be put of a wallpaper that was in the bad taste of years before but had been kept so that no more money should be spent and was almost covered over with amateurish drawings and superior engravings framed in narrow gilt with large margins the room had its bright durable sociable air the air that laura wing liked in so many english thingsthat of being meant for daily life for long periods for uses of high decency but more than ever today was it incongruous that such an habitation with its chintzes and its british poets its wellworn carpets and domestic artthe whole aspect so unmeretricious and sincereshould have to do with lives that were not right of course however it had to do only indirectly and the wrong life was not old mrs berringtons nor yet lady davenants if selina and selinas doings were not an implication of such an interior any more than it was for them an explication this was because she had come from so far off was a foreign element altogether yet it was there she had found her occasion all the influences that had altered her so her sister had a theory that she was metamorphosed that when she was young she seemed born for innocence if not at plash at least at mellows for the two places after all had ever so much in common and there were rooms at the great house that looked remarkably like mrs berringtons parlour  lady davenant always had a headdress of a peculiar style original and appropriatea sort of white veil or cape which came in a point to the place on her forehead where her smooth hair began to show and then covered her shoulders it was always exquisitely fresh and was partly the reason why she struck the girl rather as a fine portrait than as a living person and yet she was full of life old as she was and had been made finer sharper and more delicate by nearly eighty years of it it was the hand of a master that laura seemed to see in her face the witty expression of which shone like a lamp through the groundglass of her good breeding nature was always an artist but not so much of an artist as that infinite knowledge the girl attributed to her and that was why she liked her a little fearfully lady davenant was not as a general thing fond of the young or of invalids but she made an exception as regards youth for the little girl from america the sister of the daughterinlaw of her dearest friend she took an interest in laura partly perhaps to make up for the tepidity with which she regarded selina at all events she had assumed the general responsibility of providing her with a husband she pretended to care equally little for persons suffering from other forms of misfortune but she was capable of finding excuses for them when they had been sufficiently to blame she expected a great deal of attention always wore gloves in the house and never had anything in her hand but a book she neither embroidered nor wroteonly read and talked she had no special conversation for girls but generally addressed them in the same manner that she found effective with her contemporaries laura wing regarded this as an honour but very often she didnt know what the old lady meant and was ashamed to ask her once in a while lady davenant was ashamed to tell mrs berrington had gone to a cottage to see an old woman who was illan old woman who had been in her service for years in the old days unlike her friend she was fond of young people and invalids but she was less interesting to laura except that it was a sort of fascination to wonder how she could have such abysses of placidity she had long cheeks and kind eyes and was devoted to birds somehow she always made laura think secretly of a tablet of fine white soapnothing else was so smooth and clean  and whats going on chez vouswho is there and what are they doing lady davenant asked after the first greetings  there isnt any one but meand the childrenand the governess  what no partyno private theatricals how do you live  oh it doesnt take so much to keep me going said laura i believe there were some people coming on saturday but they have been put off or they cant come selina has gone to london  and what has she gone to london for  oh i dont knowshe has so many things to do  and where is mr berrington  he has been away somewhere but i believe he is coming back tomorrowor next day  or the day after said lady davenant and do they never go away together she continued after a pause  yes sometimesbut they dont come back together  do you mean they quarrel on the way  i dont know what they do lady davenanti dont understand laura wing replied with an unguarded tremor in her voice i dont think they are very happy  then they ought to be ashamed of themselves they have got everything so comfortablewhat more do they want  yes and the children are such dears  certainlycharming and is she a good person the present governess does she look after them properly  yesshe seems very goodits a blessing but i think shes unhappy too  bless us what a house does she want some one to make love to her  no but she wants selina to seeto appreciate said the young girl  and doesnt she appreciatewhen she leaves them that way quite to the young woman  miss steet thinks she doesnt notice how they come onshe is never there  and has she wept and told you so you know they are always crying governesseswhatever line you take you shouldnt draw them out too muchthey are always looking for a chance she ought to be thankful to be let alone you mustnt be too sympatheticits mostly wasted the old lady went on  oh im noti assure you im not said laura wing on the contrary i see so much about me that i dont sympathise with  well you mustnt be an impertinent little american either her interlocutress exclaimed laura sat with her for half an hour and the conversation took a turn through the affairs of plash and through lady davenants own which were visits in prospect and ideas suggested more or less directly by them as well as by the books she had been reading a heterogeneous pile on a table near her all of them new and clean from a circulating library in london the old woman had ideas and laura liked them though they often struck her as very sharp and hard because at mellows she had no diet of that sort there had never been an idea in the house since she came at least and there was wonderfully little reading lady davenant still went from countryhouse to countryhouse all winter as she had done all her life and when laura asked her she told her the places and the people she probably should find at each of them such an enumeration was much less interesting to the girl than it would have been a year before she herself had now seen a great many places and people and the freshness of her curiosity was gone but she still cared for lady davenants descriptions and judgments because they were the thing in her life which when she met the old woman from time to time most represented talkthe rare sort of talk that was not mere chaff that was what she had dreamed of before she came to england but in selinas set the dream had not come true in selinas set people only harried each other from morning till night with extravagant accusationsit was all a kind of horseplay of false charges when lady davenant was accusatory it was within the limits of perfect verisimilitude  laura waited for mrs berrington to come in but she failed to appear so that the girl gathered her waterproof together with an intention of departure but she was secretly reluctant because she had walked over to plash with a vague hope that some soothing hand would be laid upon her pain if there was no comfort at the dowerhouse she knew not where to look for it for there was certainly none at homenot even with miss steet and the children it was not lady davenants leading characteristic that she was comforting and laura had not aspired to be coaxed or coddled into forgetfulness she wanted rather to be taught a certain fortitudehow to live and hold up ones head even while knowing that things were very bad a brazen indifferenceit was not exactly that that she wished to acquire but were there not some sorts of indifference that were philosophic and noble could lady davenant not teach them if she should take the trouble the girl remembered to have heard that there had been years before some disagreeable occurrences in her family it was not a race in which the ladies inveterately turned out well yet who today had the stamp of honour and creditof a past which was either no ones business or was part and parcel of a fair public recordand carried it so much as a matter of course she herself had been a good woman and that was the only thing that told in the long run it was lauras own idea to be a good woman and that this would make it an advantage for lady davenant to show her how not to feel too much as regards feeling enough that was a branch in which she had no need to take lessons  the old woman liked cutting new books a task she never remitted to her maid and while her young visitor sat there she went through the greater part of a volume with the paperknife she didnt proceed very fastthere was a kind of patient awkward fumbling of her aged hands but as she passed her knife into the last leaf she said abruptlyand how is your sister going on shes very light lady davenant added before laura had time to reply  oh lady davenant the girl exclaimed vaguely slowly vexed with herself as soon as she had spoken for having uttered the words as a protest whereas she wished to draw her companion out to correct this impression she threw back her waterproof  have you ever spoken to her the old woman asked  spoken to her  about her behaviour i daresay you haventyou americans have such a lot of false delicacy i daresay selina wouldnt speak to you if you were in her place excuse the supposition and yet she is capable but lady davenant paused preferring not to say of what young mrs berrington was capable its a bad house for a girl  it only gives me a horror said laura pausing in turn  a horror of your sister thats not what one should aim at you ought to get marriedand the sooner the better my dear child i have neglected you dreadfully  i am much obliged to you but if you think marriage looks to me happy the girl exclaimed laughing without hilarity  make it happy for some one else and you will be happy enough yourself you ought to get out of your situation  laura wing was silent a moment though this was not a new reflection to her do you mean that i should leave selina altogether i feel as if i should abandon heras if i should be a coward  oh my dear it isnt the business of little girls to serve as parachutes to flyaway wives thats why if you havent spoken to her you neednt take the trouble at this time of day let her golet her go  let her go laura repeated staring  her companion gave her a sharper glance let her stay then only get out of the house you can come to me you know whenever you like i dont know another girl i would say that to  oh lady davenant laura began again but she only got as far as this in a moment she had covered her face with her handsshe had burst into tears  ah my dear dont cry or i shall take back my invitation it would never do if you were to larmoyer if i have offended you by the way i have spoken of selina i think you are too sensitive we shouldnt feel more for people than they feel for themselves she has no tears im sure  oh she has she has cried the girl sobbing with an odd effect as she put forth this pretension for her sister  then shes worse than i thought i dont mind them so much when they are merry but i hate them when they are sentimental  shes so changedso changed laura wing went on  never never my dear cest de naissance  you never knew my mother returned the girl when i think of mother the words failed her while she sobbed  i daresay she was very nice said lady davenant gently it would take that to account for you such women as selina are always easily enough accounted for i didnt mean it was inheritedfor that sort of thing skips about i daresay there was some improper ancestressexcept that you americans dont seem to have ancestresses  laura gave no sign of having heard these observations she was occupied in brushing away her tears everything is so changedyou dont know she remarked in a moment nothing could have been happiernothing could have been sweeter and now to be so dependentso helplessso poor  have you nothing at all asked lady davenant with simplicity  only enough to pay for my clothes  thats a good deal for a girl you are uncommonly dressy you know  im sorry i seem so thats just the way i dont want to look  you americans cant help it you wear your very features and your eyes look as if they had just been sent home but i confess you are not so smart as selina  yes isnt she splendid laura exclaimed with proud inconsequence and the worse she is the better she looks  oh my child if the bad women looked as bad as they are its only the good ones who can afford that the old lady murmured  it was the last thing i ever thought ofthat i should be ashamed said laura  oh keep your shame till you have more to do with it its like lending your umbrellawhen you have only one  if anything were to happenpubliclyi should die i should die the girl exclaimed passionately and with a motion that carried her to her feet this time she settled herself for departure lady davenants admonition rather frightened than sustained her  the old woman leaned back in her chair looking up at her it would be very bad i daresay but it wouldnt prevent me from taking you in  laura wing returned her look with eyes slightly distended musing think of having to come to that  lady davenant burst out laughing yes yes you must come you are so original  i dont mean that i dont feel your kindness the girl broke out blushing but to be only protectedalways protected is that a life  most women are only too thankful and i am bound to say i think you are difficile lady davenant used a good many french words in the oldfashioned manner and with a pronunciation not perfectly pure when she did so she reminded laura wing of mrs gores novels but you shall be better protected than even by me nous verrons cela only you must stop cryingthis isnt a crying country  no one must have courage here it takes courage to marry for such a reason  any reason is good enough that keeps a woman from being an old maid besides you will like him  he must like me first said the girl with a sad smile  theres the american again it isnt necessary you are too proudyou expect too much  im proud for what i amthats very certain but i dont expect anything laura wing declared thats the only form my pride takes please give my love to mrs berrington i am so sorryso sorry she went on to change the talk from the subject of her marrying she wanted to marry but she wanted also not to want it and above all not to appear to she lingered in the room moving about a little the place was always so pleasant to her that to go awayto return to her own barren homehad the effect of forfeiting a sort of privilege of sanctuary the afternoon had faded but the lamps had been brought in the smell of flowers was in the air and the old house of plash seemed to recognise the hour that suited it best the quiet old lady in the firelight encompassed with the symbolic security of chintz and watercolour gave her a sudden vision of how blessed it would be to jump all the middle dangers of life and have arrived at the end safely sensibly with a cap and gloves and consideration and memories and lady davenant what does she think she asked abruptly stopping short and referring to mrs berrington  think bless your soul she doesnt do that if she did the things she says would be unpardonable  the things she says  thats what makes them so beautifulthat they are not spoiled by preparation you could never think of them for her the girl smiled at this description of the dearest friend of her interlocutress but she wondered a little what lady davenant would say to visitors about her if she should accept a refuge under her roof her speech was after all a flattering proof of confidence she wishes it had been youi happen to know that said the old woman  it had been me  that lionel had taken a fancy to  i wouldnt have married him laura rejoined after a moment  dont say that or you will make me think it wont be easy to help you i shall depend upon you not to refuse anything so good  i dont call him good if he were good his wife would be better  very likely and if you had married him he would be better and thats more to the purpose lionel is as idiotic as a comic song but you have cleverness for two  and you have it for fifty dear lady davenant never neveri shall never marry a man i cant respect laura wing exclaimed  she had come a little nearer her old friend and taken her hand her companion held her a moment and with the other hand pushed aside one of the flaps of the waterproof and what is it your clothing costs you asked lady davenant looking at the dress underneath and not giving any heed to this declaration  i dont exactly know it takes almost everything that is sent me from america but that is dreadfully littleonly a few pounds i am a wonderful manager besides the girl added selina wants one to be dressed  and doesnt she pay any of your bills  why she gives me everythingfood shelter carriages  does she never give you money  i wouldnt take it said the girl they need everything they havetheir life is tremendously expensive  that ill warrant cried the old woman it was a most beautiful property but i dont know what has become of it now ce nest pas pour vous blesser but the hole you americans can make  laura interrupted immediately holding up her head lady davenant had dropped her hand and she had receded a step selina brought lionel a very considerable fortune and every penny of it was paid  yes i know it was mrs berrington told me it was most satisfactory thats not always the case with the fortunes you young ladies are supposed to bring the old lady added smiling  the girl looked over her head a moment why do your men marry for money  why indeed my dear and before your troubles what used your father to give you for your personal expenses  he gave us everything we askedwe had no particular allowance  and i daresay you asked for everything said lady davenant  no doubt we were very dressy as you say  no wonder he went bankruptfor he did didnt he  he had dreadful reverses but he only sacrificed himselfhe protected others  well i know nothing about these things and i only ask pour me renseigner mrs berringtons guest went on and after their reverses your father and mother lived i think only a short time  laura wing had covered herself again with her mantle her eyes were now bent upon the ground and standing there before her companion with her umbrella and her air of momentary submission and selfcontrol she might very well have been a young person in reduced circumstances applying for a place it was short enough but it seemedsome parts of itterribly long and painful my poor fathermy dear father the girl went on but her voice trembled and she checked herself  i feel as if i were crossquestioning you which god forbid said lady davenant but there is one thing i should really like to know did lionel and his wife when you were poor come freely to your assistance  they sent us money repeatedlyit was her money of course it was almost all we had  and if you have been poor and know what poverty is tell me this has it made you afraid to marry a poor man  it seemed to lady davenant that in answer to this her young friend looked at her strangely and then the old woman heard her say something that had not quite the heroic ring she expected i am afraid of so many things today that i dont know where my fears end  i have no patience with the highstrung way you take things but i have to know you know  oh dont try to know any more shamesany more horrors the girl wailed with sudden passion turning away  her companion got up drew her round again and kissed her i think you would fidget me she remarked as she released her then as if this were too cheerless a leavetaking she added in a gayer tone as laura had her hand on the door mind what i tell you my dear let her go it was to this that the girls lesson in philosophy reduced itself she reflected as she walked back to mellows in the rain which had now come on through the darkening park     ii   the children were still at tea and poor miss steet sat between them consoling herself with strong cups crunching melancholy morsels of toast and dropping an absent gaze on her little companions as they exchanged small loud remarks she always sighed when laura came init was her way of expressing appreciation of the visitand she was the one person whom the girl frequently saw who seemed to her more unhappy than herself but laura envied hershe thought her position had more dignity than that of her employers dependent sister miss steet had related her life to the childrens pretty young aunt and this personage knew that though it had had painful elements nothing so disagreeable had ever befallen her or was likely to befall her as the odious possibility of her sisters making a scandal she had two sisters laura knew all about them and one of them was married to a clergyman in staffordshire a very ugly part and had seven children and four hundred a year while the other the eldest was enormously stout and filled it was a good deal of a squeeze a position as matron in an orphanage at liverpool neither of them seemed destined to go into the english divorcecourt and such a circumstance on the part of ones near relations struck laura as in itself almost sufficient to constitute happiness miss steet never lived in a state of nervous anxietyeverything about her was respectable she made the girl almost angry sometimes by her drooping martyrlike air laura was near breaking out at her with dear me what have you got to complain of dont you earn your living like an honest girl and are you obliged to see things going on about you that you hate  but she could not say things like that to her because she had promised selina who made a great point of this that she would never be too familiar with her selina was not without her ideas of decorumvery far from it indeed only she erected them in such queer places she was not familiar with her childrens governess she was not even familiar with the children themselves that was why after all it was impossible to address much of a remonstrance to miss steet when she sat as if she were tied to the stake and the fagots were being lighted if martyrs in this situation had tea and cold meat served them they would strikingly have resembled the provoking young woman in the schoolroom at mellows laura could not have denied that it was natural she should have liked it better if mrs berrington would sometimes just look in and give a sign that she was pleased with her system but poor miss steet only knew by the servants or by laura whether mrs berrington were at home or not she was for the most part not and the governess had a way of silently intimating it was the manner she put her head on one side when she looked at scratch and parsonof course she called them geordie and ferdy that she was immensely handicapped and even that they were perhaps they were though they certainly showed it little in their appearance and manner and laura was at least sure that if selina had been perpetually dropping in miss steet would have taken that discomfort even more tragically the sight of this young womans either real or fancied wrongs did not diminish her conviction that she herself would have found courage to become a governess she would have had to teach very young children for she believed she was too ignorant for higher flights but selina would never have consented to thatshe would have considered it a disgrace or even worsea pose laura had proposed to her six months before that she should dispense with a paid governess and suffer her to take charge of the little boys in that way she should not feel so completely dependentshe should be doing something in return and pray what would happen when you came to dinner who would look after them then mrs berrington had demanded with a very shocked air laura had replied that perhaps it was not absolutely necessary that she should come to dinnershe could dine early with the children and that if her presence in the drawingroom should be required the children had their nurseand what did they have their nurse for selina looked at her as if she was deplorably superficial and told her that they had their nurse to dress them and look after their clothesdid she wish the poor little ducks to go in rags she had her own ideas of thoroughness and when laura hinted that after all at that hour the children were in bed she declared that even when they were asleep she desired the governess to be at handthat was the way a mother felt who really took an interest selina was wonderfully thorough she said something about the evening hours in the quiet schoolroom being the proper time for the governess to get up the childrens lessons for the next day laura wing was conscious of her own ignorance nevertheless she presumed to believe that she could have taught geordie and ferdy the alphabet without anticipatory nocturnal researches she wondered what her sister supposed miss steet taught themwhether she had a cheap theory that they were in latin and algebra  the governesss evening hours in the quiet schoolroom would have suited laura wellso at least she believed by touches of her own she would make the place even prettier than it was already and in the winter nights near the bright fire she would get through a delightful course of reading there was the question of a new piano the old one was pretty badmiss steet had a finger and perhaps she should have to ask selina for thatbut it would be all the schoolroom at mellows was not a charmless place and the girl often wished that she might have spent her own early years in so dear a scene it was a sort of panelled parlour in a wing and looked out on the great cushiony lawns and a part of the terrace where the peacocks used most to spread their tails there were quaint old maps on the wall and collectionsbirds and shellsunder glass cases and there was a wonderful pictured screen which old mrs berrington had made when lionel was young out of primitive woodcuts illustrative of nurserytales the place was a setting for rosy childhood and laura believed her sister never knew how delightful scratch and parson looked there old mrs berrington had known in the case of lionelit had all been arranged for him that was the story told by ever so many other things in the house which betrayed the full perception of a comfortable liberal deeply domestic effect addressed to eternities of possession characteristic thirty years before of the unquestioned and unquestioning old lady whose sofas and corners she had perhaps been the first person in england to have corners demonstrated the most of her cleverness  laura wing envied english children the boys at least and even her own chubby nephews in spite of the cloud that hung over them but she had already noted the incongruity that appeared today between lionel berrington at thirtyfive and the influences that had surrounded his younger years she did not dislike her brotherinlaw though she admired him scantily and she pitied him but she marvelled at the waste involved in some human institutions the english country gentry for instance when she perceived that it had taken so much to produce so little the sweet old wainscoted parlour the view of the garden that reminded her of scenes in shakespeares comedies all that was exquisite in the home of his forefatherswhat visible reference was there to these fine things in poor lionels stablestamped composition when she came in this evening and saw his small sons making competitive noises in their mugs miss steet checked this impropriety on her entrance she asked herself what they would have to show twenty years later for the frame that made them just then a picture would they be wonderfully ripe and noble the perfection of human culture the contrast was before her again the sense of the same curious duplicity in the literal meaning of the word that she had felt at plashthe way the genius of such an old house was all peace and decorum and the spirit that prevailed there outside of the schoolroom was contentious and impure she had often been struck with it beforewith that perfection of machinery which can still at certain times make english life go on of itself with a stately rhythm long after there is corruption within it  she had half a purpose of asking miss steet to dine with her that evening downstairs so absurd did it seem to her that two young women who had so much in common enough at least for that should sit feeding alone at opposite ends of the big empty house melancholy on such a night she would not have cared just now whether selina did think such a course familiar she indulged sometimes in a kind of angry humility placing herself near to those who were laborious and sordid but when she observed how much cold meat the governess had already consumed she felt that it would be a vain form to propose to her another repast she sat down with her and presently in the firelight the two children had placed themselves in position for a story they were dressed like the mariners of england and they smelt of the ablutions to which they had been condemned before tea and the odour of which was but partly overlaid by that of bread and butter scratch wanted an old story and parson a new and they exchanged from side to side a good many powerful arguments while they were so engaged miss steet narrated at her visitors invitation the walk she had taken with them and revealed that she had been thinking for a long time of asking mrs berringtonif she only had an opportunitywhether she should approve of her giving them a few elementary notions of botany but the opportunity had not comeshe had had the idea for a long time past she was rather fond of the study herself she had gone into it a littleshe seemed to intimate that there had been times when she extracted a needed comfort from it laura suggested that botany might be a little dry for such young children in winter from textbooksthat the better way would be perhaps to wait till the spring and show them out of doors in the garden some of the peculiarities of plants to this miss steet rejoined that her idea had been to teach some of the general facts slowlyit would take a long timeand then they would be all ready for the spring she spoke of the spring as if it would not arrive for a terribly long time she had hoped to lay the question before mrs berrington that weekbut was it not already thursday laura said oh yes you had better do anything with the children that will keep them profitably occupied she came very near saying anything that would occupy the governess herself  she had rather a dread of new storiesit took the little boys so long to get initiated and the first steps were so terribly bestrewn with questions receptive silence broken only by an occasional rectification on the part of the listener never descended until after the tale had been told a dozen times the matter was settled for riquet with the tuft but on this occasion the girls heart was not much in the entertainment the children stood on either side of her leaning against her and she had an arm round each their little bodies were thick and strong and their voices had the quality of silver bells their mother had certainly gone too far but there was nevertheless a limit to the tenderness one could feel for the neglected compromised bairns it was difficult to take a sentimental view of themthey would never take such a view of themselves geordie would grow up to be a masterhand at polo and care more for that pastime than for anything in life and ferdy perhaps would develop into the best shot in england laura felt these possibilities stirring within them they were in the things they said to her in the things they said to each other at any rate they would never reflect upon anything in the world they contradicted each other on a question of ancestral history to which their attention apparently had been drawn by their nurse whose people had been tenants for generations their grandfather had had the hounds for fifteen yearsferdy maintained that he had always had them geordie ridiculed this idea like a man of the world he had had them till he went into volunteeringthen he had got up a magnificent regiment he had spent thousands of pounds on it ferdy was of the opinion that this was wasted moneyhe himself intended to have a real regiment to be a colonel in the guards geordie looked as if he thought that a superficial ambition and could see beyond it his own most definite view was that he would have back the hounds he didnt see why papa didnt have themunless it was because he wouldnt take the trouble  i knowits because mamma is an american ferdy announced with confidence  and what has that to do with it asked laura  mamma spends so much moneythere isnt any more for anything  this startling speech elicited an alarmed protest from miss steet she blushed and assured laura that she couldnt imagine where the child could have picked up such an extraordinary idea ill look into ityou may be sure ill look into it she said while laura told ferdy that he must never never never under any circumstances either utter or listen to a word that should be wanting in respect to his mother  if any one should say anything against any of my people i would give him a good one geordie shouted with his hands in his little blue pockets  id hit him in the eye cried ferdy with cheerful inconsequence  perhaps you dont care to come to dinner at halfpast seven the girl said to miss steet but i should be very gladim all alone  thank you so much all alone really murmured the governess  why dont you get married then you wouldnt be alone geordie interposed with ingenuity  children you are really too dreadful this evening miss steet exclaimed  i shant get marriedi want to have the hounds proclaimed geordie who had apparently been much struck with his brothers explanation  i will come down afterwards about halfpast eight if you will allow me said miss steet looking conscious and responsible  very wellperhaps we can have some music we will try something together  oh musicwe dont go in for music said geordie with clear superiority and while he spoke laura saw miss steet get up suddenly looking even less alleviated than usual the door of the room had been pushed open and lionel berrington stood there he had his hat on and a cigar in his mouth and his face was red which was its common condition he took off his hat as he came into the room but he did not stop smoking and he turned a little redder than before there were several ways in which his sisterinlaw often wished he had been very different but she had never disliked him for a certain boyish shyness that was in him which came out in his dealings with almost all women the governess of his children made him uncomfortable and laura had already noticed that he had the same effect upon miss steet he was fond of his children but he saw them hardly more frequently than their mother and they never knew whether he were at home or away indeed his goings and comings were so frequent that laura herself scarcely knew it was an accident that on this occasion his absence had been marked for her selina had had her reasons for wishing not to go up to town while her husband was still at mellows and she cherished the irritating belief that he stayed at home on purpose to watch herto keep her from going away it was her theory that she herself was perpetually at homethat few women were more domestic more glued to the fireside and absorbed in the duties belonging to it and unreasonable as she was she recognised the fact that for her to establish this theory she must make her husband sometimes see her at mellows it was not enough for her to maintain that he would see her if he were sometimes there himself therefore she disliked to be caught in the crude fact of absenceto go away under his nose what she preferred was to take the next train after his own and return an hour or two before him she managed this often with great ability in spite of her not being able to be sure when he would return of late however she had ceased to take so much trouble and laura by no desire of the girls own was enough in the confidence of her impatiences and perversities to know that for her to have wished four days before the moment i write of to put him on a wrong scentor to keep him at least off the right oneshe must have had something more dreadful than usual in her head this was why the girl had been so nervous and why the sense of an impending catastrophe which had lately gathered strength in her mind was at present almost intolerably pressing she knew how little selina could afford to be more dreadful than usual  lionel startled her by turning up in that unexpected way though she could not have told herself when it would have been natural to expect him this attitude at mellows was left to the servants most of them inscrutable and incommunicative and erect in a wisdom that was founded upon telegramsyou couldnt speak to the butler but he pulled one out of his pocket it was a house of telegrams they crossed each other a dozen times an hour coming and going and selina in particular lived in a cloud of them laura had but vague ideas as to what they were all about once in a while when they fell under her eyes she either failed to understand them or judged them to be about horses there were an immense number of horses in one way and another in mrs berringtons life then she had so many friends who were always rushing about like herself and making appointments and putting them off and wanting to know if she were going to certain places or whether she would go if they did or whether she would come up to town and dine and do a theatre there were also a good many theatres in the existence of this busy lady laura remembered how fond their poor father had been of telegraphing but it was never about the theatre at all events she tried to give her sister the benefit or the excuse of heredity selina had her own opinions which were superior to thisshe once remarked to laura that it was idiotic for a woman to writeto telegraph was the only way not to get into trouble if doing so sufficed to keep a lady out of it mrs berringtons life should have flowed like the rivers of eden     iii   laura as soon as her brotherinlaw had been in the room a moment had a particular fear she had seen him twice noticeably under the influence of liquor she had not liked it at all and now there were some of the same signs she was afraid the children would discover them or at any rate miss steet and she felt the importance of not letting him stay in the room she thought it almost a sign that he should have come there at allhe was so rare an apparition he looked at her very hard smiling as if to say no no im notnot if you think it she perceived with relief in a moment that he was not very bad and liquor disposed him apparently to tenderness for he indulged in an interminable kissing of geordie and ferdy during which miss steet turned away delicately looking out of the window the little boys asked him no questions to celebrate his returnthey only announced that they were going to learn botany to which he replied are you really why i never did and looked askance at the governess blushing as if to express the hope that she would let him off from carrying that subject further to laura and to miss steet he was amiably explanatory though his explanations were not quite coherent he had come back an hour beforehe was going to spend the nighthe had driven over from churtonhe was thinking of taking the last train up to town was laura dining at home was any one coming he should enjoy a quiet dinner awfully  certainly im alone said the girl i suppose you know selina is away  oh yesi know where selina is and lionel berrington looked round smiling at every one present including scratch and parson he stopped while he continued to smile and laura wondered what he was so much pleased at she preferred not to askshe was sure it was something that wouldnt give her pleasure but after waiting a moment her brotherinlaw went on selinas in paris my dear thats where selina is  in paris laura repeated  yes in paris my deargod bless her where else do you suppose geordie my boy where should you think your mummy would naturally be  oh i dont know said geordie who had no reply ready that would express affectingly the desolation of the nursery if i were mummy id travel  well now thats your mummys ideashe has gone to travel returned the father were you ever in paris miss steet  miss steet gave a nervous laugh and said no but she had been to boulogne while to her added confusion ferdy announced that he knew where paris wasit was in america no it aintits in scotland cried geordie and laura asked lionel how he knewwhether his wife had written to him  written to me when did she ever write to me no i saw a fellow in town this morning who saw her thereat breakfast yesterday he came over last night thats how i know my wifes in paris you cant have better proof than that  i suppose its a very pleasant season there the governess murmured as if from a sense of duty in a distant discomfortable tone  i daresay its very pleasant indeedi daresay its awfully amusing laughed mr berrington shouldnt you like to run over with me for a few days laurajust to have a go at the theatres i dont see why we should always be moping at home well take miss steet and the children and give mummy a pleasant surprise now who do you suppose she was with in pariswho do you suppose she was seen with  laura had turned pale she looked at him hard imploringly in the eyes there was a name she was terribly afraid he would mention oh sir in that case we had better go and get ready miss steet quavered betwixt a laugh and a groan in a spasm of discretion and before laura knew it she had gathered geordie and ferdy together and swept them out of the room the door closed behind her with a very quick softness and lionel remained a moment staring at it  i say what does she meanaint that damned impertinent he stammered what did she think i was going to say does she suppose i would say any harm beforebefore her dash it does she suppose i would give away my wife to the servants then he added and i wouldnt say any harm before you laura you are too good and too nice and i like you too much  wont you come downstairs wont you have some tea the girl asked uneasily  no no i want to stay herei like this place he replied very gently and reasoningly its a deuced nice placeits an awfully jolly room it used to be this wayalwayswhen i was a little chap i was a rough one my dear i wasnt a pretty little lamb like that pair i think its because you look after themthats what makes em so sweet the one in my timewhat was her name i think it was bald or boldi rather think she found me a handful i used to kick her shinsi was decidedly vicious and do you see its kept so well laura he went on looking round him pon my soul its the prettiest room in the house what does she want to go to paris for when she has got such a charming house now can you answer me that laura  i suppose she has gone to get some clothes her dressmaker lives in paris you know  dressmaker clothes why she has got whole rooms full of them hasnt she got whole rooms full of them  speaking of clothes i must go and change mine said laura i have been out in the raini have been to plashim decidedly damp  oh you have been to plash you have seen my mother i hope shes in very good health but before the girl could reply to this he went on now i want you to guess who shes in paris with motcomb saw them togetherat that place whats his name close to the madeleine and as laura was silent not wishing at all to guess he continuedits the ruin of any woman you know i cant think what she has got in her head still laura said nothing and as he had hold of her arm she having turned away she led him this time out of the room she had a horror of the name the name that was in her mind and that was apparently on his lips though his tone was so singular so contemplative my dear girl shes with lady ringrosewhat do you say to that he exclaimed as they passed along the corridor to the staircase  with lady ringrose  they went over on tuesdaythey are knocking about there alone  i dont know lady ringrose laura said infinitely relieved that the name was not the one she had feared lionel leaned on her arm as they went downstairs  i rather hope noti promise you she has never put her foot in this house if selina expects to bring her here i should like half an hours notice yes half an hour would do she might as well be seen with and lionel berrington checked himself she has had at least fifty and again he stopped short you must pull me up you know if i say anything you dont like  i dont understand youlet me alone please the girl broke out disengaging herself with an effort from his arm she hurried down the rest of the steps and left him there looking after her and as she went she heard him give an irrelevant laugh     iv   she determined not to go to dinnershe wished for that day not to meet him again he would drink morehe would be worseshe didnt know what he might say besides she was too angrynot with him but with selinaand in addition to being angry she was sick she knew who lady ringrose was she knew so many things today that when she was youngerand only a littleshe had not expected ever to know her eyes had been opened very wide in england and certainly they had been opened to lady ringrose she had heard what she had done and perhaps a good deal more and it was not very different from what she had heard of other women she knew selina had been to her house she had an impression that her ladyship had been to selinas in london though she herself had not seen her there but she had not known they were so intimate as thatthat selina would rush over to paris with her what they had gone to paris for was not necessarily criminal there were a hundred reasons familiar to ladies who were fond of change of movement of the theatres and of new bonnets but nevertheless it was the fact of this little excursion quite as much as the companion that excited lauras disgust  she was not ready to say that the companion was any worse though lionel appeared to think so than twenty other women who were her sisters intimates and whom she herself had seen in london in grosvenor place and even under the motherly old beeches at mellows but she thought it unpleasant and base in selina to go abroad that way like a commercial traveller capriciously clandestinely without giving notice when she had left her to understand that she was simply spending three or four days in town it was bad taste and bad form it was cabotin and had the mark of selinas complete irremediable frivolitythe worst accusation laura tried to cling to that opinion that she laid herself open to of course frivolity that was never ashamed of itself was like a neglected coldyou could die of it morally as well as of anything else laura knew this and it was why she was inexpressibly vexed with her sister she hoped she should get a letter from selina the next morning mrs berrington would show at least that remnant of propriety which would give her a chance to despatch her an answer that was already writing itself in her brain it scarcely diminished lauras eagerness for such an opportunity that she had a vision of selinas showing her letter laughing across the table at the place near the madeleine to lady ringrose who would be paintedselina herself to do her justice was not yet while the french waiters in white aprons contemplated ces dames it was new work for our young lady to judge of these shadesthe gradations the probabilities of license and of the side of the line on which or rather how far on the wrong side lady ringrose was situated  a quarter of an hour before dinner lionel sent word to her room that she was to sit down without himhe had a headache and wouldnt appear this was an unexpected grace and it simplified the position for laura so that smoothing her ruffles she betook herself to the table before doing this however she went back to the schoolroom and told miss steet she must contribute her company she took the governess the little boys were in bed downstairs with her and made her sit opposite thinking she would be a safeguard if lionel were to change his mind miss steet was more frightened than herselfshe was a very shrinking bulwark the dinner was dull and the conversation rare the governess ate three olives and looked at the figures on the spoons laura had more than ever her sense of impending calamity a draught of misfortune seemed to blow through the house it chilled her feet under her chair the letter she had in her head went out like a flame in the wind and her only thought now was to telegraph to selina the first thing in the morning in quite different words she scarcely spoke to miss steet and there was very little the governess could say to her she had already related her history so often after dinner she carried her companion into the drawingroom by the arm and they sat down to the piano together they played duets for an hour mechanically violently laura had no idea what the music wasshe only knew that their playing was execrable in spite of thisthats a very nice thing that last she heard a vague voice say behind her at the end and she became aware that her brotherinlaw had joined them again  miss steet was pusillanimousshe retreated on the spot though lionel had already forgotten that he was angry at the scandalous way she had carried off the children from the schoolroom laura would have gone too if lionel had not told her that he had something very particular to say to her that made her want to go more but she had to listen to him when he expressed the hope that she hadnt taken offence at anything he had said before he didnt strike her as tipsy now he had slept it off or got rid of it and she saw no traces of his headache he was still conspicuously cheerful as if he had got some good news and were very much encouraged she knew the news he had got and she might have thought in view of his manner that it could not really have seemed to him so bad as he had pretended to think it it was not the first time however that she had seen him pleased that he had a case against his wife and she was to learn on this occasion how extreme a satisfaction he could take in his wrongs she would not sit down again she only lingered by the fire pretending to warm her feet and he walked to and fro in the long room where the lamplight tonight was limited stepping on certain figures of the carpet as if his triumph were alloyed with hesitation  i never know how to talk to youyou are so beastly clever he said i cant treat you like a little girl in a pinaforeand yet of course you are only a young lady youre so deuced goodthat makes it worse he went on stopping in front of her with his hands in his pockets and the air he himself had of being a goodnatured but dissipated boy with his small stature his smooth fat suffused face his round watery lightcoloured eyes and his hair growing in curious infantile rings he had lost one of his front teeth and always wore a stiff white scarf with a pin representing some symbol of the turf or the chase i dont see why she couldnt have been a little more like you if i could have had a shot at you first  i dont care for any compliments at my sisters expense laura said with some majesty  oh i say laura dont put on so many frills as selina says you know what your sister is as well as i do they stood looking at each other a moment and he appeared to see something in her face which led him to addyou know at any rate how little we hit it off  i know you dont love each otherits too dreadful  love each other she hates me as shed hate a hump on her back shed do me any devilish turn she could there isnt a feeling of loathing that she doesnt have for me shed like to stamp on me and hear me crack like a black beetle and she never opens her mouth but she insults me lionel berrington delivered himself of these assertions without violence without passion or the sting of a new discovery there was a familiar gaiety in his trivial little tone and he had the air of being so sure of what he said that he did not need to exaggerate in order to prove enough  oh lionel the girl murmured turning pale is that the particular thing you wished to say to me  and you cant say its my faultyou wont pretend to do that will you he went on aint i quiet aint i kind dont i go steady havent i given her every blessed thing she has ever asked for  you havent given her an example laura replied with spirit you dont care for anything in the wide world but to amuse yourself from the beginning of the year to the end no more does sheand perhaps its even worse in a woman you are both as selfish as you can live with nothing in your head or your heart but your vulgar pleasure incapable of a concession incapable of a sacrifice she at least spoke with passion something that had been pent up in her soul broke out and it gave her relief almost a momentary joy  it made lionel berrington stare he coloured but after a moment he threw back his head with laughter dont you call me kind when i stand here and take all that if im so keen for my pleasure what pleasure do you give me look at the way i take it laura you ought to do me justice havent i sacrificed my home and what more can a man do  i dont think you care any more for your home than selina does and its so sacred and so beautiful god forgive you you are all blind and senseless and heartless and i dont know what poison is in your veins there is a curse on you and there will be a judgment the girl went on glowing like a young prophetess  what do you want me to do do you want me to stay at home and read the bible her companion demanded with an effect of profanity confronted with her deep seriousness  it wouldnt do you any harm once in a while  there will be a judgment on herthats very sure and i know where it will be delivered said lionel berrington indulging in a visible approach to a wink have i done the half to her she has done to me i wont say the half but the hundredth part answer me truly my dear  i dont know what she has done to you said laura impatiently  thats exactly what i want to tell you but its difficult ill bet you five pounds shes doing it now  you are too unable to make yourself respected the girl remarked not shrinking now from the enjoyment of an advantagethat of feeling herself superior and taking her opportunity  her brotherinlaw seemed to feel for the moment the prick of this observation what has such a piece of nasty boldness as that to do with respect shes the first that ever defied me exclaimed the young man whose aspect somehow scarcely confirmed this pretension you know all about herdont make believe you dont he continued in another tone you see everythingyoure one of the sharp ones theres no use beating about the bush laurayouve lived in this precious house and youre not so green as that comes to besides youre so good yourself that you neednt give a shriek if one is obliged to say what one means why didnt you grow up a little sooner then over there in new york it would certainly have been you i would have made up to you would have respected meeh now dont say you wouldnt he rambled on turning about the room again partly like a person whose sequences were naturally slow but also a little as if though he knew what he had in mind there were still a scruple attached to it that he was trying to rub off  i take it that isnt what i must sit up to listen to lionel is it laura said wearily  why you dont want to go to bed at nine oclock do you thats all rot of course but i want you to help me  to help youhow  ill tell youbut you must give me my head i dont know what i said to you before dinneri had had too many brandy and sodas perhaps i was too free if i was i beg your pardon i made the governess boltvery proper in the superintendent of ones children do you suppose they saw anything i shouldnt care for that i did take half a dozen or so i was thirsty and i was awfully gratified  you have little enough to gratify you  now thats just where you are wrong i dont know when ive fancied anything so much as what i told you  what you told me  about her being in paris i hope shell stay a month  i dont understand you laura said  are you very sure laura my dear it suits my book now you know yourself hes not the first  laura was silent his round eyes were fixed on her face and she saw something she had not seen beforea little shining point which on lionels part might represent an idea but which made his expression conscious as well as eager he she presently asked whom are you speaking of  why of charley crispin g and lionel berrington accompanied this name with a startling imprecation  what has he to do  he has everything to do isnt he with her there  how should i know you said lady ringrose  lady ringrose is a mere blindand a devilish poor one at that im sorry to have to say it to you but hes her lover i mean selinas and he aint the first  there was another short silence while they stood opposed and then laura askedand the question was unexpectedwhy do you call him charley  doesnt he call me lion like all the rest said her brotherinlaw staring  youre the most extraordinary people i suppose you have a certain amount of proof before you say such things to me  proof ive oceans of proof and not only about crispin but about deepmere  and pray who is deepmere  did you never hear of lord deepmere he has gone to india that was before you came i dont say all this for my pleasure laura mr berrington added  dont you indeed asked the girl with a singular laugh i thought you were so glad  im glad to know it but im not glad to tell it when i say im glad to know it i mean im glad to be fixed at last oh ive got the tip its all open country now and i know just how to go ive gone into it most extensively theres nothing you cant find out todayif you go to the right place iveive he hesitated a moment then went on well its no matter what ive done i know where i am and its a great comfort shes up a tree if ever a woman was now well see whos a beetle and whos a toad lionel berrington concluded gaily with some incongruity of metaphor  its not trueits not trueits not true laura said slowly  thats just what shell saythough thats not the way shell say it oh if she could get off by your saying it for herfor you my dear would be believed  get offwhat do you mean the girl demanded with a coldness she failed to feel for she was tingling all over with shame and rage  why what do you suppose im talking about im going to haul her up and to have it out  youre going to make a scandal  make it bless my soul it isnt me and i should think it was made enough im going to appeal to the laws of my countrythats what im going to do she pretends im stopped whatever she does but thats all gammoni aint  i understandbut you wont do anything so horrible said laura very gently  horrible as you please but less so than going on in this way i havent told you the fiftieth partyou will easily understand that i cant they are not nice things to say to a girl like youespecially about deepmere if you didnt know it but when they happen youve got to look at them havent you thats the way i look at it  its not trueits not trueits not true laura wing repeated in the same way slowly shaking her head  of course you stand up for your sisterbut thats just what i wanted to say to you that you ought to have some pity for me and some sense of justice havent i always been nice to you have you ever had so much as a nasty word from me  this appeal touched the girl she had eaten her brotherinlaws bread for months she had had the use of all the luxuries with which he was surrounded and to herself personally she had never known him anything but goodnatured she made no direct response however she only saidbe quiet be quiet and leave her to me i will answer for her  answer for herwhat do you mean  she shall be bettershe shall be reasonablethere shall be no more talk of these horrors leave her to melet me go away with her somewhere  go away with her i wouldnt let you come within a mile of her if you were my sister  oh shame shame cried laura wing turning away from him  she hurried to the door of the room but he stopped her before she reached it he got his back to it he barred her way and she had to stand there and hear him i havent said what i wantedfor i told you that i wanted you to help me i aint crueli aint insultingyou cant make out that against me im sure you know in your heart that ive swallowed what would sicken most men therefore i will say that you ought to be fair youre too clever not to be you cant pretend to swallow he paused a moment and went on and she saw it was his ideaan idea very simple and bold he wanted her to side with himto watch for himto help him to get his divorce he forbore to say that she owed him as much for the hospitality and protection she had in her poverty enjoyed but she was sure that was in his heart of course shes your sister but when ones sisters a perfect bad un theres no law to force one to jump into the mud to save her it is mud my dear and mud up to your neck you had much better think of her childrenyou had much better stop in my boat  do you ask me to help you with evidence against her the girl murmured she had stood there passive waiting while he talked covering her face with her hands which she parted a little looking at him  he hesitated a moment i ask you not to deny what you have seenwhat you feel to be true  then of the abominations of which you say you have proof you havent proof  why havent i proof  if you want me to come forward  i shall go into court with a strong case you may do what you like but i give you notice and i expect you not to forget that i have given it dont forgetbecause youll be askedthat i have told you tonight where she is and with whom she is and what measures i intend to take  be askedbe asked the girl repeated  why of course youll be crossexamined  oh mother mother cried laura wing her hands were over her face again and as lionel berrington opening the door let her pass she burst into tears he looked after her distressed compunctious halfashamed and he exclaimed to himselfthe bloody brute the bloody brute but the words had reference to his wife     v   and are you telling me the perfect truth when you say that captain crispin was not there  the perfect truth mrs berrington straightened herself to her height threw back her head and measured her interlocutress up and down it is to be surmised that this was one of the many ways in which she knew she looked very handsome indeed her interlocutress was her sister and even in a discussion with a person long since initiated she was not incapable of feeling that her beauty was a new advantage on this occasion she had at first the air of depending upon it mainly to produce an effect upon laura then after an instants reflection she determined to arrive at her result in another way she exchanged her expression of scorn of resentment at her veracitys being impugned for a look of gentle amusement she smiled patiently as if she remembered that of course laura couldnt understand of what an impertinence she had been guilty there was a quickness of perception and lightness of hand which to her sense her american sister had never acquired the girls earnest almost barbarous probity blinded her to the importance of certain pleasant little forms my poor child the things you do say one doesnt put a question about the perfect truth in a manner that implies that a person is telling a perfect lie however as its only you i dont mind satisfying your clumsy curiosity i havent the least idea whether captain crispin was there or not i know nothing of his movements and he doesnt keep me informedwhy should he poor manof his whereabouts he was not there for meisnt that all that need interest you as far as i was concerned he might have been at the north pole i neither saw him nor heard of him i didnt see the end of his nose selina continued still with her wiser tolerant brightness looking straight into her sisters eyes her own were clear and lovely and she was but little less handsome than if she had been proud and freezing laura wondered at her more and more stupefied suspense was now almost the girls constant state of mind  mrs berrington had come back from paris the day before but had not proceeded to mellows the same night though there was more than one train she might have taken neither had she gone to the house in grosvenor place but had spent the night at an hotel her husband was absent again he was supposed to be in grosvenor place so that they had not yet met little as she was a woman to admit that she had been in the wrong she was known to have granted later that at this moment she had made a mistake in not going straight to her own house it had given lionel a degree of advantage made it appear perhaps a little that she had a bad conscience and was afraid to face him but she had had her reasons for putting up at an hotel and she thought it unnecessary to express them very definitely she came home by a morning train the second day and arrived before luncheon of which meal she partook in the company of her sister and in that of miss steet and the children sent for in honour of the occasion after luncheon she let the governess go but kept scratch and parsonkept them on ever so long in the morningroom where she remained longer than she had ever kept them before laura was conscious that she ought to have been pleased at this but there was a perversity even in selinas manner of doing right for she wished immensely now to see her aloneshe had something so serious to say to her selina hugged her children repeatedly encouraging their sallies she laughed extravagantly at the artlessness of their remarks so that at table miss steet was quite abashed by her unusual high spirits laura was unable to question her about captain crispin and lady ringrose while geordie and ferdy were there they would not understand of course but names were always reflected in their limpid little minds and they gave forth the image lateroften in the most extraordinary connections it was as if selina knew what she was waiting for and were determined to make her wait the girl wished her to go to her room that she might follow her there but selina showed no disposition to retire and one could never entertain the idea for her on any occasion that it would be suitable that she should change her dress the dress she worewhatever it waswas too becoming to her and to the moment for that laura noticed how the very folds of her garment told that she had been to paris she had spent only a week there but the mark of her couturière was all over her it was simply to confer with this great artist that from her own account she had crossed the channel the signs of the conference were so conspicuous that it was as if she had said dont you see the proof that it was for nothing but chiffons she walked up and down the room with geordie in her arms in an access of maternal tenderness he was much too big to nestle gracefully in her bosom but that only made her seem younger more flexible fairer in her tall strong slimness her distinguished figure bent itself hither and thither but always in perfect freedom as she romped with her children and there was another moment when she came slowly down the room holding one of them in each hand and singing to them while they looked up at her beauty charmed and listening and a little surprised at such new waysa moment when she might have passed for some grave antique statue of a young matron or even for a picture of saint cecilia this morning more than ever laura was struck with her air of youth the inextinguishable freshness that would have made any one exclaim at her being the mother of such bouncing little boys laura had always admired her thought her the prettiest woman in london the beauty with the finest points and now these points were so vivid especially her finished slenderness and the grace the natural elegance of every turnthe fall of her shoulders had never looked so perfect that the girl almost detested them they appeared to her a kind of advertisement of danger and even of shame  miss steet at last came back for the children and as soon as she had taken them away selina observed that she would go over to plashjust as she was she rang for her hat and jacket and for the carriage laura could see that she would not give her just yet the advantage of a retreat to her room the hat and jacket were quickly brought but after they were put on selina kept her maid in the drawingroom talking to her a long time telling her elaborately what she wished done with the things she had brought from paris before the maid departed the carriage was announced and the servant leaving the door of the room open hovered within earshot laura then losing patience turned out the maid and closed the door she stood before her sister who was prepared for her drive then she asked her abruptly fiercely but colouring with her question whether captain crispin had been in paris we have heard mrs berringtons answer with which her strenuous sister was imperfectly satisfied a fact the perception of which it doubtless was that led selina to break out with a greater show of indignation i never heard of such extraordinary ideas for a girl to have and such extraordinary things for a girl to talk about my dear you have acquired a freedomyou have emancipated yourself from conventionalityand i suppose i must congratulate you laura only stood there with her eyes fixed without answering the sally and selina went on with another change of tone and pray if he was there what is there so monstrous hasnt it happened that he is in london when i am there why is it then so awful that he should be in paris  awful awful too awful murmured laura with intense gravity still looking at herlooking all the more fixedly that she knew how little selina liked it  my dear you do indulge in a style of innuendo for a respectable young woman mrs berrington exclaimed with an angry laugh you have ideas that when i was a girl she paused and her sister saw that she had not the assurance to finish her sentence on that particular note  dont talk about my innuendoes and my ideasyou might remember those in which i have heard you indulge ideas what ideas did i ever have before i came here laura wing asked with a trembling voice dont pretend to be shocked selina thats too cheap a defence you have said things to meif you choose to talk of freedom what is the talk of your house and what does one hear if one lives with you i dont care what i hear now its all odious and theres little choice and my sweet sensibility has gone god knows where and im very glad if you understand that i dont care what i say if one talks about your affairs my dear one mustnt be too particular the girl continued with a flash of passion  mrs berrington buried her face in her hands merciful powers to be insulted to be covered with outrage by ones wretched little sister she moaned  i think you should be thankful there is one human beinghowever wretchedwho cares enough for you to care about the truth in what concerns you laura said selina selinaare you hideously deceiving us  us selina repeated with a singular laugh whom do you mean by us  laura wing hesitated she had asked herself whether it would be best she should let her sister know the dreadful scene she had had with lionel but she had not in her mind settled that point however it was settled now in an instant i dont mean your friendsthose of them that i have seen i dont think they care a strawi have never seen such people but last week lionel spoke to mehe told me he knew it as a certainty  lionel spoke to you said mrs berrington holding up her head with a stare and what is it that he knows  that captain crispin was in paris and that you were with him he believes you went there to meet him  he said this to you  yes and much morei dont know why i should make a secret of it  the disgusting beast selina exclaimed slowly solemnly he enjoys the rightthe legal rightto pour forth his vileness upon me but when he is so lost to every feeling as to begin to talk to you in such a way and mrs berrington paused in the extremity of her reprobation  oh it was not his talk that shocked meit was his believing it the girl replied that i confess made an impression on me  did it indeed im infinitely obliged to you you are a tender loving little sister  yes i am if its tender to have cried about youall these daystill im blind and sick laura replied i hope you are prepared to meet him his mind is quite made up to apply for a divorce  lauras voice almost failed her as she said thisit was the first time that in talking with selina she had uttered that horrible word she had heard it however often enough on the lips of others it had been bandied lightly enough in her presence under those somewhat austere ceilings of mellows of which the admired decorations and mouldings in the taste of the middle of the last century all in delicate plaster and reminding her of wedgewood pottery consisted of slim festoons urns and trophies and knotted ribbons so many symbols of domestic affection and irrevocable union selina herself had flashed it at her with light superiority as if it were some precious jewel kept in reserve which she could convert at any moment into specie so that it would constitute a happy provision for her future the ideaassociated with her own point of viewwas apparently too familiar to mrs berrington to be the cause of her changing colour it struck her indeed as presented by laura in a ludicrous light for her pretty eyes expanded a moment and she smiled pityingly well you are a poor dear innocent after all lionel would be about as able to divorce meeven if i were the most abandoned of my sexas he would be to write a leader in the times  i know nothing about that said laura  so i perceiveas i also perceive that you must have shut your eyes very tight should you like to know a few of the reasonsheaven forbid i should attempt to go over them all there are millionswhy his hands are tied  not in the least  should you like to know that his own life is too base for words and that his impudence in talking about me would be sickening if it werent grotesque selina went on with increasing emotion should you like me to tell you to what he has stoopedto the very gutterand the charming history of his relations with  no i dont want you to tell me anything of the sort laura interrupted especially as you were just now so pained by the license of my own allusions  you listen to him thenbut it suits your purpose not to listen to me  oh selina selina the girl almost shrieked turning away  where have your eyes been or your senses or your powers of observation you can be clever enough when it suits you mrs berrington continued throwing off another ripple of derision and now perhaps as the carriage is waiting you will let me go about my duties  laura turned again and stopped her holding her arm as she passed toward the door will you swearwill you swear by everything that is most sacred  will i swear what and now she thought selina visibly blanched  that you didnt lay eyes on captain crispin in paris  mrs berrington hesitated but only for an instant you are really too odious but as you are pinching me to death i will swear to get away from you i never laid eyes on him  the organs of vision which mrs berrington was ready solemnly to declare that she had not misapplied were as her sister looked into them an abyss of indefinite prettiness the girl had sounded them before without discovering a conscience at the bottom of them and they had never helped any one to find out anything about their possessor except that she was one of the beauties of london even while selina spoke laura had a cold horrible sense of not believing her and at the same time a desire colder still to extract a reiteration of the pledge was it the asseveration of her innocence that she wished her to repeat or only the attestation of her falsity one way or the other it seemed to her that this would settle something and she went on inexorablyby our dear mothers memoryby our poor fathers  by my mothers by my fathers said mrs berrington and by that of any other member of the family you like laura let her go she had not been pinching her as selina described the pressure but had clung to her with insistent hands as she opened the door selina said in a changed voice i suppose its no use to ask you if you care to drive to plash  no thank you i dont carei shall take a walk  i suppose from that that your friend lady davenant has gone  no i think she is still there  thats a bore selina exclaimed as she went off     vi   laura wing hastened to her room to prepare herself for her walk but when she reached it she simply fell on her knees shuddering beside her bed she buried her face in the soft counterpane of wadded silk she remained there a long time with a kind of aversion to lifting it again to the day it burned with horror and there was coolness in the smooth glaze of the silk it seemed to her that she had been concerned in a hideous transaction and her uppermost feeling was strangely enough that she was ashamednot of her sister but of herself she did not believe herthat was at the bottom of everything and she had made her lie she had brought out her perjury she had associated it with the sacred images of the dead she took no walk she remained in her room and quite late towards six oclock she heard on the gravel outside of her windows the wheels of the carriage bringing back mrs berrington she had evidently been elsewhere as well as to plash no doubt she had been to the vicarageshe was capable even of that she could pay dutyvisits like that she called at the vicarage about three times a year and she could go and be nice to her motherinlaw with her fresh lips still fresher for the lie she had just told for it was as definite as an aching nerve to laura that she did not believe her and if she did not believe her the words she had spoken were a lie it was the lie the lie to her and which she had dragged out of her that seemed to the girl the ugliest thing if she had admitted her folly if she had explained attenuated sophisticated there would have been a difference in her favour but now she was bad because she was hard she had a surface of polished metal and she could make plans and calculate she could act and do things for a particular effect she could go straight to old mrs berrington and to the parsons wife and his many daughters just as she had kept the children after luncheon on purpose so long because that looked innocent and domestic and denoted a mind without a feathers weight upon it  a servant came to the young ladys door to tell her that tea was ready and on her asking who else was below for she had heard the wheels of a second vehicle just after selinas return she learned that lionel had come back at this news she requested that some tea should be brought to her roomshe determined not to go to dinner when the dinnerhour came she sent down word that she had a headache that she was going to bed she wondered whether selina would come to her she could forget disagreeable scenes amazingly but her fervent hope that she would stay away was gratified indeed she would have another call upon her attention if her meeting with her husband was half as much of a concussion as was to have been expected laura had found herself listening hard after knowing that her brotherinlaw was in the house she half expected to hear indications of violenceloud cries or the sound of a scuffle it was a matter of course to her that some dreadful scene had not been slow to take place something that discretion should keep her out of even if she had not been too sick she did not go to bedpartly because she didnt know what might happen in the house but she was restless also for herself things had reached a point when it seemed to her that she must make up her mind she left her candles unlightedshe sat up till the small hours in the glow of the fire what had been settled by her scene with selina was that worse things were to come looking into her fire as the night went on she had a rare prevision of the catastrophe that hung over the house and she considered or tried to consider what it would be best for her in anticipation to do the first thing was to take flight  it may be related without delay that laura wing did not take flight and that though the circumstance detracts from the interest that should be felt in her character she did not even make up her mind that was not so easy when action had to ensue at the same time she had not the excuse of a conviction that by not actingthat is by not withdrawing from her brotherinlaws roofshe should be able to hold selina up to her duty to drag her back into the straight path the hopes connected with that project were now a phase that she had left behind her she had not today an illusion about her sister large enough to cover a sixpence she had passed through the period of superstition which had lasted the longestthe time when it seemed to her as at first a kind of profanity to doubt of selina and judge her the elder sister whose beauty and success she had ever been proud of and who carried herself though with the most goodnatured fraternisings as one native to an upper air she had called herself in moments of early penitence for irrepressible suspicion a little presumptuous prig so strange did it seem to her at first the impulse of criticism in regard to her bright protectress but the revolution was over and she had a desolate lonely freedom which struck her as not the most cynical thing in the world only because selinas behaviour was more so she supposed she should learn though she was afraid of the knowledge what had passed between that lady and her husband while her vigil ached itself away but it appeared to her the next day to her surprise that nothing was changed in the situation save that selina knew at present how much more she was suspected as this had not a chastening effect upon mrs berrington nothing had been gained by lauras appeal to her whatever lionel had said to his wife he said nothing to laura he left her at perfect liberty to forget the subject he had opened up to her so luminously this was very characteristic of his goodnature it had come over him that after all she wouldnt like it and if the free use of the gray ponies could make up to her for the shock she might order them every day in the week and banish the unpleasant episode from her mind  laura ordered the gray ponies very often she drove herself all over the country she visited not only the neighbouring but the distant poor and she never went out without stopping for one of the vicars fresh daughters mellows was now half the time full of visitors and when it was not its master and mistress were staying with their friends either together or singly sometimes almost always when she was asked laura wing accompanied her sister and on two or three occasions she paid an independent visit selina had often told her that she wished her to have her own friends so that the girl now felt a great desire to show her that she had them she had arrived at no decision whatever she had embraced in intention no particular course she drifted on shutting her eyes averting her head and as it seemed to herself hardening her heart this admission will doubtless suggest to the reader that she was a weak inconsequent spasmodic young person with a standard not really or at any rate not continuously high and i have no desire that she shall appear anything but what she was it must even be related of her that since she could not escape and live in lodgings and paint fans there were reasons why this combination was impossible she determined to try and be happy in the given circumstancesto float in shallow turbid water she gave up the attempt to understand the cynical modus vivendi at which her companions seemed to have arrived she knew it was not final but it served them sufficiently for the time and if it served them why should it not serve her the dependent impecunious tolerated little sister representative of the class whom it behoved above all to mind their own business the time was coming round when they would all move up to town and there in the crowd with the added movement the strain would be less and indifference easier  whatever lionel had said to his wife that evening she had found something to say to him that laura could see though not so much from any change in the simple expression of his little red face and in the vain bustle of his existence as from the grand manner in which selina now carried herself she was smarter than ever and her waist was smaller and her back straighter and the fall of her shoulders finer her long eyes were more oddly charming and the extreme detachment of her elbows from her sides conduced still more to the exhibition of her beautiful arms so she floated with a serenity not disturbed by a general tardiness through the interminable succession of her engagements her photographs were not to be purchased in the burlington arcadeshe had kept out of that but she looked more than ever as they would have represented her if they had been obtainable there there were times when laura thought her brotherinlaws formless desistence too frivolous for nature it even gave her a sense of deeper dangers it was as if he had been digging away in the dark and they would all tumble into the hole it happened to her to ask herself whether the things he had said to her the afternoon he fell upon her in the schoolroom had not all been a clumsy practical joke a crude desire to scare that of a schoolboy playing with a sheet in the dark or else brandy and soda which came to the same thing however this might be she was obliged to recognise that the impression of brandy and soda had not again been given her more striking still however was selinas capacity to recover from shocks and condone imputations she kissed againkissed laurawithout tears and proposed problems connected with the rearrangement of trimmings and of the flowers at dinner as candidlyas earnestlyas if there had never been an intenser question between them captain crispin was not mentioned much less of course so far as laura was concerned was he seen but lady ringrose appeared she came down for two days during an absence of lionels laura to her surprise found her no such jezebel but a clever little woman with a single eyeglass and short hair who had read lecky and could give her useful hints about watercolours a reconciliation that encouraged the girl for this was the direction in which it now seemed to her best that she herself should grow     vii   in grosvenor place on sunday afternoon during the first weeks of the season mrs berrington was usually at home this indeed was the only time when a visitor who had not made an appointment could hope to be admitted to her presence very few hours in the twentyfour did she spend in her own house gentlemen calling on these occasions rarely found her sister mrs berrington had the field to herself it was understood between the pair that laura should take this time for going to see her old women it was in that manner that selina qualified the girls independent social resources the old women however were not a dozen in number they consisted mainly of lady davenant and the elder mrs berrington who had a house in portman street lady davenant lived at queens gate and also was usually at home of a sunday afternoon her visitors were not all men like selina berringtons and lauras maidenly bonnet was not a false note in her drawingroom selina liked her sister naturally enough to make herself useful but of late somehow they had grown rarer the occasions that depended in any degree upon her aid and she had never been much appealed tothough it would have seemed natural she should beon behalf of the weekly chorus of gentlemen it came to be recognised on selinas part that nature had dedicated her more to the relief of old women than to that of young men laura had a distinct sense of interfering with the free interchange of anecdote and pleasantry that went on at her sisters fireside the anecdotes were mostly such an immense secret that they could not be told fairly if she were there and she had their privacy on her conscience there was an exception however when selina expected americans she naturally asked her to stay at home not apparently so much because their conversation would be good for her as because hers would be good for them  one sunday about the middle of may laura wing prepared herself to go and see lady davenant who had made a long absence from town at easter but would now have returned the weather was charming she had from the first established her right to tread the london streets alone if she was a poor girl she could have the detachment as well as the helplessness of it and she promised herself the pleasure of a walk along the park where the new grass was bright a moment before she quitted the house her sister sent for her to the drawingroom the servant gave her a note scrawled in pencil that man from new york is heremr wendover who brought me the introduction the other day from the schoolings hes rather a doseyou must positively come down and talk to him take him out with you if you can the description was not alluring but selina had never made a request of her to which the girl had not instantly responded it seemed to her she was there for that she joined the circle in the drawingroom and found that it consisted of five persons one of whom was lady ringrose lady ringrose was at all times and in all places a fitful apparition she had described herself to laura during her visit at mellows as a bird on the branch she had no fixed habit of receiving on sunday she was in and out as she liked and she was one of the few specimens of her sex who in grosvenor place ever turned up as she said on the occasions to which i allude of the three gentlemen two were known to laura she could have told you at least that the big one with the red hair was in the guards and the other in the rifles the latter looked like a rosy child and as if he ought to be sent up to play with geordie and ferdy his social nickname indeed was the baby selinas admirers were of all agesthey ranged from infants to octogenarians  she introduced the third gentleman to her sister a tall fair slender young man who suggested that he had made a mistake in the shade of his tight perpendicular coat ordering it of too heavenly a blue this added however to the candour of his appearance and if he was a dose as selina had described him he could only operate beneficently there were moments when lauras heart rather yearned towards her countrymen and now though she was preoccupied and a little disappointed at having been detained she tried to like mr wendover whom her sister had compared invidiously as it seemed to her with her other companions it struck her that his surface at least was as glossy as theirs the baby whom she remembered to have heard spoken of as a dangerous flirt was in conversation with lady ringrose and the guardsman with mrs berrington so she did her best to entertain the american visitor as to whom any one could easily see she thought that he had brought a letter of introductionhe wished so to maintain the credit of those who had given it to him laura scarcely knew these people american friends of her sister who had spent a period of festivity in london and gone back across the sea before her own advent but mr wendover gave her all possible information about them he lingered upon them returned to them corrected statements he had made at first discoursed upon them earnestly and exhaustively he seemed to fear to leave them lest he should find nothing again so good and he indulged in a parallel that was almost elaborate between miss fanny and miss katie selina told her sister afterwards that she had overheard himthat he talked of them as if he had been a nursemaid upon which laura defended the young man even to extravagance she reminded her sister that people in london were always saying lady mary and lady susan why then shouldnt americans use the christian name with the humbler prefix with which they had to content themselves there had been a time when mrs berrington had been happy enough to be miss lina even though she was the elder sister and the girl liked to think there were still old friendsfriends of the family at home for whom even should she live to sixty years of spinsterhood she would never be anything but miss laura this was as good as donna anna or donna elvira english people could never call people as other people did for fear of resembling the servants  mr wendover was very attentive as well as communicative however his letter might be regarded in grosvenor place he evidently took it very seriously himself but his eyes wandered considerably none the less to the other side of the room and laura felt that though he had often seen persons like her before not that he betrayed this too crudely he had never seen any one like lady ringrose his glance rested also on mrs berrington who to do her justice abstained from showing by the way she returned it that she wished her sister to get him out of the room her smile was particularly pretty on sunday afternoons and he was welcome to enjoy it as a part of the decoration of the place whether or no the young man should prove interesting he was at any rate interested indeed she afterwards learned that what selina deprecated in him was the fact that he would eventually display a fatiguing intensity of observation he would be one of the sort who noticed all kinds of little thingsthings she never saw or heard ofin the newspapers or in society and would call upon her a dreadful prospect to explain or even to defend them she had not come there to explain england to the americans the more particularly as her life had been a burden to her during the first years of her marriage through her having to explain america to the english as for defending england to her countrymen she had much rather defend it from them there were too manytoo many for those who were already there this was the class she wished to spareshe didnt care about the english they could obtain an eye for an eye and a cutlet for a cutlet by going over there which she had no desire to donot for all the cutlets in christendom  when mr wendover and laura had at last cut loose from the schoolings he let her know confidentially that he had come over really to see london he had time that year he didnt know when he should have it again if ever as he said and he had made up his mind that this was about the best use he could make of four months and a half he had heard so much of it it was talked of so much today a man felt as if he ought to know something about it laura wished the others could hear thisthat england was coming up was making her way at last to a place among the topics of societies more universal she thought mr wendover after all remarkably like an englishman in spite of his saying that he believed she had resided in london quite a time he talked a great deal about things being characteristic and wanted to know lowering his voice to make the inquiry whether lady ringrose were not particularly so he had heard of her very often he said and he observed that it was very interesting to see her he could not have used a different tone if he had been speaking of the prime minister or the laureate laura was ignorant of what he had heard of lady ringrose she doubted whether it could be the same as what she had heard from her brotherinlaw if this had been the case he never would have mentioned it she foresaw that his friends in london would have a good deal to do in the way of telling him whether this or that were characteristic or not he would go about in much the same way that english travellers did in america fixing his attention mainly on society he let laura know that this was especially what he wished to go into and neglecting the antiquities and sights quite as if he failed to believe in their importance he would ask questions it was impossible to answer as to whether for instance society were very different in the two countries if you said yes you gave a wrong impression and if you said no you didnt give a right one that was the kind of thing that selina had suffered from laura found her new acquaintance on the present occasion and later more philosophically analytic of his impressions than those of her countrymen she had hitherto encountered in her new home the latter in regard to such impressions usually exhibited either a profane levity or a tendency to mawkish idealism  mrs berrington called out at last to laura that she must not stay if she had prepared herself to go out whereupon the girl having nodded and smiled goodbye at the other members of the circle took a more formal leave of mr wendoverexpressed the hope as an american girl does in such a case that they should see him again selina asked him to come and dine three days later which was as much as to say that relations might be suspended till then mr wendover took it so and having accepted the invitation he departed at the same time as laura he passed out of the house with her and in the street she asked him which way he was going he was too tender but she liked him he appeared not to deal in chaff and that was a change that relieved hershe had so often had to pay out that coin when she felt wretchedly poor she hoped he would ask her leave to go with her the way she was goingand this not on particular but on general grounds it would be american it would remind her of old times she should like him to be as american as that there was no reason for her taking so quick an interest in his nature inasmuch as she had not fallen under his spell but there were moments when she felt a whimsical desire to be reminded of the way people felt and acted at home mr wendover did not disappoint her and the bright chocolatecoloured vista of the fifth avenue seemed to surge before her as he said may i have the pleasure of making my direction the same as yours and moved round systematically to take his place between her and the curbstone she had never walked much with young men in america she had been brought up in the new school the school of attendant maids and the avoidance of certain streets and she had very often done so in england in the country yet as at the top of grosvenor place she crossed over to the park proposing they should take that way the breath of her native land was in her nostrils it was certainly only an american who could have the tension of mr wendover his solemnity almost made her laugh just as her eyes grew dull when people slanged each other hilariously in her sisters house but at the same time he gave her a feeling of high respectability it would be respectable still if she were to go on with him indefinitelyif she never were to come home at all he asked her after a while as they went whether he had violated the custom of the english in offering her his company whether in that country a gentleman might walk with a young ladythe first time he saw hernot because their roads lay together but for the sake of the walk  why should it matter to me whether it is the custom of the english i am not english said laura wing then her companion explained that he only wanted a general guidancethat with her she was so kind he had not the sense of having taken a liberty the point was simplyand rather comprehensively and strenuously he began to set forth the point laura interrupted him she said she didnt care about it and he almost irritated her by telling her she was kind she was but she was not pleased at its being recognised so soon and he was still too importunate when he asked her whether she continued to go by american usage didnt find that if one lived there one had to conform in a great many ways to the english she was weary of the perpetual comparison for she not only heard it from othersshe heard it a great deal from herself she held that there were certain differences you felt if you belonged to one or the other nation and that was the end of it there was no use trying to express them those you could express were not real or not important ones and were not worth talking about mr wendover asked her if she liked english society and if it were superior to american also if the tone were very high in london she thought his questions academicthe term she used to see applied in the times to certain speeches in parliament bending his long leanness over her she had never seen a man whose material presence was so insubstantial so unoppressive and walking almost sidewise to give her a proper attention he struck her as innocent as incapable of guessing that she had had a certain observation of life they were talking about totally different things english society as he asked her judgment upon it and she had happened to see it was an affair that he didnt suspect if she were to give him that judgment it would be more than he doubtless bargained for but she would do it not to make him open his eyesonly to relieve herself she had thought of that before in regard to two or three persons she had metof the satisfaction of breaking out with some of her feelings it would make little difference whether the person understood her or not the one who should do so best would be far from understanding everything i want to get out of it pleaseout of the set i live in the one i have tumbled into through my sister the people you saw just now there are thousands of people in london who are different from that and ever so much nicer but i dont see them i dont know how to get at them and after all poor dear man what power have you to help me that was in the last analysis the gist of what she had to say  mr wendover asked her about selina in the tone of a person who thought mrs berrington a very important phenomenon and that by itself was irritating to laura wing importantgracious goodness no she might have to live with her to hold her tongue about her but at least she was not bound to exaggerate her significance the young man forbore decorously to make use of the expression but she could see that he supposed selina to be a professional beauty and she guessed that as this product had not yet been domesticated in the western world the desire to behold it after having read so much about it had been one of the motives of mr wendovers pilgrimage mrs schooling who must have been a goose had told him that mrs berrington though transplanted was the finest flower of a rich ripe society and as clever and virtuous as she was beautiful meanwhile laura knew what selina thought of fanny schooling and her incurable provinciality now was that a good example of london talkwhat i heard i only heard a little of it but the conversation was more general before you came in in your sisters drawingroom i dont mean literary intellectual talki suppose there are special places to hear that i meani mean mr wendover went on with a deliberation which gave his companion an opportunity to interrupt him they had arrived at lady davenants door and she cut his meaning short a fancy had taken her on the spot and the fact that it was whimsical seemed only to recommend it  if you want to hear london talk there will be some very good going on in here she said if you would like to come in with me  oh you are very kindi should be delighted replied mr wendover endeavouring to emulate her own more rapid processes they stepped into the porch and the young man anticipating his companion lifted the knocker and gave a postmans rap she laughed at him for this and he looked bewildered the idea of taking him in with her had become agreeably exhilarating their acquaintance in that moment took a long jump she explained to him who lady davenant was and that if he was in search of the characteristic it would be a pity he shouldnt know her and then she added before he could put the question  and what i am doing is not in the least usual no it is not the custom for young ladies here to take strange gentlemen off to call on their friends the first time they see them  so that lady davenant will think it rather extraordinary mr wendover eagerly inquired not as if that idea frightened him but so that his observation on this point should also be well founded he had entered into lauras proposal with complete serenity  oh most extraordinary said laura as they went in the old lady however concealed such surprise as she may have felt and greeted mr wendover as if he were any one of fifty familiars she took him altogether for granted and asked him no questions about his arrival his departure his hotel or his business in england he noticed as he afterwards confided to laura her omission of these forms but he was not wounded by ithe only made a mark against it as an illustration of the difference between english and american manners in new york people always asked the arriving stranger the first thing about the steamer and the hotel mr wendover appeared greatly impressed with lady davenants antiquity though he confessed to his companion on a subsequent occasion that he thought her a little flippant a little frivolous even for her years oh yes said the girl on that occasion i have no doubt that you considered she talked too much for one so old in america old ladies sit silent and listen to the young mr wendover stared a little and replied to this that with herwith laura wingit was impossible to tell which side she was on the american or the english sometimes she seemed to take one sometimes the other at any rate he added smiling with regard to the other great division it was easy to seeshe was on the side of the old of course i am she said when one is old and then he inquired according to his wont if she were thought so in england to which she answered that it was england that had made her so  lady davenants bright drawingroom was filled with mementoes and especially with a collection of portraits of distinguished people mainly fine old prints with signatures an array of precious autographs oh its a cemetery she said when the young man asked her some question about one of the pictures they are my contemporaries they are all dead and those things are the tombstones with the inscriptions im the gravedigger i look after the place and try to keep it a little tidy i have dug my own little hole she went on to laura and when you are sent for you must come and put me in this evocation of mortality led mr wendover to ask her if she had known charles lamb at which she stared for an instant replying dear me noone didnt meet him  oh i meant to say lord byron said mr wendover  bless me yes i was in love with him but he didnt notice me fortunatelywe were so many he was very nicelooking but he was very vulgar lady davenant talked to laura as if mr wendover had not been there or rather as if his interests and knowledge were identical with hers before they went away the young man asked her if she had known garrick and she replied oh dear no we didnt have them in our houses in those days  he must have been dead long before you were born laura exclaimed  i daresay but one used to hear of him  i think i meant edmund kean said mr wendover  you make little mistakes of a century or two laura wing remarked laughing she felt now as if she had known mr wendover a long time  oh he was very clever said lady davenant  very magnetic i suppose mr wendover went on  whats that i believe he used to get tipsy  perhaps you dont use that expression in england lauras companion inquired  oh i daresay we do if its american we talk american now you seem very goodnatured people but such a jargon as you do speak  i like your way lady davenant said mr wendover benevolently smiling  you might do worse cried the old woman and then she added please go out they were taking leave of her but she kept lauras hand and for the young man nodded with decision at the open door now wouldnt he do she asked after mr wendover had passed into the hall  do for what  for a husband of course  for a husbandfor whom  whyfor me said lady davenant  i dont knowi think he might tire you  ohif hes tiresome the old lady continued smiling at the girl  i think he is very good said laura  well then hell do  ah perhaps you wont laura exclaimed smiling back at her and turning away     viii   she was of a serious turn by nature and unlike many serious people she made no particular study of the art of being gay had her circumstances been different she might have done so but she lived in a merry house heaven save the mark as she used to say and therefore was not driven to amuse herself for conscience sake the diversions she sought were of a serious cast and she liked those best which showed most the note of difference from selinas interests and lionels she felt that she was most divergent when she attempted to cultivate her mind and it was a branch of such cultivation to visit the curiosities the antiquities the monuments of london she was fond of the abbey and the british museumshe had extended her researches as far as the tower she read the works of mr john timbs and made notes of the old corners of history that had not yet been abolishedthe houses in which great men had lived and died she planned a general tour of inspection of the ancient churches of the city and a pilgrimage to the queer places commemorated by dickens it must be added that though her intentions were great her adventures had as yet been small she had wanted for opportunity and independence people had other things to do than to go with her so that it was not till she had been some time in the country and till a good while after she had begun to go out alone that she entered upon the privilege of visiting public institutions by herself there were some aspects of london that frightened her but there were certain spots such as the poets corner in the abbey or the room of the elgin marbles where she liked better to be alone than not to have the right companion at the time mr wendover presented himself in grosvenor place she had begun to put in as they said a museum or something of that sort whenever she had a chance besides her idea that such places were sources of knowledge it is to be feared that the poor girls notions of knowledge were at once conventional and crude they were also occasions for detachment an escape from worrying thoughts she forgot selina and she qualified herself a littlethough for what she hardly knew  the day mr wendover dined in grosvenor place they talked about st pauls which he expressed a desire to see wishing to get some idea of the great past as he said in england as well as of the present laura mentioned that she had spent half an hour the summer before in the big black temple on ludgate hill whereupon he asked her if he might entertain the hope thatif it were not disagreeable to her to go againshe would serve as his guide there she had taken him to see lady davenant who was so remarkable and worth a long journey and now he should like to pay her backto show her something the difficulty would be that there was probably nothing she had not seen but if she could think of anything he was completely at her service they sat together at dinner and she told him she would think of something before the repast was over a little while later she let him know that a charming place had occurred to hera place to which she was afraid to go alone and where she should be grateful for a protector she would tell him more about it afterwards it was then settled between them that on a certain afternoon of the same week they would go to st pauls together extending their ramble as much further as they had time laura lowered her voice for this discussion as if the range of allusion had had a kind of impropriety she was now still more of the mind that mr wendover was a good young manhe had such worthy eyes his principal defect was that he treated all subjects as if they were equally important but that was perhaps better than treating them with equal levity if one took an interest in him one might not despair of teaching him to discriminate  laura said nothing at first to her sister about her appointment with him the feelings with which she regarded selina were not such as to make it easy for her to talk over matters of conduct as it were with this votary of pleasure at any price or at any rate to report her arrangements to her as one would do to a person of fine judgment all the same as she had a horror of positively hiding anything selina herself did that enough for two it was her purpose to mention at luncheon on the day of the event that she had agreed to accompany mr wendover to st pauls it so happened however that mrs berrington was not at home at this repast laura partook of it in the company of miss steet and her young charges it very often happened now that the sisters failed to meet in the morning for selina remained very late in her room and there had been a considerable intermission of the girls earlier custom of visiting her there it was selinas habit to send forth from this fragrant sanctuary little hieroglyphic notes in which she expressed her wishes or gave her directions for the day on the morning i speak of her maid put into lauras hand one of these communications which contained the words please be sure and replace me with the children at lunchi meant to give them that hour today but i have a frantic appeal from lady watermouth she is worse and beseeches me to come to her so i rush for the 1230 train these lines required no answer and laura had no questions to ask about lady watermouth she knew she was tiresomely ill in exile condemned to forego the diversions of the season and calling out to her friends in a house she had taken for three months at weybridge for a certain particular air where selina had already been to see her selinas devotion to her appeared commendableshe had her so much on her mind laura had observed in her sister in relation to other persons and objects these sudden intensities of charity and she had said to herself watching themis it because she is baddoes she want to make up for it somehow and to buy herself off from the penalties  mr wendover called for his cicerone and they agreed to go in a romantic bohemian manner the young man was very docile and appreciative about this walking the short distance to the victoria station and taking the mysterious underground railway in the carriage she anticipated the inquiry that she figured to herself he presently would make and said laughing no no this is very exceptional if we were both englishand both what we are otherwisewe wouldnt do this  and if only one of us were english  it would depend upon which one  well say me  oh in that case i certainlyon so short an acquaintancewould not go sightseeing with you  well i am glad im american said mr wendover sitting opposite to her  yes you may thank your fate its much simpler laura added  oh you spoil it the young man exclaimeda speech of which she took no notice but which made her think him brighter as they used to say at home he was brighter still after they had descended from the train at the temple station they had meant to go on to blackfriars but they jumped out on seeing the sign of the temple fired with the thought of visiting that institution too and got admission to the old garden of the benchers which lies beside the foggy crowded river and looked at the tombs of the crusaders in the low romanesque church with the crosslegged figures sleeping so close to the eternal uproar and lingered in the flagged homely courts of brick with their muchlettered doorposts their dull old windows and atmosphere of consultationlingered to talk of johnson and goldsmith and to remark how london opened ones eyes to dickens and he was brightest of all when they stood in the high bare cathedral which suggested a dirty whiteness saying it was fine but wondering why it was not finer and letting a glance as cold as the dusty colourless glass fall upon epitaphs that seemed to make most of the defunct bores even in death mr wendover was decorous but he was increasingly gay and these qualities appeared in him in spite of the fact that st pauls was rather a disappointment then they felt the advantage of having the other placethe one laura had had in mind at dinnerto fall back upon that perhaps would prove a compensation they entered a hansom now they had to come to that though they had walked also from the temple to st pauls and drove to lincolns inn fields laura making the reflection as they went that it was really a charm to roam about london under valid protectionsuch a mixture of freedom and safetyand that perhaps she had been unjust ungenerous to her sister a goodnatured positively charitable doubt came into her minda doubt that selina might have the benefit of what she liked in her present undertaking was the element of the imprévu that it contained and perhaps it was simply the same happy sense of getting the laws of londononce in a wayoff her back that had led selina to go over to paris to ramble about with captain crispin possibly they had done nothing worse than go together to the invalides and notre dame and if any one were to meet her driving that way so far from home with mr wendoverlaura mentally did not finish her sentence overtaken as she was by the reflection that she had fallen again into her old assumption she had been in and out of it a hundred times that mrs berrington had met captain crispinthe idea she so passionately repudiated she at least would never deny that she had spent the afternoon with mr wendover she would simply say that he was an american and had brought a letter of introduction  the cab stopped at the soane museum which laura wing had always wanted to see a compatriot having once told her that it was one of the most curious things in london and one of the least known while mr wendover was discharging the vehicle she looked over the important oldfashioned square which led her to say to herself that london was endlessly big and one would never know all the places that made it up and saw a great bank of cloud hanging above ita definite portent of a summer storm we are going to have thunder you had better keep the cab she said upon which her companion told the man to wait so that they should not afterwards in the wet have to walk for another conveyance the heterogeneous objects collected by the late sir john soane are arranged in a fine old dwellinghouse and the place gives one the impression of a sort of saturday afternoon of ones youtha long rummaging visit under indulgent care to some eccentric and rather alarming old travelled person our young friends wandered from room to room and thought everything queer and some few objects interesting mr wendover said it would be a very good place to find a thing you couldnt find anywhere elseit illustrated the prudent virtue of keeping they took note of the sarcophagi and pagodas the artless old maps and medals they admired the fine hogarths there were uncanny unexpected objects that laura edged away from that she would have preferred not to be in the room with they had been there half an hourit had grown much darkerwhen they heard a tremendous peal of thunder and became aware that the storm had broken they watched it a while from the upper windowsa violent june shower with quick sheets of lightning and a rainfall that danced on the pavements they took it sociably they lingered at the window inhaling the odour of the fresh wet that splashed over the sultry town they would have to wait till it had passed and they resigned themselves serenely to this idea repeating very often that it would pass very soon one of the keepers told them that there were other rooms to seethat there were very interesting things in the basement they made their way downit grew much darker and they heard a great deal of thunderand entered a part of the house which presented itself to laura as a series of dim irregular vaultspassages and little narrow avenuesencumbered with strange vague things obscured for the time but some of which had a wicked startling look so that she wondered how the keepers could stay there its very fearfulit looks like a cave of idols she said to her companion and then she addedjust look thereis that a person or a thing as she spoke they drew nearer to the object of her referencea figure in the middle of a small vista of curiosities a figure which answered her question by uttering a short shriek as they approached the immediate cause of this cry was apparently a vivid flash of lightning which penetrated into the room and illuminated both lauras face and that of the mysterious person our young lady recognised her sister as mrs berrington had evidently recognised her why selina broke from her lips before she had time to check the words at the same moment the figure turned quickly away and then laura saw that it was accompanied by another that of a tall gentleman with a light beard which shone in the dusk the two persons retreated togetherdodged out of sight as it were disappearing in the gloom or in the labyrinth of the objects exhibited the whole encounter was but the business of an instant  was it mrs berrington mr wendover asked with interest while laura stood staring  oh no i only thought it was at first she managed to reply very quickly she had recognised the gentlemanhe had the fine fair beard of captain crispinand her heart seemed to her to jump up and down she was glad her companion could not see her face and yet she wanted to get out to rush up the stairs where he would see it again to escape from the place she wished not to be there with themshe was overwhelmed with a sudden horror she has liedshe has lied againshe has liedthat was the rhythm to which her thought began to dance she took a few steps one way and then another she was afraid of running against the dreadful pair again she remarked to her companion that it was time they should go off and then when he showed her the way back to the staircase she pleaded that she had not half seen the things she pretended suddenly to a deep interest in them and lingered there roaming and prying about she was flurried still more by the thought that he would have seen her flurry and she wondered whether he believed the woman who had shrieked and rushed away was not selina if she was not selina why had she shrieked and if she was selina what would mr wendover think of her behaviour and of her own and of the strange accident of their meeting what must she herself think of that so astonishing it was that in the immensity of london so infinitesimally small a chance should have got itself enacted what a queer place to come tofor people like them they would get away as soon as possible of that she could be sure and she would wait a little to give them time  mr wendover made no further remarkthat was a relief though his silence itself seemed to show that he was mystified they went upstairs again and on reaching the door found to their surprise that their cab had disappeareda circumstance the more singular as the man had not been paid the rain was still coming down though with less violence and the square had been cleared of vehicles by the sudden storm the doorkeeper perceiving the dismay of our friends explained that the cab had been taken up by another lady and another gentleman who had gone out a few minutes before and when they inquired how he had been induced to depart without the money they owed him the reply was that there evidently had been a discussion he hadnt heard it but the lady seemed in a fearful hurry and the gentleman had told him that they would make it all up to him and give him a lot more into the bargain the doorkeeper hazarded the candid surmise that the cabby would make ten shillings by the job but there were plenty more cabs there would be one up in a minute and the rain moreover was going to stop well that is sharp practice said mr wendover he made no further allusion to the identity of the lady     ix   the rain did stop while they stood there and a brace of hansoms was not slow to appear laura told her companion that he must put her into oneshe could go home alone she had taken up enough of his time he deprecated this course very respectfully urged that he had it on his conscience to deliver her at her own door but she sprang into the cab and closed the apron with a movement that was a sharp prohibition she wanted to get away from himit would be too awkward the long pottering drive back her hansom started off while mr wendover smiling sadly lifted his hat it was not very comfortable even without him especially as before she had gone a quarter of a mile she felt that her action had been too markedshe wished she had let him come his puzzled innocent air of wondering what was the matter annoyed her and she was in the absurd situation of being angry at a desistence which she would have been still angrier if he had been guiltless of it would have comforted her because it would seem to share her burden and yet it would have covered her with shame if he had guessed that what she saw was wrong it would not occur to him that there was a scandal so near her because he thought with no great promptitude of such things and yet since there wasbut since there was after all laura scarcely knew what attitude would sit upon him most gracefully as to what he might be prepared to suspect by having heard what selinas reputation was in london of that laura was unable to judge not knowing what was said because of course it was not said to her lionel would undertake to give her the benefit of this any moment she would allow him but how in the world could he know either for how could things be said to him then in the rattle of the hansom passing through streets for which the girl had no eyes she has lied she has lied she has lied kept repeating itself why had she written and signed that wanton falsehood about her going down to lady watermouth how could she have gone to lady watermouths when she was making so very different and so extraordinary a use of the hours she had announced her intention of spending there what had been the need of that misrepresentation and why did she lie before she was driven to it  it was because she was false altogether and deception came out of her with her breath she was so depraved that it was easier to her to fabricate than to let it alone laura would not have asked her to give an account of her day but she would ask her now she shuddered at one moment as she found herself sayingeven in silencesuch things of her sister and the next she sat staring out of the front of the cab at the stiff problem presented by selinas turning up with the partner of her guilt at the soane museum of all places in the world the girl shifted this fact about in various ways to account for itnot unconscious as she did so that it was a pretty exercise of ingenuity for a nice girl plainly it was a rare accident if it had been their plan to spend the day together the soane museum had not been in the original programme they had been near it they had been on foot and they had rushed in to take refuge from the rain but how did they come to be near it and above all to be on foot how could selina do anything so reckless from her own point of view as to walk about the towneven an outoftheway part of itwith her suspected lover laura wing felt the want of proper knowledge to explain such anomalies it was too little clear to her where ladies went and how they proceeded when they consorted with gentlemen in regard to their meetings with whom they had to lie she knew nothing of where captain crispin lived very possiblyfor she vaguely remembered having heard selina say of him that he was very poorhe had chambers in that part of the town and they were either going to them or coming from them if selina had neglected to take her way in a fourwheeler with the glasses up it was through some chance that would not seem natural till it was explained like that of their having darted into a public institution then no doubt it would hang together with the rest only too well the explanation most exact would probably be that the pair had snatched a walk together in the course of a day of many edifying episodes for the lark of it and for the sake of the walk had taken the risk which in that part of london so detached from all gentility had appeared to them small the last thing selina could have expected was to meet her sister in such a strange cornerher sister with a young man of her own  she was dining out that night with both selina and lionela conjunction that was rather rare she was by no means always invited with them and selina constantly went without her husband appearances however sometimes got a sop thrown them three or four times a month lionel and she entered the brougham together like people who still had forms who still said my dear this was to be one of those occasions and mrs berringtons young unmarried sister was included in the invitation when laura reached home she learned on inquiry that selina had not yet come in and she went straight to her own room if her sister had been there she would have gone to hers insteadshe would have cried out to her as soon as she had closed the door oh stop stopin gods name stop before you go any further before exposure and ruin and shame come down and bury us that was what was in the airthe vulgarest disgrace and the girl harder now than ever about her sister was conscious of a more passionate desire to save herself but selinas absence made the difference that during the next hour a certain chill fell upon this impulse from other feelings she found suddenly that she was late and she began to dress they were to go together after dinner to a couple of balls a diversion which struck her as ghastly for people who carried such horrors in their breasts ghastly was the idea of the drive of husband wife and sister in pursuit of pleasure with falsity and detection and hate between them selinas maid came to her door to tell her that she was in the carriagean extraordinary piece of punctuality which made her wonder as selina was always dreadfully late for everything laura went down as quickly as she could passed through the open door where the servants were grouped in the foolish majesty of their superfluous attendance and through the file of dingy gazers who had paused at the sight of the carpet across the pavement and the waiting carriage in which selina sat in pure white splendour mrs berrington had a tiara on her head and a proud patience in her face as if her sister were really a sore trial as soon as the girl had taken her place she said to the footman is mr berrington thereto which the man replied no maam not yet it was not new to laura that if there was any one later as a general thing than selina it was selinas husband then he must take a hansom go on the footman mounted and they rolled away  there were several different things that had been present to lauras mind during the last couple of hours as destined to markone or the otherthis present encounter with her sister but the words selina spoke the moment the brougham began to move were of course exactly those she had not foreseen she had considered that she might take this tone or that tone or even no tone at all she was quite prepared for her presenting a face of blankness to any form of interrogation and saying what on earth are you talking about it was in short conceivable to her that selina would deny absolutely that she had been in the museum that they had stood face to face and that she had fled in confusion she was capable of explaining the incident by an idiotic error on lauras part by her having seized on another person by her seeing captain crispin in every bush though doubtless she would be taxed of course she would say that was the womans own affair to supply a reason for the embarrassment of the other lady but she was not prepared for selinas breaking out with will you be so good as to inform me if you are engaged to be married to mr wendover  engaged to him i have seen him but three times  and is that what you usually do with gentlemen you have seen three times  are you talking about my having gone with him to see some sights i see nothing wrong in that to begin with you see what he is one might go with him anywhere then he brought us an introductionwe have to do something for him moreover you threw him upon me the moment he cameyou asked me to take charge of him  i didnt ask you to be indecent if lionel were to know it he wouldnt tolerate it so long as you live with us  laura was silent a moment i shall not live with you long the sisters side by side with their heads turned looked at each other a deep crimson leaping into lauras face i wouldnt have believed itthat you are so bad she said you are horrible she saw that selina had not taken up the idea of denyingshe judged that would be hopeless the recognition on either side had been too sharp she looked radiantly handsome especially with the strange new expression that lauras last word brought into her eyes this expression seemed to the girl to show her more of selina morally than she had ever yet seensomething of the full extent and the miserable limit  its different for a married woman especially when shes married to a cad its in a girl that such things are odiousscouring london with strange men i am not bound to explain to youthere would be too many things to say i have my reasonsi have my conscience it was the oddest of all things our meeting in that placei know that as well as you selina went on with her wonderful affected clearness but it was not your finding me that was out of the way it was my finding youwith your remarkable escort that was incredible i pretended not to recognise you so that the gentleman who was with me shouldnt see you shouldnt know you he questioned me and i repudiated you you may thank me for saving you you had better wear a veil next timeone never knows what may happen i met an acquaintance at lady watermouths and he came up to town with me he happened to talk about old prints i told him how i have collected them and we spoke of the bother one has about the frames he insisted on my going with him to that placefrom waterlooto see such an excellent model  laura had turned her face to the window of the carriage again they were spinning along park lane passing in the quick flash of other vehicles an endless succession of ladies with dressed heads of gentlemen in white neckties why i thought your frames were all so pretty laura murmured then she added i suppose it was your eagerness to save your companion the shock of seeing mein my dishonourthat led you to steal our cab  your cab  your delicacy was expensive for you  you dont mean you were knocking about in cabs with him selina cried  of course i know that you dont really think a word of what you say about me laura went on though i dont know that that makes your saying it a bit less unspeakably base  the brougham pulled up in park lane and mrs berrington bent herself to have a view through the front glass we are there but there are two other carriages she remarked for all answer ah there are the collingwoods  where are you goingwhere are you goingwhere are you going laura broke out  the carriage moved on to set them down and while the footman was getting off the box selina said i dont pretend to be better than other women but you do and being on the side of the house she quickly stepped out and carried her crowned brilliancy through the longlingering daylight and into the open portals     x   what do you intend to do you will grant that i have a right to ask you that  to do i shall do as i have always donenot so badly as it seems to me  this colloquy took place in mrs berringtons room in the early morning hours after selinas return from the entertainment to which reference was last made her sister came home before hershe found herself incapable of going on when selina quitted the house in park lane at which they had dined mrs berrington had the night still before her and she stepped into her carriage with her usual air of graceful resignation to a brilliant lot she had taken the precaution however to provide herself with a defence against a little sister bristling with righteousness in the person of mrs collingwood to whom she offered a lift as they were bent upon the same business and mr collingwood had a use of his own for his brougham the collingwoods were a happy pair who could discuss such a divergence before their friends candidly amicably with a great many my loves and not for the worlds lionel berrington disappeared after dinner without holding any communication with his wife and laura expected to find that he had taken the carriage to repay her in kind for her having driven off from grosvenor place without him but it was not new to the girl that he really spared his wife more than she spared him not so much perhaps because he wouldnt do the nastiest thing as because he couldnt selina could always be nastier there was ever a whimsicality in her actions if two or three hours before it had been her fancy to keep a third person out of the carriage she had now her reasons for bringing such a person in laura knew that she would not only pretend but would really believe that her vindication of her conduct on their way to dinner had been powerful and that she had won a brilliant victory what need therefore to thresh out further a subject that she had chopped into atoms laura wing however had needs of her own and her remaining in the carriage when the footman next opened the door was intimately connected with them  i dont care to go in she said to her sister if you will allow me to be driven home and send back the carriage for you thats what i shall like best  selina stared and laura knew what she would have said if she could have spoken her thought oh you are furious that i havent given you a chance to fly at me again and you must take it out in sulks these were the ideasideas of fury and sulksinto which selina could translate feelings that sprang from the pure depths of ones conscience mrs collingwood protestedshe said it was a shame that laura shouldnt go in and enjoy herself when she looked so lovely doesnt she look lovely she appealed to mrs berrington bless us whats the use of being pretty now if she had my face  i think she looks rather cross said selina getting out with her friend and leaving her sister to her own inventions laura had a vision as the carriage drove away again of what her situation would have been or her peace of mind if selina and lionel had been good attached people like the collingwoods and at the same time of the singularity of a good womans being ready to accept favours from a person as to whose behaviour she had the lights that must have come to the lady in question in regard to selina she accepted favours herself and she only wanted to be good that was oppressively true but if she had not been selinas sister she would never drive in her carriage that conviction was strong in the girl as this vehicle conveyed her to grosvenor place but it was not in its nature consoling the prevision of disgrace was now so vivid to her that it seemed to her that if it had not already overtaken them she had only to thank the loose mysterious rather ignoble tolerance of people like mrs collingwood there were plenty of that species even among the good perhaps indeed exposure and dishonour would begin only when the bad had got hold of the facts would the bad be most horrified and do most to spread the scandal there were in any event plenty of them too  laura sat up for her sister that night with that nice question to help her to torment herselfwhether if she was hard and merciless in judging selina it would be with the bad too that she would associate herself was she all wrong after allwas she cruel by being too rigid was mrs collingwoods attitude the right one and ought she only to propose to herself to allow more and more and to allow ever and to smooth things down by gentleness by sympathy by not looking at them too hard it was not the first time that the just measure of things seemed to slip from her hands as she became conscious of possible or rather of very actual differences of standard and usage on this occasion geordie and ferdy asserted themselves by the mere force of lying asleep upstairs in their little cribs as on the whole the proper measure laura went into the nursery to look at them when she came homeit was her habit almost any nightand yearned over them as mothers and maids do alike over the pillow of rosy childhood they were an antidote to all casuistry for selina to forget themthat was the beginning and the end of shame she came back to the library where she should best hear the sound of her sisters return the hours passed as she sat there without bringing round this event carriages came and went all night the soft shock of swift hoofs was on the wooden roadway long after the summer dawn grew fairtill it was merged in the rumble of the awakening day lionel had not come in when she returned and he continued absent to lauras satisfaction for if she wanted not to miss selina she had no desire at present to have to tell her brotherinlaw why she was sitting up she prayed selina might arrive first then she would have more time to think of something that harassed her particularlythe question of whether she ought to tell lionel that she had seen her in a faraway corner of the town with captain crispin almost impossible as she found it now to feel any tenderness for her she yet detested the idea of bearing witness against her notwithstanding which it appeared to her that she could make up her mind to do this if there were a chance of its preventing the last scandala catastrophe to which she saw her sister rushing straight that selina was capable at a given moment of going off with her lover and capable of it precisely because it was the greatest ineptitude as well as the greatest wickednessthere was a voice of prophecy of warning to this effect in the silent empty house if repeating to lionel what she had seen would contribute to prevent anything or to stave off the danger was it not her duty to denounce his wife flesh and blood of her own as she was to his further reprobation this point was not intolerably difficult to determine as she sat there waiting only because even what was righteous in that reprobation could not present itself to her as fruitful or efficient what could lionel frustrate after all and what intelligent or authoritative step was he capable of taking mixed with all that now haunted her was her consciousness of what his own absence at such an hour represented in the way of the unedifying he might be at some sporting club or he might be anywhere else at any rate he was not where he ought to be at three oclock in the morning such the husband such the wife she said to herself and she felt that selina would have a kind of advantage which she grudged her if she should come in and say and where is he pleasewhere is he the exalted being on whose behalf you have undertaken to preach so much better than he himself practises  but still selina failed to come ineven to take that advantage yet in proportion as her waiting was useless did the girl find it impossible to go to bed a new fear had seized her the fear that she would never come back at allthat they were already in the presence of the dreaded catastrophe this made her so nervous that she paced about the lower rooms listening to every sound roaming till she was tired she knew it was absurd the image of selina taking flight in a balldress but she said to herself that she might very well have sent other clothes away in advance somewhere laura had her own ripe views about the maid and at any rate for herself that was the fate she had to expect if not that night then some other one soon and it was all the same to sit counting the hours till a hope was given up and a hideous certainty remained she had fallen into such a state of apprehension that when at last she heard a carriage stop at the door she was almost happy in spite of her prevision of how disgusted her sister would be to find her they met in the halllaura went out as she heard the opening of the door selina stopped short seeing her but said nothingon account apparently of the presence of the sleepy footman then she moved straight to the stairs where she paused again asking the footman if mr berrington had come in  not yet maam the footman answered  ah said mrs berrington dramatically and ascended the stairs  i have sat up on purposei want particularly to speak to you laura remarked following her  ah selina repeated more superior still she went fast almost as if she wished to get to her room before her sister could overtake her but the girl was close behind her she passed into the room with her laura closed the door then she told her that she had found it impossible to go to bed without asking her what she intended to do  your behaviour is too monstrous selina flashed out what on earth do you wish to make the servants suppose  oh the servantsin this house as if one could put any idea into their heads that is not there already laura thought but she said nothing of thisshe only repeated her question aware that she was exasperating to her sister but also aware that she could not be anything else mrs berrington whose maid having outlived surprises had gone to rest began to divest herself of some of her ornaments and it was not till after a moment during which she stood before the glass that she made that answer about doing as she had always done to this laura rejoined that she ought to put herself in her place enough to feel how important it was to her to know what was likely to happen so that she might take time by the forelock and think of her own situation if anything should happen she would infinitely rather be out of itbe as far away as possible therefore she must take her measures  it was in the mirror that they looked at each otherin the strange candlelighted duplication of the scene that their eyes met selina drew the diamonds out of her hair and in this occupation for a minute she was silent presently she asked what are you talking aboutwhat do you allude to as happening  why it seems to me that there is nothing left for you but to go away with him if there is a prospect of that insanity but here laura stopped something so unexpected was taking place in selinas countenancethe movement that precedes a sudden gush of tears mrs berrington dashed down the glittering pins she had detached from her tresses and the next moment she had flung herself into an armchair and was weeping profusely extravagantly laura forbore to go to her she made no motion to soothe or reassure her she only stood and watched her tears and wondered what they signified somehow even the slight refreshment she felt at having affected her in that particular and as it had lately come to seem improbable way did not suggest to her that they were precious symptoms since she had come to disbelieve her word so completely there was nothing precious about selina any more but she continued for some moments to cry passionately and while this lasted laura remained silent at last from the midst of her sobs selina broke out go away go awayleave me alone  of course i infuriate you said the girl but how can i see you rush to your ruinto that of all of uswithout holding on to you and dragging you back  oh you dont understand anything about anything selina wailed with her beautiful hair tumbling all over her  i certainly dont understand how you can give such a tremendous handle to lionel  at the mention of her husbands name selina always gave a bound and she sprang up now shaking back her dense braids i give him no handle and you dont know what you are talking about i know what i am doing and what becomes me and i dont care if i do he is welcome to all the handles in the world for all that he can do with them  in the name of common pity think of your children said laura  have i ever thought of anything else have you sat up all night to have the pleasure of accusing me of cruelty are there sweeter or more delightful children in the world and isnt that a little my merit pray selina went on sweeping away her tears who has made them what they are prayis it their lovely father perhaps youll say its you certainly you have been nice to them but you must remember that you only came here the other day isnt it only for them that i am trying to keep myself alive  this formula struck laura wing as grotesque so that she replied with a laugh which betrayed too much her impression die for themthat would be better  her sister at this looked at her with an extraordinary cold gravity dont interfere between me and my children and for gods sake cease to harry me  laura turned away she said to herself that given that intensity of silliness of course the worst would come she felt sick and helpless and practically she had got the certitude she both wanted and dreaded i dont know what has become of your mind she murmured and she went to the door but before she reached it selina had flung herself upon her in one of her strange but as she felt really not encouraging revulsions her arms were about her she clung to her she covered laura with the tears that had again begun to flow she besought her to save her to stay with her to help her against herself against him against lionel against everythingto forgive her also all the horrid things she had said to her mrs berrington melted liquefied and the room was deluged with her repentance her desolation her confession her promises and the articles of apparel which were detached from her by the high tide of her agitation laura remained with her for an hour and before they separated the culpable woman had taken a tremendous vowkneeling before her sister with her head in her lapnever again as long as she lived to consent to see captain crispin or to address a word to him spoken or written the girl went terribly tired to bed  a month afterwards she lunched with lady davenant whom she had not seen since the day she took mr wendover to call upon her the old woman had found herself obliged to entertain a small company and as she disliked set parties she sent laura a request for sympathy and assistance she had disencumbered herself at the end of so many years of the burden of hospitality but every now and then she invited people in order to prove that she was not too old laura suspected her of choosing stupid ones on purpose to prove it betterto show that she could submit not only to the extraordinary but what was much more difficult to the usual but when they had been properly fed she encouraged them to disperse on this occasion as the party broke up laura was the only person she asked to stay she wished to know in the first place why she had not been to see her for so long and in the second how that young man had behavedthe one she had brought that sunday lady davenant didnt remember his name though he had been so goodnatured as she said since then as to leave a card if he had behaved well that was a very good reason for the girls neglect and laura need give no other laura herself would not have behaved well if at such a time she had been running after old women there was nothing in general that the girl liked less than being spoken of offhand as a marriageable articlebeing planned and arranged for in this particular it made too light of her independence and though in general such inventions passed for benevolence they had always seemed to her to contain at bottom an impertinenceas if people could be moved about like a game of chequers there was a liberty in the way lady davenants imagination disposed of her with such an insouciance of her own preferences but she forgave that because after all this old friend was not obliged to think of her at all  i knew that you were almost always out of town now on sundaysand so have we been laura said and then i have been a great deal with my sistermore than before  more than before what  well a kind of estrangement we had about a certain matter  and now you have made it all up  well we have been able to talk of it we couldnt beforewithout painful scenes and that has cleared the air we have gone about together a good deal laura went on she has wanted me constantly with her  thats very nice and where has she taken you asked the old lady  oh its i who have taken her rather and laura hesitated  where do you meanto say her prayers  well to some concertsand to the national gallery  lady davenant laughed disrespectfully at this and the girl watched her with a mournful face my dear child you are too delightful you are trying to reform her by beethoven and bach by rubens and titian  she is very intelligent about music and picturesshe has excellent ideas said laura  and you have been trying to draw them out that is very commendable  i think you are laughing at me but i dont care the girl declared smiling faintly  because you have a consciousness of successin what do they call itthe attempt to raise her tone you have been trying to wind her up and you have raised her tone  oh lady davenant i dont know and i dont understand laura broke out i dont understand anything any morei have given up trying  thats what i recommended you to do last winter dont you remember that day at plash  you told me to let her go said laura  and evidently you havent taken my advice  how can ihow can i  of course how can you and meanwhile if she doesnt go its so much gained but even if she should wont that nice young man remain lady davenant inquired i hope very much selina hasnt taken you altogether away from him  laura was silent a moment then she returned what nice young man would ever look at me if anything bad should happen  i would never look at him if he should let that prevent him the old woman cried it isnt for your sister he loves you i suppose is it  he doesnt love me at all  ah then he does lady davenant demanded with some eagerness laying her hand on the girls arm laura sat near her on her sofa and looked at her for all answer to this with an expression of which the sadness appeared to strike the old woman freshly doesnt he come to the housedoesnt he say anything she continued with a voice of kindness  he comes to the housevery often  and dont you like him  yes very muchmore than i did at first  well as you liked him at first well enough to bring him straight to see me i suppose that means that now you are immensely pleased with him  hes a gentleman said laura  so he seems to me but why then doesnt he speak out  perhaps thats the very reason seriously the girl added i dont know what he comes to the house for  is he in love with your sister  i sometimes think so  and does she encourage him  she detests him  oh then i like him i shall immediately write to him to come and see me i shall appoint an hour and give him a piece of my mind  if i believed that i should kill myself said laura  you may believe what you like but i wish you didnt show your feelings so in your eyes they might be those of a poor widow with fifteen children when i was young i managed to be happy whatever occurred and i am sure i looked so  oh yes lady davenantfor you it was different you were safe in so many ways laura said and you were surrounded with consideration  i dont know some of us were very wild and exceedingly ill thought of and i didnt cry about it however there are natures and natures if you will come and stay with me tomorrow i will take you in  you know how kind i think you but i have promised selina not to leave her  well then if she keeps you she must at least go straight cried the old woman with some asperity laura made no answer to this and lady davenant asked after a moment and what is lionel doing  i dont knowhe is very quiet  doesnt it please himhis wifes improvement the girl got up apparently she was made uncomfortable by the ironical effect if not by the ironical intention of this question her old friend was kind but she was penetrating her very next words pierced further of course if you are really protecting her i cant count upon you a remark not adapted to enliven laura who would have liked immensely to transfer herself to queens gate and had her very private ideas as to the efficacy of her protection lady davenant kissed her and then suddenly saidoh by the way his address you must tell me that  his address  the young mans whom you brought here but its no matter the old woman added the butler will have entered itfrom his card  lady davenant you wont do anything so loathsome the girl cried seizing her hand  why is it loathsome if he comes so often its rubbish his caring for selinaa married womanwhen you are there  why is it rubbishwhen so many other people do  oh well he is differenti could see that or if he isnt he ought to be  he likes to observehe came here to take notes said the girl and he thinks selina a very interesting london specimen  in spite of her dislike of him  oh he doesnt know that laura exclaimed  why not he isnt a fool  oh i have made it seem but here laura stopped her colour had risen  lady davenant stared an instant made it seem that she inclines to him mercy to do that how fond of him you must be an observation which had the effect of driving the girl straight out of the house     xi   on one of the last days of june mrs berrington showed her sister a note she had received from your dear friend as she called him mr wendover this was the manner in which she usually designated him but she had naturally in the present phase of her relations with laura never indulged in any renewal of the eminently perverse insinuations by means of which she had attempted after the incident at the soane museum to throw dust in her eyes mr wendover proposed to mrs berrington that she and her sister should honour with their presence a box he had obtained for the opera three nights lateran occasion of high curiosity the first appearance of a young american singer of whom considerable things were expected laura left it to selina to decide whether they should accept this invitation and selina proved to be of two or three differing minds first she said it wouldnt be convenient to her to go and she wrote to the young man to this effect then on second thoughts she considered she might very well go and telegraphed an acceptance later she saw reason to regret her acceptance and communicated this circumstance to her sister who remarked that it was still not too late to change selina left her in ignorance till the next day as to whether she had retracted then she told her that she had let the matter standthey would go to this laura replied that she was gladfor mr wendover and for yourself selina said leaving the girl to wonder why every one this universality was represented by mrs lionel berrington and lady davenant had taken up the idea that she entertained a passion for her compatriot she was clearly conscious that this was not the case though she was glad her esteem for him had not yet suffered the disturbance of her seeing reason to believe that lady davenant had already meddled according to her terrible threat laura was surprised to learn afterwards that selina had in london parlance thrown over a dinner in order to make the evening at the opera fit in the dinner would have made her too late and she didnt care about it she wanted to hear the whole opera  the sisters dined together alone without any question of lionel and on alighting at covent garden found mr wendover awaiting them in the portico his box proved commodious and comfortable and selina was gracious to him she thanked him for his consideration in not stuffing it full of people he assured her that he expected but one other inmatea gentleman of a shrinking disposition who would take up no room the gentleman came in after the first act he was introduced to the ladies as mr booker of baltimore he knew a great deal about the young lady they had come to listen to and he was not so shrinking but that he attempted to impart a portion of his knowledge even while she was singing before the second act was over laura perceived lady ringrose in a box on the other side of the house accompanied by a lady unknown to her there was apparently another person in the box behind the two ladies whom they turned round from time to time to talk with laura made no observation about lady ringrose to her sister and she noticed that selina never resorted to the glass to look at her that mrs berrington had not failed to see her however was proved by the fact that at the end of the second act the opera was meyerbeers huguenots she suddenly said turning to mr wendover i hope you wont mind very much if i go for a short time to sit with a friend on the other side of the house she smiled with all her sweetness as she announced this intention and had the benefit of the fact that an apologetic expression is highly becoming to a pretty woman but she abstained from looking at her sister and the latter after a wondering glance at her looked at mr wendover she saw that he was disappointedeven slightly wounded he had taken some trouble to get his box and it had been no small pleasure to him to see it graced by the presence of a celebrated beauty now his situation collapsed if the celebrated beauty were going to transfer her light to another quarter laura was unable to imagine what had come into her sisters headto make her so inconsiderate so rude selina tried to perform her act of defection in a soothing conciliating way so far as appealing eyebeams went but she gave no particular reason for her escapade withheld the name of the friends in question and betrayed no consciousness that it was not usual for ladies to roam about the lobbies laura asked her no question but she said to her after an hesitation you wont be long surely you know you oughtnt to leave me here selina took no notice of thisexcused herself in no way to the girl mr wendover only exclaimed smiling in reference to lauras last remark oh so far as leaving you here goes in spite of his great defect and it was his only one that she could see of having only an ascending scale of seriousness she judged him interestedly enough to feel a real pleasure in noticing that though he was annoyed at selinas going away and not saying that she would come back soon he conducted himself as a gentleman should submitted respectfully gallantly to her wish he suggested that her friends might perhaps instead be induced to come to his box but when she had objected oh you see there are too many he put her shawl on her shoulders opened the box offered her his arm while this was going on laura saw lady ringrose studying them with her glass selina refused mr wendovers arm she said oh no you stay with heri daresay hell take me and she gazed inspiringly at mr booker selina never mentioned a name when the pronoun would do mr booker of course sprang to the service required and led her away with an injunction from his friend to bring her back promptly as they went off laura heard selina say to her companionand she knew mr wendover could also hear itnothing would have induced me to leave her alone with you she thought this a very extraordinary speechshe thought it even vulgar especially considering that she had never seen the young man till half an hour before and since then had not exchanged twenty words with him it came to their ears so distinctly that laura was moved to notice it by exclaiming with a laugh poor mr booker what does she suppose i would do to him  oh its for you shes afraid said mr wendover  laura went on after a moment she oughtnt to have left me alone with you either  oh yes she oughtafter all the young man returned  the girl had uttered these words from no desire to say something flirtatious but because they simply expressed a part of the judgment she passed mentally on selinas behaviour she had a sense of wrongof being made light of for mrs berrington certainly knew that honourable women didnt for the appearance of the thing arrange to leave their unmarried sister sitting alone publicly at the playhouse with a couple of young menthe couple that there would be as soon as mr booker should come back it displeased her that the people in the opposite box the people selina had joined should see her exhibited in this light she drew the curtain of the box a little she moved a little more behind it and she heard her companion utter a vague appealing protecting sigh which seemed to express his sense her own corresponded with it that the glory of the occasion had somehow suddenly departed at the end of some minutes she perceived among lady ringrose and her companions a movement which appeared to denote that selina had come in the two ladies in front turned roundsomething went on at the back of the box shes there laura said indicating the place but mrs berrington did not show herselfshe remained masked by the others neither was mr booker visible he had not seemingly been persuaded to remain and indeed laura could see that there would not have been room for him mr wendover observed ruefully that as mrs berrington evidently could see nothing at all from where she had gone she had exchanged a very good place for a very bad one i cant imaginei cant imagine said the girl but she paused losing herself in reflections and wonderments in conjectures that soon became anxieties suspicion of selina was now so rooted in her heart that it could make her unhappy even when it pointed nowhere and by the end of half an hour she felt how little her fears had really been lulled since that scene of dishevelment and contrition in the early dawn  the opera resumed its course but mr booker did not come back the american singer trilled and warbled executed remarkable flights and there was much applause every symptom of success but laura became more and more unaware of the musicshe had no eyes but for lady ringrose and her friend she watched them earnestlyshe tried to sound with her glass the curtained dimness behind them their attention was all for the stage and they gave no present sign of having any fellowlisteners these others had either gone away or were leaving them very much to themselves laura was unable to guess any particular motive on her sisters part but the conviction grew within her that she had not put such an affront on mr wendover simply in order to have a little chat with lady ringrose there was something else there was some one else in the affair and when once the girls idea had become as definite as that it took but little longer to associate itself with the image of captain crispin this image made her draw back further behind her curtain because it brought the blood to her face and if she coloured for shame she coloured also for anger captain crispin was there in the opposite box those horrible women concealed him she forgot how harmless and wellread lady ringrose had appeared to her that time at mellows they had lent themselves to this abominable proceeding selina was nestling there in safety with him by their favour and she had had the baseness to lay an honest girl the most loyal the most unselfish of sisters under contribution to the same end laura crimsoned with the sense that she had been unsuspectingly part of a scheme that she was being used as the two women opposite were used but that she had been outraged into the bargain inasmuch as she was not like them a conscious accomplice and not a person to be given away in that manner before hundreds of people it came back to her how bad selina had been the day of the business in lincolns inn fields and how in spite of intervening comedies the woman who had then found such words of injury would be sure to break out in a new spot with a new weapon accordingly while the pure music filled the place and the rich picture of the stage glowed beneath it laura found herself face to face with the strange inference that the evil of selinas nature made her wishsince she had given herself to itto bring her sister to her own colour by putting an appearance of fastness upon her the girl said to herself that she would have succeeded in the cynical view of london and to her troubled spirit the immense theatre had a myriad eyes eyes that she knew eyes that would know her that would see her sitting there with a strange young man she had recognised many faces already and her imagination quickly multiplied them however after she had burned a while with this particular revolt she ceased to think of herself and of what as regarded herself selina had intended all her thought went to the mere calculation of mrs berringtons return as she did not return and still did not laura felt a sharp constriction of the heart she knew not what she fearedshe knew not what she supposed she was so nervous as she had been the night she waited till morning for her sister to reenter the house in grosvenor place that when mr wendover occasionally made a remark to her she failed to understand him was unable to answer him fortunately he made very few he was preoccupiedeither wondering also what selina was up to or more probably simply absorbed in the music what she had comprehended however was that when at three different moments she had said restlessly why doesnt mr booker come back he replied oh theres plenty of timewe are very comfortable these words she was conscious of she particularly noted them and they interwove themselves with her restlessness she also noted in her tension that after her third inquiry mr wendover said something about looking up his friend if she didnt mind being left alone a moment he quitted the box and during this interval laura tried more than ever to see with her glass what had become of her sister but it was as if the ladies opposite had arranged themselves had arranged their curtains on purpose to frustrate such an attempt it was impossible to her even to assure herself of what she had begun to suspect that selina was now not with them if she was not with them where in the world had she gone as the moments elapsed before mr wendovers return she went to the door of the box and stood watching the lobby for the chance that he would bring back the absentee presently she saw him coming alone and something in the expression of his face made her step out into the lobby to meet him he was smiling but he looked embarrassed and strange especially when he saw her standing there as if she wished to leave the place  i hope you dont want to go he said holding the door for her to pass back into the box  where are theywhere are they she demanded remaining in the corridor  i saw our friendhe has found a place in the stalls near the door by which you go into themjust here under us  and does he like that better  mr wendovers smile became perfunctory as he looked down at her mrs berrington has made such an amusing request of him  an amusing request  she made him promise not to come back  made him promise laura stared  she asked himas a particular favour to hernot to join us again and he said he wouldnt  ah the monster laura exclaimed blushing crimson  do you mean poor mr booker mr wendover asked of course he had to assure her that the wish of so lovely a lady was law but he doesnt understand laughed the young man  no more do i and where is the lovely lady said laura trying to recover herself  he hasnt the least idea  isnt she with lady ringrose  if you like i will go and see  laura hesitated looking down the curved lobby where there was nothing to see but the little numbered doors of the boxes they were alone in the lamplit bareness the finale of the act was ringing and booming behind them in a moment she said im afraid i must trouble you to put me into a cab  ah you wont see the rest do staywhat difference does it make and her companion still held open the door of the box her eyes met his in which it seemed to her that as well as in his voice there was conscious sympathy entreaty vindication tenderness then she gazed into the vulgar corridor again something said to her that if she should return she would be taking the most important step of her life she considered this and while she did so a great burst of applause filled the place as the curtain fell see what we are losing and the last act is so fine said mr wendover she returned to her seat and he closed the door of the box behind them  then in this little upholstered receptacle which was so public and yet so private laura wing passed through the strangest moments she had known an indication of their strangeness is that when she presently perceived that while she was in the lobby lady ringrose and her companion had quite disappeared she observed the circumstance without an exclamation holding herself silent their box was empty but laura looked at it without in the least feeling this to be a sign that selina would now come round she would never come round again nor would she have gone home from the opera that was by this time absolutely definite to the girl who had first been hot and now was cold with the sense of what selinas injunction to poor mr booker exactly meant it was worthy of her for it was simply a vicious little kick as she took her flight grosvenor place would not shelter her that night and would never shelter her more that was the reason she tried to spatter her sister with the mud into which she herself had jumped she would not have dared to treat her in such a fashion if they had had a prospect of meeting again the strangest part of this remarkable juncture was that what ministered most to our young ladys suppressed emotion was not the tremendous reflection that this time selina had really bolted and that on the morrow all london would know it all that had taken the glare of certainty and a very hideous hue it was whereas the chill that had fallen upon the girl now was that of a mystery which waited to be cleared up her heart was full of suspensesuspense of which she returned the pressure trying to twist it into expectation there was a certain chance in life that sat there beside her but it would go for ever if it should not move nearer that night and she listened she watched for it to move i need not inform the reader that this chance presented itself in the person of mr wendover who more than any one she knew had it in his hand to transmute her detestable position tomorrow he would know and would think sufficiently little of a young person of that breed therefore it could only be a question of his speaking on the spot that was what she had come back into the box forto give him his opportunity it was open to her to think he had asked for itadding everything together  the poor girl added added deep in her heart while she said nothing the music was not there now to keep them silent yet he remained quiet even as she did and that for some minutes was a part of her addition she felt as if she were running a race with failure and shame she would get in first if she should get in before the degradation of the morrow but this was not very far off and every minute brought it nearer it would be there in fact virtually that night if mr wendover should begin to realise the brutality of selinas not turning up at all the comfort had been hitherto that he didnt realise brutalities there were certain violins that emitted tentative sounds in the orchestra they shortened the time and made her uneasierfixed her idea that he could lift her out of her mire if he would it didnt appear to prove that he would his also observing lady ringroses empty box without making an encouraging comment upon it laura waited for him to remark that her sister obviously would turn up now but no such words fell from his lips he must either like selinas being away or judge it damningly and in either case why didnt he speak if he had nothing to say why had he said why had he done what did he mean but the girls inward challenge to him lost itself in a mist of faintness she was screwing herself up to a purpose of her own and it hurt almost to anguish and the whole place around her was a blur and swim through which she heard the tuning of fiddles before she knew it she had said to him why have you come so often  so often to see you do you mean  to see meit was for that why have you come she went on he was evidently surprised and his surprise gave her a point of anger a desire almost that her words should hurt him lash him she spoke low but she heard herself and she thought that if what she said sounded to him in the same way you have come very oftentoo often too often  he coloured he looked frightened he was clearly extremely startled why you have been so kind so delightful he stammered  yes of course and so have you did you come for selina she is married you know and devoted to her husband a single minute had sufficed to show the girl that her companion was quite unprepared for her question that he was distinctly not in love with her and was face to face with a situation entirely new the effect of this perception was to make her say wilder things  why what is more natural when one likes people than to come often perhaps i have bored youwith our american way said mr wendover  and is it because you like me that you have kept me here laura asked she got up leaning against the side of the box she had pulled the curtain far forward and was out of sight of the house  he rose but more slowly he had got over his first confusion he smiled at her but his smile was dreadful can you have any doubt as to what i have come for its a pleasure to me that you have liked me well enough to ask  for an instant she thought he was coming nearer to her but he didnt he stood there twirling his gloves then an unspeakable shame and horrorhorror of herself of him of everythingcame over her and she sank into a chair at the back of the box with averted eyes trying to get further into her corner leave me leave me go away she said in the lowest tone that he could hear the whole house seemed to her to be listening to her pressing into the box  leave you alonein this placewhen i love you i cant do thatindeed i cant  you dont love meand you torture me by staying laura went on in a convulsed voice for gods sake go away and dont speak to me dont let me see you or hear of you again  mr wendover still stood there exceedingly agitated as well he might be by this inconceivable scene unaccustomed feelings possessed him and they moved him in different directions her command that he should take himself off was passionate yet he attempted to resist to speak how would she get homewould she see him tomorrowwould she let him wait for her outside to this laura only replied oh dear oh dear if you would only go and at the same instant she sprang up gathering her cloak around her as if to escape from him to rush away herself he checked this movement however clapping on his hat and holding the door one moment more he looked at herher own eyes were closed then he exclaimed pitifully oh miss wing oh miss wing and stepped out of the box  when he had gone she collapsed into one of the chairs again and sat there with her face buried in a fold of her mantle for many minutes she was perfectly stillshe was ashamed even to move the one thing that could have justified her blown away the dishonour of her monstrous overture would have been on his side the quick response of unmistakable passion it had not come and she had nothing left but to loathe herself she did so violently for a long time in the dark corner of the box and she felt that he loathed her too i love youhow pitifully the poor little makebelieve words had quavered out and how much disgust they must have represented poor manpoor man laura wing suddenly found herself murmuring compassion filled her mind at the sense of the way she had used him at the same moment a flare of music broke out the last act of the opera had begun and she had sprung up and quitted the box  the passages were empty and she made her way without trouble she descended to the vestibule there was no one to stare at her and her only fear was that mr wendover would be there but he was not apparently and she saw that she should be able to go away quickly selina would have taken the carriageshe could be sure of that or if she hadnt it wouldnt have come back yet besides she couldnt possibly wait there so long as while it was called she was in the act of asking one of the attendants in the portico to get her a cab when some one hurried up to her from behind overtaking hera gentleman in whom turning round she recognised mr booker he looked almost as bewildered as mr wendover and his appearance disconcerted her almost as much as that of his friend would have done oh are you going away alone what must you think of me this young man exclaimed and he began to tell her something about her sister and to ask her at the same time if he might not go with herhelp her in some way he made no inquiry about mr wendover and she afterwards judged that that distracted gentleman had sought him out and sent him to her assistance also that he himself was at that moment watching them from behind some column he would have been hateful if he had shown himself yet in this later meditation there was a voice in her heart which commended his delicacy he effaced himself to look after herhe provided for her departure by proxy  a cab a cabthats all i want she said to mr booker and she almost pushed him out of the place with the wave of the hand with which she indicated her need he rushed off to call one and a minute afterwards the messenger whom she had already despatched rattled up in a hansom she quickly got into it and as she rolled away she saw mr booker returning in all haste with another she gave a passionate moanthis common confusion seemed to add a grotesqueness to her predicament     xii   the next day at five oclock she drove to queens gate turning to lady davenant in her distress in order to turn somewhere her old friend was at home and by extreme good fortune alone looking up from her book in her place by the window she gave the girl as she came in a sharp glance over her glasses this glance was acquisitive she said nothing but laying down her book stretched out her two gloved hands laura took them and she drew her down toward her so that the girl sunk on her knees and in a moment hid her face sobbing in the old womans lap there was nothing said for some time lady davenant only pressed her tenderlystroked her with her hands is it very bad she asked at last then laura got up saying as she took a seat have you heard of it and do people know it  i havent heard anything is it very bad lady davenant repeated  we dont know where selina isand her maids gone  lady davenant looked at her visitor a moment lord what an ass she then ejaculated putting the paperknife into her book to keep her place and whom has she persuaded to take hercharles crispin she added  we supposewe suppose said laura  and hes another interrupted the old woman and who supposesgeordie and ferdy  i dont know its all black darkness  my dear its a blessing and now you can live in peace  in peace cried laura with my wretched sister leading such a life  oh my dear i daresay it will be very comfortable i am sorry to say anything in favour of such doings but it very often is dont worry you take her too hard has she gone abroad the old lady continued i daresay she has gone to some pretty amusing place  i dont know anything about it i only know she is gone i was with her last evening and she left me without a word  well that was better i hate em when they make parting scenes its too mawkish  lionel has people watching them said the girl agents detectives i dont know what he has had them for a long time i didnt know it  do you mean you would have told her if you had what is the use of detectives now isnt he rid of her  oh i dont know hes as bad as she he talks too horriblyhe wants every one to know it laura groaned  and has he told his mother  i suppose so he rushed off to see her at noon shell be overwhelmed  overwhelmed not a bit of it cried lady davenant almost gaily when did anything in the world overwhelm her and what do you take her for shell only make some delightful odd speech as for people knowing it she added theyll know it whether he wants them or not my poor child how long do you expect to make believe  lionel expects some news tonight laura said as soon as i know where she is i shall start  start for where  to go to herto do something  something preposterous my dear do you expect to bring her back  he wont take her in said laura with her dried dismal eyes he wants his divorceits too hideous  well as she wants hers what is simpler  yes she wants hers lionel swears by all the gods she cant get it  bless me wont one do lady davenant asked we shall have some pretty reading  its awful awful awful murmured laura  yes they oughtnt to be allowed to publish them i wonder if we couldnt stop that at any rate he had better be quiet tell him to come and see me  you wont influence him hes dreadful against her such a house as it is today  well my dear naturally  yes but its terrible for me its all more sickening than i can bear  my dear child come and stay with me said the old woman gently  oh i cant desert her i cant abandon her  desertabandon what a way to put it hasnt she abandoned you  she has no heartshes too base said the girl her face was white and the tears now began to rise to her eyes again  lady davenant got up and came and sat on the sofa beside her she put her arms round her and the two women embraced your room is all ready the old lady remarked and then she said when did she leave you when did you see her last  oh in the strangest maddest crudest way the way most insulting to me we went to the opera together and she left me there with a gentleman we know nothing about her since  with a gentleman  with mr wendoverthat american and something too dreadful happened  dear me did he kiss you asked lady davenant  laura got up quickly turning away goodbye im going im going and in reply to an irritated protesting exclamation from her companion she went on anywhereanywhere to get away  to get away from your american  i asked him to marry me the girl turned round with her tragic face  he oughtnt to have left that to you  i knew this horror was coming and it took possession of me there in the box from one moment to the otherthe idea of making sure of some other life some protection some respectability first i thought he liked me he had behaved as if he did and i like him he is a very good man so i asked him i couldnt help it it was too hideousi offered myself laura spoke as if she were telling that she had stabbed him standing there with dilated eyes  lady davenant got up again and went to her drawing off her glove she felt her cheek with the back of her hand you are ill you are in a fever im sure that whatever you said it was very charming  yes i am ill said laura  upon my honour you shant go home you shall go straight to bed and what did he say to you  oh it was too miserable cried the girl pressing her face again into her companions kerchief i was all all mistaken he had never thought  why the deuce then did he run about that way after you he was a brute to say it  he didnt say it and he never ran about he behaved like a perfect gentleman  ive no patiencei wish i had seen him that time lady davenant declared  yes that would have been nice youll never see him if he is a gentleman hell rush away  bless me what a rushing away murmured the old woman then passing her arm round laura she added youll please to come upstairs with me  half an hour later she had some conversation with her butler which led to his consulting a little register into which it was his law to transcribe with great neatness from their cards the addresses of new visitors this volume kept in the drawer of the hall table revealed the fact that mr wendover was staying in george street hanover square get into a cab immediately and tell him to come and see me this evening lady davenant said make him understand that it interests him very nearly so that no matter what his engagements may be he must give them up go quickly and youll just find him hell be sure to be at home to dress for dinner she had calculated justly for a few minutes before ten oclock the door of her drawingroom was thrown open and mr wendover was announced  sit there said the old lady no not that one nearer to me we must talk low my dear sir i wont bite you  oh this is very comfortable mr wendover replied vaguely smiling through his visible anxiety it was no more than natural that he should wonder what laura wings peremptory friend wanted of him at that hour of the night but nothing could exceed the gallantry of his attempt to conceal the symptoms of alarm  you ought to have come before you know lady davenant went on i have wanted to see you more than once  i have been dining outi hurried away this was the first possible moment i assure you  i too was dining out and i stopped at home on purpose to see you but i didnt mean tonight for you have done very well i was quite intending to send for youthe other day but something put it out of my head besides i knew she wouldnt like it  why lady davenant i made a point of calling ever so long agoafter that day the young man exclaimed not reassured or at any rate not enlightened  i daresay you didbut you mustnt justify yourself thats just what i dont want it isnt what i sent for you for i have something very particular to say to you but its very difficult voyons un peu  the old woman reflected a little with her eyes on his face which had grown more grave as she went on its expression intimated that he failed as yet to understand her and that he at least was not exactly trifling lady davenants musings apparently helped her little if she was looking for an artful approach for they ended in her saying abruptly i wonder if you know what a capital girl she is  do you meando you mean stammered mr wendover pausing as if he had given her no right not to allow him to conceive alternatives  yes i do mean shes upstairs in bed  upstairs in bed the young man stared  dont be afraidim not going to send for her laughed his hostess her being here after all has nothing to do with it except that she did comeyes certainly she did come but my keeping herthat was my doing my maid has gone to grosvenor place to get her things and let them know that she will stay here for the present now am i clear  not in the least said mr wendover almost sternly  lady davenant however was not of a composition to suspect him of sternness or to care very much if she did and she went on with her quick discursiveness well we must be patient we shall work it out together i was afraid you would go away thats why i lost no time above all i want you to understand that she has not the least idea that i have sent for you and you must promise me never never never to let her know she would be monstrous angry it is quite my own ideai have taken the responsibility i know very little about you of course but she has spoken to me well of you besides i am very clever about people and i liked you that day though you seemed to think i was a hundred and eighty  you do me great honour mr wendover rejoined  im glad youre pleased you must be if i tell you that i like you now even better i see what you are except for the question of fortune it doesnt perhaps matter much but have you any money i mean have you a fine income  no indeed i havent and the young man laughed in his bewilderment i have very little money indeed  well i daresay you have as much as i besides that would be a proof she is not mercenary  you havent in the least made it plain whom you are talking about said mr wendover i have no right to assume anything  are you afraid of betraying her i am more devoted to her even than i want you to be she has told me what happened between you last nightwhat she said to you at the opera thats what i want to talk to you about  she was very strange the young man remarked  i am not so sure that she was strange however you are welcome to think it for goodness knows she says so herself she is overwhelmed with horror at her own words she is absolutely distracted and prostrate  mr wendover was silent a moment i assured her that i admire herbeyond every one i was most kind to her  did you say it in that tone you should have thrown yourself at her feet from the moment you didntsurely you understand women well enough to know  you must remember where we werein a public place with very little room for throwing mr wendover exclaimed  ah so far from blaming you she says your behaviour was perfect its only i who want to have it out with you lady davenant pursued shes so clever so charming so good and so unhappy  when i said just now she was strange i meant only in the way she turned against me  she turned against you  she told me she hoped she should never see me again  and you should you like to see her  not nownot now mr wendover exclaimed eagerly  i dont mean now im not such a fool as that i mean some day or other when she has stopped accusing herself if she ever does  ah lady davenant you must leave that to me the young man returned after a moments hesitation  dont be afraid to tell me im meddling with what doesnt concern me said his hostess of course i know im meddling i sent for you here to meddle who wouldnt for that creature she makes one melt  im exceedingly sorry for her i dont know what she thinks she said  well that she asked you why you came so often to grosvenor place i dont see anything so awful in that if you did go  yes i went very often i liked to go  now thats exactly where i wish to prevent a misconception said lady davenant if you liked to go you had a reason for liking and laura wing was the reason wasnt she  i thought her charming and i think her so now more than ever  then you are a dear good man vous faisiez votre cour in short  mr wendover made no immediate response the two sat looking at each other it isnt easy for me to talk of these things he said at last but if you mean that i wished to ask her to be my wife i am bound to tell you that i had no such intention  ah then im at sea you thought her charming and you went to see her every day what then did you wish  i didnt go every day moreover i think you have a very different idea in this country of what constituteswell what constitutes making love a man commits himself much sooner  oh i dont know what your odd ways may be lady davenant exclaimed with a shade of irritation  yes but i was justified in supposing that those ladies did they at least are american  they my dear sir for heavens sake dont mix up that nasty selina with it  why not if i admired her too i do extremely and i thought the house most interesting  mercy on us if thats your idea of a nice house but i dont knowi have always kept out of it lady davenant added checking herself then she went on if you are so fond of mrs berrington i am sorry to inform you that she is absolutely goodfornothing  goodfornothing  nothing to speak of i have been thinking whether i would tell you and i have decided to do so because i take it that your learning it for yourself would be a matter of but a very short time selina has bolted as they say  bolted mr wendover repeated  i dont know what you call it in america  in america we dont do it  ah well if they stay as they do usually abroad thats better i suppose you didnt think her capable of behaving herself did you  do you mean she has left her husbandwith some one else  neither more nor less with a fellow named crispin it appears it all came off last evening and she had her own reasons for doing it in the most offensive waypublicly clumsily with the vulgarest bravado laura has told me what took place and you must permit me to express my surprise at your not having divined the miserable business  i saw something was wrong but i didnt understand im afraid im not very quick at these things  your state is the more gracious but certainly you are not quick if you could call there so often and not see through selina  mr crispin whoever he is was never there said the young man  oh she was a clever hussy his companion rejoined  i knew she was fond of amusement but thats what i liked to see i wanted to see a house of that sort  fond of amusement is a very pretty phrase said lady davenant laughing at the simplicity with which her visitor accounted for his assiduity and did laura wing seem to you in her place in a house of that sort  why it was natural she should be with her sister and she always struck me as very gay  that was your enlivening effect and did she strike you as very gay last night with this scandal hanging over her  she didnt talk much said mr wendover  she knew it was comingshe felt it she saw it and thats what makes her sick now that at such a time she should have challenged you when she felt herself about to be associated in peoples minds of course with such a vile business in peoples minds and in yourswhen you should know what had happened  ah miss wing isnt associated said mr wendover he spoke slowly but he rose to his feet with a nervous movement that was not lost upon his companion she noted it indeed with a certain inward sense of triumph she was very deep but she had never been so deep as when she made up her mind to mention the scandal of the house of berrington to her visitor and intimated to him that laura wing regarded herself as near enough to it to receive from it a personal stain im extremely sorry to hear of mrs berringtons misconduct he continued gravely standing before her and i am no less obliged to you for your interest  dont mention it she said getting up too and smiling i mean my interest as for the other matter it will all come out lionel will haul her up  dear me how dreadful  yes dreadful enough but dont betray me  betray you he repeated as if his thoughts had gone astray a moment  i mean to the girl think of her shame  her shame mr wendover said in the same way  it seemed to her with what was becoming so clear to her that an honest man might save her from it might give her his name and his faith and help her to traverse the bad place she exaggerates the badness of it the stigma of her relationship good heavens at that rate where would some of us be but those are her ideas they are absolutely sincere and they had possession of her at the opera she had a sense of being lost and was in a real agony to be rescued she saw before her a kind gentleman who had seemedwho had certainly seemed and lady davenant with her fine old face lighted by her bright sagacity and her eyes on mr wendovers paused lingering on this word of course she must have been in a state of nerves  i am very sorry for her said mr wendover with his gravity that committed him to nothing  so am i and of course if you were not in love with her you werent were you  i must bid you goodbye i am leaving london that was the only answer lady davenant got to her inquiry  goodbye then she is the nicest girl i know but once more mind you dont let her suspect  how can i let her suspect anything when i shall never see her again  oh dont say that said lady davenant very gently  she drove me away from her with a kind of ferocity  oh gammon cried the old woman  im going home he said looking at her with his hand on the door  well its the best place for you and for her too she added as he went out she was not sure that the last words reached him     xiii   laura wing was sharply ill for three days but on the fourth she made up her mind she was better though this was not the opinion of lady davenant who would not hear of her getting up the remedy she urged was lying still and yet lying still but this specific the girl found wellnigh intolerableit was a form of relief that only ministered to fever she assured her friend that it killed her to do nothing to which her friend replied by asking her what she had a fancy to do laura had her idea and held it tight but there was no use in producing it before lady davenant who would have knocked it to pieces on the afternoon of the first day lionel berrington came and though his intention was honest he brought no healing hearing she was ill he wanted to look after herhe wanted to take her back to grosvenor place and make her comfortable he spoke as if he had every convenience for producing that condition though he confessed there was a little bar to it in his own case this impediment was the cheeky aspect of miss steet who went sniffing about as if she knew a lot if she should only condescend to tell it he saw more of the children now im going to have em in every day poor little devils he said and he spoke as if the discipline of suffering had already begun for him and a kind of holy change had taken place in his life nothing had been said yet in the house of course as laura knew about selinas disappearance in the way of treating it as irregular but the servants pretended so hard not to be aware of anything in particular that they were like pickpockets looking with unnatural interest the other way after they have cribbed a fellows watch to a certainty in a day or two the governess would give him warning she would come and tell him she couldnt stay in such a place and he would tell her in return that she was a little donkey for not knowing that the place was much more respectable now than it had ever been  this information selinas husband imparted to lady davenant to whom he discoursed with infinite candour and humour taking a highly philosophical view of his position and declaring that it suited him down to the ground his wife couldnt have pleased him better if she had done it on purpose he knew where she had been every hour since she quitted laura at the operahe knew where she was at that moment and he was expecting to find another telegram on his return to grosvenor place so if it suited her it was all right wasnt it and the whole thing would go as straight as a shot lady davenant took him up to see laura though she viewed their meeting with extreme disfavour the girl being in no state for talking in general laura had little enough mind for it but she insisted on seeing lionel she declared that if this were not allowed her she would go after him ill as she wasshe would dress herself and drive to his house she dressed herself now after a fashion she got upon a sofa to receive him lady davenant left him alone with her for twenty minutes at the end of which she returned to take him away this interview was not fortifying to the girl whose ideathe idea of which i have said that she was tenaciouswas to go after her sister to take possession of her cling to her and bring her back lionel of course wouldnt hear of taking her back nor would selina presumably hear of coming but this made no difference in lauras heroic plan she would work it she would compass it she would go down on her knees she would find the eloquence of angels she would achieve miracles at any rate it made her frantic not to try especially as even in fruitless action she should escape from herselfan object of which her horror was not yet extinguished  as she lay there through inexorably conscious hours the picture of that hideous moment in the box alternated with the vision of her sisters guilty flight she wanted to fly herselfto go off and keep going for ever lionel was fussily kind to her and he didnt abuse selinahe didnt tell her again how that ladys behaviour suited his book he simply resisted with a little exasperating dogged grin her pitiful appeal for knowledge of her sisters whereabouts he knew what she wanted it for and he wouldnt help her in any such game if she would promise solemnly to be quiet he would tell her when she got better but he wouldnt lend her a hand to make a fool of herself her work was cut out for hershe was to stay and mind the children if she was so keen to do her duty she neednt go further than that for it he talked a great deal about the children and figured himself as pressing the little deserted darlings to his bosom he was not a comedian and she could see that he really believed he was going to be better and purer now laura said she was sure selina would make an attempt to get themor at least one of them and he replied grimly yes my dear she had better try the girl was so angry with him in her hot tossing weakness for refusing to tell her even whether the desperate pair had crossed the channel that she was guilty of the immorality of regretting that the difference in badness between husband and wife was so distinct for it was distinct she could see that as he made his dry little remark about selinas trying he told her he had already seen his solicitor the clever mr smallshaw and she said she didnt care  on the fourth day of her absence from grosvenor place she got up at an hour when she was alone in the afternoon rather late and prepared herself to go out lady davenant had admitted in the morning that she was better and fortunately she had not the complication of being subject to a medical opinion having absolutely refused to see a doctor her old friend had been obliged to go outshe had scarcely quitted her beforeand laura had requested the hovering rustling ladysmaid to leave her alone she assured her she was doing beautifully laura had no plan except to leave london that night she had a moral certainty that selina had gone to the continent she had always done so whenever she had a chance and what chance had ever been larger than the present the continent was fearfully vague but she would deal sharply with lionelshe would show him she had a right to knowledge he would certainly be in town he would be in a complacent bustle with his lawyers she had told him that she didnt believe he had yet gone to them but in her heart she believed it perfectly if he didnt satisfy her she would go to lady ringrose odious as it would be to her to ask a favour of this depraved creature unless indeed lady ringrose had joined the little party to france as on the occasion of selinas last journey thither on her way downstairs she met one of the footmen of whom she made the request that he would call her a cab as quickly as possibleshe was obliged to go out for half an hour he expressed the respectful hope that she was better and she replied that she was perfectly wellhe would please tell her ladyship when she came in to this the footman rejoined that her ladyship had come inshe had returned five minutes before and had gone to her room miss frothingham told her you were asleep miss said the man and her ladyship said it was a blessing and you were not to be disturbed  very good i will see her laura remarked with dissimulation only please let me have my cab  the footman went downstairs and she stood there listening presently she heard the housedoor closehe had gone out on his errand then she descended very softlyshe prayed he might not be long the door of the drawingroom stood open as she passed it and she paused before it thinking she heard sounds in the lower hall they appeared to subside and then she found herself faintshe was terribly impatient for her cab partly to sit down till it came there was a seat on the landing but another servant might come up or down and see her and partly to look at the front window whether it were not coming she went for a moment into the drawingroom she stood at the window but the footman was slow then she sank upon a chairshe felt very weak just after she had done so she became aware of steps on the stairs and she got up quickly supposing that her messenger had returned though she had not heard wheels what she saw was not the footman she had sent out but the expansive person of the butler followed apparently by a visitor this functionary ushered the visitor in with the remark that he would call her ladyship and before she knew it she was face to face with mr wendover at the same moment she heard a cab drive up while mr wendover instantly closed the door  dont turn me away do see medo see me he said i asked for lady davenantthey told me she was at home but it was you i wanted and i wanted her to help me i was going awaybut i couldnt you look very illdo listen to me you dont understandi will explain everything ah how ill you look the young man cried as the climax of this sudden soft distressed appeal laura for all answer tried to push past him but the result of this movement was that she found herself enclosed in his arms he stopped her but she disengaged herself she got her hand upon the door he was leaning against it so she couldnt open it and as she stood there panting she shut her eyes so as not to see him if you would let me tell you what i thinki would do anything in the world for you he went on  let me goyou persecute me the girl cried pulling at the handle  you dont do me justiceyou are too cruel mr wendover persisted  let me golet me go she only repeated with her high quavering distracted note and as he moved a little she got the door open but he followed her out would she see him that night where was she going might he not go with her would she see him tomorrow  never never never she flung at him as she hurried away the butler was on the stairs descending from above so he checked himself letting her go laura passed out of the house and flew into her cab with extraordinary speed for mr wendover heard the wheels bear her away while the servant was saying to him in measured accents that her ladyship would come down immediately  lionel was at home in grosvenor place she burst into the library and found him playing papa geordie and ferdy were sporting around him the presence of miss steet had been dispensed with and he was holding his younger son by the stomach horizontally between his legs while the child made little sprawling movements which were apparently intended to represent the act of swimming geordie stood impatient on the brink of the imaginary stream protesting that it was his turn now and as soon as he saw his aunt he rushed at her with the request that she would take him up in the same fashion she was struck with the superficiality of their childhood they appeared to have no sense that she had been away and no care that she had been ill but lionel made up for this he greeted her with affectionate jollity said it was a good job she had come back and remarked to the children that they would have great larks now that auntie was home again ferdy asked if she had been with mummy but didnt wait for an answer and she observed that they put no question about their mother and made no further allusion to her while they remained in the room she wondered whether their father had enjoined upon them not to mention her and reflected that even if he had such a command would not have been efficacious it added to the ugliness of selinas flight that even her children didnt miss her and to the dreariness somehow to lauras sense of the whole situation that one could neither spend tears on the mother and wife because she was not worth it nor sentimentalise about the little boys because they didnt inspire it well you do look seedyim bound to say that lionel exclaimed and he recommended strongly a glass of port while ferdy not seizing this reference suggested that daddy should take her by the waistband and teach her to strike out he represented himself in the act of drowning but laura interrupted this entertainment when the servant answered the bell lionel having rung for the port by requesting that the children should be conveyed to miss steet tell her she must never go away again lionel said to geordie as the butler took him by the hand but the only touching consequence of this injunction was that the child piped back to his father over his shoulder well you mustnt either you know  you must tell me or ill kill myselfi give you my word laura said to her brotherinlaw with unnecessary violence as soon as they had left the room  i say i say he rejoined you are a wilful one what do you want to threaten me for dont you know me well enough to know that aint the way thats the tone selina used to take surely you dont want to begin and imitate her she only sat there looking at him while he leaned against the chimneypiece smoking a short cigar there was a silence during which she felt the heat of a certain irrational anger at the thought that a little ignorant redfaced jockey should have the luck to be in the right as against her flesh and blood she considered him helplessly with something in her eyes that had never been there beforesomething that apparently after a moment made an impression on him afterwards however she saw very well that it was not her threat that had moved him and even at the moment she had a sense from the way he looked back at her that this was in no manner the first time a baffled woman had told him that she would kill herself he had always accepted his kinship with her but even in her trouble it was part of her consciousness that he now lumped her with a mixed group of female figures a little wavering and dim who were associated in his memory with scenes with importunities and bothers it is apt to be the disadvantage of women on occasions of measuring their strength with men that they may perceive that the man has a larger experience and that they themselves are a part of it it is doubtless as a provision against such emergencies that nature has opened to them operations of the mind that are independent of experience laura felt the dishonour of her race the more that her brotherinlaw seemed so gay and bright about it he had an air of positive prosperity as if his misfortune had turned into that it came to her that he really liked the idea of the public éclaircissementthe fresh occupation the bustle and importance and celebrity of it that was sufficiently incredible but as she was on the wrong side it was also humiliating besides higher spirits always suggest finer wisdom and such an attribute on lionels part was most humiliating of all i havent the least objection at present to telling you what you want to know i shall have made my little arrangements very soon and you will be subpoenaed  subpoenaed the girl repeated mechanically  you will be called as a witness on my side  on your side  of course youre on my side aint you  can they force me to come asked laura in answer to this  no they cant force you if you leave the country  thats exactly what i want to do  that will be idiotic said lionel and very bad for your sister if you dont help me you ought at least to help her  she sat a moment with her eyes on the ground where is shewhere is she she then asked  they are at brussels at the hôtel de flandres they appear to like it very much  are you telling me the truth  lord my dear child i dont lie lionel exclaimed youll make a jolly mistake if you go to her he added if you have seen her with him how can you speak for her  i wont see her with him  thats all very well but hell take care of that of course if youre ready for perjury lionel exclaimed  im ready for anything  well ive been kind to you my dear he continued smoking with his chin in the air  certainly you have been kind to me  if you want to defend her you had better keep away from her said lionel besides for yourself it wont be the best thing in the worldto be known to have been in it  i dont care about myself the girl returned musingly  dont you care about the children that you are so ready to throw them over for you would my dear you know if you go to brussels you never come back hereyou never cross this thresholdyou never touch them again  laura appeared to listen to this last declaration but she made no reply to it she only exclaimed after a moment with a certain impatience oh the children will do anyway then she added passionately you wont lionel in mercys name tell me that you wont  i wont what  do the awful thing you say  divorce her the devil i wont  then why do you speak of the childrenif you have no pity for them  lionel stared an instant i thought you said yourself that they would do anyway  laura bent her head resting it on the back of her hand on the leathern arm of the sofa so she remained while lionel stood smoking but at last to leave the room she got up with an effort that was a physical pain he came to her to detain her with a little good intention that had no felicity for her trying to take her hand persuasively dear old girl dont try and behave just as she did if youll stay quietly here i wont call you i give you my honour i wont there you want to see the doctorthats the fellow you want to see and what good will it do you even if you bring her home in pink paper do you candidly suppose ill ever look at herexcept across the courtroom  i must i must i must laura cried jerking herself away from him and reaching the door  well then goodbye he said in the sternest tone she had ever heard him use  she made no answer she only escaped she locked herself in her room she remained there an hour at the end of this time she came out and went to the door of the schoolroom where she asked miss steet to be so good as to come and speak to her the governess followed her to her apartment and there laura took her partly into her confidence there were things she wanted to do before going and she was too weak to act without assistance she didnt want it from the servants if only miss steet would learn from them whether mr berrington were dining at home laura told her that her sister was ill and she was hurrying to join her abroad it had to be mentioned that way that mrs berrington had left the country though of course there was no spoken recognition between the two women of the reasons for which she had done so there was only a tacit hypocritical assumption that she was on a visit to friends and that there had been nothing queer about her departure laura knew that miss steet knew the truth and the governess knew that she knew it this young woman lent a hand very confusedly to the girls preparations she ventured not to be sympathetic as that would point too much to badness but she succeeded perfectly in being dismal she suggested that laura was ill herself but laura replied that this was no matter when her sister was so much worse she elicited the fact that mr berrington was dining outthe butler believed with his motherbut she was of no use when it came to finding in the bradshaw which she brought up from the hall the hour of the nightboat to ostend laura found it herself it was conveniently late and it was a gain to her that she was very near the victoria station where she would take the train for dover the governess wanted to go to the station with her but the girl would not listen to thisshe would only allow her to see that she had a cab laura let her help her still further she sent her down to talk to lady davenants maid when that personage arrived in grosvenor place to inquire from her mistress what in the world had become of poor miss wing the maid intimated miss steet said on her return that her ladyship would have come herself only she was too angry she was very bad indeed it was an indication of this that she had sent back her young friends dressingcase and her clothes laura also borrowed money from the governessshe had too little in her pocket the latter brightened up as the preparations advanced she had never before been concerned in a flurried nightepisode with an unavowed clandestine side the very imprudence of it for a sick girl alone was romantic and before laura had gone down to the cab she began to say that foreign life must be fascinating and to make wistful reflections she saw that the coast was clear in the nurserythat the children were asleep for their aunt to come in she kissed ferdy while her companion pressed her lips upon geordie and geordie while laura hung for a moment over ferdy at the door of the cab she tried to make her take more money and our heroine had an odd sense that if the vehicle had not rolled away she would have thrust into her hand a keepsake for captain crispin  a quarter of an hour later laura sat in the corner of a railwaycarriage muffled in her cloak the july evening was fresh as it so often is in londonfresh enough to add to her sombre thoughts the suggestion of the wind in the channel waiting in a vain torment of nervousness for the train to set itself in motion her nervousness itself had led her to come too early to the station and it seemed to her that she had already waited long a lady and a gentleman had taken their place in the carriage it was not yet the moment for the outward crowd of tourists and had left their appurtenances there while they strolled up and down the platform the long english twilight was still in the air but there was dusk under the grimy arch of the station and laura flattered herself that the offcorner of the carriage she had chosen was in shadow this however apparently did not prevent her from being recognised by a gentleman who stopped at the door looking in with the movement of a person who was going from carriage to carriage as soon as he saw her he stepped quickly in and the next moment mr wendover was seated on the edge of the place beside her leaning toward her speaking to her low with clasped hands she fell back in her seat closing her eyes again he barred the way out of the compartment  i have followed you herei saw miss steeti want to implore you not to go dont dont i know what youre doing dont go i beseech you i saw lady davenant i wanted to ask her to help me i could bear it no longer i have thought of you night and day these four days lady davenant has told me things and i entreat you not to go  laura opened her eyes there was something in his voice in his pressing nearness and looked at him a moment it was the first time she had done so since the first of those detestable moments in the box at covent garden she had never spoken to him of selina in any but an honourable sense now she said im going to my sister  i know it and i wish unspeakably you would give it upit isnt goodits a great mistake stay here and let me talk to you  the girl raised herself she stood up in the carriage mr wendover did the same laura saw that the lady and gentleman outside were now standing near the door what have you to say its my own business she returned between her teeth go out go out go out  do you suppose i would speak if i didnt caredo you suppose i would care if i didnt love you the young man murmured close to her face  what is there to care about because people will know it and talk if its bad its the right thing for me if i dont go to her where else shall i go  come to me dearest dearest mr wendover went on you are ill you are mad i love youi assure you i do  she pushed him away with her hands if you follow me i will jump off the boat  take your places take your places cried the guard on the platform mr wendover had to slip out the lady and gentleman were coming in laura huddled herself into her corner again and presently the train drew away  mr wendover did not get into another compartment he went back that evening to queens gate he knew how interested his old friend there as he now considered her would be to hear what laura had undertaken though as he learned on entering her drawingroom again she had already heard of it from her maid and he felt the necessity to tell her once more how her words of four days before had fructified in his heart what a strange ineffaceable impression she had made upon him to tell her in short and to repeat it over and over that he had taken the most extraordinary fancy lady davenant was tremendously vexed at the girls perversity but she counselled him patience a long persistent patience a week later she heard from laura wing from antwerp that she was sailing to america from that porta letter containing no mention whatever of selina or of the reception she had found at brussels to america mr wendover followed his young compatriot that at least she had no right to forbid and there for the moment he has had a chance to practise the humble virtue recommended by lady davenant he knows she has no money and that she is staying with some distant relatives in virginia a situation that heperhaps too superficiallyfigures as unspeakably dreary he knows further that lady davenant has sent her fifty pounds and he himself has ideas of transmitting funds not directly to virginia but by the roundabout road of queens gate now however that lionel berringtons deplorable suit is coming on he reflects with some satisfaction that the court of probate and divorce is far from the banks of the rappahannock berrington versus berrington and others is coming onbut these are matters of the present hour     the patagonia     i   the houses were dark in the august night and the perspective of beacon street with its double chain of lamps was a foreshortened desert the club on the hill alone from its semicylindrical front projected a glow upon the dusky vagueness of the common and as i passed it i heard in the hot stillness the click of a pair of billiard balls as every one was out of town perhaps the servants in the extravagance of their leisure were profaning the tables the heat was insufferable and i thought with joy of the morrow of the deck of the steamer the freshening breeze the sense of getting out to sea i was even glad of what i had learned in the afternoon at the office of the companythat at the eleventh hour an old ship with a lower standard of speed had been put on in place of the vessel in which i had taken my passage america was roasting england might very well be stuffy and a slow passage which at that season of the year would probably also be a fine one was a guarantee of ten or twelve days of fresh air  i strolled down the hill without meeting a creature though i could see through the palings of the common that that recreative expanse was peopled with dim forms i remembered mrs nettlepoints houseshe lived in those days they are not so distant but there have been changes on the waterside a little way beyond the spot at which the public garden terminates and i reflected that like myself she would be spending the night in boston if it were true that as had been mentioned to me a few days before at mount desert she was to embark on the morrow for liverpool i presently saw this appearance confirmed by a light above her door and in two or three of her windows and i determined to ask for her having nothing to do till bedtime i had come out simply to pass an hour leaving my hotel to the blaze of its gas and the perspiration of its porters but it occurred to me that my old friend might very well not know of the substitution of the patagonia for the scandinavia so that it would be an act of consideration to prepare her mind besides i could offer to help her to look after her in the morning lone women are grateful for support in taking ship for far countries  as i stood on her doorstep i remembered that as she had a son she might not after all be so lone yet at the same time it was present to me that jasper nettlepoint was not quite a young man to lean upon having as i at least supposed a life of his own and tastes and habits which had long since drawn him away from the maternal side if he did happen just now to be at home my solicitude would of course seem officious for in his many wanderingsi believed he had roamed all over the globehe would certainly have learned how to manage none the less i was very glad to show mrs nettlepoint i thought of her with my long absence i had lost sight of her but i had liked her of old she had been a close friend of my sisters and i had in regard to her that sense which is pleasant to those who in general have grown strange or detachedthe feeling that she at least knew all about me i could trust her at any time to tell people what a respectable person i was perhaps i was conscious of how little i deserved this indulgence when it came over me that for years i had not communicated with her the measure of this neglect was given by my vagueness of mind about her son however i really belonged nowadays to a different generation i was more the old ladys contemporary than jaspers  mrs nettlepoint was at home i found her in her back drawingroom where the wide windows opened upon the water the room was duskyit was too hot for lampsand she sat slowly moving her fan and looking out on the little arm of the sea which is so pretty at night reflecting the lights of cambridgeport and charlestown i supposed she was musing upon the loved ones she was to leave behind her married daughters her grandchildren but she struck a note more specifically bostonian as she said to me pointing with her fan to the back bayi shall see nothing more charming than that over there you know she made me very welcome but her son had told her about the patagonia for which she was sorry as this would mean a longer voyage she was a poor creature on shipboard and mainly confined to her cabin even in weather extravagantly termed fineas if any weather could be fine at sea  ah then your sons going with you i asked  here he comes he will tell you for himself much better than i am able to do  jasper nettlepoint came into the room at that moment dressed in white flannel and carrying a large fan  well my dear have you decided his mother continued with some irony in her tone he hasnt yet made up his mind and we sail at ten oclock  what does it matter when my things are put up said the young man there is no crowd at this moment there will be cabins to spare im waiting for a telegramthat will settle it i just walked up to the club to see if it was cometheyll send it there because they think the house is closed not yet but i shall go back in twenty minutes  mercy how you rush about in this temperature his mother exclaimed while i reflected that it was perhaps his billiardballs i had heard ten minutes before i was sure he was fond of billiards  rush not in the least i take it uncommonly easy  ah im bound to say you do mrs nettlepoint exclaimed inconsequently i divined that there was a certain tension between the pair and a want of consideration on the young mans part arising perhaps from selfishness his mother was nervous in suspense wanting to be at rest as to whether she should have his company on the voyage or be obliged to make it alone but as he stood there smiling and slowly moving his fan he struck me somehow as a person on whom this fact would not sit very heavily he was of the type of those whom other people worry about not of those who worry about other people tall and strong he had a handsome face with a round head and closecurling hair the whites of his eyes and the enamel of his teeth under his brown moustache gleamed vaguely in the lights of the back bay i made out that he was sunburnt as if he lived much in the open air and that he looked intelligent but also slightly brutal though not in a morose way his brutality if he had any was bright and finished i had to tell him who i was but even then i saw that he failed to place me and that my explanations gave me in his mind no great identity or at any rate no great importance i foresaw that he would in intercourse make me feel sometimes very young and sometimes very old he mentioned as if to show his mother that he might safely be left to his own devices that he had once started from london to bombay at threequarters of an hours notice  yes and it must have been pleasant for the people you were with  oh the people i was with he rejoined and his tone appeared to signify that such people would always have to come off as they could he asked if there were no cold drinks in the house no lemonade no iced syrups in such weather something of that sort ought always to be kept going when his mother remarked that surely at the club they were going he went on oh yes i had various things there but you know i have walked down the hill since one should have something at either end may i ring and see he rang while mrs nettlepoint observed that with the people they had in the housean establishment reduced naturally at such a moment to its simplest expression they were burningup candleends and there were no luxuries she would not answer for the service the matter ended in the old ladys going out of the room in quest of syrup with the female domestic who had appeared in response to the bell and in whom jaspers appeal aroused no visible intelligence  she remained away some time and i talked with her son who was sociable but desultory and kept moving about the room always with his fan as if he were impatient sometimes he seated himself for an instant on the windowsill and then i saw that he was in fact very goodlooking a fine brown clean young athlete he never told me on what special contingency his decision depended he only alluded familiarly to an expected telegram and i perceived that he was probably not addicted to copious explanations his mothers absence was an indication that when it was a question of gratifying him she had grown used to spare no pains and i fancied her rummaging in some close storeroom among old preservepots while the dull maidservant held the candle awry i know not whether this same vision was in his own eyes at all events it did not prevent him from saying suddenly as he looked at his watch that i must excuse him as he had to go back to the club he would return in half an houror in less he walked away and i sat there alone conscious in the dark dismantled simplified room in the deep silence that rests on american towns during the hot season there was now and then a far cry or a plash in the water and at intervals the tinkle of the bells of the horsecars on the long bridge slow in the suffocating night of the strange influence half sweet half sad that abides in houses uninhabited or about to become soin places muffled and bereaved where the unheeded sofas and patient belittered tables seem to know like the disconcerted dogs that it is the eve of a journey  after a while i heard the sound of voices of steps the rustle of dresses and i looked round supposing these things to be the sign of the return of mrs nettlepoint and her handmaiden bearing the refreshment prepared for her son what i saw however was two other female forms visitors just admitted apparently who were ushered into the room they were not announcedthe servant turned her back on them and rambled off to our hostess they came forward in a wavering tentative unintroduced waypartly i could see because the place was dark and partly because their visit was in its nature experimental a stretch of confidence one of the ladies was stout and the other was slim and i perceived in a moment that one was talkative and the other silent i made out further that one was elderly and the other young and that the fact that they were so unlike did not prevent their being mother and daughter mrs nettlepoint reappeared in a very few minutes but the interval had sufficed to establish a communication really copious for the occasion between the strangers and the unknown gentleman whom they found in possession hat and stick in hand this was not my doing for what had i to go upon and still less was it the doing of the person whom i supposed and whom i indeed quickly and definitely learned to be the daughter she spoke but oncewhen her companion informed me that she was going out to europe the next day to be married then she said oh mother protestingly in a tone which struck me in the darkness as doubly strange exciting my curiosity to see her face  it had taken her mother but a moment to come to that and to other things besides after i had explained that i myself was waiting for mrs nettlepoint who would doubtless soon come back  well she wont know mei guess she hasnt ever heard much about me the good lady said but i have come from mrs allen and i guess that will make it all right i presume you know mrs allen  i was unacquainted with this influential personage but i assented vaguely to the proposition mrs allens emissary was goodhumoured and familiar but rather appealing than insistent she remarked that if her friend had found time to come in the afternoonshe had so much to do being just up for the day that she couldnt be sureit would be all right and somehow even before she mentioned merrimac avenue they had come all the way from there my imagination had associated her with that indefinite social limbo known to the properlyconstituted boston mind as the south enda nebulous region which condenses here and there into a pretty face in which the daughters are an improvement on the mothers and are sometimes acquainted with gentlemen resident in more distinguished districts of the new england capitalgentlemen whose wives and sisters in turn are not acquainted with them  when at last mrs nettlepoint came in accompanied by candles and by a tray laden with glasses of coloured fluid which emitted a cool tinkling i was in a position to officiate as master of the ceremonies to introduce mrs mavis and miss grace mavis to represent that mrs allen had recommended themnay had urged themto come that way informally and had been prevented only by the pressure of occupations so characteristic of her especially when she was up from mattapoisett just for a few hours shopping from herself calling in the course of the day to explain who they were and what was the favour they had to ask of mrs nettlepoint goodnatured women understand each other even when divided by the line of topographical fashion and our hostess had quickly mastered the main facts mrs allens visit in the morning in merrimac avenue to talk of mrs ambers great idea the classes at the public schools in vacation she was interested with an equal charity to that of mrs maviseven in such weatherin those of the south end for games and exercises and music to keep the poor unoccupied children out of the streets then the revelation that it had suddenly been settled almost from one hour to the other that grace should sail for liverpool mr porterfield at last being ready he was taking a little holiday his mother was with him they had come over from paris to see some of the celebrated old buildings in england and he had telegraphed to say that if grace would start right off they would just finish it up and be married it often happened that when things had dragged on that way for years they were all huddled up at the end of course in such a case she mrs mavis had had to fly round her daughters passage was taken but it seemed too dreadful that she should make her journey all alone the first time she had ever been at sea without any companion or escort she couldnt gomr mavis was too sick she hadnt even been able to get him off to the seaside  well mrs nettlepoint is going in that ship mrs allen had said and she had represented that nothing was simpler than to put the girl in her charge when mrs mavis had replied that that was all very well but that she didnt know the lady mrs allen had declared that that didnt make a speck of difference for mrs nettlepoint was kind enough for anything it was easy enough to know her if that was all the trouble all mrs mavis would have to do would be to go up to her the next morning when she took her daughter to the ship she would see her there on the deck with her party and tell her what she wanted mrs nettlepoint had daughters herself and she would easily understand very likely she would even look after grace a little on the other side in such a queer situation going out alone to the gentleman she was engaged to she would just help her to turn round before she was married mr porterfield seemed to think they wouldnt wait long once she was there they would have it right over at the american consuls mrs allen had said it would perhaps be better still to go and see mrs nettlepoint beforehand that day to tell her what they wanted then they wouldnt seem to spring it on her just as she was leaving she herself mrs allen would call and say a word for them if she could save ten minutes before catching her train if she hadnt come it was because she hadnt saved her ten minutes but she had made them feel that they must come all the same mrs mavis liked that better because on the ship in the morning there would be such a confusion she didnt think her daughter would be any troubleconscientiously she didnt it was just to have some one to speak to her and not sally forth like a servantgirl going to a situation  i see i am to act as a sort of bridesmaid and to give her away said mrs nettlepoint she was in fact kind enough for anything and she showed on this occasion that it was easy enough to know her there is nothing more tiresome than complications at sea but she accepted without a protest the burden of the young ladys dependence and allowed her as mrs mavis said to hook herself on she evidently had the habit of patience and her reception of her visitors story reminded me afresh i was reminded of it whenever i returned to my native land that my dear compatriots are the people in the world who most freely take mutual accommodation for granted they have always had to help themselves and by a magnanimous extension they confound helping each other with that in no country are there fewer forms and more reciprocities  it was doubtless not singular that the ladies from merrimac avenue should not feel that they were importunate what was striking was that mrs nettlepoint did not appear to suspect it however she would in any case have thought it inhuman to show thatthough i could see that under the surface she was amused at everything the lady from the south end took for granted i know not whether the attitude of the younger visitor added or not to the merit of her goodnature mr porterfields intended took no part in her mothers appeal scarcely spoke sat looking at the back bay and the lights on the long bridge she declined the lemonade and the other mixtures which at mrs nettlepoints request i offered her while her mother partook freely of everything and i reflected for i as freely consumed the reviving liquid that mr jasper had better hurry back if he wished to profit by the refreshment prepared for him  was the effect of the young womans reserve ungracious or was it only natural that in her particular situation she should not have a flow of compliment at her command i noticed that mrs nettlepoint looked at her often and certainly though she was undemonstrative miss mavis was interesting the candlelight enabled me to see that if she was not in the very first flower of her youth she was still a handsome girl her eyes and hair were dark her face was pale and she held up her head as if with its thick braids it were an appurtenance she was not ashamed of if her mother was excellent and common she was not common not flagrantly so and perhaps not excellent at all events she would not be in appearance at least a dreary appendage and in the case of a person hooking on that was always something gained is it because something of a romantic or pathetic interest usually attaches to a good creature who has been the victim of a long engagement that this young lady made an impression on me from the firstfavoured as i had been so quickly with this glimpse of her history certainly she made no positive appeal she only held her tongue and smiled and her smile corrected whatever suggestion might have forced itself upon me that the spirit was deadthe spirit of that promise of which she found herself doomed to carry out the letter  what corrected it less i must add was an odd recollection which gathered vividness as i listened to ita mental association which the name of mr porterfield had evoked surely i had a personal impression oversmeared and confused of the gentleman who was waiting at liverpool or who would be for mrs nettlepoints protégée i had met him known him some time somewhere somehow in europe was he not studying somethingvery hardsomewhere probably in paris ten years before and did he not make extraordinarily neat drawings linear and architectural didnt he go to a table dhôte at two francs twentyfive in the rue bonaparte which i then frequented and didnt he wear spectacles and a scotch plaid arranged in a manner which seemed to say i have trustworthy information that that is the way they do it in the highlands was he not exemplary and very poor so that i supposed he had no overcoat and his tartan was what he slept under at night was he not working very hard still and wouldnt he be in the natural course not yet satisfied that he knew enough to launch out he would be a man of long preparationsmiss maviss white face seemed to speak to one of that it appeared to me that if i had been in love with her i should not have needed to lay such a train to marry her architecture was his line and he was a pupil of the École des beaux arts this reminiscence grew so much more vivid with me that at the end of ten minutes i had a curious sense of knowingby implicationa good deal about the young lady  even after it was settled that mrs nettlepoint would do everything for her that she could her mother sat a little sipping her syrup and telling how low mr mavis had been at this period the girls silence struck me as still more conscious partly perhaps because she deprecated her mothers loquacity she was enough of an improvement to measure that and partly because she was too full of pain at the idea of leaving her infirm her perhaps dying father i divined that they were poor and that she would take out a very small purse for her trousseau moreover for mr porterfield to make up the sum his own case would have had to change if he had enriched himself by the successful practice of his profession i had not encountered the buildings he had rearedhis reputation had not come to my ears  mrs nettlepoint notified her new friends that she was a very inactive person at sea she was prepared to suffer to the full with miss mavis but she was not prepared to walk with her to struggle with her to accompany her to the table to this the girl replied that she would trouble her little she was sure she had a belief that she should prove a wretched sailor and spend the voyage on her back her mother scoffed at this picture prophesying perfect weather and a lovely time and i said that if i might be trusted as a tame old bachelor fairly seaseasoned i should be delighted to give the new member of our party an arm or any other countenance whenever she should require it both the ladies thanked me for this taking my description only too literally and the elder one declared that we were evidently going to be such a sociable group that it was too bad to have to stay at home she inquired of mrs nettlepoint if there were any one elseif she were to be accompanied by some of her family and when our hostess mentioned her sonthere was a chance of his embarking but wasnt it absurd he had not decided yet she rejoined with extraordinary candouroh dear i do hope hell go that would be so pleasant for grace  somehow the words made me think of poor mr porterfields tartan especially as jasper nettlepoint strolled in again at that moment his mother instantly challenged him it was ten oclock had he by chance made up his great mind apparently he failed to hear her being in the first place surprised at the strange ladies and then struck with the fact that one of them was not strange the young man after a slight hesitation greeted miss mavis with a handshake and an oh good evening how do you do he did not utter her name and i could see that he had forgotten it but she immediately pronounced his availing herself of an american girls discretion to introduce him to her mother  well you might have told me you knew him all this time mrs mavis exclaimed then smiling at mrs nettlepoint she added it would have saved me a worry an acquaintance already begun  ah my sons acquaintances mrs nettlepoint murmured  yes and my daughters too cried mrs mavis jovially mrs allen didnt tell us you were going she continued to the young man  she would have been clever if she had been able to mrs nettlepoint ejaculated  dear mother i have my telegram jasper remarked looking at grace mavis  i know you very little the girl said returning his observation  ive danced with you at some ballfor some sufferers by something or other  i think it was an inundation she replied smiling but it was a long time agoand i havent seen you since  i have been in far countriesto my loss i should have said it was for a big fire  it was at the horticultural hall i didnt remember your name said grace mavis  that is very unkind of you when i recall vividly that you had a pink dress  oh i remember that dressyou looked lovely in it mrs mavis broke out you must get another just like iton the other side  yes your daughter looked charming in it said jasper nettlepoint then he added to the girlyet you mentioned my name to your mother  it came back to meseeing you here i had no idea this was your home  well i confess it isnt much oh there are some drinks jasper went on approaching the tray and its glasses  indeed there are and quite delicious mrs mavis declared  wont you have another thena pink one like your daughters gown  with pleasure sir oh do see them over mrs mavis continued accepting from the young mans hand a third tumbler  my mother and that gentleman surely they can take care of themselves said jasper nettlepoint  but my daughtershe has a claim as an old friend  jasper what does your telegram say his mother interposed  he gave no heed to her question he stood there with his glass in his hand looking from mrs mavis to miss grace  ah leave her to me madam im quite competent i said to mrs mavis  then the young man looked at me the next minute he asked of the young ladydo you mean you are going to europe  yes tomorrow in the same ship as your mother  thats what weve come here for to see all about it said mrs mavis  my son take pity on me and tell me what light your telegram throws mrs nettlepoint went on  i will dearest when ive quenched my thirst and jasper slowly drained his glass  well youre worse than gracie mrs mavis commented she was first one thing and then the otherbut only about up to three oclock yesterday  excuse mewont you take something jasper inquired of gracie who however declined as if to make up for her mothers copious consommation i made privately the reflection that the two ladies ought to take leave the question of mrs nettlepoints goodwill being so satisfactorily settled and the meeting of the morrow at the ship so near at hand and i went so far as to judge that their protracted stay with their hostess visibly in a fidget was a sign of a want of breeding miss grace after all then was not such an improvement on her mother for she easily might have taken the initiative of departure in spite of mrs maviss imbibing her glass of syrup in little interspaced sips as if to make it last as long as possible i watched the girl with an increasing curiosity i could not help asking myself a question or two about her and even perceiving already in a dim and general way that there were some complications in her position was it not a complication that she should have wished to remain long enough to assuage a certain suspense to learn whether or no jasper were going to sail had not something particular passed between them on the occasion or at the period to which they had covertly alluded and did she really not know that her mother was bringing her to his mothers though she apparently had thought it well not to mention the circumstance such things were complications on the part of a young lady betrothed to that curious crossbarred phantom of a mr porterfield but i am bound to add that she gave me no further warrant for suspecting them than by the simple fact of her encouraging her mother by her immobility to linger somehow i had a sense that she knew better i got up myself to go but mrs nettlepoint detained me after seeing that my movement would not be taken as a hint and i perceived she wished me not to leave my fellowvisitors on her hands jasper complained of the closeness of the room said that it was not a night to sit in a roomone ought to be out in the air under the sky he denounced the windows that overlooked the water for not opening upon a balcony or a terrace until his mother whom he had not yet satisfied about his telegram reminded him that there was a beautiful balcony in front with room for a dozen people she assured him we would go and sit there if it would please him  it will be nice and cool tomorrow when we steam into the great ocean said miss mavis expressing with more vivacity than she had yet thrown into any of her utterances my own thought of half an hour before mrs nettlepoint replied that it would probably be freezing cold and her son murmured that he would go and try the drawingroom balcony and report upon it just as he was turning away he said smiling to miss maviswont you come with me and see if its pleasant  oh well we had better not stay all night her mother exclaimed but without moving the girl moved after a moments hesitation she rose and accompanied jasper into the other room i observed that her slim tallness showed to advantage as she walked and that she looked well as she passed with her head thrown back into the darkness of the other part of the house there was something rather marked rather surprising i scarcely knew why for the act was simple enough in her doing so and perhaps it was our sense of this that held the rest of us somewhat stiffly silent as she remained away i was waiting for mrs mavis to go so that i myself might go and mrs nettlepoint was waiting for her to go so that i might not this doubtless made the young ladys absence appear to us longer than it really wasit was probably very brief her mother moreover i think had a vague consciousness of embarrassment jasper nettlepoint presently returned to the back drawingroom to get a glass of syrup for his companion and he took occasion to remark that it was lovely on the balcony one really got some air the breeze was from that quarter i remembered as he went away with his tinkling tumbler that from my hand a few minutes before miss mavis had not been willing to accept this innocent offering a little later mrs nettlepoint saidwell if its so pleasant there we had better go ourselves so we passed to the front and in the other room met the two young people coming in from the balcony i wondered in the light of subsequent events exactly how long they had been sitting there together there were three or four cane chairs which had been placed there for the summer if it had been but five minutes that only made subsequent events more curious we must go mother miss mavis immediately said and a moment later with a little renewal of chatter as to our general meeting on the ship the visitors had taken leave jasper went down with them to the door and as soon as they had gone out mrs nettlepoint exclaimedah but shell be a boreshell be a bore  not through talking too muchsurely  an affectation of silence is as bad i hate that particular pose its coming up very much now an imitation of the english like everything else a girl who tries to be statuesque at seathat will act on ones nerves  i dont know what she tries to be but she succeeds in being very handsome  so much the better for you ill leave her to you for i shall be shut up i like her being placed under my care  she will be under jaspers i remarked  ah he wont goi want it too much  i have an idea he will go  why didnt he tell me so thenwhen he came in  he was diverted by miss mavisa beautiful unexpected girl sitting there  diverted from his mothertrembling for his decision  shes an old friend it was a meeting after a long separation  yes such a lot of them as he knows said mrs nettlepoint  such a lot of them  he has so many female friendsin the most varied circles  well we can close round her thenfor i on my side knew or used to know her young man  her young man  the fiancé the intended the one she is going out to he cant by the way be very young now  how odd it sounds said mrs nettlepoint  i was going to reply that it was not odd if you knew mr porterfield but i reflected that that perhaps only made it odder i told my companion briefly who he wasthat i had met him in the old days in paris when i believed for a fleeting hour that i could learn to paint when i lived with the jeunesse des écoles and her comment on this was simplywell he had better have come out for her  perhaps so she looked to me as she sat there as if she might change her mind at the last moment  about her marriage  about sailing but she wont change now  jasper came back and his mother instantly challenged him well are you going  yes i shall go he said smiling i have got my telegram  oh your telegram i ventured to exclaim that charming girl is your telegram  he gave me a look but in the dusk i could not make out very well what it conveyed then he bent over his mother kissing her my news isnt particularly satisfactory i am going for you  oh you humbug she rejoined but of course she was delighted     ii   people usually spend the first hours of a voyage in squeezing themselves into their cabins taking their little precautions either so excessive or so inadequate wondering how they can pass so many days in such a hole and asking idiotic questions of the stewards who appear in comparison such men of the world my own initiations were rapid as became an old sailor and so it seemed were miss maviss for when i mounted to the deck at the end of half an hour i found her there alone in the stern of the ship looking back at the dwindling continent it dwindled very fast for so big a place i accosted her having had no conversation with her amid the crowd of leavetakers and the muddle of farewells before we put off we talked a little about the boat our fellowpassengers and our prospects and then i saidi think you mentioned last night a name i knowthat of mr porterfield  oh no i never uttered it she replied smiling at me through her closelydrawn veil  then it was your mother  very likely it was my mother and she continued to smile as if i ought to have known the difference  i venture to allude to him because i have an idea i used to know him i went on  oh i see beyond this remark she manifested no interest in my having known him  that is if its the same one it seemed to me it would be silly to say nothing more so i added my mr porterfield was called david  well so is ours ours struck me as clever  i suppose i shall see him again if he is to meet you at liverpool i continued  well it will be bad if he doesnt  it was too soon for me to have the idea that it would be bad if he did that only came later so i remarked that i had not seen him for so many years that it was very possible i should not know him  well i have not seen him for a great many years but i expect i shall know him all the same  oh with you its different i rejoined smiling at her hasnt he been back since those days  i dont know what days you mean  when i knew him in parisages ago he was a pupil of the École des beaux arts he was studying architecture  well he is studying it still said grace mavis  hasnt he learned it yet  i dont know what he has learned i shall see then she added architecture is very difficult and he is tremendously thorough  oh yes i remember that he was an admirable worker but he must have become quite a foreigner if its so many years since he has been at home  oh he is not changeable if he were changeable but here my interlocutress paused i suspect she had been going to say that if he were changeable he would have given her up long ago after an instant she went on he wouldnt have stuck so to his profession you cant make much by it  you cant make much  it doesnt make you rich  oh of course you have got to practise itand to practise it long  yesso mr porterfield says  something in the way she uttered these words made me laughthey were so serene an implication that the gentleman in question did not live up to his principles but i checked myself asking my companion if she expected to remain in europe longto live there  well it will be a good while if it takes me as long to come back as it has taken me to go out  and i think your mother said last night that it was your first visit  miss mavis looked at me a moment didnt mother talk  it was all very interesting  she continued to look at me you dont think that  what have i to gain by saying it if i dont  oh men have always something to gain  you make me feel a terrible failure then i hope at any rate that it gives you pleasurethe idea of seeing foreign lands  mercyi should think so  its a pity our ship is not one of the fast ones if you are impatient  she was silent a moment then she exclaimed oh i guess it will be fast enough  that evening i went in to see mrs nettlepoint and sat on her seatrunk which was pulled out from under the berth to accommodate me it was nine oclock but not quite dark as our northward course had already taken us into the latitude of the longer days she had made her nest admirably and lay upon her sofa in a becoming dressinggown and cap resting from her labours it was her regular practice to spend the voyage in her cabin which smelt good such was the refinement of her art and she had a secret peculiar to herself for keeping her port open without shipping seas she hated what she called the mess of the ship and the idea if she should go above of meeting stewards with plates of supererogatory food she professed to be content with her situation we promised to lend each other books and i assured her familiarly that i should be in and out of her room a dozen times a day and pitied me for having to mingle in society she judged this to be a limited privilege for on the deck before we left the wharf she had taken a view of our fellowpassengers  oh im an inveterate almost a professional observer i replied and with that vice i am as well occupied as an old woman in the sun with her knitting it puts it in my power in any situation to see things i shall see them even here and i shall come down very often and tell you about them you are not interested today but you will be tomorrow for a ship is a great school of gossip you wont believe the number of researches and problems you will be engaged in by the middle of the voyage  i never in the worldlying here with my nose in a book and never seeing anything  you will participate at second hand you will see through my eyes hang upon my lips take sides feel passions all sorts of sympathies and indignations i have an idea that your young lady is the person on board who will interest me most  mine indeed she has not been near me since we left the dock  well she is very curious  you have such coldblooded terms mrs nettlepoint murmured elle ne sait pas se conduire she ought to have come to ask about me  yes since you are under her care i said smiling as for her not knowing how to behavewell thats exactly what we shall see  you will but not i i wash my hands of her  dont say thatdont say that  mrs nettlepoint looked at me a moment why do you speak so solemnly  in return i considered her i will tell you before we land and have you seen much of your son  oh yes he has come in several times he seems very much pleased he has got a cabin to himself  thats great luck i said but i have an idea he is always in luck i was sure i should have to offer him the second berth in my room  and you wouldnt have enjoyed that because you dont like him mrs nettlepoint took upon herself to say  what put that into your head  it isnt in my headits in my heart my coeur de mère we guess those things you think hes selfishi could see it last night  dear lady i said i have no general ideas about him at all he is just one of the phenomena i am going to observe he seems to me a very fine young man however i added since you have mentioned last night i will admit that i thought he rather tantalised you he played with your suspense  why he came at the last just to please me said mrs nettlepoint  i was silent a moment are you sure it was for your sake  ah perhaps it was for yours  when he went out on the balcony with that girl perhaps she asked him to come i continued  perhaps she did but why should he do everything she asks him  i dont know yet but perhaps i shall know later not that he will tell mefor he will never tell me anything he is not one of those who tell  if she didnt ask him what you say is a great wrong to her said mrs nettlepoint  yes if she didnt but you say that to protect jasper not to protect her i continued smiling  you are coldbloodedits uncanny my companion exclaimed  ah this is nothing yet wait a whileyoull see at sea in general im awfuli pass the limits if i have outraged her in thought i will jump overboard there are ways of asking a man doesnt need to tell a woman that without the crude words  i dont know what you suppose between them said mrs nettlepoint  nothing but what was visible on the surface it transpired as the newspapers say that they were old friends  he met her at some promiscuous partyi asked him about it afterwards she is not a person he could ever think of seriously  thats exactly what i believe  you dont observeyou imagine mrs nettlepoint pursued how do you reconcile her laying a trap for jasper with her going out to liverpool on an errand of love  i dont for an instant suppose she laid a trap i believe she acted on the impulse of the moment she is going out to liverpool on an errand of marriage that is not necessarily the same thing as an errand of love especially for one who happens to have had a personal impression of the gentleman she is engaged to  well there are certain decencies which in such a situation the most abandoned of her sex would still observe you apparently judge her capableon no evidenceof violating them  ah you dont understand the shades of things i rejoined decencies and violationsthere is no need for such heavy artillery i can perfectly imagine that without the least immodesty she should have said to jasper on the balcony in fact if not in wordsim in dreadful spirits but if you come i shall feel better and that will be pleasant for you too  and why is she in dreadful spirits  she isnt i replied laughing  what is she doing  she is walking with your son  mrs nettlepoint said nothing for a moment then she broke out inconsequentlyah shes horrid  no shes charming i protested  you mean shes curious  well for me its the same thing  this led my friend of course to declare once more that i was coldblooded on the afternoon of the morrow we had another talk and she told me that in the morning miss mavis had paid her a long visit she knew nothing about anything but her intentions were good and she was evidently in her own eyes conscientious and decorous and mrs nettlepoint concluded these remarks with the exclamation poor young thing  you think she is a good deal to be pitied then  well her story sounds drearyshe told me a great deal of it she fell to talking little by little and went from one thing to another shes in that situation when a girl must open herselfto some woman  hasnt she got jasper i inquired  he isnt a woman you strike me as jealous of him my companion added  i daresay he thinks soor will before the end ah noah no and i asked mrs nettlepoint if our young lady struck her as a flirt she gave me no answer but went on to remark that it was odd and interesting to her to see the way a girl like grace mavis resembled the girls of the kind she herself knew better the girls of society at the same time that she differed from them and the way the differences and resemblances were mixed up so that on certain questions you couldnt tell where you would find her you would think she would feel as you did because you had found her feeling so and then suddenly in regard to some other matter which was yet quite the same she would be terribly wanting mrs nettlepoint proceeded to observe to such idle speculations does the vanity of a seavoyage give encouragement that she wondered whether it were better to be an ordinary girl very well brought up or an extraordinary girl not brought up at all  oh i go in for the extraordinary girl under all circumstances  it is true that if you are very well brought up you are not ordinary said mrs nettlepoint smelling her strong salts you are a lady at any rate cest toujours ça  and miss mavis isnt oneis that what you mean  wellyou have seen her mother  yes but i think your contention would be that among such people the mother doesnt count  precisely and thats bad  i see what you mean but isnt it rather hard if your mother doesnt know anything it is better you should be independent of her and yet if you are that constitutes a bad note i added that mrs mavis had appeared to count sufficiently two nights before she had said and done everything she wanted while the girl sat silent and respectful graces attitude so far as her mother was concerned had been eminently decent  yes but she couldnt bear it said mrs nettlepoint  ah if you know it i may confess that she has told me as much  mrs nettlepoint stared told you theres one of the things they do  well it was only a word wont you let me know whether you think shes a flirt  find out for yourself since you pretend to study folks  oh your judgment would probably not at all determine mine its in regard to yourself that i ask it  in regard to myself  to see the length of maternal immorality  mrs nettlepoint continued to repeat my words maternal immorality  you desire your son to have every possible distraction on his voyage and if you can make up your mind in the sense i refer to that will make it all right he will have no responsibility  heavens how you analyse i havent in the least your passion for making up my mind  then if you chance it youll be more immoral still  your reasoning is strange said the poor lady when it was you who tried to put it into my head yesterday that she had asked him to come  yes but in good faith  how do you mean in good faith  why as girls of that sort do their allowance and measure in such matters is much larger than that of young ladies who have been as you say very well brought up and yet i am not sure that on the whole i dont think them the more innocent miss mavis is engaged and shes to be married next week but its an old old story and theres no more romance in it than if she were going to be photographed so her usual life goes on and her usual life consists and that of ces demoiselles in general in having plenty of gentlemens society having it i mean without having any harm from it  well if there is no harm from it what are you talking about and why am i immoral  i hesitated laughing i retractyou are sane and clear i am sure she thinks there wont be any harm i added thats the great point  the great point  i mean to be settled  mercy we are not trying them how can we settle it  i mean of course in our minds there will be nothing more interesting for the next ten days for our minds to exercise themselves upon  they will get very tired of it said mrs nettlepoint  no no because the interest will increase and the plot will thicken it cant help it she looked at me as if she thought me slightly mephistophelean and i went onso she told you everything in her life was dreary  not everything but most things and she didnt tell me so much as i guessed it shell tell me more the next time she will behave properly now about coming in to see me i told her she ought to  i am glad of that i said keep her with you as much as possible  i dont follow you much mrs nettlepoint replied but so far as i do i dont think your remarks are in very good taste  im too excited i lose my head coldblooded as you think me doesnt she like mr porterfield  yes thats the worst of it  the worst of it  hes so goodtheres no fault to be found with him otherwise she would have thrown it all up it has dragged on since she was eighteen she became engaged to him before he went abroad to study it was one of those childish muddles which parents in america might prevent so much more than they do the thing is to insist on ones daughters waiting on the engagements being long and then after you have got that started to take it on every occasion as little seriously as possibleto make it die out you can easily tire it out however mr porterfield has taken it seriously for some years he has done his part to keep it alive she says he adores her  his part surely his part would have been to marry her by this time  he has absolutely no money  he ought to have got some in seven years  so i think she thinks there are some sorts of poverty that are contemptible but he has a little more now thats why he wont wait any longer his mother has come out she has somethinga littleand she is able to help him she will live with them and bear some of the expenses and after her death the son will have what there is  how old is she i asked cynically  i havent the least idea but it doesnt sound very inspiring he has not been to america since he first went out  thats an odd way of adoring her  i made that objection mentally but i didnt express it to her she met it indeed a little by telling me that he had had other chances to marry  that surprises me i remarked and did she say that she had had  no and thats one of the things i thought nice in her for she must have had she didnt try to make out that he had spoiled her life she has three other sisters and there is very little money at home she has tried to make money she has written little things and painted little things but her talent is apparently not in that direction her father has had a long illness and has lost his placehe was in receipt of a salary in connection with some waterworksand one of her sisters has lately become a widow with children and without means and so as in fact she never has married any one else whatever opportunities she may have encountered she appears to have just made up her mind to go out to mr porterfield as the least of her evils but it isnt very amusing  that only makes it the more honourable she will go through with it whatever it costs rather than disappoint him after he has waited so long it is true i continued that when a woman acts from a sense of honour  well when she does said mrs nettlepoint for i hesitated perceptibly  it is so extravagant a course that some one has to pay for it  you are very impertinent we all have to pay for each other all the while and for each others virtues as well as vices  thats precisely why i shall be sorry for mr porterfield when she steps off the ship with her little bill i mean with her teeth clenched  her teeth are not in the least clenched she is in perfect goodhumour  well we must try and keep her so i said you must take care that jasper neglects nothing  i know not what reflection this innocent pleasantry of mine provoked on the good ladys part the upshot of them at all events was to make her saywell i never asked her to come im very glad of that it is all their own doing  their ownyou mean jaspers and hers  no indeed i mean her mothers and mrs allens the girls too of course they put themselves upon us  oh yes i can testify to that therefore im glad too we should have missed it i think  how seriously you take it mrs nettlepoint exclaimed  ah wait a few days i replied getting up to leave her     iii   the patagonia was slow but she was spacious and comfortable and there was a kind of motherly decency in her long nursing rock and her rustling oldfashioned gait it was as if she wished not to present herself in port with the splashed eagerness of a young creature we were not numerous enough to squeeze each other and yet we were not too few to entertainwith that familiarity and relief which figures and objects acquire on the great bare field of the ocean beneath the great bright glass of the sky i had never liked the sea so much before indeed i had never liked it at all but now i had a revelation of how in a midsummer mood it could please it was darkly and magnificently blue and imperturbably quietsave for the great regular swell of its heartbeats the pulse of its life and there grew to be something so agreeable in the sense of floating there in infinite isolation and leisure that it was a positive satisfaction the patagonia was not a racer one had never thought of the sea as the great place of safety but now it came over one that there is no place so safe from the land when it does not give you trouble it takes it awaytakes away letters and telegrams and newspapers and visits and duties and efforts all the complications all the superfluities and superstitions that we have stuffed into our terrene life the simple absence of the post when the particular conditions enable you to enjoy the great fact by which it is produced becomes in itself a kind of bliss and the clean stage of the deck shows you a play that amuses the personal drama of the voyage the movement and interaction in the strong sealight of figures that end by representing somethingsomething moreover of which the interest is never even in its keenness too great to suffer you to go to sleep i at any rate dozed a great deal lying on my rug with a french novel and when i opened my eyes i generally saw jasper nettlepoint passing with his mothers protégée on his arm somehow at these moments between sleeping and waking i had an inconsequent sense that they were a part of the french novel perhaps this was because i had fallen into the trick at the start of regarding grace mavis almost as a married woman which as every one knows is the necessary status of the heroine of such a work every revolution of our engine at any rate would contribute to the effect of making her one  in the saloon at meals my neighbour on the right was a certain little mrs peck a very short and very round person whose head was enveloped in a cloud a cloud of dirty white wool and who promptly let me know that she was going to europe for the education of her children i had already perceived an hour after we left the dock that some energetic step was required in their interest but as we were not in europe yet the business could not be said to have begun the four little pecks in the enjoyment of untrammelled leisure swarmed about the ship as if they had been pirates boarding her and their mother was as powerless to check their license as if she had been gagged and stowed away in the hold they were especially to be trusted to run between the legs of the stewards when these attendants arrived with bowls of soup for the languid ladies their mother was too busy recounting to her fellowpassengers how many years miss mavis had been engaged in the blank of a marine existence things that are nobodys business very soon become everybodys and this was just one of those facts that are propagated with a mysterious and ridiculous rapidity the whisper that carries them is very small in the great scale of things of air and space and progress but it is also very safe for there is no compression no soundingboard to make speakers responsible and then repetition at sea is somehow not repetition monotony is in the air the mind is flat and everything recursthe bells the meals the stewards faces the romp of children the walk the clothes the very shoes and buttons of passengers taking their exercise these things grow at last so insipid that in comparison revelations as to the personal history of ones companions have a taste even when one cares little about the people  jasper nettlepoint sat on my left hand when he was not upstairs seeing that miss mavis had her repast comfortably on deck his mothers place would have been next mine had she shown herself and then that of the young lady under her care the two ladies in other words would have been between us jasper marking the limit of the party on that side miss mavis was present at luncheon the first day but dinner passed without her coming in and when it was half over jasper remarked that he would go up and look after her  isnt that young lady comingthe one who was here to lunch mrs peck asked of me as he left the saloon  apparently not my friend tells me she doesnt like the saloon  you dont mean to say shes sick do you  oh no not in this weather but she likes to be above  and is that gentleman gone up to her  yes shes under his mothers care  and is his mother up there too asked mrs peck whose processes were homely and direct  no she remains in her cabin people have different tastes perhaps thats one reason why miss mavis doesnt come to table i addedher chaperon not being able to accompany her  her chaperon  mrs nettlepointthe lady under whose protection she is  protection mrs peck stared at me a moment moving some valued morsel in her mouth then she exclaimed familiarly pshaw i was struck with this and i was on the point of asking her what she meant by it when she continued are we not going to see mrs nettlepoint  i am afraid not she vows that she wont stir from her sofa  pshaw said mrs peck again thats quite a disappointment  do you know her then  no but i know all about her then my companion addedyou dont meant to say shes any relation  do you mean to me  no to grace mavis  none at all they are very new friends as i happen to know then you are acquainted with our young lady i had not noticed that any recognition passed between them at luncheon  is she yours too asked mrs peck smiling at me  ah when people are in the same boatliterallythey belong a little to each other  thats so said mrs peck i dont know miss mavis but i know all about heri live opposite to her on merrimac avenue i dont know whether you know that part  oh yesits very beautiful  the consequence of this remark was another pshaw but mrs peck went onwhen youve lived opposite to people like that for a long time you feel as if you were acquainted but she didnt take it up today she didnt speak to me she knows who i am as well as she knows her own mother  you had better speak to her firstshes shy i remarked  shy why shes nearly thirty years old i suppose you know where shes going  oh yeswe all take an interest in that  that young man i suppose particularly  that young man  the handsome one who sits there didnt you tell me he is mrs nettlepoints son  oh yes he acts as her deputy no doubt he does all he can to carry out her function  mrs peck was silent a moment i had spoken jocosely but she received my pleasantry with a serious face well she might let him eat his dinner in peace she presently exclaimed  oh hell come back i said glancing at his place the repast continued and when it was finished i screwed my chair round to leave the table mrs peck performed the same movement and we quitted the saloon together outside of it was a kind of vestibule with several seats from which you could descend to the lower cabins or mount to the promenadedeck mrs peck appeared to hesitate as to her course and then solved the problem by going neither way she dropped upon one of the benches and looked up at me  i thought you said he would come back  young nettlepoint i see he didnt miss mavis then has given him half of her dinner  its very kind of her she has been engaged for ages  yes but that will soon be over  so i supposeas quick as we land every one knows it on merrimac avenue every one there takes a great interest in it  ah of course a girl like that she has many friends  i mean even people who dont know her  i see i went on she is so handsome that she attracts attention people enter into her affairs  she used to be pretty but i cant say i think shes anything remarkable today anyhow if she attracts attention she ought to be all the more careful what she does you had better tell her that  oh its none of my business i replied leaving mrs peck and going above the exclamation i confess was not perfectly in accordance with my feeling or rather my feeling was not perfectly in harmony with the exclamation the very first thing i did on reaching the deck was to notice that miss mavis was pacing it on jasper nettlepoints arm and that whatever beauty she might have lost according to mrs pecks insinuation she still kept enough to make ones eyes follow her she had put on a sort of crimson hood which was very becoming to her and which she wore for the rest of the voyage she walked very well with long steps and i remember that at this moment the ocean had a gentle evening swell which made the great ship dip slowly rhythmically giving a movement that was graceful to graceful pedestrians and a more awkward one to the awkward it was the loveliest hour of a fine day the clear early evening with the glow of the sunset in the air and a purple colour in the sea i always thought that the waters ploughed by the homeric heroes must have looked like that i perceived on that particular occasion moreover that grace mavis would for the rest of the voyage be the most visible thing on the ship the figure that would count most in the composition of groups she couldnt help it poor girl nature had made her conspicuousimportant as the painters say she paid for it by the exposure it brought with itthe danger that people would as i had said to mrs peck enter into her affairs  jasper nettlepoint went down at certain times to see his mother and i watched for one of these occasions on the third day out and took advantage of it to go and sit by miss mavis she wore a blue veil drawn tightly over her face so that if the smile with which she greeted me was dim i could account for it partly by that  well we are getting onwe are getting on i said cheerfully looking at the friendly twinkling sea  are we going very fast  not fast but steadily ohne hast ohne rastdo you know german  well ive studied itsome  it will be useful to you over there when you travel  well yes if we do but i dont suppose we shall much mr nettlepoint says we ought my interlocutress added in a moment  ah of course he thinks so he has been all over the world  yes he has described some of the places thats what i should like i didnt know i should like it so much  like what so much  going on this way i could go on for ever for ever and ever  ah you know its not always like this i rejoined  well its better than boston  it isnt so good as paris i said smiling  oh i know all about paris there is no freshness in that i feel as if i had been there  you mean you have heard so much about it  oh yes nothing else for ten years  i had come to talk with miss mavis because she was attractive but i had been rather conscious of the absence of a good topic not feeling at liberty to revert to mr porterfield she had not encouraged me when i spoke to her as we were leaving boston to go on with the history of my acquaintance with this gentleman and yet now unexpectedly she appeared to imply it was doubtless one of the disparities mentioned by mrs nettlepoint that he might be glanced at without indelicacy  i see you mean by letters i remarked  i shant live in a good part i know enough to know that she went on  dear young lady there are no bad parts i answered reassuringly  why mr nettlepoint says its horrid  its horrid  up there in the batignolles its worse than merrimac avenue  worsein what way  why even less where the nice people live  he oughtnt to say that i returned dont you call mr porterfield a nice person i ventured to subjoin  oh it doesnt make any difference she rested her eyes on me a moment through her veil the texture of which gave them a suffused prettiness do you know him very well she asked  mr porterfield  no mr nettlepoint  ah very little hes a good deal younger than i  she was silent a moment after which she said hes younger than me too i know not what drollery there was in this but it was unexpected and it made me laugh neither do i know whether miss mavis took offence at my laughter though i remember thinking at the moment with compunction that it had brought a certain colour to her cheek at all events she got up gathering her shawl and her books into her arm im going downim tired  tired of me im afraid  no not yet  im like you i pursued i should like it to go on and on  she had begun to walk along the deck to the companionway and i went with her oh no i shouldnt after all  i had taken her shawl from her to carry it but at the top of the steps that led down to the cabins i had to give it back your mother would be glad if she could know i observed as we parted  if she could know  how well you are getting on and that good mrs allen  oh mother mother she made me come she pushed me off and almost as if not to say more she went quickly below  i paid mrs nettlepoint a morning visit after luncheon and another in the evening before she turned in that same day in the evening she said to me suddenly do you know what i have done i have asked jasper  asked him what  why if she asked him you know  i dont understand  you do perfectly if that girl really asked himon the balconyto sail with us  my dear friend do you suppose that if she did he would tell you  thats just what he says but he says she didnt  and do you consider the statement valuable i asked laughing out you had better ask miss gracie herself  mrs nettlepoint stared i couldnt do that  incomparable friend i am only joking what does it signify now  i thought you thought everything signified you were so full of signification  yes but we are farther out now and somehow in midocean everything becomes absolute  what else can he do with decency mrs nettlepoint went on if as my son he were never to speak to her it would be very rude and you would think that stranger still then you would do what he does and where would be the difference  how do you know what he does i havent mentioned him for twentyfour hours  why she told me herself she came in this afternoon  what an odd thing to tell you i exclaimed  not as she says it she says hes full of attention perfectly devotedlooks after her all the while she seems to want me to know it so that i may commend him for it  thats charming it shows her good conscience  yes or her great cleverness  something in the tone in which mrs nettlepoint said this caused me to exclaim in real surprise why what do you suppose she has in her mind  to get hold of him to make him go so far that he cant retreat to marry him perhaps  to marry him and what will she do with mr porterfield  shell ask me just to explain to himor perhaps you  yes as an old friend i replied laughing but i asked more seriously do you see jasper caught like that  well hes only a boyhes younger at least than she  precisely she regards him as a child  as a child  she remarked to me herself today that he is so much younger  mrs nettlepoint stared does she talk of it with you that shows she has a plan that she has thought it over  i have sufficiently betrayed that i deemed grace mavis a singular girl but i was far from judging her capable of laying a trap for our young companion moreover my reading of jasper was not in the least that he was catchablecould be made to do a thing if he didnt want to do it of course it was not impossible that he might be inclined that he might take it or already have taken it into his head to marry miss mavis but to believe this i should require still more proof than his always being with her he wanted at most to marry her for the voyage if you have questioned him perhaps you have tried to make him feel responsible i said to his mother  a little but its very difficult interference makes him perverse one has to go gently besides its too absurdthink of her age if she cant take care of herself cried mrs nettlepoint  yes let us keep thinking of her age though its not so prodigious and if things get very bad you have one resource left i added  what is that  you can go upstairs  ah never never if it takes that to save her she must be lost besides what good would it do if i were to go up she could come down here  yes but you could keep jasper with you  could i mrs nettlepoint demanded in the manner of a woman who knew her son  in the saloon the next day after dinner over the red cloth of the tables beneath the swinging lamps and the racks of tumblers decanters and wineglasses we sat down to whist mrs peck among others taking a hand in the game she played very badly and talked too much and when the rubber was over assuaged her discomfiture though not minewe had been partners with a welsh rabbit and a tumbler of something hot we had done with the cards but while she waited for this refreshment she sat with her elbows on the table shuffling a pack  she hasnt spoken to me yetshe wont do it she remarked in a moment  is it possible there is any one on the ship who hasnt spoken to you  not that girlshe knows too well mrs peck looked round our little circle with a smile of intelligenceshe had familiar communicative eyes several of our company had assembled according to the wont the last thing in the evening of those who are cheerful at sea for the consumption of grilled sardines and devilled bones  what then does she know  oh she knows that i know  well we know what mrs peck knows one of the ladies of the group observed to me with an air of privilege  well you wouldnt know if i hadnt told youfrom the way she acts said mrs peck with a small laugh  she is going out to a gentleman who lives over therehes waiting there to marry her the other lady went on in the tone of authentic information i remember that her name was mrs gotch and that her mouth looked always as if she were whistling  oh he knowsive told him said mrs peck  well i presume every one knows mrs gotch reflected  dear madam is it every ones business i asked  why dont you think its a peculiar way to act mrs gotch was evidently surprised at my little protest  why its right therestraight in front of you like a play at the theatreas if you had paid to see it said mrs peck if you dont call it public  arent you mixing things up what do you call public  why the way they go on they are up there now  they cuddle up there half the night said mrs gotch i dont know when they come down any hour you likewhen all the lights are out they are up there still  oh you cant tire them out they dont want relieflike the watch laughed one of the gentlemen  well if they enjoy each others society whats the harm another asked theyd do just the same on land  they wouldnt do it on the public streets i suppose said mrs peck and they wouldnt do it if mr porterfield was round  isnt that just where your confusion comes in i inquired its public enough that miss mavis and mr nettlepoint are always together but it isnt in the least public that she is going to be married  why how can you saywhen the very sailors know it the captain knows it and all the officers know it they see them thereespecially at night when theyre sailing the ship  i thought there was some rule said mrs gotch  well there isthat youve got to behave yourself mrs peck rejoined so the captain told mehe said they have some rule he said they have to have when people are too demonstrative  too demonstrative  when they attract so much attention  ah its we who attract the attentionby talking about what doesnt concern us and about what we really dont know i ventured to declare  she said the captain said he would tell on her as soon as we arrive mrs gotch interposed  she said i repeated bewildered  well he did say so that he would think it his duty to inform mr porterfield when he comes on to meet herif they keep it up in the same way said mrs peck  oh theyll keep it up dont you fear one of the gentlemen exclaimed  dear madam the captain is laughing at you  no he ainthes right down scandalised he says he regards us all as a real family and wants the family to be properly behaved i could see mrs peck was irritated by my controversial tone she challenged me with considerable spirit how can you say i dont know it when all the street knows it and has known it for yearsfor years and years she spoke as if the girl had been engaged at least for twenty what is she going out for if not to marry him  perhaps she is going to see how he looks suggested one of the gentlemen  hed look queerif he knew  well i guess hell know said mrs gotch  shed tell him herselfshe wouldnt be afraid the gentleman went on  well she might as well kill him hell jump overboard  jump overboard cried mrs gotch as if she hoped then that mr porterfield would be told  he has just been waiting for thisfor years said mrs peck  do you happen to know him i inquired  mrs peck hesitated a moment no but i know a lady who does are you going up  i had risen from my placei had not ordered supper im going to take a turn before going to bed  well then youll see  outside the saloon i hesitated for mrs pecks admonition made me feel for a moment that if i ascended to the deck i should have entered in a manner into her little conspiracy but the night was so warm and splendid that i had been intending to smoke a cigar in the air before going below and i did not see why i should deprive myself of this pleasure in order to seem not to mind mrs peck i went up and saw a few figures sitting or moving about in the darkness the ocean looked black and small as it is apt to do at night and the long mass of the ship with its vague dim wings seemed to take up a great part of it there were more stars than one saw on land and the heavens struck one more than ever as larger than the earth grace mavis and her companion were not so far as i perceived at first among the few passengers who were lingering late and i was glad because i hated to hear her talked about in the manner of the gossips i had left at supper i wished there had been some way to prevent it but i could think of no way but to recommend her privately to change her habits that would be a very delicate business and perhaps it would be better to begin with jasper though that would be delicate too at any rate one might let him know in a friendly spirit to how much remark he exposed the young ladyleaving this revelation to work its way upon him unfortunately i could not altogether believe that the pair were unconscious of the observation and the opinion of the passengers they were not a boy and a girl they had a certain social perspective in their eye i was not very clear as to the details of that behaviour which had made them according to the version of my good friends in the saloon a scandal to the ship for though i looked at them a good deal i evidently had not looked at them so continuously and so hungrily as mrs peck nevertheless the probability was that they knew what was thought of themwhat naturally would beand simply didnt care that made miss mavis out rather cynical and even a little immodest and yet somehow if she had such qualities i did not dislike her for them i dont know what strange secret excuses i found for her i presently indeed encountered a need for them on the spot for just as i was on the point of going below again after several restless turns and within the limit where smoking was allowed as many puffs at a cigar as i cared for i became aware that a couple of figures were seated behind one of the lifeboats that rested on the deck they were so placed as to be visible only to a person going close to the rail and peering a little sidewise i dont think i peered but as i stood a moment beside the rail my eye was attracted by a dusky object which protruded beyond the boat and which as i saw at a second glance was the tail of a ladys dress i bent forward an instant but even then i saw very little more that scarcely mattered however for i took for granted on the spot that the persons concealed in so snug a corner were jasper nettlepoint and mr porterfields intended concealed was the word and i thought it a real pity there was bad taste in it i immediately turned away and the next moment i found myself face to face with the captain of the ship i had already had some conversation with him he had been so good as to invite me as he had invited mrs nettlepoint and her son and the young lady travelling with them and also mrs peck to sit at his table and had observed with pleasure that he had the art not universal on the atlantic liners of mingling urbanity with seamanship  they dont waste much timeyour friends in there he said nodding in the direction in which he had seen me looking  ah well they havent much to lose  thats what i mean im told she hasnt  i wanted to say something exculpatory but i scarcely knew what note to strike i could only look vaguely about me at the starry darkness and the sea that seemed to sleep well with these splendid nights this perfection of weather people are beguiled into late hours  yes we want a nice little blow the captain said  a nice little blow  that would clear the decks  the captain was rather dry and he went about his business he had made me uneasy and instead of going below i walked a few steps more the other walkers dropped off pair by pair they were all men till at last i was alone then after a little i quitted the field jasper and his companion were still behind their lifeboat personally i greatly preferred good weather but as i went down i found myself vaguely wishing in the interest of i scarcely knew what unless of decorum that we might have half a gale  miss mavis turned out in seaphrase early for the next morning i saw her come up only a little while after i had finished my breakfast a ceremony over which i contrived not to dawdle she was alone and jasper nettlepoint by a rare accident was not on deck to help her i went to meet her she was encumbered as usual with her shawl her sunumbrella and a book and laid my hands on her chair placing it near the stern of the ship where she liked best to be but i proposed to her to walk a little before she sat down and she took my arm after i had put her accessories into the chair the deck was clear at that hour and the morning light was gay one got a sort of exhilarated impression of fair conditions and an absence of hindrance i forget what we spoke of first but it was because i felt these things pleasantly and not to torment my companion nor to test her that i could not help exclaiming cheerfully after a moment as i have mentioned having done the first day well we are getting on we are getting on  oh yes i count every hour  the last days always go quicker i said and the last hours  well the last hours she asked for i had instinctively checked myself  oh one is so glad then that it is almost the same as if one had arrived but we ought to be grateful when the elements have been so kind to us i added i hope you will have enjoyed the voyage  she hesitated a moment then she said yes much more than i expected  did you think it would be very bad  horrible horrible  the tone of these words was strange but i had not much time to reflect upon it for turning round at that moment i saw jasper nettlepoint come towards us he was separated from us by the expanse of the white deck and i could not help looking at him from head to foot as he drew nearer i know not what rendered me on this occasion particularly sensitive to the impression but it seemed to me that i saw him as i had never seen him beforesaw him inside and out in the intense sealight in his personal his moral totality it was a quick vivid revelation if it only lasted a moment it had a simplifying certifying effect he was intrinsically a pleasing apparition with his handsome young face and a certain absence of compromise in his personal arrangements which more than any one i have ever seen he managed to exhibit on shipboard he had none of the appearance of wearing out old clothes that usually prevails there but dressed straight as i heard some one say this gave him a practical successful air as of a young man who would come best out of any predicament i expected to feel my companions hand loosen itself on my arm as indication that now she must go to him and was almost surprised she did not drop me we stopped as we met and jasper bade us a friendly goodmorning of course the remark was not slow to be made that we had another lovely day which led him to exclaim in the manner of one to whom criticism came easily yes but with this sort of thing consider what one of the others would do  one of the other ships  we should be there now or at any rate tomorrow  well then im glad it isnt one of the others i said smiling at the young lady on my arm my remark offered her a chance to say something appreciative and gave him one even more but neither jasper nor grace mavis took advantage of the opportunity what they did do i perceived was to look at each other for an instant after which miss mavis turned her eyes silently to the sea she made no movement and uttered no word contriving to give me the sense that she had all at once become perfectly passive that she somehow declined responsibility we remained standing there with jasper in front of us and if the touch of her arm did not suggest that i should give her up neither did it intimate that we had better pass on i had no idea of giving her up albeit one of the things that i seemed to discover just then in jaspers physiognomy was an imperturbable implication that she was his property his eye met mine for a moment and it was exactly as if he had said to me i know what you think but i dont care a rap what i really thought was that he was selfish beyond the limits that was the substance of my little revelation youth is almost always selfish just as it is almost always conceited and after all when it is combined with health and good parts good looks and good spirits it has a right to be and i easily forgive it if it be really youth still it is a question of degree and what stuck out of jasper nettlepoint if one felt that sort of thing was that his egotism had a hardness his love of his own way an avidity these elements were jaunty and prosperous they were accustomed to triumph he was fond very fond of women they were necessary to him and that was in his type but he was not in the least in love with grace mavis among the reflections i quickly made this was the one that was most to the point there was a degree of awkwardness after a minute in the way we were planted there though the apprehension of it was doubtless not in the least with him  how is your mother this morning i asked  you had better go down and see  not till miss mavis is tired of me  she said nothing to this and i made her walk again for some minutes she remained silent then rather unexpectedly she began ive seen you talking to that lady who sits at our tablethe one who has so many children  mrs peck oh yes i have talked with her  do you know her very well  only as one knows people at sea an acquaintance makes itself it doesnt mean very much  she doesnt speak to meshe might if she wanted  thats just what she says of youthat you might speak to her  oh if shes waiting for that said my companion with a laugh then she addedshe lives in our street nearly opposite  precisely thats the reason why she thinks you might speak she has seen you so often and seems to know so much about you  what does she know about me  ah you must ask heri cant tell you  i dont care what she knows said my young lady after a moment she went onshe must have seen that im not very sociable and thenwhat are you laughing at  my laughter was for an instant irrepressiblethere was something so droll in the way she had said that  well you are not sociable and yet you are mrs peck is at any rate and thought that ought to make it easy for you to enter into conversation with her  oh i dont care for her conversationi know what it amounts to i made no rejoinderi scarcely knew what rejoinder to makeand the girl went on i know what she thinks and i know what she says still i was silent but the next moment i saw that my delicacy had been wasted for miss mavis asked does she make out that she knows mr porterfield  no she only says that she knows a lady who knows him  yes i knowmrs jeremie mrs jeremies an idiot i was not in a position to controvert this and presently my young lady said she would sit down i left her in her chairi saw that she preferred itand wandered to a distance a few minutes later i met jasper again and he stopped of his own accord and said to me  we shall be in about six in the evening on the eleventh daythey promise it  if nothing happens of course  well whats going to happen  thats just what im wondering and i turned away and went below with the foolish but innocent satisfaction of thinking that i had mystified him     iv   i dont know what to do and you must help me mrs nettlepoint said to me that evening as soon as i went in to see her  ill do what i canbut whats the matter  she has been crying here and going onshe has quite upset me  crying she doesnt look like that  exactly and thats what startled me she came in to see me this afternoon as she has done before and we talked about the weather and the run of the ship and the manners of the stewardess and little commonplaces like that and then suddenly in the midst of it as she sat there à propos of nothing she burst into tears i asked her what ailed her and tried to comfort her but she didnt explain she only said it was nothing the effect of the sea of leaving home i asked her if it had anything to do with her prospects with her marriage whether she found as that drew near that her heart was not in it i told her that she mustnt be nervous that i could enter into thatin short i said what i could all that she replied was that she was nervous very nervous but that it was already over and then she jumped up and kissed me and went away does she look as if she had been crying mrs nettlepoint asked  how can i tell when she never quits that horrid veil its as if she were ashamed to show her face  shes keeping it for liverpool but i dont like such incidents said mrs nettlepoint i shall go upstairs  and is that where you want me to help you  oh your arm and that sort of thing yes but something more i feel as if something were going to happen  thats exactly what i said to jasper this morning  and what did he say  he only looked innocent as if he thought i meant a fog or a storm  heaven forbidit isnt that i shall never be goodnatured again mrs nettlepoint went on never have a girl put upon me that way you always pay for it there are always tiresome complications what i am afraid of is after we get there shell throw up her engagement there will be dreadful scenes i shall be mixed up with them and have to look after her and keep her with me i shall have to stay there with her till she can be sent back or even take her up to london voyezvous ça  i listened respectfully to this and then i said you are afraid of your son  afraid of him  there are things you might say to himand with your manner because you have one when you choose  very likely but what is my manner to his besides i have said everything to him that is i have said the great thing that he is making her immensely talked about  and of course in answer to that he has asked you how you know and you have told him i have told you  i had to and he says its none of your business  i wish he would say that to my face  hell do so perfectly if you give him a chance thats where you can help me quarrel with himhes rather good at a quarrel and that will divert him and draw him off  then im ready to discuss the matter with him for the rest of the voyage  very well i count on you but hell ask you as he asks me what the deuce you want him to do  to go to bed i replied laughing  oh it isnt a joke  thats exactly what i told you at first  yes but dont exult i hate people who exult jasper wants to know why he should mind her being talked about if she doesnt mind it herself  ill tell him why i replied and mrs nettlepoint said she should be exceedingly obliged to me and repeated that she would come upstairs  i looked for jasper above that same evening but circumstances did not favour my quest i found himthat is i discovered that he was again ensconced behind the lifeboat with miss mavis but there was a needless violence in breaking into their communion and i put off our interview till the next day then i took the first opportunity at breakfast to make sure of it he was in the saloon when i went in and was preparing to leave the table but i stopped him and asked if he would give me a quarter of an hour on deck a little laterthere was something particular i wanted to say to him he said oh yes if you like with just a visible surprise but no look of an uncomfortable consciousness when i had finished my breakfast i found him smoking on the forwarddeck and i immediately began i am going to say something that you wont at all like to ask you a question that you will think impertinent  impertinent thats bad  i am a good deal older than you and i am a friendof many yearsof your mother theres nothing i like less than to be meddlesome but i think these things give me a certain righta sort of privilege for the rest my inquiry will speak for itself  why so many preliminaries the young man asked smiling  we looked into each others eyes a moment what indeed was his mothers mannerher best mannercompared with his are you prepared to be responsible  to you  dear noto the young lady herself i am speaking of course of miss mavis  ah yes my mother tells me you have her greatly on your mind  so has your mother herselfnow  she is so good as to say soto oblige you  she would oblige me a great deal more by reassuring me i am aware that you know i have told her that miss mavis is greatly talked about  yes but what on earth does it matter  it matters as a sign  a sign of what  that she is in a false position  jasper puffed his cigar with his eyes on the horizon i dont know whether its your business what you are attempting to discuss but it really appears to me it is none of mine what have i to do with the tattle with which a pack of old women console themselves for not being seasick  do you call it tattle that miss mavis is in love with you  drivelling  then you are very ungrateful the tattle of a pack of old women has this importance that she suspects or knows that it exists and that nice girls are for the most part very sensitive to that sort of thing to be prepared not to heed it in this case she must have a reason and the reason must be the one i have taken the liberty to call your attention to  in love with me in six days just like that said jasper smoking  there is no accounting for tastes and six days at sea are equivalent to sixty on land i dont want to make you too proud of course if you recognise your responsibility its all right and i have nothing to say  i dont see what you mean jasper went on  surely you ought to have thought of that by this time shes engaged to be married and the gentleman she is engaged to is to meet her at liverpool the whole ship knows it i didnt tell them and the whole ship is watching her its impertinent if you like just as i am but we make a little world here together and we cant blink its conditions what i ask you is whether you are prepared to allow her to give up the gentleman i have just mentioned for your sake  for my sake  to marry her if she breaks with him  jasper turned his eyes from the horizon to my own and i found a strange expression in them has miss mavis commissioned you to make this inquiry  never in the world  well then i dont understand it  it isnt from another i make it let it come from yourselfto yourself  lord you must think i lead myself a life thats a question the young lady may put to me any moment that it pleases her  let me then express the hope that she will but what will you answer  my dear sir it seems to me that in spite of all the titles you have enumerated you have no reason to expect i will tell you he turned away and i exclaimed sincerely poor girl at this he faced me again and looking at me from head to foot demanded what is it you want me to do  i told your mother that you ought to go to bed  you had better do that yourself  this time he walked off and i reflected rather dolefully that the only clear result of my experiment would probably have been to make it vivid to him that she was in love with him mrs nettlepoint came up as she had announced but the day was half over it was nearly three oclock she was accompanied by her son who established her on deck arranged her chair and her shawls saw that she was protected from sun and wind and for an hour was very properly attentive while this went on grace mavis was not visible nor did she reappear during the whole afternoon i had not observed that she had as yet been absent from the deck for so long a period jasper went away but he came back at intervals to see how his mother got on and when she asked him where miss mavis was he said he had not the least idea i sat with mrs nettlepoint at her particular request she told me she knew that if i left her mrs peck and mrs gotch would come to speak to her she was flurried and fatigued at having to make an effort and i think that grace maviss choosing this occasion for retirement suggested to her a little that she had been made a fool of she remarked that the girls not being there showed her complete want of breeding and that she was really very good to have put herself out for her so she was a common creature and that was the end of it i could see that mrs nettlepoints advent quickened the speculative activity of the other ladies they watched her from the opposite side of the deck keeping their eyes fixed on her very much as the man at the wheel kept his on the course of the ship mrs peck plainly meditated an approach and it was from this danger that mrs nettlepoint averted her face  its just as we said she remarked to me as we sat there it is like the bucket in the well when i come up that girl goes down  yes but youve succeeded since jasper remains here  remains i dont see him  he comes and goesits the same thing  he goes more than he comes but nen parlons plus i havent gained anything i dont admire the sea at allwhat is it but a magnified watertank i shant come up again  i have an idea shell stay in her cabin now i said she tells me she has one to herself mrs nettlepoint replied that she might do as she liked and i repeated to her the little conversation i had had with jasper  she listened with interest but marry her mercy she exclaimed i like the manner in which you give my son away  you wouldnt accept that  never in the world  then i dont understand your position  good heavens i have none it isnt a position to be bored to death  you wouldnt accept it even in the case i put to himthat of her believing she had been encouraged to throw over poor porterfield  not evennot even who knows what she believes  then you do exactly what i said you wouldyou show me a fine example of maternal immorality  maternal fiddlesticks it was she began it  then why did you come up today  to keep you quiet  mrs nettlepoints dinner was served on deck but i went into the saloon jasper was there but not grace mavis as i had half expected i asked him what had become of her if she were ill he must have thought i had an ignoble pertinacity and he replied that he knew nothing whatever about her mrs peck talked to me about mrs nettlepoint and said it had been a great interest to her to see her only it was a pity she didnt seem more sociable to this i replied that she had to beg to be excusedshe was not well  you dont mean to say shes sick on this pond  no shes unwell in another way  i guess i know the way mrs peck laughed and then she added i suppose she came up to look after her charge  her charge  why miss mavis weve talked enough about that  quite enough i dont know what that had to do with it miss mavis hasnt been there today  oh it goes on all the same  it goes on  well its too late  too late  well youll see therell be a row  this was not comforting but i did not repeat it above mrs nettlepoint returned early to her cabin professing herself much tired i know not what went on but grace mavis continued not to show i went in late to bid mrs nettlepoint goodnight and learned from her that the girl had not been to her she had sent the stewardess to her room for news to see if she were ill and needed assistance and the stewardess came back with the information that she was not there i went above after this the night was not quite so fair and the deck was almost empty in a moment jasper nettlepoint and our young lady moved past me together i hope you are better i called after her and she replied over her shoulder  oh yes i had a headache but the air now does me good  i went down againi was the only person there but they and i wished to not appear to be watching themand returning to mrs nettlepoints room found her door was open into the little passage that she was still sitting up  shes all right i said shes on the deck with jasper  the old lady looked up at me from her book i didnt know you called that all right  well its better than something else  something else  something i was a little afraid of mrs nettlepoint continued to look at me she asked me what that was ill tell you when we are ashore i said  the next day i went to see her at the usual hour of my morning visit and found her in considerable agitation the scenes have begun she said you know i told you i shouldnt get through without them you made me nervous last nighti havent the least idea what you meant but you made me nervous she came in to see me an hour ago and i had the courage to say to her i dont know why i shouldnt tell you frankly that i have been scolding my son about you of course she asked me what i meant by that and i saidit seems to me he drags you about the ship too much for a girl in your position he has the air of not remembering that you belong to some one else there is a kind of want of taste and even of want of respect in it that produced an explosion she became very violent  do you mean angry  not exactly angry but very hot and excitedat my presuming to think her relations with my son were not the simplest in the world i might scold him as much as i likedthat was between ourselves but she didnt see why i should tell her that i had done so did i think she allowed him to treat her with disrespect that idea was not very complimentary to her he had treated her better and been kinder to her than most other peoplethere were very few on the ship that hadnt been insulting she should be glad enough when she got off it to her own people to some one whom no one would have a right to say anything about what was there in her position that was not perfectly natural what was the idea of making a fuss about her position did i mean that she took it too easilythat she didnt think as much as she ought about mr porterfield didnt i believe she was attached to himdidnt i believe she was just counting the hours until she saw him that would be the happiest moment of her life it showed how little i knew her if i thought anything else  all that must have been rather finei should have liked to hear it i said and what did you reply  oh i grovelled i told her that i accused her as regards my son of nothing worse than an excess of good nature she helped him to pass his timehe ought to be immensely obliged also that it would be a very happy moment for me too when i should hand her over to mr porterfield  and will you come up today  no indeedshell do very well now  i gave a sigh of relief alls well that ends well  jasper that day spent a great deal of time with his mother she had told me that she really had had no proper opportunity to talk over with him their movements after disembarking everything changes a little the last two or three days of a voyage the spell is broken and new combinations take place grace mavis was neither on deck nor at dinner and i drew mrs pecks attention to the extreme propriety with which she now conducted herself she had spent the day in meditation and she judged it best to continue to meditate  ah shes afraid said my implacable neighbour  afraid of what  well that well tell tales when we get there  whom do you mean by we  well there are plenty on a ship like this  well then we wont  maybe we wont have the chance said the dreadful little woman  oh at that moment a universal geniality reigns  well shes afraid all the same  so much the better  yes so much the better  all the next day too the girl remained invisible and mrs nettlepoint told me that she had not been in to see her she had inquired by the stewardess if she would receive her in her own cabin and grace mavis had replied that it was littered up with things and unfit for visitors she was packing a trunk over jasper made up for his devotion to his mother the day before by now spending a great deal of his time in the smokingroom i wanted to say to him this is much better but i thought it wiser to hold my tongue indeed i had begun to feel the emotion of prospective arrival i was delighted to be almost back in my dear old europe again and had less to spare for other matters it will doubtless appear to the critical reader that i had already devoted far too much to the little episode of which my story gives an account but to this i can only reply that the event justified me we sighted land the dim yet rich coast of ireland about sunset and i leaned on the edge of the ship and looked at it it doesnt look like much does it i heard a voice say beside me and turning i found grace mavis was there almost for the first time she had her veil up and i thought her very pale  it will be more tomorrow i said  oh yes a great deal more  the first sight of land at sea changes everything i went on i always think its like waking up from a dream its a return to reality  for a moment she made no response to this then she said it doesnt look very real yet  no and meanwhile this lovely evening the dream is still present  she looked up at the sky which had a brightness though the light of the sun had left it and that of the stars had not come out it is a lovely evening  oh yes with this we shall do  she stood there a while longer while the growing dusk effaced the line of the land more rapidly than our progress made it distinct she said nothing more she only looked in front of her but her very quietness made me want to say something suggestive of sympathy and service i was unable to think what to saysome things seemed too wide of the mark and others too importunate at last unexpectedly she appeared to give me my chance irrelevantly abruptly she broke out  didnt you tell me that you knew mr porterfield  dear me yesi used to see him i have often wanted to talk to you about him  she turned her face upon me and in the deepened evening i fancied she looked whiter what good would that do  why it would be a pleasure i replied rather foolishly  do you mean for you  well yescall it that i said smiling  did you know him so well  my smile became a laugh and i saidyou are not easy to make speeches to  i hate speeches the words came from her lips with a violence that surprised me they were loud and hard but before i had time to wonder at it she went onshall you know him when you see him  perfectly i think her manner was so strange that one had to notice it in some way and it appeared to me the best way was to notice it jocularly so i added shant you  oh perhaps youll point him out and she walked quickly away as i looked after her i had a singular a perverse and rather an embarrassed sense of having during the previous days and especially in speaking to jasper nettlepoint interfered with her situation to her loss i had a sort of pang in seeing her move about alone i felt somehow responsible for it and asked myself why i could not have kept my hands off i had seen jasper in the smokingroom more than once that day as i passed it and half an hour before this i had observed through the open door that he was there he had been with her so much that without him she had a bereaved forsaken air it was better no doubt but superficially it made her rather pitiable mrs peck would have told me that their separation was gammon they didnt show together on deck and in the saloon but they made it up elsewhere the secret places on shipboard are not numerous mrs pecks elsewhere would have been vague and i know not what license her imagination took it was distinct that jasper had fallen off but of course what had passed between them on this subject was not so and could never be later through his mother i had his version of that but i may remark that i didnt believe it poor mrs nettlepoint did of course i was almost capable after the girl had left me of going to my young man and saying after all do return to her a little just till we get in it wont make any difference after we land and i dont think it was the fear he would tell me i was an idiot that prevented me at any rate the next time i passed the door of the smokingroom i saw that he had left it i paid my usual visit to mrs nettlepoint that night but i troubled her no further about miss mavis she had made up her mind that everything was smooth and settled now and it seemed to me that i had worried her and that she had worried herself enough i left her to enjoy the foretaste of arrival which had taken possession of her mind before turning in i went above and found more passengers on deck than i had ever seen so late jasper was walking about among them alone but i forebore to join him the coast of ireland had disappeared but the night and the sea were perfect on the way to my cabin when i came down i met the stewardess in one of the passages and the idea entered my head to say to herdo you happen to know where miss mavis is  why shes in her room sir at this hour  do you suppose i could speak to her it had come into my mind to ask her why she had inquired of me whether i should recognise mr porterfield  no sir said the stewardess she has gone to bed  thats all right and i followed the young ladys excellent example  the next morning while i was dressing the steward of my side of the ship came to me as usual to see what i wanted but the first thing he said to me wasrather a bad job sira passenger missing  a passengermissing  a lady sir i think you knew her miss mavis sir  missing i criedstaring at him horrorstricken  shes not on the ship they cant find her  then where to god is she  i remember his queer face well sir i suppose you know that as well as i  do you mean she has jumped overboard  some time in the night siron the quiet but its beyond every one the way she escaped notice they usually sees em sir it must have been about halfpast two lord but she was clever sir she didnt so much as make a splash they say she ad come against her will sir  i had dropped upon my sofai felt faint the man went on liking to talk as persons of his class do when they have something horrible to tell she usually rang for the stewardess early but this morning of course there had been no ring the stewardess had gone in all the same about eight oclock and found the cabin empty that was about an hour ago her things were there in confusionthe things she usually wore when she went above the stewardess thought she had been rather strange last night but she waited a little and then went back miss mavis hadnt turned upand she didnt turn up the stewardess began to look for hershe hadnt been seen on deck or in the saloon besides she wasnt dressednot to show herself all her clothes were in her room there was another lady an old lady mrs nettlepointi would know herthat she was sometimes with but the stewardess had been with her and she knew miss mavis had not come near her that morning she had spoken to him and they had taken a quiet lookthey had hunted everywhere a ships a big place but you do come to the end of it and if a person aint there why they aint in short an hour had passed and the young lady was not accounted for from which i might judge if she ever would be the watch couldnt account for her but no doubt the fishes in the sea couldpoor miserable lady the stewardess and he they had of course thought it their duty very soon to speak to the doctor and the doctor had spoken immediately to the captain the captain didnt like itthey never did but he would try to keep it quietthey always did  by the time i succeeded in pulling myself together and getting on after a fashion the rest of my clothes i had learned that mrs nettlepoint had not yet been informed unless the stewardess had broken it to her within the previous few minutes her son knew the young gentleman on the other side of the ship he had the other steward my man had seen him come out of his cabin and rush above just before he came in to me he had gone above my man was sure he had not gone to the old ladys cabin i remember a queer vision when the steward told me thisthe wild flash of a picture of jasper nettlepoint leaping with a mad compunction in his young agility over the side of the ship i hasten to add that no such incident was destined to contribute its horror to poor grace maviss mysterious tragic act what followed was miserable enough but i can only glance at it when i got to mrs nettlepoints door she was there in her dressinggown the stewardess had just told her and she was rushing out to come to me i made her go backi said i would go for jasper i went for him but i missed him partly no doubt because it was really at first the captain i was after i found this personage and found him highly scandalised but he gave me no hope that we were in error and his displeasure expressed with seamanlike plainness was a definite settlement of the question from the deck where i merely turned round and looked i saw the light of another summer day the coast of ireland green and near and the sea a more charming colour than it had been at all when i came below again jasper had passed back he had gone to his cabin and his mother had joined him there he remained there till we reached liverpooli never saw him his mother after a little at his request left him alone all the world went above to look at the land and chatter about our tragedy but the poor lady spent the day dismally enough in her room it seemed to me intolerably long i was thinking so of vague porterfield and of my prospect of having to face him on the morrow now of course i knew why she had asked me if i should recognise him she had delegated to me mentally a certain pleasant office i gave mrs peck and mrs gotch a wide berthi couldnt talk to them i could or at least i did a little to mrs nettlepoint but with too many reserves for comfort on either side for i foresaw that it would not in the least do now to mention jasper to her i was obliged to assume by my silence that he had had nothing to do with what had happened and of course i never really ascertained what he had had to do the secret of what passed between him and the strange girl who would have sacrificed her marriage to him on so short an acquaintance remains shut up in his breast his mother i know went to his door from time to time but he refused her admission that evening to be human at a venture i requested the steward to go in and ask him if he should care to see me and the attendant returned with an answer which he candidly transmitted not in the least jasper apparently was almost as scandalised as the captain  at liverpool at the dock when we had touched twenty people came on board and i had already made out mr porterfield at a distance he was looking up at the side of the great vessel with disappointment written to my eyes in his facedisappointment at not seeing the woman he loved lean over it and wave her handkerchief to him every one was looking at him every one but she his identity flew about in a moment and i wondered if he did not observe it he used to be lean he had grown almost fat the interval between us diminishedhe was on the plank and then on the deck with the jostling officers of the customsall too soon for my equanimity i met him instantly however laid my hand on him and drew him away though i perceived that he had no impression of having seen me before it was not till afterwards that i thought this a little stupid of him i drew him far away i was conscious of mrs peck and mrs gotch looking at us as we passed into the empty stale smokingroom he remained speechless and that struck me as like him i had to speak first he could not even relieve me by saying is anything the matter i told him first that she was ill it was an odious moment     the liar     i   the train was half an hour late and the drive from the station longer than he had supposed so that when he reached the house its inmates had dispersed to dress for dinner and he was conducted straight to his room the curtains were drawn in this asylum the candles were lighted the fire was bright and when the servant had quickly put out his clothes the comfortable little place became suggestiveseemed to promise a pleasant house a various party talks acquaintances affinities to say nothing of very good cheer he was too occupied with his profession to pay many country visits but he had heard people who had more time for them speak of establishments where they do you very well he foresaw that the proprietors of stayes would do him very well in his bedroom at a country house he always looked first at the books on the shelf and the prints on the walls he considered that these things gave a sort of measure of the culture and even of the character of his hosts though he had but little time to devote to them on this occasion a cursory inspection assured him that if the literature as usual was mainly american and humorous the art consisted neither of the watercolour studies of the children nor of goody engravings the walls were adorned with oldfashioned lithographs principally portraits of country gentlemen with high collars and riding gloves this suggestedand it was encouragingthat the tradition of portraiture was held in esteem there was the customary novel of mr le fanu for the bedside the ideal reading in a country house for the hours after midnight oliver lyon could scarcely forbear beginning it while he buttoned his shirt  perhaps that is why he not only found every one assembled in the hall when he went down but perceived from the way the move to dinner was instantly made that they had been waiting for him there was no delay to introduce him to a lady for he went out in a group of unmatched men without this appendage the men straggling behind sidled and edged as usual at the door of the diningroom and the dénouement of this little comedy was that he came to his place last of all this made him think that he was in a sufficiently distinguished company for if he had been humiliated which he was not he could not have consoled himself with the reflection that such a fate was natural to an obscure struggling young artist he could no longer think of himself as very young alas and if his position was not so brilliant as it ought to be he could no longer justify it by calling it a struggle he was something of a celebrity and he was apparently in a society of celebrities this idea added to the curiosity with which he looked up and down the long table as he settled himself in his place  it was a numerous partyfive and twenty people rather an odd occasion to have proposed to him as he thought he would not be surrounded by the quiet that ministers to good work however it had never interfered with his work to see the spectacle of human life before him in the intervals and though he did not know it it was never quiet at stayes when he was working well he found himself in that happy statethe happiest of all for an artistin which things in general contribute to the particular idea and fall in with it help it on and justify it so that he feels for the hour as if nothing in the world can happen to him even if it come in the guise of disaster or suffering that will not be an enhancement of his subject moreover there was an exhilaration he had felt it before in the rapid change of scenethe jump in the dusk of the afternoon from foggy london and his familiar studio to a centre of festivity in the middle of hertfordshire and a drama half acted a drama of pretty women and noted men and wonderful orchids in silver jars he observed as a not unimportant fact that one of the pretty women was beside him a gentleman sat on his other hand but he went into his neighbours little as yet he was busy looking out for sir david whom he had never seen and about whom he naturally was curious  evidently however sir david was not at dinner a circumstance sufficiently explained by the other circumstance which constituted our friends principal knowledge of himhis being ninety years of age oliver lyon had looked forward with great pleasure to the chance of painting a nonagenarian and though the old mans absence from table was something of a disappointment it was an opportunity the less to observe him before going to work it seemed a sign that he was rather a sacred and perhaps therefore an impressive relic lyon looked at his son with the greater interestwondered whether the glazed bloom of his cheek had been transmitted from sir david that would be jolly to paint in the old manthe withered ruddiness of a winter apple especially if the eye were still alive and the white hair carried out the frosty look arthur ashmores hair had a midsummer glow but lyon was glad his commission had been to delineate the father rather than the son in spite of his never having seen the one and of the other being seated there before him now in the happy expansion of liberal hospitality  arthur ashmore was a freshcoloured thicknecked english gentleman but he was just not a subject he might have been a farmer and he might have been a banker you could scarcely paint him in characters his wife did not make up the amount she was a large bright negative woman who had the same air as her husband of being somehow tremendously new a sort of appearance of fresh varnish lyon could scarcely tell whether it came from her complexion or from her clothes so that one felt she ought to sit in a gilt frame suggesting reference to a catalogue or a pricelist it was as if she were already rather a bad though expensive portrait knocked off by an eminent hand and lyon had no wish to copy that work the pretty woman on his right was engaged with her neighbour and the gentleman on his other side looked shrinking and scared so that he had time to lose himself in his favourite diversion of watching face after face this amusement gave him the greatest pleasure he knew and he often thought it a mercy that the human mask did interest him and that it was not less vivid than it was sometimes it ran its success in this line very close since he was to make his living by reproducing it even if arthur ashmore would not be inspiring to paint a certain anxiety rose in him lest if he should make a hit with her fatherinlaw mrs arthur should take it into her head that he had now proved himself worthy to aborder her husband even if he had looked a little less like a page fine as to print and margin without punctuation he would still be a refreshing iridescent surface but the gentleman four persons offwhat was he would he be a subject or was his face only the legible doorplate of his identity burnished with punctual washing and shavingthe least thing that was decent that you would know him by  this face arrested oliver lyon it struck him at first as very handsome the gentleman might still be called young and his features were regular he had a plentiful fair moustache that curled up at the ends a brilliant gallant almost adventurous air and a big shining breastpin in the middle of his shirt he appeared a fine satisfied soul and lyon perceived that wherever he rested his friendly eye there fell an influence as pleasant as the september sunas if he could make grapes and pears or even human affection ripen by looking at them what was odd in him was a certain mixture of the correct and the extravagant as if he were an adventurer imitating a gentleman with rare perfection or a gentleman who had taken a fancy to go about with hidden arms he might have been a dethroned prince or the warcorrespondent of a newspaper he represented both enterprise and tradition good manners and bad taste lyon at length fell into conversation with the lady beside himthey dispensed as he had had to dispense at dinnerparties before with an introductionby asking who this personage might be  oh hes colonel capadose dont you know lyon didnt know and he asked for further information his neighbour had a sociable manner and evidently was accustomed to quick transitions she turned from her other interlocutor with a methodical air as a good cook lifts the cover of the next saucepan he has been a great deal in indiaisnt he rather celebrated she inquired lyon confessed he had never heard of him and she went on well perhaps he isnt but he says he is and if you think it thats just the same isnt it  if you think it  i mean if he thinks itthats just as good i suppose  do you mean that he says that which is not  oh dear nobecause i never know he is exceedingly clever and amusingquite the cleverest person in the house unless indeed you are more so but that i cant tell yet can i i only know about the people i know i think thats celebrity enough  enough for them  oh i see youre clever enough for me but i have heard of you the lady went on i know your pictures i admire them but i dont think you look like them  they are mostly portraits lyon said and what i usually try for is not my own resemblance  i see what you mean but they have much more colour and now you are going to do some one here  i have been invited to do sir david im rather disappointed at not seeing him this evening  oh he goes to bed at some unnatural houreight oclock or something of that sort you know hes rather an old mummy  an old mummy oliver lyon repeated  i mean he wears half a dozen waistcoats and that sort of thing hes always cold  i have never seen him and never seen any portrait or photograph of him lyon said im surprised at his never having had anything doneat their waiting all these years  ah thats because he was afraid you know it was a kind of superstition he was sure that if anything were done he would die directly afterwards he has only consented today  hes ready to die then  oh now hes so old he doesnt care  well i hope i shant kill him said lyon it was rather unnatural in his son to send for me  oh they have nothing to gaineverything is theirs already his companion rejoined as if she took this speech quite literally her talkativeness was systematicshe fraternised as seriously as she might have played whist they do as they likethey fill the house with peoplethey have carte blanche  i seebut theres still the title  yes but what is it  our artist broke into laughter at this whereat his companion stared before he had recovered himself she was scouring the plain with her other neighbour the gentleman on his left at last risked an observation and they had some fragmentary talk this personage played his part with difficulty he uttered a remark as a lady fires a pistol looking the other way to catch the ball lyon had to bend his ear and this movement led to his observing a handsome creature who was seated on the same side beyond his interlocutor her profile was presented to him and at first he was only struck with its beauty then it produced an impression still more agreeablea sense of undimmed remembrance and intimate association he had not recognised her on the instant only because he had so little expected to see her there he had not seen her anywhere for so long and no news of her ever came to him she was often in his thoughts but she had passed out of his life he thought of her twice a week that may be called often in relation to a person one has not seen for twelve years the moment after he recognised her he felt how true it was that it was only she who could look like that of the most charming head in the world and this lady had it there could never be a replica she was leaning forward a little she remained in profile apparently listening to some one on the other side of her she was listening but she was also looking and after a moment lyon followed the direction of her eyes they rested upon the gentleman who had been described to him as colonel capadoserested as it appeared to him with a kind of habitual visible complacency this was not strange for the colonel was unmistakably formed to attract the sympathetic gaze of woman but lyon was slightly disappointed that she could let him look at her so long without giving him a glance there was nothing between them today and he had no rights but she must have known he was coming it was of course not such a tremendous event but she could not have been staying in the house without hearing of it and it was not natural that that should absolutely fail to affect her  she was looking at colonel capadose as if she were in love with hima queer accident for the proudest most reserved of women but doubtless it was all right if her husband liked it or didnt notice it he had heard indefinitely years before that she was married and he took for granted as he had not heard that she had become a widow the presence of the happy man on whom she had conferred what she had refused to him the poor artstudent at munich colonel capadose appeared to be aware of nothing and this circumstance incongruously enough rather irritated lyon than gratified him suddenly the lady turned her head showing her full face to our hero he was so prepared with a greeting that he instantly smiled as a shaken jug overflows but she gave him no response turned away again and sank back in her chair all that her face said in that instant was you see im as handsome as ever to which he mentally subjoined yes and as much good it does me he asked the young man beside him if he knew who that beautiful being wasthe fifth person beyond him the young man leaned forward considered and then said i think shes mrs capadose  do you mean his wifethat fellows and lyon indicated the subject of the information given him by his other neighbour  oh is he mr capadose said the young man who appeared very vague he admitted his vagueness and explained it by saying that there were so many people and he had come only the day before what was definite to lyon was that mrs capadose was in love with her husband so that he wished more than ever that he had married her  shes very faithful he found himself saying three minutes later to the lady on his right he added that he meant mrs capadose  ah you know her then  i knew her once upon a timewhen i was living abroad  why then were you asking me about her husband  precisely for that reason she married after thati didnt even know her present name  how then do you know it now  this gentleman has just told mehe appears to know  i didnt know he knew anything said the lady glancing forward  i dont think he knows anything but that  then you have found out for yourself that she is faithful what do you mean by that  ah you mustnt question mei want to question you lyon said how do you all like her here  you ask too much i can only speak for myself i think shes hard  thats only because shes honest and straightforward  do you mean i like people in proportion as they deceive  i think we all do so long as we dont find them out lyon said and then theres something in her facea sort of roman type in spite of her having such an english eye in fact shes english down to the ground but her complexion her low forehead and that beautiful close little wave in her dark hair make her look like a glorified contadina  yes and she always sticks pins and daggers into her head to increase that effect i must say i like her husband better he is so clever  well when i knew her there was no comparison that could injure her she was altogether the most delightful thing in munich  in munich  her people lived there they were not richin pursuit of economy in fact and munich was very cheap her father was the younger son of some noble house he had married a second time and had a lot of little mouths to feed she was the child of the first wife and she didnt like her stepmother but she was charming to her little brothers and sisters i once made a sketch of her as werthers charlotte cutting bread and butter while they clustered all round her all the artists in the place were in love with her but she wouldnt look at the likes of us she was too proudi grant you that but she wasnt stuck up nor young ladyish she was simple and frank and kind about it she used to remind me of thackerays ethel newcome she told me she must marry well it was the one thing she could do for her family i suppose you would say that she has married well  she told you smiled lyons neighbour  oh of course i proposed to her too but she evidently thinks so herself he added  when the ladies left the table the host as usual bade the gentlemen draw together so that lyon found himself opposite to colonel capadose the conversation was mainly about the run for it had apparently been a great day in the huntingfield most of the gentlemen communicated their adventures and opinions but colonel capadoses pleasant voice was the most audible in the chorus it was a bright and fresh but masculine organ just such a voice as to lyons sense such a fine man ought to have had it appeared from his remarks that he was a very straight rider which was also very much what lyon would have expected not that he swaggered for his allusions were very quietly and casually made but they were all too dangerous experiments and close shaves lyon perceived after a little that the attention paid by the company to the colonels remarks was not in direct relation to the interest they seemed to offer the result of which was that the speaker who noticed that he at least was listening began to treat him as his particular auditor and to fix his eyes on him as he talked lyon had nothing to do but to look sympathetic and assentcolonel capadose appeared to take so much sympathy and assent for granted a neighbouring squire had had an accident he had come a cropper in an awkward placejust at the finishwith consequences that looked grave he had struck his head he remained insensible up to the last accounts there had evidently been concussion of the brain there was some exchange of views as to his recoveryhow soon it would take place or whether it would take place at all which led the colonel to confide to our artist across the table that he shouldnt despair of a fellow even if he didnt come round for weeksfor weeks and weeks and weeksfor months almost for years he leaned forward lyon leaned forward to listen and colonel capadose mentioned that he knew from personal experience that there was really no limit to the time one might lie unconscious without being any the worse for it it had happened to him in ireland years before he had been pitched out of a dogcart had turned a sheer somersault and landed on his head they thought he was dead but he wasnt they carried him first to the nearest cabin where he lay for some days with the pigs and then to an inn in a neighbouring townit was a near thing they didnt put him under ground he had been completely insensiblewithout a ray of recognition of any human thingfor three whole months had not a glimmer of consciousness of any blessed thing it was touch and go to that degree that they couldnt come near him they couldnt feed him they could scarcely look at him then one day he had opened his eyesas fit as a flea  i give you my honour it had done me goodit rested my brain he appeared to intimate that with an intelligence so active as his these periods of repose were providential lyon thought his story very striking but he wanted to ask him whether he had not shammed a littlenot in relating it but in keeping so quiet he hesitated however in time to imply a doubthe was so impressed with the tone in which colonel capadose said that it was the turn of a hair that they hadnt buried him alive that had happened to a friend of his in indiaa fellow who was supposed to have died of jungle feverthey clapped him into a coffin he was going on to recite the further fate of this unfortunate gentleman when mr ashmore made a move and every one got up to adjourn to the drawingroom lyon noticed that by this time no one was heeding what his new friend said to him they came round on either side of the table and met while the gentlemen dawdled before going out  and do you mean that your friend was literally buried alive asked lyon in some suspense  colonel capadose looked at him a moment as if he had already lost the thread of the conversation then his face brightenedand when it brightened it was doubly handsome upon my soul he was chucked into the ground  and was he left there  he was left there till i came and hauled him out  you came  i dreamed about himits the most extraordinary story i heard him calling to me in the night i took upon myself to dig him up you know there are people in indiaa kind of beastly race the ghoulswho violate graves i had a sort of presentiment that they would get at him first i rode straight i can tell you and by jove a couple of them had just broken ground crackcrack from a couple of barrels and they showed me their heels as you may believe would you credit that i took him out myself the air brought him to and he was none the worse he has got his pensionhe came home the other day he would do anything for me  he called to you in the night said lyon much startled  thats the interesting point now what was it it wasnt his ghost because he wasnt dead it wasnt himself because he couldnt it was something or other you see indias a strange countrytheres an element of the mysterious the air is full of things you cant explain  they passed out of the diningroom and colonel capadose who went among the first was separated from lyon but a minute later before they reached the drawingroom he joined him again ashmore tells me who you are of course i have often heard of youim very glad to make your acquaintance my wife used to know you  im glad she remembers me i recognised her at dinner and i was afraid she didnt  ah i daresay she was ashamed said the colonel with indulgent humour  ashamed of me lyon replied in the same key  wasnt there something about a picture yes you painted her portrait  many times said the artist and she may very well have been ashamed of what i made of her  well i wasnt my dear sir it was the sight of that picture which you were so good as to present to her that made me first fall in love with her  do you mean that one with the childrencutting bread and butter  bread and butter bless me novine leaves and a leopard skina kind of bacchante  ah yes said lyon i remember it was the first decent portrait i painted i should be curious to see it today  dont ask her to show it to youshell be mortified the colonel exclaimed  mortified  we parted with itin the most disinterested manner he laughed an old friend of my wifesher family had known him intimately when they lived in germanytook the most extraordinary fancy to it the grand duke of silberstadtschreckenstein dont you know he came out to bombay while we were there and he spotted your picture you know hes one of the greatest collectors in europe and made such eyes at it that upon my wordit happened to be his birthdayshe told him he might have it to get rid of him he was perfectly enchantedbut we miss the picture  it is very good of you lyon said if its in a great collectiona work of my incompetent youthi am infinitely honoured  oh he has got it in one of his castles i dont know whichyou know he has so many he sent us before he left indiato return the complimenta magnificent old vase  that was more than the thing was worth lyon remarked  colonel capadose gave no heed to this observation he seemed to be thinking of something after a moment he said if youll come and see us in town shell show you the vase and as they passed into the drawingroom he gave the artist a friendly propulsion go and speak to her there she isshell be delighted  oliver lyon took but a few steps into the wide saloon he stood there a moment looking at the bright composition of the lamplit group of fair women the single figures the great setting of white and gold the panels of old damask in the centre of each of which was a single celebrated picture there was a subdued lustre in the scene and an air as of the shining trains of dresses tumbled over the carpet at the furthest end of the room sat mrs capadose rather isolated she was on a small sofa with an empty place beside her lyon could not flatter himself she had been keeping it for him her failure to respond to his recognition at table contradicted that but he felt an extreme desire to go and occupy it moreover he had her husbands sanction so he crossed the room stepping over the tails of gowns and stood before his old friend  i hope you dont mean to repudiate me he said  she looked up at him with an expression of unalloyed pleasure i am so glad to see you i was delighted when i heard you were coming  i tried to get a smile from you at dinnerbut i couldnt  i didnt seei didnt understand besides i hate smirking and telegraphing also im very shyyou wont have forgotten that now we can communicate comfortably and she made a better place for him on the little sofa he sat down and they had a talk that he enjoyed while the reason for which he used to like her so came back to him as well as a good deal of the very same old liking she was still the least spoiled beauty he had ever seen with an absence of coquetry or any insinuating art that seemed almost like an omitted faculty there were moments when she struck her interlocutor as some fine creature from an asyluma surprising deafmute or one of the operative blind her noble pagan head gave her privileges that she neglected and when people were admiring her brow she was wondering whether there were a good fire in her bedroom she was simple kind and good inexpressive but not inhuman or stupid now and again she dropped something that had a sifted selected airthe sound of an impression at first hand she had no imagination but she had added up her feelings some of her reflections about life lyon talked of the old days in munich reminded her of incidents pleasures and pains asked her about her father and the others and she told him in return that she was so impressed with his own fame his brilliant position in the world that she had not felt very sure he would speak to her or that his little sign at table was meant for her this was plainly a perfectly truthful speechshe was incapable of any otherand he was affected by such humility on the part of a woman whose grand line was unique her father was dead one of her brothers was in the navy and the other on a ranch in america two of her sisters were married and the youngest was just coming out and very pretty she didnt mention her stepmother she asked him about his own personal history and he said that the principal thing that had happened to him was that he had never married  oh you ought to she answered its the best thing  i like thatfrom you he returned  why not from me i am very happy  thats just why i cant be its cruel of you to praise your state but i have had the pleasure of making the acquaintance of your husband we had a good bit of talk in the other room  you must know him betteryou must know him really well said mrs capadose  i am sure that the further you go the more you find but he makes a fine show too  she rested her good gray eyes on lyon dont you think hes handsome  handsome and clever and entertaining you see im generous  yes you must know him well mrs capadose repeated  he has seen a great deal of life said her companion  yes we have been in so many places you must see my little girl she is nine years oldshes too beautiful  you must bring her to my studio some dayi should like to paint her  ah dont speak of that said mrs capadose it reminds me of something so distressing  i hope you dont mean when you used to sit to methough that may well have bored you  its not what you didits what we have done its a confession i must makeits a weight on my mind i mean about that beautiful picture you gave meit used to be so much admired when you come to see me in london i count on your doing that very soon i shall see you looking all round i cant tell you i keep it in my own room because i love it so for the simple reason and she paused a moment  because you cant tell wicked lies said lyon  no i cant so before you ask for it  oh i know you parted with itthe blow has already fallen lyon interrupted  ah then you have heard i was sure you would but do you know what we got for it two hundred pounds  you might have got much more said lyon smiling  that seemed a great deal at the time we were in want of the moneyit was a good while ago when we first married our means were very small then but fortunately that has changed rather for the better we had the chance it really seemed a big sum and i am afraid we jumped at it my husband had expectations which have partly come into effect so that now we do well enough but meanwhile the picture went  fortunately the original remained but do you mean that two hundred was the value of the vase lyon asked  of the vase  the beautiful old indian vasethe grand dukes offering  the grand duke  whats his namesilberstadtschreckenstein your husband mentioned the transaction  oh my husband said mrs capadose and lyon saw that she coloured a little  not to add to her embarrassment but to clear up the ambiguity which he perceived the next moment he had better have left alone he went on he tells me its now in his collection  in the grand dukes ah you know its reputation i believe it contains treasures she was bewildered but she recovered herself and lyon made the mental reflection that for some reason which would seem good when he knew it the husband and the wife had prepared different versions of the same incident it was true that he did not exactly see everina brant preparing a version that was not her line of old and indeed it was not in her eyes today at any rate they both had the matter too much on their conscience he changed the subject said mrs capadose must really bring the little girl he sat with her some time longer and thoughtperhaps it was only a fancythat she was rather absent as if she were annoyed at their having been even for a moment at crosspurposes this did not prevent him from saying to her at the last just as the ladies began to gather themselves together to go to bed you seem much impressed from what you say with my renown and my prosperity and you are so good as greatly to exaggerate them would you have married me if you had known that i was destined to success  i did know it  well i didnt  you were too modest  you didnt think so when i proposed to you  well if i had married you i couldnt have married himand hes so nice mrs capadose said lyon knew she thought ithe had learned that at dinnerbut it vexed him a little to hear her say it the gentleman designated by the pronoun came up amid the prolonged handshaking for goodnight and mrs capadose remarked to her husband as she turned away he wants to paint amy  ah shes a charming child a most interesting little creature the colonel said to lyon she does the most remarkable things  mrs capadose stopped in the rustling procession that followed the hostess out of the room dont tell him please dont she said  dont tell him what  why what she does let him find out for himself and she passed on  she thinks i swagger about the childthat i bore people said the colonel i hope you smoke he appeared ten minutes later in the smokingroom in a brilliant equipment a suit of crimson foulard covered with little white spots he gratified lyons eye made him feel that the modern age has its splendour too and its opportunities for costume if his wife was an antique he was a fine specimen of the period of colour he might have passed for a venetian of the sixteenth century they were a remarkable couple lyon thought and as he looked at the colonel standing in bright erectness before the chimneypiece while he emitted great smokepuffs he did not wonder that everina could not regret she had not married him all the gentlemen collected at stayes were not smokers and some of them had gone to bed colonel capadose remarked that there probably would be a smallish muster they had had such a hard days work that was the worst of a huntinghousethe men were so sleepy after dinner it was devilish stupid for the ladies even for those who hunted themselvesfor women were so extraordinary they never showed it but most fellows revived under the stimulating influences of the smokingroom and some of them in this confidence would turn up yet some of the grounds of their confidencenot all of themmight have been seen in a cluster of glasses and bottles on a table near the fire which made the great salver and its contents twinkle sociably the others lurked as yet in various improper corners of the minds of the most loquacious lyon was alone with colonel capadose for some moments before their companions in varied eccentricities of uniform straggled in and he perceived that this wonderful man had but little loss of vital tissue to repair  they talked about the house lyon having noticed an oddity of construction in the smokingroom and the colonel explained that it consisted of two distinct parts one of which was of very great antiquity they were two complete houses in short the old one and the new each of great extent and each very fine in its way the two formed together an enormous structurelyon must make a point of going all over it the modern portion had been erected by the old man when he bought the property oh yes he had bought it forty years beforeit hadnt been in the family there hadnt been any particular family for it to be in he had had the good taste not to spoil the original househe had not touched it beyond what was just necessary for joining it on it was very curious indeeda most irregular rambling mysterious pile where they every now and then discovered a walledup room or a secret staircase to his mind it was essentially gloomy however even the modern additions splendid as they were failed to make it cheerful there was some story about a skeleton having been found years before during some repairs under a stone slab of the floor of one of the passages but the family were rather shy of its being talked about the place they were in was of course in the old part which contained after all some of the best rooms he had an idea it had been the primitive kitchen half modernised at some intermediate period  my room is in the old part too thenim very glad lyon said its very comfortable and contains all the latest conveniences but i observed the depth of the recess of the door and the evident antiquity of the corridor and staircasethe first short oneafter i came out that panelled corridor is admirable it looks as if it stretched away in its brown dimness the lamps didnt seem to me to make much impression on it for half a mile  oh dont go to the end of it exclaimed the colonel smiling  does it lead to the haunted room lyon asked  his companion looked at him a moment ah you know about that  no i dont speak from knowledge only from hope i have never had any lucki have never stayed in a dangerous house the places i go to are always as safe as charing cross i want to seewhatever there is the regular thing is there a ghost here  of course there isa rattling good one  and have you seen him  oh dont ask me what ive seeni should tax your credulity i dont like to talk of these things but there are two or three as badthat is as goodrooms as youll find anywhere  do you mean in my corridor lyon asked  i believe the worst is at the far end but you would be illadvised to sleep there  illadvised  until youve finished your job youll get letters of importance the next morning and youll take the 1020  do you mean i will invent a pretext for running away  unless you are braver than almost any one has ever been they dont often put people to sleep there but sometimes the house is so crowded that they have to the same thing always happensillconcealed agitation at the breakfasttable and letters of the greatest importance of course its a bachelors room and my wife and i are at the other end of the house but we saw the comedy three days agothe day after we got here a young fellow had been put therei forget his namethe house was so full and the usual consequence followed letters at breakfastan awfully queer facean urgent call to townso very sorry his visit was cut short ashmore and his wife looked at each other and off the poor devil went  ah that wouldnt suit me i must paint my picture said lyon but do they mind your speaking of it some people who have a good ghost are very proud of it you know  what answer colonel capadose was on the point of making to this inquiry our hero was not to learn for at that moment their host had walked into the room accompanied by three or four gentlemen lyon was conscious that he was partly answered by the colonels not going on with the subject this however on the other hand was rendered natural by the fact that one of the gentlemen appealed to him for an opinion on a point under discussion something to do with the everlasting history of the days run to lyon himself mr ashmore began to talk expressing his regret at having had so little direct conversation with him as yet the topic that suggested itself was naturally that most closely connected with the motive of the artists visit lyon remarked that it was a great disadvantage to him not to have had some preliminary acquaintance with sir davidin most cases he found that so important but the present sitter was so far advanced in life that there was doubtless no time to lose oh i can tell you all about him said mr ashmore and for half an hour he told him a good deal it was very interesting as well as very eulogistic and lyon could see that he was a very nice old man to have endeared himself so to a son who was evidently not a gusher at last he got uphe said he must go to bed if he wished to be fresh for his work in the morning to which his host replied then you must take your candle the lights are out i dont keep my servants up  in a moment lyon had his glimmering taper in hand and as he was leaving the room he did not disturb the others with a goodnight they were absorbed in the lemonsqueezer and the sodawater cork he remembered other occasions on which he had made his way to bed alone through a darkened countryhouse such occasions had not been rare for he was almost always the first to leave the smokingroom if he had not stayed in houses conspicuously haunted he had none the less having the artistic temperament sometimes found the great black halls and staircases rather creepy there had been often a sinister effect to his imagination in the sound of his tread in the long passages or the way the winter moon peeped into tall windows on landings it occurred to him that if houses without supernatural pretensions could look so wicked at night the old corridors of stayes would certainly give him a sensation he didnt know whether the proprietors were sensitive very often as he had said to colonel capadose people enjoyed the impeachment what determined him to speak with a certain sense of the risk was the impression that the colonel told queer stories as he had his hand on the door he said to arthur ashmore i hope i shant meet any ghosts  any ghosts  you ought to have somein this fine old part  we do our best but que voulezvous said mr ashmore i dont think they like the hotwater pipes  they remind them too much of their own climate but havent you a haunted roomat the end of my passage  oh there are storieswe try to keep them up  i should like very much to sleep there lyon said  well you can move there tomorrow if you like  perhaps i had better wait till i have done my work  very good but you wont work there you know my father will sit to you in his own apartments  oh it isnt that its the fear of running away like that gentleman three days ago  three days ago what gentleman mr ashmore asked  the one who got urgent letters at breakfast and fled by the 1020 did he stand more than one night  i dont know what you are talking about there was no such gentlemanthree days ago  ah so much the better said lyon nodding goodnight and departing he took his course as he remembered it with his wavering candle and though he encountered a great many gruesome objects safely reached the passage out of which his room opened in the complete darkness it seemed to stretch away still further but he followed it for the curiosity of the thing to the end he passed several doors with the name of the room painted upon them but he found nothing else he was tempted to try the last doorto look into the room of evil fame but he reflected that this would be indiscreet since colonel capadose handled the brushas a raconteurwith such freedom there might be a ghost and there might not but the colonel himself he inclined to think was the most mystifying figure in the house     ii   lyon found sir david ashmore a capital subject and a very comfortable sitter into the bargain moreover he was a very agreeable old man tremendously puckered but not in the least dim and he wore exactly the furred dressinggown that lyon would have chosen he was proud of his age but ashamed of his infirmities which however he greatly exaggerated and which did not prevent him from sitting there as submissive as if portraiture in oils had been a branch of surgery he demolished the legend of his having feared the operation would be fatal giving an explanation which pleased our friend much better he held that a gentleman should be painted but once in his lifethat it was eager and fatuous to be hung up all over the place that was good for women who made a pretty wallpattern but the male face didnt lend itself to decorative repetition the proper time for the likeness was at the last when the whole man was thereyou got the totality of his experience lyon could not reply that that period was not a real compendiumyou had to allow so for leakage for there had been no crack in sir davids crystallisation he spoke of his portrait as a plain map of the country to be consulted by his children in a case of uncertainty a proper map could be drawn up only when the country had been travelled he gave lyon his mornings till luncheon and they talked of many things not neglecting as a stimulus to gossip the people in the house now that he did not go out as he said he saw much less of the visitors at stayes people came and went whom he knew nothing about and he liked to hear lyon describe them the artist sketched with a fine point and did not caricature and it usually befell that when sir david did not know the sons and daughters he had known the fathers and mothers he was one of those terrible old gentlemen who are a repository of antecedents but in the case of the capadose family at whom they arrived by an easy stage his knowledge embraced two or even three generations general capadose was an old crony and he remembered his father before him the general was rather a smart soldier but in private life of too speculative a turnalways sneaking into the city to put his money into some rotten thing he married a girl who brought him something and they had half a dozen children he scarcely knew what had become of the rest of them except that one was in the church and had found prefermentwasnt he dean of rockingham clement the fellow who was at stayes had some military talent he had served in the east he had married a pretty girl he had been at eton with his son and he used to come to stayes in his holidays lately coming back to england he had turned up with his wife again that was before hethe old manhad been put to grass he was a taking dog but he had a monstrous foible  a monstrous foible said lyon  hes a thumping liar  lyons brush stopped short while he repeated for somehow the formula startled him a thumping liar  you are very lucky not to have found it out  well i confess i have noticed a romantic tinge  oh it isnt always romantic hell lie about the time of day about the name of his hatter it appears there are people like that  well they are precious scoundrels lyon declared his voice trembling a little with the thought of what everina brant had done with herself  oh not always said the old man this fellow isnt in the least a scoundrel there is no harm in him and no bad intention he doesnt steal nor cheat nor gamble nor drink hes very kindhe sticks to his wife is fond of his children he simply cant give you a straight answer  then everything he told me last night i suppose was mendacious he delivered himself of a series of the stiffest statements they stuck when i tried to swallow them but i never thought of so simple an explanation  no doubt he was in the vein sir david went on its a natural peculiarityas you might limp or stutter or be lefthanded i believe it comes and goes like intermittent fever my son tells me that his friends usually understand it and dont haul him upfor the sake of his wife  oh his wifehis wife lyon murmured painting fast  i daresay shes used to it  never in the world sir david how can she be used to it  why my dear sir when a womans fondand dont they mostly handle the long bow themselves they are connoisseursthey have a sympathy for a fellowperformer  lyon was silent a moment he had no ground for denying that mrs capadose was attached to her husband but after a little he rejoined oh not this one i knew her years agobefore her marriage knew her well and admired her she was as clear as a bell  i like her very much sir david said but i have seen her back him up  lyon considered sir david for a moment not in the light of a model are you very sure  the old man hesitated then he answered smiling youre in love with her  very likely god knows i used to be  she must help him outshe cant expose him  she can hold her tongue lyon remarked  well before you probably she will  thats what i am curious to see and lyon added privately mercy on us what he must have made of her he kept this reflection to himself for he considered that he had sufficiently betrayed his state of mind with regard to mrs capadose none the less it occupied him now immensely the question of how such a woman would arrange herself in such a predicament he watched her with an interest deeply quickened when he mingled with the company he had had his own troubles in life but he had rarely been so anxious about anything as he was now to see what the loyalty of a wife and the infection of an example would have made of an absolutely truthful mind oh he held it as immutably established that whatever other women might be prone to do she of old had been perfectly incapable of a deviation even if she had not been too simple to deceive she would have been too proud and if she had not had too much conscience she would have had too little eagerness it was the last thing she would have endured or condonedthe particular thing she would not have forgiven did she sit in torment while her husband turned his somersaults or was she now too so perverse that she thought it a fine thing to be striking at the expense of ones honour it would have taken a wondrous alchemyworking backwards as it wereto produce this latter result besides these two alternatives that she suffered tortures in silence and that she was so much in love that her husbands humiliating idiosyncrasy seemed to her only an added richnessa proof of life and talent there was still the possibility that she had not found him out that she took his false pieces at his own valuation a little reflection rendered this hypothesis untenable it was too evident that the account he gave of things must repeatedly have contradicted her own knowledge within an hour or two of his meeting them lyon had seen her confronted with that perfectly gratuitous invention about the profit they had made off his early picture even then indeed she had not so far as he could see smarted andbut for the present he could only contemplate the case  even if it had not been interfused through his uneradicated tenderness for mrs capadose with an element of suspense the question would still have presented itself to him as a very curious problem for he had not painted portraits during so many years without becoming something of a psychologist his inquiry was limited for the moment to the opportunity that the following three days might yield as the colonel and his wife were going on to another house it fixed itself largely of course upon the colonel toothis gentleman was such a rare anomaly moreover it had to go on very quickly lyon was too scrupulous to ask other people what they thought of the businesshe was too afraid of exposing the woman he once had loved it was probable also that light would come to him from the talk of the rest of the company the colonels queer habit both as it affected his own situation and as it affected his wife would be a familiar theme in any house in which he was in the habit of staying lyon had not observed in the circles in which he visited any marked abstention from comment on the singularities of their members it interfered with his progress that the colonel hunted all day while he plied his brushes and chatted with sir david but a sunday intervened and that partly made it up mrs capadose fortunately did not hunt and when his work was over she was not inaccessible he took a couple of longish walks with her she was fond of that and beguiled her at tea into a friendly nook in the hall regard her as he might he could not make out to himself that she was consumed by a hidden shame the sense of being married to a man whose word had no worth was not in her spirit so far as he could guess the canker within the rose her mind appeared to have nothing on it but its own placid frankness and when he looked into her eyes deeply as he occasionally permitted himself to do they had no uncomfortable consciousness he talked to her again and still again of the dear old daysreminded her of things that he had not before this reunion the least idea that he remembered then he spoke to her of her husband praised his appearance his talent for conversation professed to have felt a quick friendship for him and asked with an inward audacity at which he trembled a little what manner of man he was what manner said mrs capadose dear me how can one describe ones husband i like him very much  ah you have told me that already lyon exclaimed with exaggerated ruefulness  then why do you ask me again she added in a moment as if she were so happy that she could afford to take pity on him he is everything thats good and kind hes a soldierand a gentlemanand a dear he hasnt a fault and he has great ability  yes he strikes one as having great ability but of course i cant think him a dear  i dont care what you think him said mrs capadose looking it seemed to him as she smiled handsomer than he had ever seen her she was either deeply cynical or still more deeply impenetrable and he had little prospect of winning from her the intimation that he longed forsome hint that it had come over her that after all she had better have married a man who was not a byword for the most contemptible the least heroic of vices had she not seenhad she not feltthe smile go round when her husband executed some especially characteristic conversational caper how could a woman of her quality endure that day after day year after year except by her qualitys altering but he would believe in the alteration only when he should have heard her lie he was fascinated by his problem and yet half exasperated and he asked himself all kinds of questions did she not lie after all when she let his falsehoods pass without a protest was not her life a perpetual complicity and did she not aid and abet him by the simple fact that she was not disgusted with him then again perhaps she was disgusted and it was the mere desperation of her pride that had given her an inscrutable mask perhaps she protested in private passionately perhaps every night in their own apartments after the days hideous performance she made him the most scorching scene but if such scenes were of no avail and he took no more trouble to cure himself how could she regard him and after so many years of marriage too with the perfectly artless complacency that lyon had surprised in her in the course of the first days dinner if our friend had not been in love with her he could have taken the diverting view of the colonels delinquencies but as it was they turned to the tragical in his mind even while he had a sense that his solicitude might also have been laughed at  the observation of these three days showed him that if capadose was an abundant he was not a malignant liar and that his fine faculty exercised itself mainly on subjects of small direct importance he is the liar platonic he said to himself he is disinterested he doesnt operate with a hope of gain or with a desire to injure it is art for art and he is prompted by the love of beauty he has an inner vision of what might have been of what ought to be and he helps on the good cause by the simple substitution of a nuance he paints as it were and so do i his manifestations had a considerable variety but a family likeness ran through them which consisted mainly of their singular futility it was this that made them offensive they encumbered the field of conversation took up valuable space converted it into a sort of brilliant sunshot fog for a fib told under pressure a convenient place can usually be found as for a person who presents himself with an authors order at the first night of a play but the supererogatory lie is the gentleman without a voucher or a ticket who accommodates himself with a stool in the passage  in one particular lyon acquitted his successful rival it had puzzled him that irrepressible as he was he had not got into a mess in the service but he perceived that he respected the servicethat august institution was sacred from his depredations moreover though there was a great deal of swagger in his talk it was oddly enough rarely swagger about his military exploits he had a passion for the chase he had followed it in far countries and some of his finest flowers were reminiscences of lonely danger and escape the more solitary the scene the bigger of course the flower a new acquaintance with the colonel always received the tribute of a bouquet that generalisation lyon very promptly made and this extraordinary man had inconsistencies and unexpected lapseslapses into flat veracity lyon recognised what sir david had told him that his aberrations came in fits or periodsthat he would sometimes keep the truce of god for a month at a time the muse breathed upon him at her pleasure she often left him alone he would neglect the finest openings and then set sail in the teeth of the breeze as a general thing he affirmed the false rather than denied the true yet this proportion was sometimes strikingly reversed very often he joined in the laugh against himselfhe admitted that he was trying it on and that a good many of his anecdotes had an experimental character still he never completely retracted nor retreatedhe dived and came up in another place lyon divined that he was capable at intervals of defending his position with violence but only when it was a very bad one then he might easily be dangerousthen he would hit out and become calumnious such occasions would test his wifes equanimitylyon would have liked to see her there in the smokingroom and elsewhere the company so far as it was composed of his familiars had an hilarious protest always at hand but among the men who had known him long his rich tone was an old story so old that they had ceased to talk about it and lyon did not care as i have said to elicit the judgment of those who might have shared his own surprise  the oddest thing of all was that neither surprise nor familiarity prevented the colonels being liked his largest drafts on a sceptical attention passed for an overflow of life and gaietyalmost of good looks he was fond of portraying his bravery and used a very big brush and yet he was unmistakably brave he was a capital rider and shot in spite of his fund of anecdote illustrating these accomplishments in short he was very nearly as clever and his career had been very nearly as wonderful as he pretended his best quality however remained that indiscriminate sociability which took interest and credulity for granted and about which he bragged least it made him cheap it made him even in a manner vulgar but it was so contagious that his listener was more or less on his side as against the probabilities it was a private reflection of oliver lyons that he not only lied but made one feel ones self a bit of a liar even or especially if one contradicted him in the evening at dinner and afterwards our friend watched his wifes face to see if some faint shade or spasm never passed over it but she showed nothing and the wonder was that when he spoke she almost always listened that was her pride she wished not to be even suspected of not facing the music lyon had none the less an importunate vision of a veiled figure coming the next day in the dusk to certain places to repair the colonels ravages as the relatives of kleptomaniacs punctually call at the shops that have suffered from their pilferings  i must apologise of course it wasnt true i hope no harm is done it is only his incorrigible oh to hear that womans voice in that deep abasement lyon had no nefarious plan no conscious wish to practise upon her shame or her loyalty but he did say to himself that he should like to bring her round to feel that there would have been more dignity in a union with a certain other person he even dreamed of the hour when with a burning face she would ask him not to take it up then he should be almost consoledhe would be magnanimous  lyon finished his picture and took his departure after having worked in a glow of interest which made him believe in his success until he found he had pleased every one especially mr and mrs ashmore when he began to be sceptical the party at any rate changed colonel and mrs capadose went their way he was able to say to himself however that his separation from the lady was not so much an end as a beginning and he called on her soon after his return to town she had told him the hours she was at homeshe seemed to like him if she liked him why had she not married him or at any rate why was she not sorry she had not if she was sorry she concealed it too well lyons curiosity on this point may strike the reader as fatuous but something must be allowed to a disappointed man he did not ask much after all not that she should love him today or that she should allow him to tell her that he loved her but only that she should give him some sign she was sorry instead of this for the present she contented herself with exhibiting her little daughter to him the child was beautiful and had the prettiest eyes of innocence he had ever seen which did not prevent him from wondering whether she told horrid fibs this idea gave him much entertainmentthe picture of the anxiety with which her mother would watch as she grew older for the symptoms of heredity that was a nice occupation for everina brant did she lie to the child herself about her fatherwas that necessary when she pressed her daughter to her bosom to cover up his tracks did he control himself before the little girlso that she might not hear him say things she knew to be other than he said lyon doubted this his genius would be too strong for him and the only safety for the child would be in her being too stupid to analyse one couldnt judge yetshe was too young if she should grow up clever she would be sure to tread in his stepsa delightful improvement in her mothers situation her little face was not shifty but neither was her fathers big one so that proved nothing  lyon reminded his friends more than once of their promise that amy should sit to him and it was only a question of his leisure the desire grew in him to paint the colonel alsoan operation from which he promised himself a rich private satisfaction he would draw him out he would set him up in that totality about which he had talked with sir david and none but the initiated would know they however would rank the picture high and it would be indeed six rows deepa masterpiece of subtle characterisation of legitimate treachery he had dreamed for years of producing something which should bear the stamp of the psychologist as well as of the painter and here at last was his subject it was a pity it was not better but that was not his fault it was his impression that already no one drew the colonel out more than he and he did it not only by instinct but on a plan there were moments when he was almost frightened at the success of his planthe poor gentleman went so terribly far he would pull up some day look at lyon between the eyesguess he was being played uponwhich would lead to his wifes guessing it also not that lyon cared much for that however so long as she failed to suppose as she must that she was a part of his joke he formed such a habit now of going to see her of a sunday afternoon that he was angry when she went out of town this occurred often as the couple were great visitors and the colonel was always looking for sport which he liked best when it could be had at other peoples expense lyon would have supposed that this sort of life was particularly little to her taste for he had an idea that it was in countryhouses that her husband came out strongest to let him go off without her not to see him expose himselfthat ought properly to have been a relief and a luxury to her she told lyon in fact that she preferred staying at home but she neglected to say it was because in other peoples houses she was on the rack the reason she gave was that she liked so to be with the child it was not perhaps criminal to draw such a bow but it was vulgar poor lyon was delighted when he arrived at that formula certainly some day too he would cross the linehe would become a noxious animal yes in the meantime he was vulgar in spite of his talents his fine person his impunity twice by exception toward the end of the winter when he left town for a few days hunting his wife remained at home lyon had not yet reached the point of asking himself whether the desire not to miss two of his visits had something to do with her immobility that inquiry would perhaps have been more in place later when he began to paint the child and she always came with her but it was not in her to give the wrong name to pretend and lyon could see that she had the maternal passion in spite of the bad blood in the little girls veins  she came inveterately though lyon multiplied the sittings amy was never entrusted to the governess or the maid he had knocked off poor old sir david in ten days but the portrait of the simplefaced child bade fair to stretch over into the following year he asked for sitting after sitting and it would have struck any one who might have witnessed the affair that he was wearing the little girl out he knew better however and mrs capadose also knew they were present together at the long intermissions he gave her when she left her pose and roamed about the great studio amusing herself with its curiosities playing with the old draperies and costumes having unlimited leave to handle then her mother and mr lyon sat and talked he laid aside his brushes and leaned back in his chair he always gave her tea what mrs capadose did not know was the way that during these weeks he neglected other orders women have no faculty of imagination with regard to a mans work beyond a vague idea that it doesnt matter in fact lyon put off everything and made several celebrities wait there were halfhours of silence when he plied his brushes during which he was mainly conscious that everina was sitting there she easily fell into that if he did not insist on talking and she was not embarrassed nor bored by it sometimes she took up a bookthere were plenty of them about sometimes a little way off in her chair she watched his progress though without in the least advising or correcting as if she cared for every stroke that represented her daughter these strokes were occasionally a little wild he was thinking so much more of his heart than of his hand he was not more embarrassed than she was but he was agitated it was as if in the sittings for the child too was beautifully quiet something was growing between them or had already growna tacit confidence an inexpressible secret he felt it that way but after all he could not be sure that she did what he wanted her to do for him was very little it was not even to confess that she was unhappy he would be superabundantly gratified if she should simply let him know even by a silent sign that she recognised that with him her life would have been finer sometimes he guessedhis presumption went so farthat he might see this sign in her contentedly sitting there     iii   at last he broached the question of painting the colonel it was now very late in the seasonthere would be little time before the general dispersal he said they must make the most of it the great thing was to begin then in the autumn with the resumption of their london life they could go forward mrs capadose objected to this that she really could not consent to accept another present of such value lyon had given her the portrait of herself of old and he had seen what they had had the indelicacy to do with it now he had offered her this beautiful memorial of the childbeautiful it would evidently be when it was finished if he could ever satisfy himself a precious possession which they would cherish for ever but his generosity must stop therethey couldnt be so tremendously beholden to him they couldnt order the pictureof course he would understand that without her explaining it was a luxury beyond their reach for they knew the great prices he received besides what had they ever donewhat above all had she ever done that he should overload them with benefits no he was too dreadfully good it was really impossible that clement should sit lyon listened to her without protest without interruption while he bent forward at his work and at last he said well if you wont take it why not let him sit for me for my own pleasure and profit let it be a favour a service i ask of him it will do me a lot of good to paint him and the picture will remain in my hands  how will it do you a lot of good mrs capadose asked  why hes such a rare modelsuch an interesting subject he has such an expressive face it will teach me no end of things  expressive of what said mrs capadose  why of his nature  and do you want to paint his nature  of course i do thats what a great portrait gives you and i shall make the colonels a great one it will put me up high so you see my request is eminently interested  how can you be higher than you are  oh im insatiable do consent said lyon  well his nature is very noble mrs capadose remarked  ah trust me i shall bring it out lyon exclaimed feeling a little ashamed of himself  mrs capadose said before she went away that her husband would probably comply with his invitation but she added nothing would induce me to let you pry into me that way  oh you lyon laughedi could do you in the dark  the colonel shortly afterwards placed his leisure at the painters disposal and by the end of july had paid him several visits lyon was disappointed neither in the quality of his sitter nor in the degree to which he himself rose to the occasion he felt really confident that he should produce a fine thing he was in the humour he was charmed with his motif and deeply interested in his problem the only point that troubled him was the idea that when he should send his picture to the academy he should not be able to give the title for the catalogue simply as the liar however it little mattered for he had now determined that this character should be perceptible even to the meanest intelligenceas overtopping as it had become to his own sense in the living man as he saw nothing else in the colonel today so he gave himself up to the joy of painting nothing else how he did it he could not have told you but it seemed to him that the mystery of how to do it was revealed to him afresh every time he sat down to his work it was in the eyes and it was in the mouth it was in every line of the face and every fact of the attitude in the indentation of the chin in the way the hair was planted the moustache was twisted the smile came and went the breath rose and fell it was in the way he looked out at a bamboozled world in shortthe way he would look out for ever there were half a dozen portraits in europe that lyon rated as supreme he regarded them as immortal for they were as perfectly preserved as they were consummately painted it was to this small exemplary group that he aspired to annex the canvas on which he was now engaged one of the productions that helped to compose it was the magnificent moroni of the national gallerythe young tailor in the white jacket at his board with his shears the colonel was not a tailor nor was moronis model unlike many tailors a liar but as regards the masterly clearness with which the individual should be rendered his work would be on the same line as that he had to a degree in which he had rarely had it before the satisfaction of feeling life grow and grow under his brush the colonel as it turned out liked to sit and he liked to talk while he was sitting which was very fortunate as his talk largely constituted lyons inspiration lyon put into practice that idea of drawing him out which he had been nursing for so many weeks he could not possibly have been in a better relation to him for the purpose he encouraged beguiled excited him manifested an unfathomable credulity and his only interruptions were when the colonel did not respond to it he had his intermissions his hours of sterility and then lyon felt that the picture also languished the higher his companion soared the more gyrations he executed in the blue the better he painted he couldnt make his flights long enough he lashed him on when he flagged his apprehension became great at moments that the colonel would discover his game but he never did apparently he basked and expanded in the fine steady light of the painters attention in this way the picture grew very fast it was astonishing what a short business it was compared with the little girls by the fifth of august it was pretty well finished that was the date of the last sitting the colonel was for the present able to give as he was leaving town the next day with his wife lyon was amply contenthe saw his way so clear he should be able to do at his convenience what remained with or without his friends attendance at any rate as there was no hurry he would let the thing stand over till his own return to london in november when he would come back to it with a fresh eye on the colonels asking him if his wife might come and see it the next day if she should find a minutethis was so greatly her desirelyon begged as a special favour that she would wait he was so far from satisfied as yet this was the repetition of a proposal mrs capadose had made on the occasion of his last visit to her and he had then asked for a delaydeclared that he was by no means content he was really delighted and he was again a little ashamed of himself  by the fifth of august the weather was very warm and on that day while the colonel sat straight and gossiped lyon opened for the sake of ventilation a little subsidiary door which led directly from his studio into the garden and sometimes served as an entrance and an exit for models and for visitors of the humbler sort and as a passage for canvases frames packingboxes and other professional gear the main entrance was through the house and his own apartments and this approach had the charming effect of admitting you first to a high gallery from which a crooked picturesque staircase enabled you to descend to the wide decorated encumbered room the view of this room beneath them with all its artistic ingenuities and the objects of value that lyon had collected never failed to elicit exclamations of delight from persons stepping into the gallery the way from the garden was plainer and at once more practicable and more private lyons domain in st johns wood was not vast but when the door stood open of a summers day it offered a glimpse of flowers and trees you smelt something sweet and you heard the birds on this particular morning the sidedoor had been found convenient by an unannounced visitor a youngish woman who stood in the room before the colonel perceived her and whom he perceived before she was noticed by his friend she was very quiet and she looked from one of the men to the other oh dear heres another lyon exclaimed as soon as his eyes rested on her she belonged in fact to a somewhat importunate classthe model in search of employment and she explained that she had ventured to come straight in that way because very often when she went to call upon gentlemen the servants played her tricks turned her off and wouldnt take in her name  but how did you get into the garden lyon asked  the gate was open sirthe servants gate the butchers cart was there  the butcher ought to have closed it said lyon  then you dont require me sir the lady continued  lyon went on with his painting he had given her a sharp look at first but now his eyes lighted on her no more the colonel however examined her with interest she was a person of whom you could scarcely say whether being young she looked old or old she looked young she had at any rate evidently rounded several of the corners of life and had a face that was rosy but that somehow failed to suggest freshness nevertheless she was pretty and even looked as if at one time she might have sat for the complexion she wore a hat with many feathers a dress with many bugles long black gloves encircled with silver bracelets and very bad shoes there was something about her that was not exactly of the governess out of place nor completely of the actress seeking an engagement but that savoured of an interrupted profession or even of a blighted career she was rather soiled and tarnished and after she had been in the room a few moments the air or at any rate the nostril became acquainted with a certain alcoholic waft she was unpractised in the h and when lyon at last thanked her and said he didnt want herhe was doing nothing for which she could be usefulshe replied with rather a wounded manner well you know you ave ad me  i dont remember you lyon answered  well i daresay the people that saw your pictures do i havent much time but i thought i would look in  i am much obliged to you  if ever you should require me if you just send me a postcard  i never send postcards said lyon  oh well i should value a private letter anything to miss geraldine mortimer terrace mews notting ill  very good ill remember said lyon  miss geraldine lingered i thought id just stop on the chance  im afraid i cant hold out hopes im so busy with portraits lyon continued  yes i see you are i wish i was in the gentlemans place  im afraid in that case it wouldnt look like me said the colonel laughing  oh of course it couldnt compareit wouldnt be so andsome but i do hate them portraits miss geraldine declared its so much bread out of our mouths  well there are many who cant paint them lyon suggested comfortingly  oh ive sat to the very firstand only to the first theres many that couldnt do anything without me  im glad youre in such demand lyon was beginning to be bored and he added that he wouldnt detain herhe would send for her in case of need  very well remember its the mewsmores the pity you dont sit so well as us miss geraldine pursued looking at the colonel if you should require me sir  you put him out you embarrass him said lyon  embarrass him oh gracious the visitor cried with a laugh which diffused a fragrance perhaps you send postcards eh she went on to the colonel and then she retreated with a wavering step she passed out into the garden as she had come  how very dreadfulshes drunk said lyon he was painting hard but he looked up checking himself miss geraldine in the open doorway had thrust back her head  yes i do hate itthat sort of thing she cried with an explosion of mirth which confirmed lyons declaration and then she disappeared  what sort of thingwhat does she mean the colonel asked  oh my painting you when i might be painting her  and have you ever painted her  never in the world i have never seen her she is quite mistaken  the colonel was silent a moment then he remarked she was very prettyten years ago  i daresay but shes quite ruined for me the least drop too much spoils them i shouldnt care for her at all  my dear fellow shes not a model said the colonel laughing  today no doubt shes not worthy of the name but she has been one  jamais de la vie thats all a pretext  a pretext lyon pricked up his earshe began to wonder what was coming now  she didnt want youshe wanted me  i noticed she paid you some attention what does she want of you  oh to do me an ill turn she hates melots of women do shes watching meshe follows me  lyon leaned back in his chairhe didnt believe a word of this he was all the more delighted with it and with the colonels bright candid manner the story had bloomed fragrant on the spot my dear colonel he murmured with friendly interest and commiseration  i was annoyed when she came inbut i wasnt startled his sitter continued  you concealed it very well if you were  ah when one has been through what i have today however i confess i was half prepared i have seen her hanging aboutshe knows my movements she was near my house this morningshe must have followed me  but who is she thenwith such a toupet  yes she has that said the colonel but as you observe she was primed still there was a cheek as they say in her coming in oh shes a bad one she isnt a model and she never was no doubt she has known some of those women and picked up their form she had hold of a friend of mine ten years agoa stupid young gander who might have been left to be plucked but whom i was obliged to take an interest in for family reasons its a long storyi had really forgotten all about it shes thirtyseven if shes a day i cut in and made him get rid of heri sent her about her business she knew it was me she had to thank she has never forgiven mei think shes off her head her name isnt geraldine at all and i doubt very much if thats her address  ah what is her name lyon asked most attentive the details always began to multiply to abound when once his companion was well launchedthey flowed forth in battalions  its pearsonharriet pearson but she used to call herself grenadinewasnt that a rum appellation grenadinegeraldinethe jump was easy lyon was charmed with the promptitude of this response and his interlocutor went on i hadnt thought of her for yearsi had quite lost sight of her i dont know what her idea is but practically shes harmless as i came in i thought i saw her a little way up the road she must have found out i come here and have arrived before me i daresayor rather im sureshe is waiting for me there now  hadnt you better have protection lyon asked laughing  the best protection is five shillingsim willing to go that length unless indeed she has a bottle of vitriol but they only throw vitriol on the men who have deceived them and i never deceived heri told her the first time i saw her that it wouldnt do oh if shes there well walk a little way together and talk it over and as i say ill go as far as five shillings  well said lyon ill contribute another five he felt that this was little to pay for his entertainment  that entertainment was interrupted however for the time by the colonels departure lyon hoped for a letter recounting the fictive sequel but apparently his brilliant sitter did not operate with the pen at any rate he left town without writing they had taken a rendezvous for three months later oliver lyon always passed the holidays in the same way during the first weeks he paid a visit to his elder brother the happy possessor in the south of england of a rambling old house with formal gardens in which he delighted and then he went abroadusually to italy or spain this year he carried out his custom after taking a last look at his all but finished work and feeling as nearly pleased with it as he ever felt with the translation of the idea by the handalways as it seemed to him a pitiful compromise one yellow afternoon in the country as he was smoking his pipe on one of the old terraces he was seized with the desire to see it again and do two or three things more to it he had thought of it so often while he lounged there the impulse was too strong to be dismissed and though he expected to return to town in the course of another week he was unable to face the delay to look at the picture for five minutes would be enoughit would clear up certain questions which hummed in his brain so that the next morning to give himself this luxury he took the train for london he sent no word in advance he would lunch at his club and probably return into sussex by the 545  in st johns wood the tide of human life flows at no time very fast and in the first days of september lyon found unmitigated emptiness in the straight sunny roads where the little plastered gardenwalls with their incommunicative doors looked slightly oriental there was definite stillness in his own house to which he admitted himself by his passkey having a theory that it was well sometimes to take servants unprepared the good woman who was mainly in charge and who cumulated the functions of cook and housekeeper was however quickly summoned by his step and he cultivated frankness of intercourse with his domestics received him without the confusion of surprise he told her that she neednt mind the place being not quite straight he had only come up for a few hourshe should be busy in the studio to this she replied that he was just in time to see a lady and a gentleman who were there at the momentthey had arrived five minutes before she had told them he was away from home but they said it was all right they only wanted to look at a picture and would be very careful of everything i hope it is all right sir the housekeeper concluded the gentleman says hes a sitter and he gave me his namerather an odd name i think its military the ladys a very fine lady sir at any rate there they are  oh its all right lyon said the identity of his visitors being clear the good woman couldnt know for she usually had little to do with the comings and goings his man who showed people in and out had accompanied him to the country he was a good deal surprised at mrs capadoses having come to see her husbands portrait when she knew that the artist himself wished her to forbear but it was a familiar truth to him that she was a woman of a high spirit besides perhaps the lady was not mrs capadose the colonel might have brought some inquisitive friend a person who wanted a portrait of her husband what were they doing in town at any rate at that moment lyon made his way to the studio with a certain curiosity he wondered vaguely what his friends were up to he pushed aside the curtain that hung in the door of communicationthe door opening upon the gallery which it had been found convenient to construct at the time the studio was added to the house when i say he pushed it aside i should amend my phrase he laid his hand upon it but at that moment he was arrested by a very singular sound it came from the floor of the room beneath him and it startled him extremely consisting apparently as it did of a passionate waila sort of smothered shriekaccompanied by a violent burst of tears oliver lyon listened intently a moment and then he passed out upon the balcony which was covered with an old thick moorish rug his step was noiseless though he had not endeavoured to make it so and after that first instant he found himself profiting irresistibly by the accident of his not having attracted the attention of the two persons in the studio who were some twenty feet below him in truth they were so deeply and so strangely engaged that their unconsciousness of observation was explained the scene that took place before lyons eyes was one of the most extraordinary they had ever rested upon delicacy and the failure to comprehend kept him at first from interrupting itfor what he saw was a woman who had thrown herself in a flood of tears on her companions bosomand these influences were succeeded after a minute the minutes were very few and very short by a definite motive which presently had the force to make him step back behind the curtain i may add that it also had the force to make him avail himself for further contemplation of a crevice formed by his gathering together the two halves of the portière he was perfectly aware of what he was abouthe was for the moment an eavesdropper a spy but he was also aware that a very odd business in which his confidence had been trifled with was going forward and that if in a measure it didnt concern him in a measure it very definitely did his observation his reflections accomplished themselves in a flash  his visitors were in the middle of the room mrs capadose clung to her husband weeping sobbing as if her heart would break her distress was horrible to oliver lyon but his astonishment was greater than his horror when he heard the colonel respond to it by the words vehemently uttered damn him damn him damn him what in the world had happened why was she sobbing and whom was he damning what had happened lyon saw the next instant was that the colonel had finally rummaged out his unfinished portrait he knew the corner where the artist usually placed it out of the way with its face to the wall and had set it up before his wife on an empty easel she had looked at it a few moments and thenapparentlywhat she saw in it had produced an explosion of dismay and resentment she was too busy sobbing and the colonel was too busy holding her and reiterating his objurgation to look round or look up the scene was so unexpected to lyon that he could not take it on the spot as a proof of the triumph of his handof a tremendous hit he could only wonder what on earth was the matter the idea of the triumph came a little later yet he could see the portrait from where he stood he was startled with its look of lifehe had not thought it so masterly mrs capadose flung herself away from her husbandshe dropped into the nearest chair buried her face in her arms leaning on a table her weeping suddenly ceased to be audible but she shuddered there as if she were overwhelmed with anguish and shame her husband remained a moment staring at the picture then he went to her bent over her took hold of her again soothed her what is it darling what the devil is it he demanded  lyon heard her answer its crueloh its too cruel  damn himdamn himdamn him the colonel repeated  its all thereits all there mrs capadose went on  hang it whats all there  everything there oughtnt to beeverything he has seenits too dreadful  everything he has seen why aint i a goodlooking fellow he has made me rather handsome  mrs capadose had sprung up again she had darted another glance at the painted betrayal handsome hideous hideous not thatnever never  not what in heavens name the colonel almost shouted lyon could see his flushed bewildered face  what he has made of youwhat you know he knowshe has seen every one will knowevery one will see fancy that thing in the academy  youre going wild darling but if you hate it so it neednt go  oh hell send itits so good come awaycome away mrs capadose wailed seizing her husband  its so good the poor man cried  come awaycome away she only repeated and she turned toward the staircase that ascended to the gallery  not that waynot through the house in the state youre in lyon heard the colonel object this waywe can pass he added and he drew his wife to the small door that opened into the garden it was bolted but he pushed the bolt and opened the door she passed out quickly but he stood there looking back into the room wait for me a moment he cried out to her and with an excited stride he reentered the studio he came up to the picture again and again he stood looking at it damn himdamn himdamn him he broke out once more it was not clear to lyon whether this malediction had for its object the original or the painter of the portrait the colonel turned away and moved rapidly about the room as if he were looking for something lyon was unable for the instant to guess his intention then the artist said to himself below his breath hes going to do it a harm his first impulse was to rush down and stop him but he paused with the sound of everina brants sobs still in his ears the colonel found what he was looking forfound it among some odds and ends on a small table and rushed back with it to the easel at one and the same moment lyon perceived that the object he had seized was a small eastern dagger and that he had plunged it into the canvas he seemed animated by a sudden fury for with extreme vigour of hand he dragged the instrument down lyon knew it to have no very fine edge making a long abominable gash then he plucked it out and dashed it again several times into the face of the likeness exactly as if he were stabbing a human victim it had the oddest effectthat of a sort of figurative suicide in a few seconds more the colonel had tossed the dagger awayhe looked at it as he did so as if he expected it to reek with bloodand hurried out of the place closing the door after him  the strangest part of all wasas will doubtless appearthat oliver lyon made no movement to save his picture but he did not feel as if he were losing it or cared not if he were so much more did he feel that he was gaining a certitude his old friend was ashamed of her husband and he had made her so and he had scored a great success even though the picture had been reduced to rags the revelation excited him soas indeed the whole scene didthat when he came down the steps after the colonel had gone he trembled with his happy agitation he was dizzy and had to sit down a moment the portrait had a dozen jagged woundsthe colonel literally had hacked it to death lyon left it where it was never touched it scarcely looked at it he only walked up and down his studio still excited for an hour at the end of this time his good woman came to recommend that he should have some luncheon there was a passage under the staircase from the offices  ah the lady and gentleman have gone sir i didnt hear them  yes they went by the garden  but she had stopped staring at the picture on the easel gracious how you ave served it sir  lyon imitated the colonel yes i cut it upin a fit of disgust  mercy after all your trouble because they werent pleased sir  yes they werent pleased  well they must be very grand blessed if i would  have it chopped up it will do to light fires lyon said  he returned to the country by the 330 and a few days later passed over to france during the two months that he was absent from england he expected somethinghe could hardly have said what a manifestation of some sort on the colonels part wouldnt he write wouldnt he explain wouldnt he take for granted lyon had discovered the way he had as the cook said served him and deem it only decent to take pity in some fashion or other on his mystification would he plead guilty or would he repudiate suspicion the latter course would be difficult and make a considerable draft upon his genius in view of the certain testimony of lyons housekeeper who had admitted the visitors and would establish the connection between their presence and the violence wrought would the colonel proffer some apology or some amends or would any word from him be only a further expression of that destructive petulance which our friend had seen his wife so suddenly and so potently communicate to him he would have either to declare that he had not touched the picture or to admit that he had and in either case he would have to tell a fine story lyon was impatient for the story and as no letter came disappointed that it was not produced his impatience however was much greater in respect to mrs capadoses version if version there was to be for certainly that would be the real test would show how far she would go for her husband on the one side or for him oliver lyon on the other he could scarcely wait to see what line she would take whether she would simply adopt the colonels whatever it might be he wanted to draw her out without waiting to get an idea in advance he wrote to her to this end from venice in the tone of their established friendship asking for news narrating his wanderings hoping they should soon meet in town and not saying a word about the picture day followed day after the time and he received no answer upon which he reflected that she couldnt trust herself to writewas still too much under the influence of the emotion produced by his betrayal her husband had espoused that emotion and she had espoused the action he had taken in consequence of it and it was a complete rupture and everything was at an end lyon considered this prospect rather ruefully at the same time that he thought it deplorable that such charming people should have put themselves so grossly in the wrong he was at last cheered though little further enlightened by the arrival of a letter brief but breathing goodhumour and hinting neither at a grievance nor at a bad conscience the most interesting part of it to lyon was the postscript which consisted of these words i have a confession to make to you we were in town for a couple of days the 1st of september and i took the occasion to defy your authorityit was very bad of me but i couldnt help it i made clement take me to your studioi wanted so dreadfully to see what you had done with him your wishes to the contrary notwithstanding we made your servants let us in and i took a good look at the picture it is really wonderful wonderful was noncommittal but at least with this letter there was no rupture  the third day after lyons return to london was a sunday so that he could go and ask mrs capadose for luncheon she had given him in the spring a general invitation to do so and he had availed himself of it several times these had been the occasions before he sat to him when he saw the colonel most familiarly directly after the meal his host disappeared he went out as he said to call on his women and the second halfhour was the best even when there were other people now in the first days of december lyon had the luck to find the pair alone without even amy who appeared but little in public they were in the drawingroom waiting for the repast to be announced and as soon as he came in the colonel broke out my dear fellow im delighted to see you im so keen to begin again  oh do go on its so beautiful mrs capadose said as she gave him her hand  lyon looked from one to the other he didnt know what he had expected but he had not expected this ah then you think ive got something  youve got everything said mrs capadose smiling from her goldenbrown eyes  she wrote you of our little crime her husband asked she dragged me therei had to go lyon wondered for a moment whether he meant by their little crime the assault on the canvas but the colonels next words didnt confirm this interpretation you know i like to sitit gives such a chance to my bavardise and just now i have time  you must remember i had almost finished lyon remarked  so you had mores the pity i should like you to begin again  my dear fellow i shall have to begin again said oliver lyon with a laugh looking at mrs capadose she did not meet his eyesshe had got up to ring for luncheon the picture has been smashed lyon continued  smashed ah what did you do that for mrs capadose asked standing there before him in all her clear rich beauty now that she looked at him she was impenetrable  i didnti found it sowith a dozen holes punched in it  i say cried the colonel  lyon turned his eyes to him smiling i hope you didnt do it  is it ruined the colonel inquired he was as brightly true as his wife and he looked simply as if lyons question could not be serious for the love of sitting to you my dear fellow if i had thought of it i would  nor you either the painter demanded of mrs capadose  before she had time to reply her husband had seized her arm as if a highly suggestive idea had come to him i say my dear that womanthat woman  that woman mrs capadose repeated and lyon too wondered what woman he meant  dont you remember when we came out she was at the dooror a little way from it i spoke to you of heri told you about her geraldinegrenadinethe one who burst in that day he explained to lyon we saw her hanging abouti called everinas attention to her  do you mean she got at my picture  ah yes i remember said mrs capadose with a sigh  she burst in againshe had learned the wayshe was waiting for her chance the colonel continued ah the little brute  lyon looked down he felt himself colouring this was what he had been waiting forthe day the colonel should wantonly sacrifice some innocent person and could his wife be a party to that final atrocity lyon had reminded himself repeatedly during the previous weeks that when the colonel perpetrated his misdeed she had already quitted the room but he had argued none the lessit was a virtual certaintythat he had on rejoining her immediately made his achievement plain to her he was in the flush of performance and even if he had not mentioned what he had done she would have guessed it he did not for an instant believe that poor miss geraldine had been hovering about his door nor had the account given by the colonel the summer before of his relations with this lady deceived him in the slightest degree lyon had never seen her before the day she planted herself in his studio but he knew her and classified her as if he had made her he was acquainted with the london female model in all her varietiesin every phase of her development and every step of her decay when he entered his house that september morning just after the arrival of his two friends there had been no symptoms whatever up and down the road of miss geraldines reappearance that fact had been fixed in his mind by his recollecting the vacancy of the prospect when his cook told him that a lady and a gentleman were in his studio he had wondered there was not a carriage nor a cab at his door then he had reflected that they would have come by the underground railway he was close to the marlborough road station and he knew the colonel coming to his sittings more than once had availed himself of that convenience how in the world did she get in he addressed the question to his companions indifferently  let us go down to luncheon said mrs capadose passing out of the room  we went by the gardenwithout troubling your servanti wanted to show my wife lyon followed his hostess with her husband and the colonel stopped him at the top of the stairs my dear fellow i cant have been guilty of the folly of not fastening the door  i am sure i dont know colonel lyon said as they went down it was a very determined handa perfect wildcat  well she is a wildcatconfound her thats why i wanted to get him away from her  but i dont understand her motive  shes off her headand she hates me that was her motive  but she doesnt hate me my dear fellow lyon said laughing  she hated the picturedont you remember she said so the more portraits there are the less employment for such as her  yes but if she is not really the model she pretends to be how can that hurt her lyon asked  the inquiry baffled the colonel an instantbut only an instant ah she was in a vicious muddle as i say shes off her head  they went into the diningroom where mrs capadose was taking her place its too bad its too horrid she said you see the fates are against you providence wont let you be so disinterestedpainting masterpieces for nothing  did you see the woman lyon demanded with something like a sternness that he could not mitigate  mrs capadose appeared not to perceive it or not to heed it if she did there was a person not far from your door whom clement called my attention to he told me something about her but we were going the other way  and do you think she did it  how can i tell if she did she was mad poor wretch  i should like very much to get hold of her said lyon this was a false statement for he had no desire for any further conversation with miss geraldine he had exposed his friends to himself but he had no desire to expose them to any one else least of all to themselves  oh depend upon it she will never show again youre safe the colonel exclaimed  but i remember her addressmortimer terrace mews notting hill  oh thats pure humbug there isnt any such place  lord what a deceiver said lyon  is there any one else you suspect the colonel went on  not a creature  and what do your servants say  they say it wasnt them and i reply that i never said it was thats about the substance of our conferences  and when did they discover the havoc  they never discovered it at all i noticed it firstwhen i came back  well she could easily have stepped in said the colonel dont you remember how she turned up that day like the clown in the ring  yes yes she could have done the job in three seconds except that the picture wasnt out  my dear fellow dont curse mebut of course i dragged it out  you didnt put it back lyon asked tragically  ah clement clement didnt i tell you to mrs capadose exclaimed in a tone of exquisite reproach  the colonel groaned dramatically he covered his face with his hands his wifes words were for lyon the finishing touch they made his whole vision crumblehis theory that she had secretly kept herself true even to her old lover she wouldnt be so he was sick he couldnt eat he knew that he looked very strange he murmured something about it being useless to cry over spilled milkhe tried to turn the conversation to other things but it was a horrid effort and he wondered whether they felt it as much as he he wondered all sorts of things whether they guessed he disbelieved them that he had seen them of course they would never guess whether they had arranged their story in advance or it was only an inspiration of the moment whether she had resisted protested when the colonel proposed it to her and then had been borne down by him whether in short she didnt loathe herself as she sat there the cruelty the cowardice of fastening their unholy act upon the wretched woman struck him as monstrousno less monstrous indeed than the levity that could make them run the risk of her giving them in her righteous indignation the lie of course that risk could only exculpate her and not inculpate themthe probabilities protected them so perfectly and what the colonel counted on what he would have counted upon the day he delivered himself after first seeing her at the studio if he had thought about the matter then at all and not spoken from the pure spontaneity of his genius was simply that miss geraldine had really vanished for ever into her native unknown lyon wanted so much to quit the subject that when after a little mrs capadose said to him but can nothing be done cant the picture be repaired you know they do such wonders in that way now he only replied i dont know i dont care its all over nen parlons plus her hypocrisy revolted him and yet by way of plucking off the last veil of her shame he broke out to her again shortly afterward and you did like it really to which she returned looking him straight in his face without a blush a pallor an evasion oh i loved it truly her husband had trained her well after that lyon said no more and his companions forbore temporarily to insist like people of tact and sympathy aware that the odious accident had made him sore  when they quitted the table the colonel went away without coming upstairs but lyon returned to the drawingroom with his hostess remarking to her however on the way that he could remain but a moment he spent that momentit prolonged itself a littlestanding with her before the chimneypiece she neither sat down nor asked him to her manner denoted that she intended to go out yes her husband had trained her well yet lyon dreamed for a moment that now he was alone with her she would perhaps break down retract apologise confide say to him my dear old friend forgive this hideous comedyyou understand and then how he would have loved her and pitied her guarded her helped her always if she were not ready to do something of that sort why had she treated him as if he were a dear old friend why had she let him for months suppose certain thingsor almost why had she come to his studio day after day to sit near him on the pretext of her childs portrait as if she liked to think what might have been why had she come so near a tacit confession in a word if she was not willing to go an inch further and she was not willingshe was not he could see that as he lingered there she moved about the room a little rearranging two or three objects on the tables but she did nothing more suddenly he said to her which way was she going when you came out  shethe woman we saw  yes your husbands strange friend its a clew worth following he had no desire to frighten her he only wanted to communicate the impulse which would make her say ah spare meand spare him there was no such person  instead of this mrs capadose replied she was going away from usshe crossed the road we were coming towards the station  and did she appear to recognise the coloneldid she look round  yes she looked round but i didnt notice much a hansom came along and we got into it it was not till then that clement told me who she was i remember he said that she was there for no good i suppose we ought to have gone back  yes you would have saved the picture  for a moment she said nothing then she smiled for you i am very sorry but you must remember that i possess the original  at this lyon turned away well i must go he said and he left her without any other farewell and made his way out of the house as he went slowly up the street the sense came back to him of that first glimpse of her he had had at stayesthe way he had seen her gaze across the table at her husband lyon stopped at the corner looking vaguely up and down he would never go backhe couldnt she was still in love with the colonelhe had trained her too well     mrs temperly     i   why cousin raymond how can you suppose why shes only sixteen  she told me she was seventeen said the young man as if it made a great difference  well only just mrs temperly replied in the tone of graceful reasonable concession  well thats a very good age for me im very young  you are old enough to know better the lady remarked in her soft pleasant voice which always drew the sting from a reproach and enabled you to swallow it as you would a cooked plum without the stone why she hasnt finished her education  thats just what i mean said her interlocutor it would finish it beautifully for her to marry me  have you finished yours my dear mrs temperly inquired the way you young people talk about marrying she exclaimed looking at the itinerant functionary with the long wand who touched into a flame the tall gaslamp on the other side of the fifth avenue the pair were standing in the recess of a window in one of the big public rooms of an immense hotel and the october day was turning to dusk  well would you have us leave it to the old raymond asked thats just what i thinkshe would be such a help to me he continued i want to go back to paris to study more i have come home too soon i dont know half enough they know more here than i thought so it would be perfectly easy and we should all be together  well my dear when you do come back to paris we will talk about it said mrs temperly turning away from the window  i should like it better cousin maria if you trusted me a little more raymond sighed observing that she was not really giving her thoughts to what he said she irritated him somehow she was so full of her impending departure of her arrangements her last duties and memoranda she was not exactly important any more than she was humble she was too conciliatory for the one and too positive for the other but she bustled quietly and gave one the sense of being up to everything the successive steps of her enterprise were in advance perfectly clear to her and he could see that her imagination conventional as she was she had plenty of that faculty had already taken up its abode on one of those fine premiers which she had never seen but which by instinct she seemed to know all about in the very best part of the quarter of the champs elysées if she ruffled him envy had perhaps something to do with it she was to set sail on the morrow for the city of his affection and he was to stop in new york where the fact that he was but half pleased did not alter the fact that he had his studio on his hands and that it was a bad one though perhaps as good as any use he should put it to which no one would be in a hurry to relieve him of  it was easy for him to talk to mrs temperly in that airy way about going back but he couldnt go back unless the old gentleman gave him the means he had already given him a great many things in the past and with the others coming on marians marriageoutfit within three months had cost literally thousands raymond had not at present the face to ask for more he must sell some pictures first and to sell them he must first paint them it was his misfortune that he saw what he wanted to do so much better than he could do it but he must really try and please himselfan effort that appeared more possible now that the idea of following dora across the ocean had become an incentive in spite of secret aspirations and even intentions however it was not encouraging to feel that he made really no impression at all on cousin maria this certitude was so far from agreeable to him that he almost found it in him to drop the endearing title by which he had hitherto addressed her it was only that after all her husband had been distantly related to his mother it was not as a cousin that he was interested in dora but as something very much more intimate i know not whether it occurred to him that mrs temperly herself would never give his displeasure the benefit of dropping the affectionate form she might shut her door to him altogether but he would always be her kinsman and her dear she was much addicted to these little embellishments of human intercoursethe friendly apostrophe and even the caressing handand there was something homely and cosy a rustic motherly bonhomie in her use of them she was as lavish of them as she was really careful in the selection of her friends  she stood there with her hand in her pocket as if she were feeling for something her little plain pleasant face was presented to him with a musing smile and he vaguely wondered whether she were fumbling for a piece of money to buy him off from wishing to marry her daughter such an idea would be quite in keeping with the disguised levity with which she treated his state of mind if her levity was wrapped up in the air of tender solicitude for everything that related to the feelings of her child that only made her failure to appreciate his suit more deliberate she struck him almost as impertinent at the same time that he knew this was never her intention as she looked up at himher tiny proportions always made her throw back her head and set something dancing in her capand inquired whether he had noticed if she gave two keys tied together by a blue ribbon to susan winkle when that faithful but flurried domestic met them in the lobby she was thinking only of questions of luggage and the fact that he wished to marry dora was the smallest incident in their getting off  i think you ask me that only to change the subject he said i dont believe that ever in your life you have been unconscious of what you have done with your keys  not often but you make me nervous she answered with her patient honest smile  oh cousin maria the young man exclaimed ambiguously while mrs temperly looked humanely at some totally uninteresting people who came straggling into the great hot frescoed velvety drawingroom where it was as easy to see you were in an hotel as it was to see that if you were you were in one of the very best mrs temperly since her husbands death had passed much of her life at hotels where she flattered herself that she preserved the tone of domestic life free from every taint and promoted the refined development of her children but she selected them as well as she selected her friends somehow they became better from the very fact of her being there and her children were smuggled in and out in the most extraordinary way one never met them racing and whooping as one did hundreds of others in the lobbies her frequentation of hotels where she paid enormous bills was part of her expensive but practical way of living and also of her theory that from one week to another she was going to europe for a series of years as soon as she had wound up certain complicated affairs which had devolved upon her at her husbands death if these affairs had dragged on it was owing to their inherent troublesomeness and implied no doubt of her capacity to bring them to a solution and to administer the very considerable fortune that mr temperly had left she used in a superior unprejudiced way every convenience that the civilisation of her time offered her and would have lived without hesitation in a lighthouse if this had contributed to her general scheme she was now in the interest of this scheme preparing to use europe which she had not yet visited and with none of whose foreign tongues she was acquainted this time she was certainly embarking  she took no notice of the discredit which her young friend appeared to throw on the idea that she had nerves and betrayed no suspicion that he believed her to have them in about the same degree as a sound productive alderney cow she only moved toward one of the numerous doors of the room as if to remind him of all she had still to do before night they passed together into the long wide corridor of the hotela vista of soft carpet numbered doors wandering women and perpetual gaslightand approached the staircase by which she must ascend again to her domestic duties she counted over serenely for his enlightenment those that were still to be performed but he could see that everything would be finished by nine oclockthe time she had fixed in advance the heavy luggage was then to go to the steamer she herself was to be on board with the children and the smaller things at eleven oclock the next morning they had thirty pieces but this was less than they had when they came from california five years before she wouldnt have done that again it was true that at that time she had had mr temperly to help he had died raymond remembered six months after the settlement in new york but on the other hand she knew more now it was one of mrs temperlys amiable qualities that she admitted herself so candidly to be still susceptible of development she never professed to be in possession of all the knowledge requisite for her career not only did she let her friends know that she was always learning but she appealed to them to instruct her in a manner which was in itself an example  when raymond said to her that he took for granted she would let him come down to the steamer for a last goodbye she not only consented graciously but added that he was free to call again at the hotel in the evening if he had nothing better to do he must come between nine and ten she expected several other friendsthose who wished to see the last of them yet didnt care to come to the ship then he would see all of themshe meant all of themselves dora and effie and tishy and even mademoiselle bourde she spoke exactly as if he had never approached her on the subject of dora and as if tishy who was ten years of age and mademoiselle bourde who was the french governess and forty were objects of no less an interest to him he felt what a long pull he should have ever to get round her and the sting of this knowledge was in his consciousness that dora was really in her mothers hands in mrs temperlys composition there was not a hint of the bully but none the less she held her childrenshe would hold them for ever it was not simply by tenderness but what it was by she knew best herself raymond appreciated the privilege of seeing dora again that evening as well as on the morrow yet he was so vexed with her mother that his vexation betrayed him into something that almost savoured of violencea fact which i am ashamed to have to chronicle as mrs temperlys own urbanity deprived such breaches of every excuse it may perhaps serve partly as an excuse for raymond bestwick that he was in love or at least that he thought he was before she parted from him at the foot of the staircase he said to her and of course if things go as you like over there dora will marry some foreign prince  she gave no sign of resenting this speech but she looked at him for the first time as if she were hesitating as if it were not instantly clear to her what to say it appeared to him on his side for a moment that there was something strange in her hesitation that abruptly by an inspiration she was almost making up her mind to reply that doras marriage to a prince was considering doras peculiarities he knew that her mother deemed her peculiar and so did he but that was precisely why he wished to marry her so little probable that after all once such a union was out of the question he might be no worse than another plain man these however were not the words that fell from mrs temperlys lips her embarrassment vanished in her clear smile do you know what mr temperly used to say he used to say that dora was the pattern of an old maidshe would never make a choice  i hopebecause that would have been too foolishthat he didnt say she wouldnt have a chance  oh a chance what do you call by that fine name cousin maria exclaimed laughing as she ascended the stair     ii   when he came back after dinner she was again in one of the public rooms she explained that a lot of the things for the ship were spread out in her own parlours there was no space to sit down raymond was highly gratified by this fact it offered an opportunity for strolling away a little with dora especially as after he had been there ten minutes other people began to come in they were entertained by the rest by effie and tishy who was allowed to sit up a little and by mademoiselle bourde who besought every visitor to indicate her a remedy that was really effective against the seasome charm some philter some potion or spell never mind mamselle ive got a remedy said cousin maria with her cheerful decision each time but the french instructress always began afresh  as the young man was about to be parted for an indefinite period from the girl whom he was ready to swear that he adored it is clear that he ought to have been equally ready to swear that she was the fairest of her species in point of fact however it was no less vivid to him than it had been before that he loved dora temperly for qualities which had nothing to do with straightness of nose or pinkness of complexion her figure was straight and so was her character but her nose was not and philistines and other vulgar people would have committed themselves without a blush on their own flat faces to the assertion that she was decidedly plain in his artistic imagination he had analogies for her drawn from legend and literature he was perfectly aware that she struck many persons as silent shy and angular while his own version of her peculiarities was that she was like a figure on the predella of an early italian painting or a mediæval maiden wandering about a lonely castle with her lover gone to the crusades to his sense dora had but one defecther admiration for her mother was too undiscriminating an ardent young man may well be slightly vexed when he finds that a young lady will probably never care for him so much as she cares for her parent and raymond bestwick had this added ground for chagrin that dora hadif she chose to take itso good a pretext for discriminating for she had nothing whatever in common with the others she was not of the same stuff as mrs temperly and effie and tishy  she was original and generous and uncalculating besides being full of perception and taste in regard to the things he cared about she knew nothing of conventional signs or estimates but understood everything that might be said to her from an artistic point of view she was formed to live in a studio and not in a stiff drawingroom amid upholstery horribly new and moreover her eyes and her voice were both charming it was only a pity she was so gentle that is he liked it for himself but he deplored it for her mother he considered that he had virtually given that lady his word that he would not make love to her but his spirits had risen since his visit of three or four hours before it seemed to him after thinking things over more intently that a way would be opened for him to return to paris it was not probable that in the interval dora would be married off to a prince for in the first place the foolish race of princes would be sure not to appreciate her and in the second she would not in this matter simply do her mothers biddingher gentleness would not go so far as that she might remain single by the maternal decree but she would not take a husband who was disagreeable to her in this reasoning raymond was obliged to shut his eyes very tight to the danger that some particular prince might not be disagreeable to her as well as to the attraction proceeding from what her mother might announce that she would do he was perfectly aware that it was in cousin marias power and would probably be in her pleasure to settle a handsome marriagefee upon each of her daughters he was equally certain that this had nothing to do with the nature of his own interest in the eldest both because it was clear that mrs temperly would do very little for him and because he didnt care how little she did  effie and tishy sat in the circle on the edge of rather high chairs while mademoiselle bourde surveyed in them with complacency the results of her own superiority tishy was a child but effie was fifteen and they were both very nice little girls arrayed in fresh travelling dresses and deriving a quaintness from the fact that tishy was already armed for foreign adventures with a smart new reticule from which she could not be induced to part and that effie had her finger in her place in a fat red volume of murray raymond knew that in a general way their mother would not have allowed them to appear in the drawingroom with these adjuncts but something was to be allowed to the fever of anticipation they were both pretty with delicate features and blue eyes and would grow up into worldly conventional young ladies just as dora had not done they looked at mademoiselle bourde for approval whenever they spoke and in addressing their mother alternately with that accomplished woman kept their two languages neatly distinct  raymond had but a vague idea of who the people were who had come to bid cousin maria farewell and he had no wish for a sharper one though she introduced him very definitely to the whole group she might make light of him in her secret soul but she would never put herself in the wrong by omitting the smallest form fortunately however he was not obliged to like all her forms and he foresaw the day when she would abandon this particular one she was not so well made up in advance about paris but that it would be in reserve for her to detest the period when she had thought it proper to introduce all round raymond detested it already and tried to make dora understand that he wished her to take a walk with him in the corridors there was a gentleman with a curl on his forehead who especially displeased him he made childish jokes at which the others laughed all at once as if they had rehearsed for itjokes à la portée of effie and tishy and mainly about them these two joined in the merriment as if they followed perfectly as indeed they might and gave a small sigh afterward with a little factitious air dora remained grave almost sad it was when she was different in this way that he felt how much he liked her he hated in general a large ring of people who had drawn up chairs in the public room of an hotel some one was sure to undertake to be funny  he succeeded at last in drawing dora away he endeavoured to give the movement a casual air there was nothing peculiar after all in their walking a little in the passage a dozen other persons were doing the same the girl had the air of not suspecting in the least that he could have anything particular to say to herof responding to his appeal simply out of her general gentleness it was not in her companions interest that her mind should be such a blank nevertheless his conviction that in spite of the ministrations of mademoiselle bourde she was not falsely ingenuous made him repeat to himself that he would still make her his own they took several turns in the hall during which it might still have appeared to dora temperly that her cousin raymond had nothing particular to say to her he remarked several times that he should certainly turn up in paris in the spring but when once she had replied that she was very glad that subject seemed exhausted the young man cared little however it was not a question now of making any declaration he only wanted to be with her suddenly when they were at the end of the corridor furthest removed from the room they had left he said to her your mother is very strange why has she got such an idea about paris  how do you mean such an idea he had stopped making the girl stand there before him  well she thinks so much of it without having ever seen it or really knowing anything she appears to have planned out such a great life there  she thinks its the best place dora rejoined with the dim smile that always charmed our young man  the best place for what  well to learn french the girl continued to smile  do you mean for her shell never learn it she cant  no for us and other things  you know it already and you know other things said raymond  she wants us to know them betterbetter than any girls know them  i dont know what things you mean exclaimed the young man rather impatiently  well we shall see dora returned laughing  he said nothing for a minute at the end of which he resumed i hope you wont be offended if i say that it seems curious your mother should have such aspirationssuch napoleonic plans i mean being just a quiet little lady from california who has never seen any of the kind of thing that she has in her head  thats just why she wants to see it i suppose and i dont know why her being from california should prevent at any rate she wants us to have the best isnt the best taste in paris  yes and the worst it made him gloomy when she defended the old lady and to change the subject he asked arent you sorry this last night to leave your own country for such an indefinite time  it didnt cheer him up that the girl should answer oh i would go anywhere with mother  and with her raymond demanded sarcastically as mademoiselle bourde came in sight emerging from the drawingroom she approached them they met her in a moment and she informed dora that mrs temperly wished her to come back and play a part of that composition of saintsaensthe last one she had been learningfor mr and mrs parminter they wanted to judge whether their daughter could manage it  i dont believe she can said dora smiling but she was moving away to comply when her companion detained her a moment  are you going to bid me goodbye  wont you come back to the drawingroom  i think not i dont like it  and to mammayoull say nothing the girl went on  oh we have made our farewell we had a special interview this afternoon  and you wont come to the ship in the morning  raymond hesitated a moment will mr and mrs parminter be there  oh surely they will mademoiselle bourde declared surveying the young couple with a certain tactful serenity but standing very close to them as if it might be her duty to interpose  well then i wont come  well goodbye then said the girl gently holding out her hand  goodbye dora he took it while she smiled at him but he said nothing morehe was so annoyed at the way mademoiselle bourde watched them he only looked at dora she seemed to him beautiful  my dear childthat poor madame parminter the governess murmured  i shall come over very soon said raymond as his companion turned away  that will be charming and she left him quickly without looking back  mademoiselle bourde lingeredhe didnt know why unless it was to make him feel with her smooth finished french assurance which had the manner of extreme benignity that she was following him up he sometimes wondered whether she copied mrs temperly or whether mrs temperly tried to copy her presently she said slowly rubbing her hands and smiling at him  you will have plenty of time we shall be long in paris  perhaps you will be disappointed raymond suggested  how can we beunless you disappoint us asked the governess sweetly  he left her without ceremony the imitation was probably on the part of cousin maria     iii   only just ourselves her note had said and he arrived in his natural impatience a few moments before the hour he remembered his cousin marias habitual punctuality but when he entered the splendid salon in the quarter of the parc monceauit was there that he had found her establishedhe saw that he should have it for a little to himself this was pleasing for he should be able to look roundthere were admirable things to look at even today raymond bestwick was not sure that he had learned to paint but he had no doubt of his judgment of the work of others and a single glance showed him that mrs temperly had known enough to select for the adornment of her walls half a dozen immensely valuable specimens of contemporary french art her choice of other objects had been equally enlightened and he remembered what dora had said to him five years beforethat her mother wished them to have the best evidently now they had got it if five years was a long time for him to have delayed with his original plan of getting off so soon to come to paris it was a very short one for cousin maria to have taken to arrive at the highest good  rather to his surprise the first person to come in was effie now so complete a young lady and such a very pretty girl that he scarcely would have known her she was fair she was graceful she was lovely and as she entered the room blushing and smiling with a little floating motion which suggested that she was in a liquid element she brushed down the ribbons of a delicate parisian toilette de jeune fille she appeared to expect that he would be surprised and as if to justify herself for being the first she said mamma told me to come she knows you are here she said i was not to wait more than once while they conversed during the next few moments before any one else arrived she repeated that she was acting by her mammas directions raymond perceived that she had not only the costume but several other of the attributes of a jeune fille they talked i say but with a certain difficulty for effie asked him no questions and this made him feel a little stiff about thrusting information upon her then she was so pretty so exquisite that this by itself disconcerted him it seemed to him almost that she had falsified a prophecy instead of bringing one to pass he had foretold that she would be like this the only difference was that she was so much more like it she made no inquiries about his arrival his people in america his plans and they exchanged vague remarks about the pictures quite as if they had met for the first time  when cousin maria came in effie was standing in front of the fire fastening a bracelet and he was at a distance gazing in silence at a portrait of his hostess by bastienlepage one of his apprehensions had been that cousin maria would allude ironically to the difference there had been between his threat because it had been really almost a threat of following them speedily to paris and what had in fact occurred but he saw in a moment how superficial this calculation had been besides when had cousin maria ever been ironical she treated him as if she had seen him last week which did not preclude kindness and only expressed her regret at having missed his visit the day before in consequence of which she had immediately written to him to come and dine he might have come from round the corner instead of from new york and across the wintry ocean this was a part of her cosiness her friendly motherly optimism of which even of old the habit had been never to recognise nor allude to disagreeable things so that today in the midst of so much that was not disagreeable the custom would of course be immensely confirmed  raymond was perfectly aware that it was not a pleasure even for her that for several years past things should have gone so ill in new york with his family and himself his fathers embarrassments of which marians silly husband had been the cause and which had terminated in general ruin and humiliation to say nothing of the old mans stroke and the necessity arising from it for a renunciation on his own part of all present thoughts of leaving home again and even for a partial relinquishment of present work the old man requiring so much of his personal attentionall this constituted an episode which could not fail to look sordid and dreary in the light of mrs temperlys high success the odour of success was in the warm slightly heavy air which seemed distilled from rare old fabrics from brocades and tapestries from the deep mingled tones of the pictures the subdued radiance of cabinets and old porcelain and the jars of winter roses standing in soft circles of lamplight raymond felt himself in the presence of an effect in regard to which he remained in ignorance of the causea mystery that required a key cousin marias success was unexplained so long as she simply stood there with her little familiar comforting upward gaze talking in coaxing cadences with exactly the same manner she had brought ten years ago from california to a tall bald bending smiling young man evidently a foreigner who had just come in and whose name raymond had not caught from the lips of the maître dhôtel was he just one of themselveswas he there for effie or perhaps even for dora the unexplained must preponderate till dora came in he found he counted upon her even though in her letters it was true that for the last couple of years they had come but at long intervals she had told him so little about their life she never spoke of people she talked of the books she read of the music she had heard or was studying a whole page sometimes about the last concert at the conservatoire the new pictures and the manner of the different artists  when she entered the room three or four minutes after the arrival of the young foreigner with whom her mother conversed in just the accents raymond had last heard at the hotel in the fifth avenue he was obliged to admit that she gave herself no airs it was clear that her success had not gone in the least to her head when dora at last appeared she was accompanied by mademoiselle bourde the presence of this ladyhe didnt know she was still in the houseraymond took as a sign that they were really dining en famille so that the young man was either an actual or a prospective intimate dora shook hands first with her cousin but he watched the manner of her greeting with the other visitor and saw that it indicated extreme friendlinesson the part of the latter if there was a charming flush in her cheek as he took her hand that was the remainder of the colour that had risen there as she came toward raymond it will be seen that our young man still had an eye for the element of fascination as he used to regard it in this quiet dimlyshining maiden  he saw that effie was the only one who had changed tishy remained yet to be judged except that dora really looked older quite as much older as the number of years had given her a right to there was as little difference in her as there was in her mother not that she was like her mother but she was perfectly like herself her meeting with raymond was bright but very still their phrases were awkward and commonplace and the thing was mainly a contact of looksconscious embarrassed indirect but brightening every moment with old familiarities her mother appeared to pay no attention and neither to do her justice did mademoiselle bourde who after an exchange of expressive salutations with raymond began to scrutinise effie with little admiring gestures and smiles she surveyed her from head to foot she pulled a ribbon straight she was evidently a flattering governess cousin maria explained to cousin raymond that they were waiting for one more frienda very dear lady but she lives near and when people live near they are always latehavent you noticed that  your hotel is far away i know and yet you were the first dora said smiling to raymond  oh even if it were round the corner i should be the firstto come to you the young man answered speaking loud and clear so that his words might serve as a notification to cousin maria that his sentiments were unchanged  you are more french than the french dora returned  you say that as if you didnt like them i hope you dont said raymond still with intentions in regard to his hostess  we like them more and more the more we see of them this lady interposed but gently impersonally and with an air of not wishing to put raymond in the wrong  mais jespère bien cried mademoiselle bourde holding up her head and opening her eyes very wide such friendships as we form and i may say as we inspire je men rapporte à effie the governess continued  we have received immense kindness we have established relations that are so pleasant for us cousin raymond we have the entrée of so many charming homes mrs temperly remarked  but ours is the most charming of all that i will say exclaimed mademoiselle bourde isnt it so effie  oh yes i think it is especially when we are expecting the marquise effie responded then she added but here she comes now i hear her carriage in the court  the marquise too was just one of themselves she was a part of their charming home  she is such a love said mrs temperly to the foreign gentleman with an irrepressible movement of benevolence  to which raymond heard the gentleman reply that ah she was the most distinguished woman in france  do you know madame de brives effie asked of raymond while they were waiting for her to come in  she came in at that moment and the girl turned away quickly without an answer  how in the world should i know her that was the answer he would have been tempted to give he felt very much out of cousin marias circle the foreign gentleman fingered his moustache and looked at him sidewise the marquise was a very pretty woman fair and slender of middle age with a smile a complexion a diamond necklace of great splendour and a charming manner her greeting to her friends was sweet and familiar and was accompanied with much kissing of a sisterly motherly daughterly kind and yet with this expression of simple almost homely sentiment there was something in her that astonished and dazzled she might very well have been as the foreign young man said the most distinguished woman in france dora had not rushed forward to meet her with nearly so much empressement as effie and this gave him a chance to ask the former who she was the girl replied that she was her mothers most intimate friend to which he rejoined that that was not a description what he wanted to know was her title to this exalted position  why cant you see it she is beautiful and she is good  i see that she is beautiful but how can i see that she is good  good to mamma i mean and to effie and tishy  and isnt she good to you  oh i dont know her so well but i delight to look at her  certainly that must be a great pleasure said raymond he enjoyed it during dinner which was now served though his enjoyment was diminished by his not finding himself next to dora they sat at a small round table and he had at his right his cousin maria whom he had taken in on his left was madame de brives who had the foreign gentleman for a neighbour then came effie and mademoiselle bourde and dora was on the other side of her mother raymond regarded this as markeda symbol of the fact that cousin maria would continue to separate them he remained in ignorance of the other gentlemans identity and remembered how he had prophesied at the hotel in new york that his hostess would give up introducing people it was a friendly easy little family repast as she had said it would be with just a marquise and a secretary of embassyraymond ended by guessing that the stranger was a secretary of embassythrown in so far from interfering with the family tone madame de brives directly contributed to it she eminently justified the affection in which she was held in the house she was in the highest degree sociable and sympathetic and at the same time witty there was no insipidity in madame de brives and was the cause of raymonds making the reflectionas he had made it often in his earlier yearsthat an agreeable frenchwoman is a triumph of civilisation this did not prevent him from giving the marquise no more than half of his attention the rest was dedicated to dora who on her side though in common with effie and mademoiselle bourde she bent a frequent interested gaze on the splendid french lady very often met our young mans eyes with mute vague but to his sense none the less valuable intimations it was as if she knew what was going on in his mind it is true that he scarcely knew it himself and might be trusted to clear things up at some convenient hour  madame de brives talked across raymond in excellent english to cousin maria but this did not prevent her from being gracious even encouraging to the young man who was a little afraid of her and thought her a delightful creature she asked him more questions about himself than any of them had done her conversation with mrs temperly was of an intimate domestic order and full of social personal allusions which raymond was unable to follow it appeared to be concerned considerably with the private affairs of the old french noblesse into whose councilsto judge by the tone of the marquisecousin maria had been admitted by acclamation every now and then madame de brives broke into french and it was in this tongue that she uttered an apostrophe to her hostess oh you ma toutebonne you who have the genius of good sense and she appealed to raymond to know if his cousin maria had not the genius of good sensethe wisdom of the ages the old lady did not defend herself from the compliment she let it pass with her motherly tolerant smile nor did raymond attempt to defend her for he felt the justice of his neighbours description cousin marias good sense was incontestable magnificent she took an affectionate indulgent view of most of the persons mentioned and yet her tone was far from being vapid or vague madame de brives usually remarked that they were coming very soon again to see her she did them so much good the freshness of your judgmentthe freshness of your judgment she repeated with a kind of glee and she narrated that eléonore a personage unknown to raymond had said that she was a woman of plutarch mrs temperly talked a great deal about the health of their friends she seemed to keep the record of the influenzas and neuralgias of a numerous and susceptible circle he did not find it in him quite to agreethe marquise dropping the statement into his ear at a moment when their hostess was making some inquiry of mademoiselle bourdethat she was a nature absolutely marvellous but he could easily see that to worldworn parisians her quiet charities of speech and manner with something quaint and rustic in their form might be restorative and salutary she allowed for everything yet she was so good and indeed madame de brives summed this up before they left the table in saying to her oh you my dear your success more than any other that has ever taken place has been a succès de bonté raymond was greatly amused at this idea of cousin marias succès de bonté it seemed to him delightfully parisian  before dinner was over she inquired of him how he had got on in his profession since they last met and he was too proud or so he thought to tell her anything but the simple truth that he had not got on very well if he was to ask her again for dora it would be just as he was an honourable but not particularly successful man making no show of lures and bribes i am not a remarkably good painter he said i judge myself perfectly and then i have been handicapped at home i have had a great many serious bothers and worries  ah we were so sorry to hear about your dear father  the tone of these words was kind and sincere still raymond thought that in this case her bonté might have gone a little further at any rate this was the only allusion that she made to his bothers and worries indeed she always passed over such things lightly she was an optimist for others as well as for herself which doubtless had a great deal to do raymond indulged in the reflection with the headway she made in a society tired of its own pessimism  after dinner when they went into the drawingroom the young man noted with complacency that this apartment vast in itself communicated with two or three others into which it would be easy to pass without attracting attention the doors being replaced by old tapestries looped up and offering no barrier with pictures and curiosities all over the place there were plenty of pretexts for wandering away he lost no time in asking dora whether her mother would send mademoiselle bourde after them if she were to go with him into one of the other rooms the same way she had donedidnt she rememberthat last night in new york at the hotel dora didnt admit that she remembered she was too loyal to her mother for that and raymond foresaw that this loyalty would be a source of irritation to him again as it had been in the past but he perceived all the same that she had not forgotten she raised no difficulty and a few moments later while they stood in an adjacent salon he had stopped to admire a bust of effie wonderfully living slim and juvenile the work of one of the sculptors who are the pride of contemporary french art he said to her looking about him how has she done it so fast  done what raymond  why done everything collected all these wonderful things become intimate with madame de brives and every one else organised her lifethe life of all of youso brilliantly  i have never seen mamma in a hurry dora replied  perhaps she will be now that i have come raymond suggested laughing  the girl hesitated a moment yes she was to invite youthe moment she knew you were here  she has been most kind and i talk like a brute but i am liable to do worsei give you notice she wont like it any more than she did before if she thinks i want to make up to you  dont raymonddont the girl exclaimed gently but with a look of sudden pain  dont what doradont make up to you  dont begin to talk of those things there is no need we can go on being friends  i will do exactly as you prescribe and heaven forbid i should annoy you but would you mind answering me a question it is very particular very intimate he stopped and she only looked at him saying nothing so he went on is it an idea of your mothers that you should marrysome person here he gave her a chance to reply but still she was silent and he continued do you mind telling me this could it ever be an idea of your own  do you mean some frenchman  raymond smiled some protégé of madame de brives  then the girl simply gave a slow sad headshake which struck him as the sweetest proudest most suggestive thing in the world well well thats all right he remarked cheerfully and looked again a while at the bust which he thought extraordinarily clever and havent you been done by one of these great fellows  oh dear no only mamma and effie but tishy is going to be in a month or two the next time you come you must see her she remembers you vividly  and i remember her that last night with her reticule is she always pretty  dora hesitated a moment she is a very sweet little creature but she is not so pretty as effie  and have none of them wished to do younone of the painters  oh its not a question of me i only wish them to let me alone  for me it would be a question of you if you would sit for me but i daresay your mother wouldnt allow that  no i think not said dora smiling  she smiled but her companion looked grave however not to pursue the subject he asked abruptly who is this madame de brives  if you lived in paris you would know she is very celebrated  celebrated for what  for everything  and is she goodis she genuine raymond asked then seeing something in the girls face he added i told you i should be brutal again has she undertaken to make a great marriage for effie  i dont know what she has undertaken said dora impatiently  and then for tishy when effie has been disposed of  poor little tishy the girl continued rather inscrutably  and can she do nothing for you the young man inquired  her answer surprised himafter a moment she has kindly offered to exert herself but its no use  well thats good and who is it the young man comes forthe secretary of embassy  oh he comes for all of us said dora laughing  i suppose your mother would prefer a preference raymond suggested  to this she replied irrelevantly that she thought they had better go back but as raymond took no notice of the recommendation she mentioned that the secretary was no one in particular at this moment effie looking very rosy and happy pushed through the portière with the news that her sister must come and bid goodbye to the marquise she was taking her to the duchesssdidnt dora remember to the bal blancthe sauterie de jeunes filles  i thought we should be called said raymond as he followed effie and he remarked that perhaps madame de brives would find something suitable at the duchesss  i dont know mamma would be very particular the girl rejoined and this was said simply sympathetically without the least appearance of deflection from that loyalty which raymond deplored     iv   you must come to us on the 17th we expect to have a few people and some good music cousin maria said to him before he quitted the house and he wondered whether the 17th being still ten days off this might not be an intimation that they could abstain from his society until then he chose at any rate not to take it as such and called several times in the interval late in the afternoon when the ladies would be sure to have come in  they were always there and cousin marias welcome was for each occasion maternal though when he took leave she made no allusion to future meetingsto his coming again but there were always other visitors as well collected at tea round the great fire of logs in the friendly brilliant drawingroom where the luxurious was no enemy to the casual and mrs temperlys manner of dispensing hospitality recalled to our young man somehow certain memories of his youthful time visits in new england at old homesteads flanked with elms where a talkative democratic delightful farmers wife pressed upon her company rustic viands in which she herself had had a hand cousin maria enjoyed the services of a distinguished chef and delicious petits fours were served with her tea but raymond had a sense that to complete the impression hot homemade gingerbread should have been produced  the atmosphere was suffused with the presence of madame de brives she was either there or she was just coming or she was just gone her name her voice her example and encouragement were in the air other ladies came and wentsometimes accompanied by gentlemen who looked worn out had waxed moustaches and knew how to talkand they were sometimes designated in the same manner as madame de brives but she remained the marquise par excellence the incarnation of brilliancy and renown the conversation moved among simple but civilised topics was not dull and considering that it consisted largely of personalities was not illnatured least of all was it scandalous for the girls were always there cousin maria not having thought it in the least necessary in order to put herself in accord with french traditions to relegate her daughters to the middle distance they occupied a considerable part of the foreground in the prettiest most modest most becoming attitudes  it was cousin marias theory of her own behaviour that she did in paris simply as she had always done and though this would not have been a complete account of the matter raymond could not fail to notice the good sense and good taste with which she laid down her lines and the quiet bonhomie of the authority with which she caused the tone of the american home to be respected scandal stayed outside not simply because effie and tishy were there but because even if cousin maria had received alone she never would have received evilspeakers indeed for raymond who had been accustomed to think that in a general way he knew pretty well what the french capital was this was a strange fresh paris altogether destitute of the salt that seasoned it for most palates and yet not insipid nor innutritive he marvelled at cousin marias air in such a city of knowing of recognising nothing bad all the more that it represented an actual state of mind he used to wonder sometimes what she would do and how she would feel if some day in consequence of researches made by the marquise in the grand monde she should find herself in possession of a soninlaw formed according to one of the types of which he had impressions however it was not credible that madame de brives would play her a trick there were moments when raymond almost wished she mightto see how cousin maria would handle the gentleman  dora was almost always taken up by visitors and he had scarcely any direct conversation with her she was there and he was glad she was there and she knew he was glad he knew that but this was almost all the communion he had with her she was mild exquisitely mildthis was the term he mentally applied to her nowand it amply sufficed him with the conviction he had that she was not stupid she attended to the tea for mademoiselle bourde was not always free she handed the petits fours she rang the bell when people went out and it was in connection with these offices that the idea came to him oncehe was rather ashamed of it afterwardthat she was the cinderella of the house the domestic drudge the one for whom there was no career as it was useless for the marquise to take up her case he was ashamed of this fancy i say and yet it came back to him he was even surprised that it had not occurred to him before her sisters were neither ugly nor proud tishy indeed was almost touchingly delicate and timid with exceedingly pretty points yet with a little appealing oldwomanish look as if smallvery smallas she was she was afraid she shouldnt grow any more but her mother like the mother in the fairytale was a femme forte madame de brives could do nothing for dora not absolutely because she was too plain but because she would never lend herself and that came to the same thing her mother accepted her as recalcitrant but cousin marias attitude at the best could only be resignation she would respect her childs preferences she would never put on the screw but this would not make her love the child any more so raymond interpreted certain signs which at the same time he felt to be very slight while the conversation in mrs temperlys salon this was its preponderant tendency rambled among questions of bricàbrac of where tishys portrait should be placed when it was finished and the current prices of old gobelins ces dames were not in the least above the discussion of prices  on the 17th it was easy to see that more lamps than usual had been lighted they streamed through all the windows of the charming hotel and mingled with the radiance of the carriagelanterns which followed each other slowly in couples in a close long rank into the fine sonorous court where the high stepping of valuable horses was sharp on the stones and up to the ruddy portico the night was wet not with a downpour but with showers interspaced by starry patches which only added to the glitter of the handsome clean parisian surfaces the sergents de ville were about the place and seemed to make the occasion important and official these night aspects of paris in the beaux quartiers had always for raymond a particularly festive association and as he passed from his cab under the wide permanent tin canopy painted in stripes like an awning which protected the low steps it seemed to him odder than ever that all this established prosperity should be cousin marias  if the thought of how well she did it bore him company from the threshold it deepened to admiration by the time he had been half an hour in the place she stood near the entrance with her two elder daughters distributing the most familiar most encouraging smiles together with handshakes which were in themselves a whole system of hospitality if her party was grand cousin maria was not she indulged in no assumption of stateliness and no attempt at graduated welcomes it seemed to raymond that it was only because it would have taken too much time that she didnt kiss every one effie looked lovely and just a little frightened which was exactly what she ought to have done and he noticed that among the arriving guests those who were not intimate which he could not tell from mrs temperlys manner but could from their own recognised her as a daughter much more quickly than they recognised dora who hung back disinterestedly as if not to challenge their discernment while the current passed her keeping her little sister in position on its brink meanwhile by the tenderest small gesture  may i talk with you a little later he asked of dora with only a few seconds for the question as people were pressing behind him she answered evasively that there would be very little talkthey would all have to listenit was very serious and the next moment he had received a programme from the hand of a monumental yet gracious personage who stood beyond and who had a silver chain round his neck  the place was arranged for music and how well arranged he saw later when every one was seated spaciously luxuriously without pushing or overpeeping and the finest talents in paris performed selections at which the best taste had presided the singers and players were all stars of the first magnitude raymond was fond of music and he wondered whose taste it had been he made up his mind it was dorasit was only she who could have conceived a combination so exquisite and he said to himself how they all pull together she is not in it she is not of it and yet she too works for the common end and by all he meant also mademoiselle bourde and the marquise this impression made him feel rather hopeless as if en fin de compte cousin maria were too large an adversary great as was the pleasure of being present on an occasion so admirably organised of sitting there in a beautiful room in a still attentive brilliant company with all the questions of temperature space light and decoration solved to the gratification of every sense and listening to the best artists doing their besthappily constituted as our young man was to enjoy such a privilege as this the total effect was depressing it made him feel as if the gods were not on his side  and does she do it so well without a man there must be so many details a woman cant tackle he said to himself for even counting in the marquise and mademoiselle bourde this only made a multiplication of petticoats then it came over him that she was a man as well as a womanthe masculine element was included in her nature he was sure that she bought her horses without being cheated and very few men could do that she had the american national qualityshe had faculty in a supreme degree facultyfaculty the voices of the quartette of singers seemed to repeat in the quick movement of a composition they rendered beautifully while they swelled and went faster till the thing became a joyous chant of praise a glorification of cousin marias practical genius  during the intermission in the middle of the concert people changed places more or less and circulated so that walking about at this time he came upon the marquise who in her sympathetic demonstrative way appeared to be on the point of clasping her hostess in her arms décidément ma bonne il ny a que vous cest une perfection he heard her say to which gratified but unelated cousin maria replied according to her simple sociable wont well it does seem quite a successful occasion if it will only keep on to the end  raymond wandering far found himself in a world that was mainly quite new to him and explained his ignorance of it by reflecting that the people were probably celebrated so many of them had decorations and stars and a quiet of manner that could only be accounted for by renown there were plenty of americans with no badge but a certain fine negativeness and they were quiet for a reason which by this time had become very familiar to raymond he had heard it so often mentioned that his countrypeople were supremely adaptable he tried to get hold of dora but he saw that her mother had arranged things beautifully to keep her occupied with other people so at least he interpreted the factafter all very naturalthat she had half a dozen fluttered young girls on her mind whom she was providing with programmes seats ices occasional murmured remarks and general support and protection when the concert was over she supplied them with further entertainment in the form of several young men who had pliable backs and flashing breastpins and whom she inarticulately introduced to them which gave her still more to do as after this serious step she had to stay and watch all parties it was strange to raymond to see her transformed by her mother into a precocious duenna him she introduced to no young girl and he knew not whether to regard this as cold neglect or as high consideration if he had liked he might have taken it as a sweet intimation that she knew he couldnt care for any girl but her  on the whole he was glad because it left him freefree to get hold of her mother which by this time he had boldly determined to do the conception was high inasmuch as cousin marias attention was obviously required by the ambassadors and other grandees who had flocked to do her homage nevertheless while supper was going on he wanted none and neither apparently did she he collared her as he phrased it to himself in just the right placeon the threshold of the conservatory she was flanked on either side with a foreigner of distinction but he didnt care for her foreigners now besides a conservatory was meant only for couples it was a sign of her comprehensive sociability that she should have been rambling among the palms and orchids with a double escort her friends would wish to quit her but would not wish to appear to give way to each other and raymond felt that he was relieving them both though he didnt care when he asked her to be so good as to give him a few minutes conversation he made her go back with him into the conservatory it was the only thing he had ever made her do or probably ever would she began to talk about the great gregorinihow it had been too sweet of her to repeat one of her songs when it had really been understood in advance that repetitions were not expected raymond had no interest at present in the great gregorini he asked cousin maria vehemently if she remembered telling him in new yorkthat night at the hotel five years beforethat when he should have followed them to paris he would be free to address her on the subject of dora she had given him a promise that she would listen to him in this case and now he must keep her up to the mark it was impossible to see her alone but at whatever inconvenience to herself he must insist on her giving him his opportunity  about dora cousin raymond she asked blandly and kindlyalmost as if she didnt exactly know who dora was  surely you havent forgotten what passed between us the evening before you left america i was in love with her then and i have been in love with her ever since i told you so then and you stopped me off but you gave me leave to make another appeal to you in the future i make it nowthis is the only way i haveand i think you ought to listen to it five years have passed and i love her more than ever i have behaved like a saint in the interval i havent attempted to practise upon her without your knowledge  i am so glad but she would have let me know said cousin maria looking round the conservatory as if to see if the plants were all there  no doubt i dont know what you do to her but i trust that today your opposition fallsin face of the proof that we have given you of mutual fidelity  fidelity cousin maria repeated smiling  surelyunless you mean to imply that dora has given me up i have reason to believe that she hasnt  i think she will like better to remain just as she is  just as she is  i mean not to make a choice cousin maria went on smiling  raymond hesitated a moment do you mean that you have tried to make her make one  at this the good lady broke into a laugh my dear raymond how little you must think i know my child  perhaps if you havent tried to make her you have tried to prevent her havent you told her i am unsuccessful i am poor  she stopped him laying her hand with unaffected solicitude on his arm are you poor my dear i should be so sorry  never mind i can support a wife said the young man  it wouldnt matter because i am happy to say that dora has something of her own cousin maria went on with her imperturbable candour her father thought that was the best way to arrange it i had quite forgotten my opposition as you call it that was so long ago why she was only a little girl wasnt that the ground i took well dear shes older now and you can say anything to her you like but i do think she wants to stay and she looked up at him cheerily  wants to stay  with effie and tishy  ah cousin maria the young man exclaimed you are modest about yourself  well we are all together now is that all i must see if there is enough champagne certainlyyou can say to her what you like but twenty years hence she will be just as she is today thats how i see her  lord what is it you do to her raymond groaned as he accompanied his hostess back to the crowded rooms  he knew exactly what she would have replied if she had been a frenchwoman she would have said to him triumphantly overwhelmingly que voulezvous elle adore sa mère she was however only a californian unacquainted with the language of epigram and her answer consisted simply of the words i am sorry you have ideas that make you unhappy i guess you are the only person here who hasnt enjoyed himself tonight  raymond repeated to himself gloomily for the rest of the evening elle adore sa mèreelle adore sa mère he remained very late and when but twenty people were left and he had observed that the marquise passing her hand into mrs temperlys arm led her aside as if for some important confabulation some new light doubtless on what might be hoped for effie he persuaded dora to let the rest of the guests depart in peace apparently her mother had told her to look out for them to the very last and come with him into some quiet corner they found an empty sofa in the outlasting lamplight and there the girl sat down with him evidently she knew what he was going to say or rather she thought she did for in fact after a little after he had told her that he had spoken to her mother and she had told him he might speak to her he said things that she could not very well have expected  is it true that you wish to remain with effie and tishy thats what your mother calls it when she means that you will give me up  how can i give you up the girl demanded why cant we go on being friends as i asked you the evening you dined here  what do you mean by friends  well not making everything impossible  you didnt think anything impossible of old raymond rejoined bitterly i thought you liked me then and i have even thought so since  i like you more than i like any one i like you so much that its my principal happiness  then why are there impossibilities  oh some day ill tell you said dora with a quick sigh perhaps after tishy is married and meanwhile are you not going to remain in paris at any rate isnt your work here you are not here for me only you can come to the house often thats what i mean by our being friends  her companion sat looking at her with a gloomy stare as if he were trying to make up the deficiencies in her logic  after tishy is married i dont see what that has to do with it tishy is little more than a baby she may not be married for ten years  that is very true  and you dispose of the interval by a simple meanwhile my dear dora your talk is strange raymond continued with his voice passionately lowered and i may come to the houseoften how often do you meanin ten years five timesor even twenty he saw that her eyes were filling with tears but he went on it has been coming over me little by little i notice things very much if i have a reason and now i think i understand your mothers system  dont say anything against my mother the girl broke in beseechingly  i shall not say anything unjust that is if i am unjust you must tell me this is my idea and your speaking of tishys marriage confirms it to begin with she has had immense plans for you all she wanted each of you to be a princess or a duchessi mean a good one but she has had to give you up  no one has asked for me said dora with unexpected honesty  i dont believe it dozens of fellows have asked for you and you have shaken your head in that divine way divine for me i mean in which you shook it the other night  my mother has never said an unkind word to me in her life the girl declared in answer to this  i never said she had and i dont know why you take the precaution of telling me so but whatever you tell me or dont tell me raymond pursued there is one thing i see very wellthat so long as you wont marry a duke cousin maria has found means to prevent you from marrying till your sisters have made rare alliances  has found means dora repeated as if she really wondered what was in his thought  of course i mean only through your affection for her how she works that you know best yourself  its delightful to have a mother of whom every one is so fond said dora smiling  she is a most remarkable woman dont think for a moment that i dont appreciate her you dont want to quarrel with her and i daresay you are right  why raymond of course im right  it proves you are not madly in love with me it seems to me that for you i would have quarrelled  raymond raymond she interrupted with the tears again rising  he sat looking at her and then he said well when they are married  i dont know the futurei dont know what may happen  you mean that tishy is so smallshe doesnt growand will therefore be difficult yes she is small there was bitterness in his heart but he laughed at his own words however effie ought to go off easily he went on as dora said nothing i really wonder that with the marquise and all she hasnt gone off yet this thing tonight ought to do a great deal for her  dora listened to him with a fascinated gaze it was as if he expressed things for her and relieved her spirit by making them clear and coherent her eyes managed each time to be dry again and now a somewhat wan ironical smile moved her lips mamma knows what she wantsshe knows what she will take and she will take only that  preciselysomething tremendous and she is willing to wait eh well effie is very young and shes charming but she wont be charming if she has an ugly appendage in the shape of a poor unsuccessful american artist not even a good one whose father went bankrupt for a brotherinlaw that wont smooth the way of course and if a prince is to come into the family the family must be kept tidy to receive him dora got up quickly as if she could bear his lucidity no longer but he kept close to her as she walked away and she can sacrifice you like that without a scruple without a pang  i might have escapedif i would marry the girl replied  do you call that escaping she has succeeded with you but is it a part of what the marquise calls her succès de bonté  nothing that you can say and its far worse than the reality can prevent her being delightful  yes thats your loyalty and i could shoot you for it he exclaimed making her pause on the threshold of the adjoining room so you think it will take about ten years considering tishys sizeor want of size he himself again was the only one to laugh at this your mother is closeted as much as she can be closeted now with madame de brives and perhaps this time they are really settling something  i have thought that before and nothing has come mamma wants something so good not only every advantage and every grandeur but every virtue under heaven and every guarantee oh she wouldnt expose them  i see thats where her goodness comes in and where the marquise is impressed he took doras hand he felt that he must go for she exasperated him with her irony that stopped short and her patience that wouldnt stop you simply propose that i should wait he said as he held her hand  it seems to me that you might if i can then the girl remarked now that you are here its far better  there was a sweetness in this which made him after glancing about a moment raise her hand to his lips he went away without taking leave of cousin maria who was still out of sight her conference with the marquise apparently not having terminated this looked he reflected as he passed out as if something might come of it however before he went home he fell again into a gloomy forecast the weather had changed the stars were all out and he walked the empty streets for an hour tishys perverse refusal to grow and cousin marias conscientious exactions promised him a terrible probation and in those intolerable years what further interference what meddlesome effective pressure might not make itself felt it may be added that tishy is decidedly a dwarf and his probation is not yet over   the end     advertisements   macmillan and cos publications   by the
