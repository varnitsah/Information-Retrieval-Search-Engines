14002357	the parlorcar  by william d howells     scene  a parlorcar on the new york central railroad  it is late afternoon in the early autumn with a cloudy sunset threatening rain the car is unoccupied save by a gentleman who sits fronting one of the windows with his feet in another chair a newspaper lies across his lap his hat is drawn down over his eyes and he is apparently asleep  the rear door of the car opens and the conductor enters with a young lady heavily veiled the porter coming after with her wraps and travellingbags  the ladys air is of mingled anxiety and desperation with a certain fierceness of movement  she casts a careless glance over the empty chairs  conductor  heres your ticket madam  you can have any of the places you like hereglancing at the unconscious gentleman and then at the young ladyif you prefer you can go and take that seat in the forward car  miss lucy galbraith  oh i cant ride backwards  ill stay here please  thank you  the porter places her things in a chair by a window across the car from the sleeping gentleman and she throws herself wearily into the next seat wheels round in it and lifting her veil gazes absently out at the landscape  her face which is very pretty with a low forehead shadowed by thick blond hair shows the traces of tears  she makes search in her pocket for her handkerchief which she presses to her eyes  the conductor lingering a moment goes out  porter  ill be right here at de end of de cah if you should happen to want anything missmaking a feint of arranging the shawls and satchels  should you like some dese things hung up well deyll be jus as well in de chair  wes pretty late dis afternoon moren four hours behin time  ought to been into albany fore dis  freight train off de track jus dis side o rochester an had to wait  was you going to stop at schenectady miss  miss galbraith absently  at schenectady  after a pause yes  porter  well thats de next station and den de cahs dont stop agin till dey git to albany  anything else i can do for you now miss  miss galbraith  no no thank you nothing  the porter hesitates takes off his cap and scratches his head with a murmur of embarrassment  miss galbraith looks up at him inquiringly and then suddenly takes out her portemonnaie and fees him  porter  thank you miss thank you  if you want anything at all miss im right dere at de end of de cah  he goes out by the narrow passageway beside the smaller enclosed parlor  miss galbraith looks askance at the sleeping gentleman and then rising goes to the large mirror to pin her veil which has become loosened from her hat  she gives a little start at sight of the gentleman in the mirror but arranges her headgear and returning to her place looks out of the window again  after a little while she moves about uneasily in her chair then leans forward and tries to raise her window she lifts it partly up when the catch slips from her fingers and the window falls shut again with a crash  miss galbraith  oh dear how provoking  i suppose i must call the porter  she rises from her seat but on attempting to move away she finds that the skirt of her polonaise has been caught in the falling window  she pulls at it and then tries to lift the window again but the cloth has wedged it in and she cannot stir it  well i certainly think this is beyond endurance  porter  ahporter  oh hell never hear me in the racket that these wheels are making  i wish theyd stopithe gentleman stirs in his chair lifts his head listens takes his feet down from the other seat rises abruptly and comes to miss galbraiths side  mr allen richards  will you allow me to open the window for you starting back miss galbraith  miss galbraith  almr richards  there is a silence for some moments in which they remain looking at each other then   mr richards  lucy   miss galbraith  i forbid you to address me in that way mr richards  mr richards  why you were just going to call me allen  miss galbraith  that was an accident you know very wellan impulse   mr richards  well so is this  miss galbraith  of which you ought to be ashamed to take advantage i wonder at your presumption in speaking to me at all  its quite idle i can assure you  everything is at an end between us  it seems that i bore with you too long but im thankful that i had the spirit to not at last and to act in time  and now that chance has thrown us together i trust that you will not force your conversation upon me  no gentleman would and i have always given you credit for thinking yourself a gentleman  i request that you will not speak to me  mr richards  youve spoken ten words to me for every one of mine to you  but i wont annoy you  i cant believe it lucy i can not believe it  it seems like some rascally dream and if i had had any sleep since it happened i should think i  miss galbraith  oh  you were sleeping soundly enough when i got into the car  mr richards  i own it i was perfectly used up and i had dropped off  miss galbraith scornfully  then perhaps you have dreamed it  mr richards  ill think so till you tell me again that our engagement is broken that the faithful love of years is to go for nothing that you dismiss me with cruel insult without one word of explanation without a word of intelligible accusation even  its too much  ive been thinking it all over and over and i cant make head or tail of it  i meant to see you again as soon as we got to town and implore you to hear me  come its a mighty serious matter lucy  im not a man to put on heroics and that but i believe itll play the very deuce with me lucythat is to say miss galbraithi do indeed  itll give me a low opinion of woman  miss galbraith averting her face  oh a very high opinion of woman you have had  mr richards with sentiment  well there was one woman whom i thought a perfect angel  miss galbraith  indeed  may i ask her name  mr richards with a forlorn smile  i shall be obliged to describe her somewhat formally asmiss galbraith  miss galbraith  mr richards  mr richards  why youve just forbidden me to say lucy  you must tell me dearest what i have done to offend you  the worst criminals are not condemned unheard and ive always thought you were merciful if not just  and now i only ask you to be just  miss galbraith looking out of the window  you know very well what youve done  you cant expect me to humiliate myself by putting your offence into words  mr richards  upon my soul i dont know what you mean  i dont know what ive done  when you came at me last night with my ring and presents and other little traps you might have knocked me down with the lightest of the lot  i was perfectly dazed i couldnt say anything before you were off and all i could do was to hope that youd be more like yourself in the morning  and in the morning when i came round to mrs philipss i found you were gone and i came after you by the next train  miss galbraith  mr richards your personal history for the last twentyfour hours is a matter of perfect indifference to me as it shall be for the next twentyfour hundred years  i see that you are resolved to annoy me and since you will not leave the car i must do so  she rises haughtily from her seat but the imprisoned skirt of her polonaise twitches her abruptly back into her chair  she bursts into tears  oh what shall i do  mr richards dryly  you shall do whatever you like miss galbraith when ive set you free for i see your dress is caught in the window  when its once out ill shut the window and you can call the porter to raise it  he leans forward over her chair and while she shrinks back the length of her tether he tugs at the windowfastening  i cant get at it  would you be so good as to stand upall you can  miss galbraith stands up droopingly and mr richards makes a movement towards her and then falls back  no that wont do  please sit down again  he goes round her chair and tries to get at the window from that side  i cant get any purchase on it  why dont you cut out that piece  miss galbraith stares at him in dumb amazement  well i dont see what were to do  ill go and get the porter  he goes to the end of the car and returns  i cant find the porterhe must be in one of the other cars  but brightening with the fortunate conceptionive just thought of something  will it unbutton  miss galbraith  unbutton  mr richards  yes this garment of yours  miss galbraith  my polonaise  inquiringly yes  mr richards  well then its a very simple matter  if you will just take it off i can easily   miss galbraith faintly  i cant  a polonaise isnt like an overcoat   mr richards with dismay  oh  well thenhe remains thinking a moment in hopeless perplexity  miss galbraith with polite ceremony  the porter will be back soon dont trouble yourself any further about it please  i shall do very well  mr richards without heeding her  if you could kneel on that foot cushion and face the window   miss galbraith kneeling promptly  so  mr richards  yes and nowkneeling beside herif youll allow me toto get at the windowcatchhe stretches both arms forward she shrinks from his right into his left and then back againand pull while i raise the window   miss galbraith  yes yes but do hurry please  if any one saw us i dont know what they would think  its perfectly ridiculous pulling  its caught in the corner of the window between the frame and the sash and it wont come  is my hair troubling you  is it in your eyes  mr richards  its in my eyes but it isnt troubling me  am i inconveniencing you  miss galbraith  oh not at all  mr richards  well now then pull hard  he lifts the window with a great effort the polonaise comes free with a start and she strikes violently against him  in supporting the shock he cannot forbear catching her for an instant to his heart  she frees herself and starts indignantly to her feet  miss galbraith  oh what a cowardlysubterfuge  mr richards  cowardly  youve no idea how much courage it took miss galbraith puts her handkerchief to her face and sobs  oh dont cry  bless my heartim sorry i did it  but you know how dearly i love you lucy though i do think youve been cruelly unjust  i told you i never should love any one else and i never shall  i couldnt help it upon my soul i couldnt  nobody could dont let it vex you myhe approaches her  miss galbraith  please not touch me sir  you have no longer any right whatever to do so  mr richards  you misinterpret a very inoffensive gesture  i have no idea of touching you but i hope i may be allowed as a special favor  topick up my hat which you are in the act of stepping on miss galbraith hastily turns and strikes the hat with her whirling skirts it rolls to the other side of the parlor and mr richards who goes after it utters an ironical thanks  he brushes it and puts it on looking at her where she has again seated herself at the window with her back to him and continues as for any further molestation from me   miss galbraith  if you will talk to me   mr richards  excuse me i am not talking to you  miss galbraith  what were you doing  mr richards  i was beginning to think aloud  ii was soliloquizing  i suppose i may be allowed to soliloquize  miss galbraith very coldly  you can do what you like  mr richards  unfortunately thats just what i cant do  if i could do as i liked i should ask you a single question  miss galbraith after a moment  well sir you may ask your question  she remains as before with her chin in her hand looking tearfully out of the window her face is turned from mr richards who hesitates a moment before he speaks  mr richards  i wish to ask you just this miss galbraith  if you couldnt ride backwards in the other car why do you ride backwards in this  miss galbraith burying her face in her handkerchief and sobbing oh oh oh  this is too bad  mr richards  oh come now lucy  it breaks my heart to hear you going on so and all for nothing  be a little merciful to both of us and listen to me  ive no doubt i can explain everything if i once understand it but its pretty hard explaining a thing if you dont understand it yourself  do turn round  i know it makes you sick to ride in that way and if you dont want to face methere wheeling in his chair so as to turn his back upon heryou neednt though its rather trying to a fellows politeness not to mention his other feelings  now what in the name   porter who at this moment enters with his stepladder and begins to light the lamps  going pretty slow agin sah  mr richards  yes whats the trouble  porter  well i dont know exactly sah  something de matter with de locomotive  we shant be into albany much fore eight oclock  mr richards  whats the next station  porter  schenectady  mr richards  is the whole train as empty as this car  porter laughing  well no sah  fact is dis cah dont belong on dis train  its a pullman that we hitched on when you got in and wes taking it along for one of de eastern roads  we let you in cause de drawingrooms was all full  same with de ladylooking sympathetically at her as he takes his steps to go out  can i do anything for you now miss  miss galbraith plaintively  no thank you nothing whatever  she has turned while mr richards and the porter have been speaking and now faces the back of the former but her veil is drawn closely  the porter goes out  mr richards wheeling round so as to confront her  i wish you would speak to me half as kindly as you do to that darky lucy  miss galbraith  he is a gentleman  mr richards  he is an urbane and wellinformed nobleman  at any rate hes a man and a brother  but so am i  miss galbraith does not reply and after a pause mr richards resumes  talking of gentlemen i recollect once coming up on the dayboat to poughkeepsie there was a poor devil of a tipsy man kept following a young fellow about and annoying him to deathtrying to fight him as a tipsy man will and insisting that the young fellow had insulted him  by and by he lost his balance and went overboard and the other jumped after him and fished him out  sensation on the part of miss galbraith who stirs uneasily in her chair looks out of the window then looks at mr richards and drops her head  there was a young lady on board who had seen the whole thinga very charming young lady indeed with pale blond hair growing very thick over her forehead and dark eyelashes to the sweetest blue eyes in the world well this young ladys papa was amongst those who came up to say civil things to the young fellow when he got aboard again and to ask the honorhe said the honorof his acquaintance  and when he came out of his stateroom in dry clothes this infatuated old gentleman was waiting for him and took him and introduced him to his wife and daughter and the daughter said with tears in her eyes and a perfectly intoxicating impulsiveness that it was the grandest and the most heroic and the noblest thing that she had ever seen and she should always be a better girl for having seen it  excuse me miss galbraith for troubling you with these facts of a personal history which as you say is a matter of perfect indifference to you  the young fellow didnt think at the time he had done anything extraordinary but i dont suppose he did expect to live to have the same girl tell him he was no gentleman  miss galbraith wildly  o allen allen  you know i think you are a gentleman and i always did  mr richards languidly  oh i merely had your word for it just now that you didnt  tenderly will you hear me lucy  miss galbraith faintly  yes  mr richards  well what is it ive done  will you tell me if i guess right  miss galbraith with dignity  i am in no humor for jesting allen and i can assure you that though i consent to hear what you have to say or ask nothing will change my determination  all is over between us  mr richards  yes i understand that perfectly  i am now asking merely for general information  i do not expect you to relent and in fact i should consider it rather frivolous if you did  no  what i have always admired in your character lucy is a firm logical consistency a clearness of mental vision that leaves no side of a subject unsearched and an unwavering constancy of purpose  you may say that these traits are characteristic of all women but they are preeminently characteristic of you lucy  miss galbraith looks askance at him to make out whether he is in earnest or not he continues with a perfectly serious air  and i know now that if youre offended with me its for no trivial cause  she stirs uncomfortably in her chair   what i have done i cant imagine but it must be something monstrous since it has made life with me appear so impossible that you are ready to fling away your own happiness for i know you did love me lucyand destroy mine  i will begin with the worst thing i can think of  was it because i danced so much with fanny watervliet  miss galbraith indignantly  how can you insult me by supposing that i could be jealous of such a perfect little goose as that  no allen  whatever i think of you i still respect you too much for that  mr richards  im glad to hear that there are yet depths to which you think me incapable of descending and that miss watervliet is one of them  i will now take a little higher ground  perhaps you think i flirted with mrs dawes  i thought myself that the thing might begin to have that appearance but i give you my word of honor that as soon as the idea occurred to me i dropped herrather rudely too  the trouble was dont you know that i felt so perfectly safe with a married friend of yours  i couldnt be hanging about you all the time and i was afraid i might vex you if i went with the other girls and i didnt know what to do  miss galbraith  i think you behaved rather silly giggling so much with her  but   mr richards  i own it i know it was silly  but   miss galbraith  it wasnt that it wasnt that  mr richards  was it my forgetting to bring you those things from your mother  miss galbraith  no  mr richards  was it because i hadnt given up smoking yet  miss galbraith  you know i never asked you to give up smoking  it was entirely your own proposition  mr richards  thats true  thats what made me so easy about it i knew i could leave it off any time  well i will not disturb you any longer miss galbraith  he throws his overcoat across his arm and takes up his travellingbag  i have failed to guess your fatal conundrum and i have no longer any excuse for remaining  i am going into the smokingcar  shall i send the porter to you for anything  miss galbraith  no thanks  she puts up her handkerchief to her face  mr richards  lucy do you send me away  miss galbraith behind her handkerchief  you were going yourself  mr richards over his shoulder  shall i come back  miss galbraith  i have no right to drive you from the car  mr richards coming back and sitting down in the chair nearest her lucy dearest tell me whats the matter  miss galbraith  o allen your not knowing makes it all the more hopeless and killing  it shows me that we must part that you would go on breaking my heart and grinding me into the dust as long as we lived  she sobs  it shows me that you never understood me and you never will  i know youre good and kind and all that but that only makes your not understanding me so much the worse  i do it quite as much for your sake as my own allen  mr richards  id much rather you wouldnt put yourself out on my account  miss galbraith without regarding him  if you could mortify me before a whole roomful of people as you did last night what could i expect after marriage but continual insult  mr richards in amazement  how did i mortify you  i thought that i treated you with all the tenderness and affection that a decent regard for the feelings of others would allow  i was ashamed to find i couldnt keep away from you  miss galbraith  oh you were attentive enough allen nobody denies that  attentive enough in nonessentials  oh yes  mr richards  well what vital matters did i fail in  im sure i cant remember  miss galbraith  i dare say  i dare say they wont appear vital to you allen  nothing does  and if i had told you i should have been met with ridicule i suppose  but i knew better than to tell i respected myself too much  mr richards  but now you mustnt respect yourself quite so much dearest  and i promise you i wont laugh at the most serious thing im in no humor for it  if it were a matter of life and death even i can assure you that it wouldnt bring a smile to my countenance no indeed  if you expect me to laugh now you must say something particularly funny  miss galbraith  i was not going to say anything funny as you call it and i will say nothing at all if you talk in that way  mr richards  well i wont then  but do you know what i suspect lucy  i wouldnt mention it to everybody but i will to youin strict confidence  i suspect that youre rather ashamed of your grievance if you have any  i suspect its nothing at all  miss galbraith very sternly at first with a rising hysterical inflection  nothing allen  do you call it nothing to have mrs dawes come out with all that about your accident on your way up the river and ask me if it didnt frighten me terribly to hear of it even after it was all over and i had to say you hadnt told me a word of it  why lucyangrily mimicking mrs dawes you must teach him better than that  i make mr dawes tell me everything little simpleton  and then to have them all laughoh dear its too much  mr richards  why my dear lucy   miss galbraith interrupting him  i saw just how it was going to be and im thankful thankful that it happened  i saw that you didnt care enough for me to take me into your whole life that you despised and distrusted me and that it would get worse and worse to the end of our days that we should grow farther and farther apart and i should be left moping at home while you ran about making confidantes of other women whom you considered worthy of your confidence  it all flashed upon me in an instant and i resolved to break with you then and there and i did just as soon as ever i could go to my room for your things and im gladyesoh hu hu hu hu huso glad i did it  mr richards grimly  your joy is obvious  may i ask   miss galbraith  oh it wasnt the first proof you had given me how little you really cared for me but i was determined it should be the last  i dare say youve forgotten them  i dare say you dont remember telling mamie morris that you didnt like embroidered cigar cases when youd just told me that you did and let me be such a fool as to commence one for you but im thankful to say that went into the fireoh yes instantly  and i dare say youve forgotten that you didnt tell me your brothers engagement was to be kept and let me come out with it that night at the rudges and then looked perfectly aghast so that everybody thought i had been blabbing time and again allen you have made me suffer agonies yes agonies but your power to do so is at an end  i am free and happy at last she weeps bitterly  mr richards quietly  yes i had forgotten those crimes and i suppose many similar atrocities  i own it i am forgetful and careless  i was wrong about those things  i ought to have told you why i said that to miss morris  i was afraid she was going to work me one  as to that accident i told mrs dawes of it wasnt worth mentioning  our boat simply walked over a sloop in the night and nobody was hurt  i shouldnt have thought twice about it if she hadnt happened to brag of their passing close to an iceberg on their way home from europe then i trotted out my prettynear disaster as a match for hersconfound her  i wish the iceberg had sunk them only it wouldnt have sunk hershes so light shed have gone bobbing about all over the atlantic ocean like a cork shes got a perfect lifepreserver in that mind of hers  miss galbraith gives a little laugh and then a little moan  but since you are happy i will not repine miss galbraith  i dont pretend to be very happy myself but then i dont deserve it  since you are ready to let an absolutely unconscious offence on my part cancel all the past since you let my devoted love weigh as nothing against the momentary pique that a malicious little rattlepateshe was vexed at my leaving her could make you feel and choose to gratify a wicked resentment at the cost of any suffering to me why i can be glad and happy too with rising anger yes miss galbraith  all is over between us you can go  i renounce you  miss galbraith springing fiercely to her feet  go indeed renounce me  be so good as to remember that you havent got me to renounce  mr richards  well its all the same thing  id renounce you if i had  goodevening miss galbraith  i will send back your presents as soon as i get to town it wont be necessary to acknowledge them i hope we may never meet again  he goes out of the door towards the front of the ear but returns directly and glances uneasily at miss galbraith who remains with her handkerchief pressed to her eyes ahathat isi shall be obliged to intrude upon you again  the fact is   miss galbraith anxiously  why the cars have stopped  are we at schenectady  mr richards  well no not exactly not stopped exactly at schenectady   miss galbraith  then what station is this  have they carried me by  observing his embarrassment allen what is the matter  what has happened  tell me instantly  are we off the track  have we run into another train  have we broken through a bridge  shall we be burnt alive  tell me allen tell mei can bear itare we telescoped  she wrings her hands in terror  mr richards unsympathetically  nothing of the kind has happened this car has simply come uncoupled and the rest of the train has gone on ahead and left us standing on the track nowhere in particular  he leans back in his chair and wheels it round from her  miss galbraith mortified yet anxious  well  mr richards  well until they miss us and run back to pick us up i shall be obliged to ask your indulgence  i will try not to disturb you i would go out and stand on the platform but its raining  miss galbraith listening to the rainfall on the roof  why so it is  timidly did you notice when the car stopped  mr richards  no  he rises and goes out at the rear door comes back and sits down again  miss galbraith rises and goes to the large mirror to wipe away her tears  she glances at mr richards who does not move  she sits down in a seat nearer him than the chair she has left  after some faint murmurs and hesitations she asks will you please tell me why you went out just now  mr richards with indifference  yes  i went to see if the rear signal was out  miss galbraith after another hesitation  why  mr richards  because if it wasnt out some train might run into us from that direction  miss galbraith tremulously  oh  and was it  mr richards dryly  yes  miss galbraith returns to her former place with a wounded air and for a moment neither speaks  finally she asks very meekly and theres no danger from the front  mr richards coldly  no  miss galbraith after some little noises and movements meant to catch mr richardss attention  of course i never meant to imply that you were intentionally careless or forgetful  mr richards still very coldly  thank you  miss galbraith  i always did justice to your goodheartedness allen youre perfectly lovely that way and i know that you would be sorry if you knew you had wounded my feelings however accidentally she droops her head so as to catch a sidelong glimpse of his face and sighs while she nervously pinches the top of her parasol resting the point on the floor  mr richards makes no answer  that about the cigarcase might have been a mistake i saw that myself and as you explain it why it was certainly very kind and very creditable toto your thoughtfulness  it was thoughtful  mr richards  i am grateful for your good opinion  miss galbraith  but do you think it was exactlyit was quite nice not to tell me that your brothers engagement was to be kept when you know allen i cant bear to blunder in such things tenderly do you  you cant say it was  mr richards  i never said it was  miss galbraith plaintively  no allen  thats what i always admired in your character  you always owned up  dont you think its easier for men to own up than it is for women  mr richards  i dont know  i never knew any woman to do it  miss galbraith  oh yes allen  you know i often own up  mr richards  no i dont  miss galbraith  oh how can you bear to say so  when im rash or anything of that kind you know i acknowledge it  mr richards  do you acknowledge it now  miss galbraith  why how can i when i havent been rash  what have i been rash   mr richards  about the cigarcase for example  miss galbraith  oh that  that was a great while ago  i thought you meant something quite recent  a sound as of the approaching tram is heard in the distance  she gives a start and then leaves her chair again for one a little nearer his  i thought perhaps you meant aboutlast night  mr richards  well  miss galbraith very judicially  i dont think it was rash exactly  no not rash  it might not have been very kind not toto trust you more when i knew that you didnt mean anything butno i took the only course i could  nobody could have done differently under the circumstances  but if i caused you any pain im very sorry oh yes very sorry indeed  but i was not precipitate and i know i did right  at least i tried to act for the best  dont you believe i did  mr richards  why if you have no doubt upon the subject my opinion is of no consequence  miss galbraith  yes  but what do you think  if you think differently and can make me see it differently oughtnt you to do so  mr richards  i dont see why  as you say all is over between us  miss galbraith  yes  after a pause i should suppose you would care enough for yourself to wish me to look at the matter from the right point of view  mr richards  i dont  miss galbraith becoming more and more uneasy as the noise of the approaching train grows louder  i think you have been very quick with me at times quite as quick as i could have been with you last night  the noise is more distinctly heard  im sure that if i could once see it as you do no one would be more willing to do anything in their power to atone for their rashness  of course i know that everything is over  mr richards  as to that i have your word and in view of the fact perhaps this analysis of motive of character however interesting on general grounds is a little   miss galbraith with sudden violence  say it and take your revenge  i have put myself at your feet and you do right to trample on me  oh this is what women may expect when they trust to mens generosity  well it is over now and im thankful thankful cruel suspicious vindictive youre all alike and im glad that im no longer subject to your heartless caprices  and i dont care what happens after this i shall alwaysoh  youre sure its from the front allen  are you sure the rear signal is out  mr richards relenting  yes but if it will ease your mind ill go and look again  he rises and starts towards the rear door  miss galbraith quickly  oh no  dont go  i cant bear to be left alone  the sound of the approaching train continually increases in volume  oh isnt it coming very very very fast  mr richards  no no  dont be frightened  miss galbraith running towards the rear door  oh i must get out it will kill me i know it will  come with me  do do  he runs after her and her voice is heard at the rear of the car  oh the outside door is locked and we are trapped trapped trapped  oh quick  lets try the door at the other end  they reenter the parlor and the roar of the train announces that it is upon them no no  its too late its too late  im a wicked wicked girl and this is all to punish me  oh its coming its coming at full speed  he remains bewildered confronting her  she utters a wild cry and as the train strikes the car with a violent concussion she flings herself into his arms  there there  forgive me allen let us die together my own own love  she hangs fainting on his breast  voices are heard without and after a little delay the porter comes in with a lantern  porter  rather more of a jah than we meant to give you sah  we had to run down pretty quick after we missed you and the rain made the track a little slippery  lady much frightened  miss galbraith disengaging herself  oh not at all  not in the least  we thought it was a train coming from behind and going to run into us and sowei   porter  not quite so bad as that  well be into schenectady in a few minutes miss  ill come for your things  he goes out at the other door  miss galbraith in a fearful whisper  allen  what will he ever think of us  im sure he saw us  mr richards  i dont know what hell think now  he did think you were frightened but you told him you were not  however it isnt important what he thinks  probably he thinks im your longlost brother  it had a kind of family look  miss galbraith  ridiculous  mr richards  why hed never suppose that i was a jilted lover of yours  miss galbraith ruefully  no  mr richards  come lucytaking her handyou wished to die with me a moment ago  dont you think you can make one more effort to live with me  i wont take advantage of words spoken in mortal peril but i suppose you were in earnest when you called me your own ownher head droops he folds her in his arms a moment then she starts away from him as if something had suddenly occurred to her  miss galbraith  allen where are you going  mr richards  going  upon my soul i havent the least idea  miss galbraith  where were you going  mr richards  oh i was going to albany  miss galbraith  well dont  aunt mary is expecting me here at schenectadyi telegraphed herand i want you to stop here too and well refer the whole matter to her  shes such a wise old head im not sure   mr richards  what  miss galbraith demurely  that im good enough for you  mr richards starting in burlesque of her movement as if a thought had struck him  lucy how came you on this train when you left syracuse on the morning express  miss galbraith faintly  i waited over a train at utica  she sinks into a chair and averts her face  mr richards  may i ask why  miss galbraith more faintly still  i dont like to tell  i   mr richards coming and standing in front of her with his hands in his pockets  look me in the eye lucy  she drops her veil over her face and looks up at him  did youdid you expect to find me on this train  miss galbraith  i was afraid it never would get

indifferent that they pretend to be asleep when the young ladies come in  they pause at the door and look back again  and must i leave thee paradise they both kiss their hands to the car again and
