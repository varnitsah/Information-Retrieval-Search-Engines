kidnapped   the entire affair is shrouded in mystery said darnot  i have it on the best of authority that neither the police nor the special agents of the general staff have the faintest conception of how it was accomplished  all they know all that anyone knows is that nikolas rokoff has escaped  john clayton lord greystokehe who had been tarzan of the apessat in silence in the apartments of his friend lieutenant paul darnot in paris gazing meditatively at the toe of his immaculate boot  his mind revolved many memories recalled by the escape of his archenemy from the french military prison to which he had been sentenced for life upon the testimony of the apeman  he thought of the lengths to which rokoff had once gone to compass his death and he realized that what the man had already done would doubtless be as nothing by comparison with what he would wish and plot to do now that he was again free  tarzan had recently brought his wife and infant son to london to escape the discomforts and dangers of the rainy season upon their vast estate in uzirithe land of the savage waziri warriors whose broad african domains the apeman had once ruled  he had run across the channel for a brief visit with his old friend but the news of the russians escape had already cast a shadow upon his outing so that though he had but just arrived he was already contemplating an immediate return to london  it is not that i fear for myself paul he said at last   many times in the past have i thwarted rokoffs designs upon my life but now there are others to consider  unless i misjudge the man he would more quickly strike at me through my wife or son than directly at me for he doubtless realizes that in no other way could he inflict greater anguish upon me  i must go back to them at once and remain with them until rokoff is recapturedor dead  as these two talked in paris two other men were talking together in a little cottage upon the outskirts of london   both were dark sinisterlooking men  one was bearded but the other whose face wore the pallor of long confinement within doors had but a few days growth of black beard upon his face  it was he who was speaking  you must needs shave off that beard of yours alexis he said to his companion  with it he would recognize you on the instant  we must separate here in the hour and when we meet again upon the deck of the kincaid let us hope that we shall have with us two honoured guests who little anticipate the pleasant voyage we have planned for them  in two hours i should be upon my way to dover with one of them and by tomorrow night if you follow my instructions carefully you should arrive with the other provided of course that he returns to london as quickly as i presume he will  there should be both profit and pleasure as well as other good things to reward our efforts my dear alexis  thanks to the stupidity of the french they have gone to such lengths to conceal the fact of my escape for these many days that i have had ample opportunity to work out every detail of our little adventure so carefully that there is little chance of the slightest hitch occurring to mar our prospects  and now goodbye and good luck  three hours later a messenger mounted the steps to the apartment of lieutenant darnot  a telegram for lord greystoke he said to the servant who answered his summons  is he here  the man answered in the affirmative and signing for the message carried it within to tarzan who was already preparing to depart for london  tarzan tore open the envelope and as he read his face went white  read it paul he said handing the slip of paper to darnot  it has come already  the frenchman took the telegram and read  jack stolen from the garden through complicity of new servant  come at oncejane   as tarzan leaped from the roadster that had met him at the station and ran up the steps to his london town house he was met at the door by a dryeyed but almost frantic woman  quickly jane porter clayton narrated all that she had been able to learn of the theft of the boy  the babys nurse had been wheeling him in the sunshine on the walk before the house when a closed taxicab drew up at the corner of the street  the woman had paid but passing attention to the vehicle merely noting that it discharged no passenger but stood at the kerb with the motor running as though waiting for a fare from the residence before which it had stopped  almost immediately the new houseman carl had come running from the greystoke house saying that the girls mistress wished to speak with her for a moment and that she was to leave little jack in his care until she returned  the woman said that she entertained not the slightest suspicion of the mans motives until she had reached the doorway of the house when it occurred to her to warn him not to turn the carriage so as to permit the sun to shine in the babys eyes  as she turned about to call this to him she was somewhat surprised to see that he was wheeling the carriage rapidly toward the corner and at the same time she saw the door of the taxicab open and a swarthy face framed for a moment in the aperture  intuitively the danger to the child flashed upon her and with a shriek she dashed down the steps and up the walk toward the taxicab into which carl was now handing the baby to the swarthy one within  just before she reached the vehicle carl leaped in beside his confederate slamming the door behind him  at the same time the chauffeur attempted to start his machine but it was evident that something had gone wrong as though the gears refused to mesh and the delay caused by this while he pushed the lever into reverse and backed the car a few inches before again attempting to go ahead gave the nurse time to reach the side of the taxicab  leaping to the runningboard she had attempted to snatch the baby from the arms of the stranger and here screaming and fighting she had clung to her position even after the taxicab had got under way nor was it until the machine had passed the greystoke residence at good speed that carl with a heavy blow to her face had succeeded in knocking her to the pavement  her screams had attracted servants and members of the families from residences near by as well as from the greystoke home  lady greystoke had witnessed the girls brave battle and had herself tried to reach the rapidly passing vehicle but had been too late  that was all that anyone knew nor did lady greystoke dream of the possible identity of the man at the bottom of the plot until her husband told her of the escape of nikolas rokoff from the french prison where they had hoped he was permanently confined  as tarzan and his wife stood planning the wisest course to pursue the telephone bell rang in the library at their right  tarzan quickly answered the call in person  lord greystoke asked a mans voice at the other end of the line  yes  your son has been stolen continued the voice and i alone may help you to recover him  i am conversant with the plot of those who took him  in fact i was a party to it and was to share in the reward but now they are trying to ditch me and to be quits with them i will aid you to recover him on condition that you will not prosecute me for my part in the crime  what do you say  if you lead me to where my son is hidden replied the apeman you need fear nothing from me  good replied the other  but you must come alone to meet me for it is enough that i must trust you  i cannot take the chance of permitting others to learn my identity  where and when may i meet you asked tarzan  the other gave the name and location of a publichouse on the waterfront at dovera place frequented by sailors  come he concluded about ten oclock tonight  it would do no good to arrive earlier  your son will be safe enough in the meantime and i can then lead you secretly to where he is hidden  but be sure to come alone and under no circumstances notify scotland yard for i know you well and shall be watching for you  should any other accompany you or should i see suspicious characters who might be agents of the police i shall not meet you and your last chance of recovering your son will be gone  without more words the man rang off  tarzan repeated the gist of the conversation to his wife   she begged to be allowed to accompany him but he insisted that it might result in the mans carrying out his threat of refusing to aid them if tarzan did not come alone and so they parted he to hasten to dover and she ostensibly to wait at home until he should notify her of the outcome of his mission  little did either dream of what both were destined to pass through before they should meet again or the fardistantbut why anticipate  for ten minutes after the apeman had left her jane clayton walked restlessly back and forth across the silken rugs of the library  her mother heart ached bereft of its firstborn  her mind was in an anguish of hopes and fears  though her judgment told her that all would be well were her tarzan to go alone in accordance with the mysterious strangers summons her intuition would not permit her to lay aside suspicion of the gravest dangers to both her husband and her son  the more she thought of the matter the more convinced she became that the recent telephone message might be but a ruse to keep them inactive until the boy was safely hidden away or spirited out of england  or it might be that it had been simply a bait to lure tarzan into the hands of the implacable rokoff  with the lodgment of this thought she stopped in wideeyed terror instantly it became a conviction  she glanced at the great clock ticking the minutes in the corner of the library  it was too late to catch the dover train that tarzan was to take there was another later however that would bring her to the channel port in time to reach the address the stranger had given her husband before the appointed hour  summoning her maid and chauffeur she issued instructions rapidly  ten minutes later she was being whisked through the crowded streets toward the railway station  it was ninefortyfive that night that tarzan entered the squalid pub on the waterfront in dover  as he passed into the evilsmelling room a muffled figure brushed past him toward the street  come my lord whispered the stranger  the apeman wheeled about and followed the other into the illlit alley which custom had dignified with the title of thoroughfare  once outside the fellow led the way into the darkness nearer a wharf where highpiled bales boxes and casks cast dense shadows  here he halted  where is the boy asked greystoke  on that small steamer whose lights you can just see yonder replied the other  in the gloom tarzan was trying to peer into the features of his companion but he did not recognize the man as one whom he had ever before seen  had he guessed that his guide was alexis paulvitch he would have realized that naught but treachery lay in the mans heart and that danger lurked in the path of every move  he is unguarded now continued the russian  those who took him feel perfectly safe from detection and with the exception of a couple of members of the crew whom i have furnished with enough gin to silence them effectually for hours there is none aboard the kincaid  we can go aboard get the child and return without the slightest fear  tarzan nodded  lets be about it then he said  his guide led him to a small boat moored alongside the wharf   the two men entered and paulvitch pulled rapidly toward the steamer  the black smoke issuing from her funnel did not at the time make any suggestion to tarzans mind  all his thoughts were occupied with the hope that in a few moments he would again have his little son in his arms  at the steamers side they found a monkeyladder dangling close above them and up this the two men crept stealthily   once on deck they hastened aft to where the russian pointed to a hatch  the boy is hidden there he said  you had better go down after him as there is less chance that he will cry in fright than should he find himself in the arms of a stranger   i will stand on guard here  so anxious was tarzan to rescue the child that he gave not the slightest thought to the strangeness of all the conditions surrounding the kincaid  that her deck was deserted though she had steam up and from the volume of smoke pouring from her funnel was all ready to get under way made no impression upon him  with the thought that in another instant he would fold that precious little bundle of humanity in his arms the apeman swung down into the darkness below  scarcely had he released his hold upon the edge of the hatch than the heavy covering fell clattering above him  instantly he knew that he was the victim of a plot and that far from rescuing his son he had himself fallen into the hands of his enemies though he immediately endeavoured to reach the hatch and lift the cover he was unable to do so  striking a match he explored his surroundings finding that a little compartment had been partitioned off from the main hold with the hatch above his head the only means of ingress or egress  it was evident that the room had been prepared for the very purpose of serving as a cell for himself  there was nothing in the compartment and no other occupant   if the child was on board the kincaid he was confined elsewhere  for over twenty years from infancy to manhood the apeman had roamed his savage jungle haunts without human companionship of any nature  he had learned at the most impressionable period of his life to take his pleasures and his sorrows as the beasts take theirs  so it was that he neither raved nor stormed against fate but instead waited patiently for what might next befall him though not by any means without an eye to doing the utmost to succour himself  to this end he examined his prison carefully tested the heavy planking that formed its walls and measured the distance of the hatch above him  and while he was thus occupied there came suddenly to him the vibration of machinery and the throbbing of the propeller  the ship was moving  where to and to what fate was it carrying him  and even as these thoughts passed through his mind there came to his ears above the din of the engines that which caused him to go cold with apprehension  clear and shrill from the deck above him rang the scream of a frightened woman     chapter 2  marooned   as tarzan and his guide had disappeared into the shadows upon the dark wharf the figure of a heavily veiled woman had hurried down the narrow alley to the entrance of the drinkingplace the two men had just quitted  here she paused and looked about and then as though satisfied that she had at last reached the place she sought she pushed bravely into the interior of the vile den  a score of halfdrunken sailors and wharfrats looked up at the unaccustomed sight of a richly gowned woman in their midst   rapidly she approached the slovenly barmaid who stared half in envy half in hate at her more fortunate sister  have you seen a tall welldressed man here but a minute since she asked who met another and went away with him  the girl answered in the affirmative but could not tell which way the two had gone  a sailor who had approached to listen to the conversation vouchsafed the information that a moment before as he had been about to enter the pub he had seen two men leaving it who walked toward the wharf  show me the direction they went cried the woman slipping a coin into the mans hand  the fellow led her from the place and together they walked quickly toward the wharf and along it until across the water they saw a small boat just pulling into the shadows of a nearby steamer  there they be whispered the man  ten pounds if you will find a boat and row me to that steamer cried the woman  quick then he replied for we gotta go it if were goin to catch the kincaid afore she sails  shes had steam up for three hours an jest been awaitin fer that one passenger   i was atalkin to one of her crew arf an hour ago  as he spoke he led the way to the end of the wharf where he knew another boat lay moored and lowering the woman into it he jumped in after and pushed off  the two were soon scudding over the water  at the steamers side the man demanded his pay and without waiting to count out the exact amount the woman thrust a handful of banknotes into his outstretched hand  a single glance at them convinced the fellow that he had been more than well paid  then he assisted her up the ladder holding his skiff close to the ships side against the chance that this profitable passenger might wish to be taken ashore later  but presently the sound of the donkey engine and the rattle of a steel cable on the hoistingdrum proclaimed the fact that the kincaids anchor was being raised and a moment later the waiter heard the propellers revolving and slowly the little steamer moved away from him out into the channel  as he turned to row back to shore he heard a womans shriek from the ships deck  thats wot i calls rotten luck he soliloquized  i might jest as well of ad the whole bloomin wad   when jane clayton climbed to the deck of the kincaid she found the ship apparently deserted  there was no sign of those she sought nor of any other aboard and so she went about her search for her husband and the child she hoped against hope to find there without interruption  quickly she hastened to the cabin which was half above and half below deck  as she hurried down the short companionladder into the main cabin on either side of which were the smaller rooms occupied by the officers she failed to note the quick closing of one of the doors before her  she passed the full length of the main room and then retracing her steps stopped before each door to listen furtively trying each latch  all was silence utter silence there in which the throbbing of her own frightened heart seemed to her overwrought imagination to fill the ship with its thunderous alarm  one by one the doors opened before her touch only to reveal empty interiors  in her absorption she did not note the sudden activity upon the vessel the purring of the engines the throbbing of the propeller she had reached the last door upon the right now and as she pushed it open she was seized from within by a powerful darkvisaged man and drawn hastily into the stuffy illsmelling interior  the sudden shock of fright which the unexpected attack had upon her drew a single piercing scream from her throat then the man clapped a hand roughly over the mouth  not until we are farther from land my dear he said   then you may yell your pretty head off  lady greystoke turned to look into the leering bearded face so close to hers  the man relaxed the pressure of his fingers upon her lips and with a little moan of terror as she recognized him the girl shrank away from her captor  nikolas rokoff  m  thuran she exclaimed  your devoted admirer replied the russian with a low bow  my little boy she said next ignoring the terms of endearmentwhere is he  let me have him  how could you be so crueleven as younikolas rokoffcannot be entirely devoid of mercy and compassion  tell me where he is  is he aboard this ship  oh please if such a thing as a heart beats within your breast take me to my baby  if you do as you are bid no harm will befall him replied rokoff but remember that it is your own fault that you are here   you came aboard voluntarily and you may take the consequences   i little thought he added to himself that any such good luck as this would come to me  he went on deck then locking the cabindoor upon his prisoner and for several days she did not see him  the truth of the matter being that nikolas rokoff was so poor a sailor that the heavy seas the kincaid encountered from the very beginning of her voyage sent the russian to his berth with a bad attack of seasickness  during this time her only visitor was an uncouth swede the kincaids unsavoury cook who brought her meals to her   his name was sven anderssen his one pride being that his patronymic was spelt with a double s  the man was tall and rawboned with a long yellow moustache an unwholesome complexion and filthy nails   the very sight of him with one grimy thumb buried deep in the lukewarm stew that seemed from the frequency of its repetition to constitute the pride of his culinary art was sufficient to take away the girls appetite  his small blue closeset eyes never met hers squarely   there was a shiftiness of his whole appearance that even found expression in the catlike manner of his gait and to it all a sinister suggestion was added by the long slim knife that always rested at his waist slipped through the greasy cord that supported his soiled apron  ostensibly it was but an implement of his calling but the girl could never free herself of the conviction that it would require less provocation to witness it put to other and less harmless uses  his manner toward her was surly yet she never failed to meet him with a pleasant smile and a word of thanks when he brought her food to her though more often than not she hurled the bulk of it through the tiny cabin port the moment that the door closed behind him  during the days of anguish that followed jane claytons imprisonment but two questions were uppermost in her mindthe whereabouts of her husband and her son  she fully believed that the baby was aboard the kincaid provided that he still lived but whether tarzan had been permitted to live after having been lured aboard the evil craft she could not guess  she knew of course the deep hatred that the russian felt for the englishman and she could think of but one reason for having him brought aboard the shipto dispatch him in comparative safety in revenge for his having thwarted rokoffs pet schemes and for having been at last the means of landing him in a french prison   tarzan on his part lay in the darkness of his cell ignorant of the fact that his wife was a prisoner in the cabin almost above his head  the same swede that served jane brought his meals to him but though on several occasions tarzan had tried to draw the man into conversation he had been unsuccessful   he had hoped to learn through this fellow whether his little son was aboard the kincaid but to every question upon this or kindred subjects the fellow returned but one reply ay tank it blow purty soon purty hard so after several attempts tarzan gave it up  for weeks that seemed months to the two prisoners the little steamer forged on they knew not where  once the kincaid stopped to coal only immediately to take up the seemingly interminable voyage  rokoff had visited jane clayton but once since he had locked her in the tiny cabin  he had come gaunt and holloweyed from a long siege of seasickness  the object of his visit was to obtain from her her personal cheque for a large sum in return for a guarantee of her personal safety and return to england  when you set me down safely in any civilized port together with my son and my husband she replied i will pay you in gold twice the amount you ask but until then you shall not have a cent nor the promise of a cent under any other conditions  you will give me the cheque i ask he replied with a snarl or neither you nor your child nor your husband will ever again set foot within any port civilized or otherwise  i would not trust you she replied  what guarantee have i that you would not take my money and then do as you pleased with me and mine regardless of your promise  i think you will do as i bid he said turning to leave the cabin remember that i have your sonif you chance to hear the agonized wail of a tortured child it may console you to reflect that it is because of your stubbornness that the baby suffersand that it is your baby  you would not do it cried the girl  you would notcould not be so fiendishly cruel  it is not i that am cruel but you he returned for you permit a paltry sum of money to stand between your baby and immunity from suffering  the end of it was that jane clayton wrote out a cheque of large denomination and handed it to nikolas rokoff who left her cabin with a grin of satisfaction upon his lips  the following day the hatch was removed from tarzans cell and as he looked up he saw paulvitchs head framed in the square of light above him  come up commanded the russian  but bear in mind that you will be shot if you make a single move to attack me or any other aboard the ship  the apeman swung himself lightly to the deck  about him but at a respectful distance stood a halfdozen sailors armed with rifles and revolvers  facing him was paulvitch  tarzan looked about for rokoff who he felt sure must be aboard but there was no sign of him  lord greystoke commenced the russian by your continued and wanton interference with m  rokoff and his plans you have at last brought yourself and your family to this unfortunate extremity  you have only yourself to thank   as you may imagine it has cost m  rokoff a large amount of money to finance this expedition and as you are the sole cause of it he naturally looks to you for reimbursement  further i may say that only by meeting m  rokoffs just demands may you avert the most unpleasant consequences to your wife and child and at the same time retain your own life and regain your liberty  what is the amount asked tarzan  and what assurance have i that you will live up to your end of the agreement  i have little reason to trust two such scoundrels as you and rokoff you know  the russian flushed  you are in no position to deliver insults he said   you have no assurance that we will live up to our agreement other than my word but you have before you the assurance that we can make short work of you if you do not write out the cheque we demand  unless you are a greater fool than i imagine you should know that there is nothing that would give us greater pleasure than to order these men to fire  that we do not is because we have other plans for punishing you that would be entirely upset by your death  answer one question said tarzan  is my son on board this ship  no replied alexis paulvitch your son is quite safe elsewhere nor will he be killed until you refuse to accede to our fair demands  if it becomes necessary to kill you there will be no reason for not killing the child since with you gone the one whom we wish to punish through the boy will be gone and he will then be to us only a constant source of danger and embarrassment  you see therefore that you may only save the life of your son by saving your own and you can only save your own by giving us the cheque we ask  very well replied tarzan for he knew that he could trust them to carry out any sinister threat that paulvitch had made and there was a bare chance that by conceding their demands he might save the boy  that they would permit him to live after he had appended his name to the cheque never occurred to him as being within the realms of probability  but he was determined to give them such a battle as they would never forget and possibly to take paulvitch with him into eternity  he was only sorry that it was not rokoff  he took his pocket chequebook and fountainpen from his pocket  what is the amount he asked  paulvitch named an enormous sum  tarzan could scarce restrain a smile  their very cupidity was to prove the means of their undoing in the matter of the ransom at least  purposely he hesitated and haggled over the amount but paulvitch was obdurate   finally the apeman wrote out his cheque for a larger sum than stood to his credit at the bank  as he turned to hand the worthless slip of paper to the russian his glance chanced to pass across the starboard bow of the kincaid  to his surprise he saw that the ship lay within a few hundred yards of land almost down to the waters edge ran a dense tropical jungle and behind was higher land clothed in forest  paulvitch noted the direction of his gaze  you are to be set at liberty here he said  tarzans plan for immediate physical revenge upon the russian vanished he thought the land before him the mainland of africa and he knew that should they liberate him here he could doubtless find his way to civilization with comparative ease  paulvitch took the cheque  remove your clothing he said to the apeman  here you will not need it  tarzan demurred  paulvitch pointed to the armed sailors  then the englishman slowly divested himself of his clothing  a boat was lowered and still heavily guarded the apeman was rowed ashore  half an hour later the sailors had returned to the kincaid and the steamer was slowly getting under way  as tarzan stood upon the narrow strip of beach watching the departure of the vessel he saw a figure appear at the rail and call aloud to attract his attention  the apeman had been about to read a note that one of the sailors had handed him as the small boat that bore him to the shore was on the point of returning to the steamer but at the hail from the vessels deck he looked up  he saw a blackbearded man who laughed at him in derision as he held high above his head the figure of a little child   tarzan half started as though to rush through the surf and strike out for the already moving steamer but realizing the futility of so rash an act he halted at the waters edge  thus he stood his gaze riveted upon the kincaid until it disappeared beyond a projecting promontory of the coast  from the jungle at his back fierce bloodshot eyes glared from beneath shaggy overhanging brows upon him  little monkeys in the treetops chattered and scolded and from the distance of the inland forest came the scream of a leopard  but still john clayton lord greystoke stood deaf and unseeing suffering the pangs of keen regret for the opportunity that he had wasted because he had been so gullible as to place credence in a single statement of the first lieutenant of his archenemy  i have at least he thought one consolationthe knowledge that jane is safe in london  thank heaven she too did not fall into the clutches of those villains  behind him the hairy thing whose evil eyes had been watching him as a cat watches a mouse was creeping stealthily toward him  where were the trained senses of the savage apeman  where the acute hearing  where the uncanny sense of scent     chapter 3  beasts at bay   slowly tarzan unfolded the note the sailor had thrust into his hand and read it  at first it made little impression on his sorrownumbed senses but finally the full purport of the hideous plot of revenge unfolded itself before his imagination  this will explain to you the note read the exact nature of my intentions relative to your offspring and to you  you were born an ape  you lived naked in the junglesto your own we have returned you but your son shall rise a step above his sire  it is the immutable law of evolution  the father was a beast but the son shall be a manhe shall take the next ascending step in the scale of progress   he shall be no naked beast of the jungle but shall wear a loincloth and copper anklets and perchance a ring in his nose for he is to be reared by mena tribe of savage cannibals  i might have killed you but that would have curtailed the full measure of the punishment you have earned at my hands  dead you could not have suffered in the knowledge of your sons plight but living and in a place from which you may not escape to seek or succour your child you shall suffer worse than death for all the years of your life in contemplation of the horrors of your sons existence  this then is to be a part of your punishment for having dared to pit yourself against  n r  psthe balance of your punishment has to do with what shall presently befall your wifethat i shall leave to your imagination   as he finished reading a slight sound behind him brought him back with a start to the world of present realities  instantly his senses awoke and he was again tarzan of the apes  as he wheeled about it was a beast at bay vibrant with the instinct of selfpreservation that faced a huge bullape that was already charging down upon him  the two years that had elapsed since tarzan had come out of the savage forest with his rescued mate had witnessed slight diminution of the mighty powers that had made him the invincible lord of the jungle  his great estates in uziri had claimed much of his time and attention and there he had found ample field for the practical use and retention of his almost superhuman powers but naked and unarmed to do battle with the shaggy bullnecked beast that now confronted him was a test that the apeman would scarce have welcomed at any period of his wild existence  but there was no alternative other than to meet the ragemaddened creature with the weapons with which nature had endowed him  over the bulls shoulder tarzan could see now the heads and shoulders of perhaps a dozen more of these mighty forerunners of primitive man  he knew however that there was little chance that they would attack him since it is not within the reasoning powers of the anthropoid to be able to weigh or appreciate the value of concentrated action against an enemyotherwise they would long since have become the dominant creatures of their haunts so tremendous a power of destruction lies in their mighty thews and savage fangs  with a low snarl the beast now hurled himself at tarzan but the apeman had found among other things in the haunts of civilized man certain methods of scientific warfare that are unknown to the jungle folk  whereas a few years since he would have met the brute rush with brute force he now sidestepped his antagonists headlong charge and as the brute hurtled past him swung a mighty right to the pit of the apes stomach  with a howl of mingled rage and anguish the great anthropoid bent double and sank to the ground though almost instantly he was again struggling to his feet  before he could regain them however his whiteskinned foe had wheeled and pounced upon him and in the act there dropped from the shoulders of the english lord the last shred of his superficial mantle of civilization  once again he was the jungle beast revelling in bloody conflict with his kind  once again he was tarzan son of kala the sheape  his strong white teeth sank into the hairy throat of his enemy as he sought the pulsing jugular  powerful fingers held the mighty fangs from his own flesh or clenched and beat with the power of a steamhammer upon the snarling foamflecked face of his adversary  in a circle about them the balance of the tribe of apes stood watching and enjoying the struggle  they muttered low gutturals of approval as bits of white hide or hairy bloodstained skin were torn from one contestant or the other  but they were silent in amazement and expectation when they saw the mighty white ape wriggle upon the back of their king and with steel muscles tensed beneath the armpits of his antagonist bear down mightily with his open palms upon the back of the thick bullneck so that the king ape could but shriek in agony and flounder helplessly about upon the thick mat of jungle grass  as tarzan had overcome the huge terkoz that time years before when he had been about to set out upon his quest for human beings of his own kind and colour so now he overcame this other great ape with the same wrestling hold upon which he had stumbled by accident during that other combat   the little audience of fierce anthropoids heard the creaking of their kings neck mingling with his agonized shrieks and hideous roaring  then there came a sudden crack like the breaking of a stout limb before the fury of the wind  the bullethead crumpled forward upon its flaccid neck against the great hairy chestthe roaring and the shrieking ceased  the little pigeyes of the onlookers wandered from the still form of their leader to that of the white ape that was rising to its feet beside the vanquished then back to their king as though in wonder that he did not arise and slay this presumptuous stranger  they saw the newcomer place a foot upon the neck of the quiet figure at his feet and throwing back his head give vent to the wild uncanny challenge of the bullape that has made a kill  then they knew that their king was dead  across the jungle rolled the horrid notes of the victory cry  the little monkeys in the treetops ceased their chattering   the harshvoiced brilliantplumed birds were still  from afar came the answering wail of a leopard and the deep roar of a lion  it was the old tarzan who turned questioning eyes upon the little knot of apes before him  it was the old tarzan who shook his head as though to toss back a heavy mane that had fallen before his facean old habit dating from the days that his great shock of thick black hair had fallen about his shoulders and often tumbled before his eyes when it had meant life or death to him to have his vision unobstructed  the apeman knew that he might expect an immediate attack on the part of that particular surviving bullape who felt himself best fitted to contend for the kingship of the tribe   among his own apes he knew that it was not unusual for an entire stranger to enter a community and after having dispatched the king assume the leadership of the tribe himself together with the fallen monarchs mates  on the other hand if he made no attempt to follow them they might move slowly away from him later to fight among themselves for the supremacy  that he could be king of them if he so chose he was confident but he was not sure he cared to assume the sometimes irksome duties of that position for he could see no particular advantage to be gained thereby  one of the younger apes a huge splendidly muscled brute was edging threateningly closer to the apeman  through his bared fighting fangs there issued a low sullen growl  tarzan watched his every move standing rigid as a statue   to have fallen back a step would have been to precipitate an immediate charge to have rushed forward to meet the other might have had the same result or it might have put the bellicose one to flightit all depended upon the young bulls stock of courage  to stand perfectly still waiting was the middle course   in this event the bull would according to custom approach quite close to the object of his attention growling hideously and baring slavering fangs slowly he would circle about the other as though with a chip upon his shoulder and this he did even as tarzan had foreseen  it might be a bluff royal or on the other hand so unstable is the mind of an ape a passing impulse might hurl the hairy mass tearing and rending upon the man without an instants warning  as the brute circled him tarzan turned slowly keeping his eyes ever upon the eyes of his antagonist  he had appraised the young bull as one who had never quite felt equal to the task of overthrowing his former king but who one day would have done so  tarzan saw that the beast was of wondrous proportions standing over seven feet upon his short bowed legs  his great hairy arms reached almost to the ground even when he stood erect and his fighting fangs now quite close to tarzans face were exceptionally long and sharp  like the others of his tribe he differed in several minor essentials from the apes of tarzans boyhood  at first the apeman had experienced a thrill of hope at sight of the shaggy bodies of the anthropoidsa hope that by some strange freak of fate he had been again returned to his own tribe but a closer inspection had convinced him that these were another species  as the threatening bull continued his stiff and jerky circling of the apeman much after the manner that you have noted among dogs when a strange canine comes among them it occurred to tarzan to discover if the language of his own tribe was identical with that of this other family and so he addressed the brute in the language of the tribe of kerchak  who are you he asked who threatens tarzan of the apes  the hairy brute looked his surprise  i am akut replied the other in the same simple primal tongue which is so low in the scale of spoken languages that as tarzan had surmised it was identical with that of the tribe in which the first twenty years of his life had been spent  i am akut said the ape  molak is dead  i am king  go away or i shall kill you  you saw how easily i killed molak replied tarzan  so i could kill you if i cared to be king  but tarzan of the apes would not be king of the tribe of akut  all he wishes is to live in peace in this country let us be friends   tarzan of the apes can help you and you can help tarzan of the apes  you cannot kill akut replied the other  none is so great as akut had you not killed molak akut would have done so for akut was ready to be king  for answer the apeman hurled himself upon the great brute who during the conversation had slightly relaxed his vigilance  in the twinkling of an eye the man had seized the wrist of the great ape and before the other could grapple with him had whirled him about and leaped upon his broad back  down they went together but so well had tarzans plan worked out that before ever they touched the ground he had gained the same hold upon akut that had broken molaks neck  slowly he brought the pressure to bear and then as in days gone by he had given kerchak the chance to surrender and live so now he gave to akutin whom he saw a possible ally of great strength and resourcethe option of living in amity with him or dying as he had just seen his savage and heretofore invincible king die  kagoda whispered tarzan to the ape beneath him  it was the same question that he had whispered to kerchak and in the language of the apes it means broadly do you surrender  akut thought of the creaking sound he had heard just before molaks thick neck had snapped and he shuddered  he hated to give up the kingship though so again he struggled to free himself but a sudden torturing pressure upon his vertebra brought an agonized kagoda from his lips  tarzan relaxed his grip a trifle  you may still be king akut he said  tarzan told you that he did not wish to be king  if any question your right tarzan of the apes will help you in your battles  the apeman rose and akut came slowly to his feet   shaking his bullet head and growling angrily he waddled toward his tribe looking first at one and then at another of the larger bulls who might be expected to challenge his leadership  but none did so instead they drew away as he approached and presently the whole pack moved off into the jungle and tarzan was left alone once more upon the beach  the apeman was sore from the wounds that molak had inflicted upon him but he was inured to physical suffering and endured it with the calm and fortitude of the wild beasts that had taught him to lead the jungle life after the manner of all those that are born to it  his first need he realized was for weapons of offence and defence for his encounter with the apes and the distant notes of the savage voices of numa the lion and sheeta the panther warned him that his was to be no life of indolent ease and security  it was but a return to the old existence of constant bloodshed and dangerto the hunting and the being hunted  grim beasts would stalk him as they had stalked him in the past and never would there be a moment by savage day or by cruel night that he might not have instant need of such crude weapons as he could fashion from the materials at hand  upon the shore he found an outcropping of brittle igneous rock  by dint of much labour he managed to chip off a narrow sliver some twelve inches long by a quarter of an inch thick  one edge was quite thin for a few inches near the tip  it was the rudiment of a knife  with it he went into the jungle searching until he found a fallen tree of a certain species of hardwood with which he was familiar  from this he cut a small straight branch which he pointed at one end  then he scooped a small round hole in the surface of the prostrate trunk  into this he crumbled a few bits of dry bark minutely shredded after which he inserted the tip of his pointed stick and sitting astride the bole of the tree spun the slender rod rapidly between his palms  after a time a thin smoke rose from the little mass of tinder and a moment later the whole broke into flame   heaping some larger twigs and sticks upon the tiny fire tarzan soon had quite a respectable blaze roaring in the enlarging cavity of the dead tree  into this he thrust the blade of his stone knife and as it became superheated he would withdraw it touching a spot near the thin edge with a drop of moisture  beneath the wetted area a little flake of the glassy material would crack and scale away  thus very slowly the apeman commenced the tedious operation of putting a thin edge upon his primitive huntingknife  he did not attempt to accomplish the feat all in one sitting  at first he was content to achieve a cutting edge of a couple of inches with which he cut a long pliable bow a handle for his knife a stout cudgel and a goodly supply of arrows  these he cached in a tall tree beside a little stream and here also he constructed a platform with a roof of palmleaves above it  when all these things had been finished it was growing dusk and tarzan felt a strong desire to eat  he had noted during the brief incursion he had made into the forest that a short distance upstream from his tree there was a muchused watering place where from the trampled mud of either bank it was evident beasts of all sorts and in great numbers came to drink  to this spot the hungry apeman made his silent way  through the upper terrace of the treetops he swung with the grace and ease of a monkey  but for the heavy burden upon his heart he would have been happy in this return to the old free life of his boyhood  yet even with that burden he fell into the little habits and manners of his early life that were in reality more a part of him than the thin veneer of civilization that the past three years of his association with the white men of the outer world had spread lightly over hima veneer that only hid the crudities of the beast that tarzan of the apes had been  could his fellowpeers of the house of lords have seen him then they would have held up their noble hands in holy horror  silently he crouched in the lower branches of a great forest giant that overhung the trail his keen eyes and sensitive ears strained into the distant jungle from which he knew his dinner would presently emerge  nor had he long to wait  scarce had he settled himself to a comfortable position his lithe muscular legs drawn well up beneath him as the panther draws his hindquarters in preparation for the spring than bara the deer came daintily down to drink  but more than bara was coming  behind the graceful buck came another which the deer could neither see nor scent but whose movements were apparent to tarzan of the apes because of the elevated position of the apemans ambush  he knew not yet exactly the nature of the thing that moved so stealthily through the jungle a few hundred yards behind the deer but he was convinced that it was some great beast of prey stalking bara for the selfsame purpose as that which prompted him to await the fleet animal  numa perhaps or sheeta the panther  in any event tarzan could see his repast slipping from his grasp unless bara moved more rapidly toward the ford than at present  even as these thoughts passed through his mind some noise of the stalker in his rear must have come to the buck for with a sudden start he paused for an instant trembling in his tracks and then with a swift bound dashed straight for the river and tarzan  it was his intention to flee through the shallow ford and escape upon the opposite side of the river  not a hundred yards behind him came numa  tarzan could see him quite plainly now  below the apeman bara was about to pass  could he do it  but even as he asked himself the question the hungry man launched himself from his perch full upon the back of the startled buck  in another instant numa would be upon them both so if the apeman were to dine that night or ever again he must act quickly  scarcely had he touched the sleek hide of the deer with a momentum that sent the animal to its knees than he had grasped a horn in either hand and with a single quick wrench twisted the animals neck completely round until he felt the vertebrae snap beneath his grip  the lion was roaring in rage close behind him as he swung the deer across his shoulder and grasping a foreleg between his strong teeth leaped for the nearest of the lower branches that swung above his head  with both hands he grasped the limb and at the instant that numa sprang drew himself and his prey out of reach of the animals cruel talons  there was a thud below him as the baffled cat fell back to earth and then tarzan of the apes drawing his dinner farther up to the safety of a higher limb looked down with grinning face into the gleaming yellow eyes of the other wild beast that glared up at him from beneath and with taunting insults flaunted the tender carcass of his kill in the face of him whom he had cheated of it  with his crude stone knife he cut a juicy steak from the hindquarters and while the great lion paced growling back and forth below him lord greystoke filled his savage belly nor ever in the choicest of his exclusive london clubs had a meal tasted more palatable  the warm blood of his kill smeared his hands and face and filled his nostrils with the scent that the savage carnivora love best  and when he had finished he left the balance of the carcass in a high fork of the tree where he had dined and with numa trailing below him still keen for revenge he made his way back to his treetop shelter where he slept until the sun was high the following morning     chapter 4  sheeta   the next few days were occupied by tarzan in completing his weapons and exploring the jungle  he strung his bow with tendons from the buck upon which he had dined his first evening upon the new shore and though he would have preferred the gut of sheeta for the purpose he was content to wait until opportunity permitted him to kill one of the great cats  he also braided a long grass ropesuch a rope as he had used so many years before to tantalize the illnatured tublat and which later had developed into a wondrous effective weapon in the practised hands of the little apeboy  a sheath and handle for his huntingknife he fashioned and a quiver for arrows and from the hide of bara a belt and loincloth  then he set out to learn something of the strange land in which he found himself  that it was not his old familiar west coast of the african continent he knew from the fact that it faced eastthe rising sun came up out of the sea before the threshold of the jungle  but that it was not the east coast of africa he was equally positive for he felt satisfied that the kincaid had not passed through the mediterranean the suez canal and the red sea nor had she had time to round the cape of good hope  so he was quite at a loss to know where he might be  sometimes he wondered if the ship had crossed the broad atlantic to deposit him upon some wild south american shore but the presence of numa the lion decided him that such could not be the case  as tarzan made his lonely way through the jungle paralleling the shore he felt strong upon him a desire for companionship so that gradually he commenced to regret that he had not cast his lot with the apes  he had seen nothing of them since that first day when the influences of civilization were still paramount within him  now he was more nearly returned to the tarzan of old and though he appreciated the fact that there could be little in common between himself and the great anthropoids still they were better than no company at all  moving leisurely sometimes upon the ground and again among the lower branches of the trees gathering an occasional fruit or turning over a fallen log in search of the larger bugs which he still found as palatable as of old tarzan had covered a mile or more when his attention was attracted by the scent of sheeta upwind ahead of him  now sheeta the panther was one whom tarzan was exceptionally glad to fall in with for he had it in mind not only to utilize the great cats strong gut for his bow but also to fashion a new quiver and loincloth from pieces of his hide   so whereas the apeman had gone carelessly before he now became the personification of noiseless stealth  swiftly and silently he glided through the forest in the wake of the savage cat nor was the pursuer for all his noble birth one whit less savage than the wild fierce thing he stalked  as he came closer to sheeta he became aware that the panther on his part was stalking game of his own and even as he realized this fact there came to his nostrils wafted from his right by a vagrant breeze the strong odour of a company of great apes  the panther had taken to a large tree as tarzan came within sight of him and beyond and below him tarzan saw the tribe of akut lolling in a little natural clearing  some of them were dozing against the boles of trees while others roamed about turning over bits of bark from beneath which they transferred the luscious grubs and beetles to their mouths  akut was the closest to sheeta  the great cat lay crouched upon a thick limb hidden from the apes view by dense foliage waiting patiently until the anthropoid should come within range of his spring  tarzan cautiously gained a position in the same tree with the panther and a little above him  in his left hand he grasped his slim stone blade  he would have preferred to use his noose but the foliage surrounding the huge cat precluded the possibility of an accurate throw with the rope  akut had now wandered quite close beneath the tree wherein lay the waiting death  sheeta slowly edged his hind paws along the branch still further beneath him and then with a hideous shriek he launched himself toward the great ape   the barest fraction of a second before his spring another beast of prey above him leaped its weird and savage cry mingling with his  as the startled akut looked up he saw the panther almost above him and already upon the panthers back the white ape that had bested him that day near the great water  the teeth of the apeman were buried in the back of sheetas neck and his right arm was round the fierce throat while the left hand grasping a slender piece of stone rose and fell in mighty blows upon the panthers side behind the left shoulder  akut had just time to leap to one side to avoid being pinioned beneath these battling monsters of the jungle  with a crash they came to earth at his feet  sheeta was screaming snarling and roaring horribly but the white ape clung tenaciously and in silence to the thrashing body of his quarry  steadily and remorselessly the stone knife was driven home through the glossy hidetime and again it drank deep until with a final agonized lunge and shriek the great feline rolled over upon its side and save for the spasmodic jerking of its muscles lay quiet and still in death  then the apeman raised his head as he stood over the carcass of his kill and once again through the jungle rang his wild and savage victory challenge  akut and the apes of akut stood looking in startled wonder at the dead body of sheeta and the lithe straight figure of the man who had slain him  tarzan was the first to speak  he had saved akuts life for a purpose and knowing the limitations of the ape intellect he also knew that he must make this purpose plain to the anthropoid if it were to serve him in the way he hoped  i am tarzan of the apes he said mighty hunter  mighty fighter by the great water i spared akuts life when i might have taken it and become king of the tribe of akut  now i have saved akut from death beneath the rending fangs of sheeta  when akut or the tribe of akut is in danger let them call to tarzan thusand the apeman raised the hideous cry with which the tribe of kerchak had been wont to summon its absent members in times of peril  and he continued when they hear tarzan call to them let them remember what he has done for akut and come to him with great speed shall it be as tarzan says  huh assented akut and from the members of his tribe there rose a unanimous huh  then presently they went to feeding again as though nothing had happened and with them fed john clayton lord greystoke  he noticed however that akut kept always close to him and was often looking at him with a strange wonder in his little bloodshot eyes and once he did a thing that tarzan during all his long years among the apes had never before seen an ape dohe found a particularly tender morsel and handed it to tarzan  as the tribe hunted the glistening body of the apeman mingled with the brown shaggy hides of his companions   oftentimes they brushed together in passing but the apes had already taken his presence for granted so that he was as much one of them as akut himself  if he came too close to a she with a young baby the former would bare her great fighting fangs and growl ominously and occasionally a truculent young bull would snarl a warning if tarzan approached while the former was eating  but in those things the treatment was no different from that which they accorded any other member of the tribe  tarzan on his part felt very much at home with these fierce hairy progenitors of primitive man  he skipped nimbly out of reach of each threatening femalefor such is the way of apes if they be not in one of their occasional fits of bestial rageand he growled back at the truculent young bulls baring his canine teeth even as they  thus easily he fell back into the way of his early life nor did it seem that he had ever tasted association with creatures of his own kind  for the better part of a week he roamed the jungle with his new friends partly because of a desire for companionship and partially through a welllaid plan to impress himself indelibly upon their memories which at best are none too long for tarzan from past experience knew that it might serve him in good stead to have a tribe of these powerful and terrible beasts at his call  when he was convinced that he had succeeded to some extent in fixing his identity upon them he decided to again take up his exploration  to this end he set out toward the north early one day and keeping parallel with the shore travelled rapidly until almost nightfall  when the sun rose the next morning he saw that it lay almost directly to his right as he stood upon the beach instead of straight out across the water as heretofore and so he reasoned that the shore line had trended toward the west   all the second day he continued his rapid course and when tarzan of the apes sought speed he passed through the middle terrace of the forest with the rapidity of a squirrel  that night the sun set straight out across the water opposite the land and then the apeman guessed at last the truth that he had been suspecting  rokoff had set him ashore upon an island  he might have known it  if there was any plan that would render his position more harrowing he should have known that such would be the one adopted by the russian and what could be more terrible than to leave him to a lifetime of suspense upon an uninhabited island  rokoff doubtless had sailed directly to the mainland where it would be a comparatively easy thing for him to find the means of delivering the infant jack into the hands of the cruel and savage fosterparents who as his note had threatened would have the upbringing of the child  tarzan shuddered as he thought of the cruel suffering the little one must endure in such a life even though he might fall into the hands of individuals whose intentions toward him were of the kindest  the apeman had had sufficient experience with the lower savages of africa to know that even there may be found the cruder virtues of charity and humanity but their lives were at best but a series of terrible privations dangers and sufferings  then there was the horrid afterfate that awaited the child as he grew to manhood  the horrible practices that would form a part of his lifetraining would alone be sufficient to bar him forever from association with those of his own race and station in life  a cannibal  his little boy a savage maneater  it was too horrible to contemplate  the filed teeth the slit nose the little face painted hideously tarzan groaned  could he but feel the throat of the russ fiend beneath his steel fingers  and jane  what tortures of doubt and fear and uncertainty she must be suffering he felt that his position was infinitely less terrible than hers for he at least knew that one of his loved ones was safe at home while she had no idea of the whereabouts of either her husband or her son  it is well for tarzan that he did not guess the truth for the knowledge would have but added a hundredfold to his suffering  as he moved slowly through the jungle his mind absorbed by his gloomy thoughts there presently came to his ears a strange scratching sound which he could not translate  cautiously he moved in the direction from which it emanated presently coming upon a huge panther pinned beneath a fallen tree  as tarzan approached the beast turned snarling toward him struggling to extricate itself but one great limb across its back and the smaller entangling branches pinioning its legs prevented it from moving but a few inches in any direction  the apeman stood before the helpless cat fitting an arrow to his bow that he might dispatch the beast that otherwise must die of starvation but even as he drew back the shaft a sudden whim stayed his hand  why rob the poor creature of life and liberty when it would be so easy a thing to restore both to it  he was sure from the fact that the panther moved all its limbs in its futile struggle for freedom that its spine was uninjured and for the same reason he knew that none of its limbs were broken  relaxing his bowstring he returned the arrow to the quiver and throwing the bow about his shoulder stepped closer to the pinioned beast  on his lips was the soothing purring sound that the great cats themselves made when contented and happy  it was the nearest approach to a friendly advance that tarzan could make in the language of sheeta  the panther ceased his snarling and eyed the apeman closely   to lift the trees great weight from the animal it was necessary to come within reach of those long strong talons and when the tree had been removed the man would be totally at the mercy of the savage beast but to tarzan of the apes fear was a thing unknown  having decided he acted promptly  unhesitatingly he stepped into the tangle of branches close to the panthers side still voicing his friendly and conciliatory purr  the cat turned his head toward the man eyeing him steadilyquestioningly the long fangs were bared but more in preparedness than threat  tarzan put a broad shoulder beneath the bole of the tree and as he did so his bare leg pressed against the cats silken side so close was the man to the great beast  slowly tarzan extended his giant thews  the great tree with its entangling branches rose gradually from the panther who feeling the encumbering weight diminish quickly crawled from beneath  tarzan let the tree fall back to earth and the two beasts turned to look upon one another  a grim smile lay upon the apemans lips for he knew that he had taken his life in his hands to free this savage jungle fellow nor would it have surprised him had the cat sprung upon him the instant that it had been released  but it did not do so  instead it stood a few paces from the tree watching the apeman clamber out of the maze of fallen branches  once outside tarzan was not three paces from the panther   he might have taken to the higher branches of the trees upon the opposite side for sheeta cannot climb to the heights to which the apeman can go but something a spirit of bravado perhaps prompted him to approach the panther as though to discover if any feeling of gratitude would prompt the beast to friendliness  as he approached the mighty cat the creature stepped warily to one side and the apeman brushed past him within a foot of the dripping jaws and as he continued on through the forest the panther followed on behind him as a hound follows at heel  for a long time tarzan could not tell whether the beast was following out of friendly feelings or merely stalking him against the time he should be hungry but finally he was forced to believe that the former incentive it was that prompted the animals action  later in the day the scent of a deer sent tarzan into the trees and when he had dropped his noose about the animals neck he called to sheeta using a purr similar to that which he had utilized to pacify the brutes suspicions earlier in the day but a trifle louder and more shrill  it was similar to that which he had heard panthers use after a kill when they had been hunting in pairs  almost immediately there was a crashing of the underbrush close at hand and the long lithe body of his strange companion broke into view  at sight of the body of bara and the smell of blood the panther gave forth a shrill scream and a moment later two beasts were feeding side by side upon the tender meat of the deer  for several days this strangely assorted pair roamed the jungle together  when one made a kill he called the other and thus they fed well and often  on one occasion as they were dining upon the carcass of a boar that sheeta had dispatched numa the lion grim and terrible broke through the tangled grasses close beside them  with an angry warning roar he sprang forward to chase them from their kill  sheeta bounded into a nearby thicket while tarzan took to the low branches of an overhanging tree  here the apeman unloosed his grass rope from about his neck and as numa stood above the body of the boar challenging head erect he dropped the sinuous noose about the maned neck drawing the stout strands taut with a sudden jerk   at the same time he called shrilly to sheeta as he drew the struggling lion upward until only his hind feet touched the ground  quickly he made the rope fast to a stout branch and as the panther in answer to his summons leaped into sight tarzan dropped to the earth beside the struggling and infuriated numa and with a long sharp knife sprang upon him at one side even as sheeta did upon the other  the panther tore and rent numa upon the right while the apeman struck home with his stone knife upon the other so that before the mighty clawing of the king of beasts had succeeded in parting the rope he hung quite dead and harmless in the noose  and then upon the jungle air there rose in unison from two savage throats the victory cry of the bullape and the panther blended into one frightful and uncanny scream  as the last notes died away in a longdrawn fearsome wail a score of painted warriors drawing their long warcanoe upon the beach halted to stare in the direction of the jungle and to listen     chapter 5  mugambi   by the time that tarzan had travelled entirely about the coast of the island and made several trips inland from various points he was sure that he was the only human being upon it  nowhere had he found any sign that men had stopped even temporarily upon this shore though of course he knew that so quickly does the rank vegetation of the tropics erase all but the most permanent of human monuments that he might be in error in his deductions  the day following the killing of numa tarzan and sheeta came upon the tribe of akut  at sight of the panther the great apes took to flight but after a time tarzan succeeded in recalling them  it had occurred to him that it would be at least an interesting experiment to attempt to reconcile these hereditary enemies  he welcomed anything that would occupy his time and his mind beyond the filling of his belly and the gloomy thoughts to which he fell prey the moment that he became idle  to communicate his plan to the apes was not a particularly difficult matter though their narrow and limited vocabulary was strained in the effort but to impress upon the little wicked brain of sheeta that he was to hunt with and not for his legitimate prey proved a task almost beyond the powers of the apeman  tarzan among his other weapons possessed a long stout cudgel and after fastening his rope about the panthers neck he used this instrument freely upon the snarling beast endeavouring in this way to impress upon its memory that it must not attack the great shaggy manlike creatures that had approached more closely once they had seen the purpose of the rope about sheetas neck  that the cat did not turn and rend tarzan is something of a miracle which may possibly be accounted for by the fact that twice when it turned growling upon the apeman he had rapped it sharply upon its sensitive nose inculcating in its mind thereby a most wholesome fear of the cudgel and the apebeasts behind it  it is a question if the original cause of his attachment for tarzan was still at all clear in the mind of the panther though doubtless some subconscious suggestion superinduced by this primary reason and aided and abetted by the habit of the past few days did much to compel the beast to tolerate treatment at his hands that would have sent it at the throat of any other creature  then too there was the compelling force of the manmind exerting its powerful influence over this creature of a lower order and after all it may have been this that proved the most potent factor in tarzans supremacy over sheeta and the other beasts of the jungle that had from time to time fallen under his domination  be that as it may for days the man the panther and the great apes roamed their savage haunts side by side making their kills together and sharing them with one another and of all the fierce and savage band none was more terrible than the smoothskinned powerful beast that had been but a few short months before a familiar figure in many a london drawing room  sometimes the beasts separated to follow their own inclinations for an hour or a day and it was upon one of these occasions when the apeman had wandered through the treetops toward the beach and was stretched in the hot sun upon the sand that from the low summit of a nearby promontory a pair of keen eyes discovered him  for a moment the owner of the eyes looked in astonishment at the figure of the savage white man basking in the rays of that hot tropic sun then he turned making a sign to some one behind him  presently another pair of eyes were looking down upon the apeman and then another and another until a full score of hideously trapped savage warriors were lying upon their bellies along the crest of the ridge watching the whiteskinned stranger  they were down wind from tarzan and so their scent was not carried to him and as his back was turned half toward them he did not see their cautious advance over the edge of the promontory and down through the rank grass toward the sandy beach where he lay  big fellows they were all of them their barbaric headdresses and grotesquely painted faces together with their many metal ornaments and gorgeously coloured feathers adding to their wild fierce appearance  once at the foot of the ridge they came cautiously to their feet and bent halfdouble advanced silently upon the unconscious white man their heavy warclubs swinging menacingly in their brawny hands  the mental suffering that tarzans sorrowful thoughts induced had the effect of numbing his keen perceptive faculties so that the advancing savages were almost upon him before he became aware that he was no longer alone upon the beach  so quickly though were his mind and muscles wont to react in unison to the slightest alarm that he was upon his feet and facing his enemies even as he realized that something was behind him  as he sprang to his feet the warriors leaped toward him with raised clubs and savage yells but the foremost went down to sudden death beneath the long stout stick of the apeman and then the lithe sinewy figure was among them striking right and left with a fury power and precision that brought panic to the ranks of the blacks  for a moment they withdrew those that were left of them and consulted together at a short distance from the apeman who stood with folded arms a halfsmile upon his handsome face watching them  presently they advanced upon him once more this time wielding their heavy warspears  they were between tarzan and the jungle in a little semicircle that closed in upon him as they advanced  there seemed to the apeman but slight chance to escape the final charge when all the great spears should be hurled simultaneously at him but if he had desired to escape there was no way other than through the ranks of the savages except the open sea behind him  his predicament was indeed most serious when an idea occurred to him that altered his smile to a broad grin   the warriors were still some little distance away advancing slowly making after the manner of their kind a frightful din with their savage yells and the pounding of their naked feet upon the ground as they leaped up and down in a fantastic war dance  then it was that the apeman lifted his voice in a series of wild weird screams that brought the blacks to a sudden perplexed halt they looked at one another questioningly for here was a sound so hideous that their own frightful din faded into insignificance beside it  no human throat could have formed those bestial notes they were sure and yet with their own eyes they had seen this white man open his mouth to pour forth his awful cry  but only for a moment they hesitated and then with one accord they again took up their fantastic advance upon their prey but even then a sudden crashing in the jungle behind them brought them once more to a halt and as they turned to look in the direction of this new noise there broke upon their startled visions a sight that may well have frozen the blood of braver men than the wagambi  leaping from the tangled vegetation of the jungles rim came a huge panther with blazing eyes and bared fangs and in his wake a score of mighty shaggy apes lumbering rapidly toward them half erect upon their short bowed legs and with their long arms reaching to the ground where their horny knuckles bore the weight of their ponderous bodies as they lurched from side to side in their grotesque advance  the beasts of tarzan had come in answer to his call  before the wagambi could recover from their astonishment the frightful horde was upon them from one side and tarzan of the apes from the other  heavy spears were hurled and mighty warclubs wielded and though apes went down never to rise so too went down the men of ugambi  sheetas cruel fangs and tearing talons ripped and tore at the black hides  akuts mighty yellow tusks found the jugular of more than one sleekskinned savage and tarzan of the apes was here and there and everywhere urging on his fierce allies and taking a heavy toll with his long slim knife  in a moment the blacks had scattered for their lives but of the score that had crept down the grassy sides of the promontory only a single warrior managed to escape the horde that had overwhelmed his people  this one was mugambi chief of the wagambi of ugambi and as he disappeared in the tangled luxuriousness of the rank growth upon the ridges summit only the keen eyes of the apeman saw the direction of his flight  leaving his pack to eat their fill upon the flesh of their victimsflesh that he could not touchtarzan of the apes pursued the single survivor of the bloody fray  just beyond the ridge he came within sight of the fleeing black making with headlong leaps for a long warcanoe that was drawn well up upon the beach above the high tide surf  noiseless as the fellows shadow the apeman raced after the terrorstricken black  in the white mans mind was a new plan awakened by sight of the warcanoe  if these men had come to his island from another or from the mainland why not utilize their craft to make his way to the country from which they had come  evidently it was an inhabited country and no doubt had occasional intercourse with the mainland if it were not itself upon the continent of africa  a heavy hand fell upon the shoulder of the escaping mugambi before he was aware that he was being pursued and as he turned to do battle with his assailant giant fingers closed about his wrists and he was hurled to earth with a giant astride him before he could strike a blow in his own defence  in the language of the west coast tarzan spoke to the prostrate man beneath him  who are you he asked  mugambi chief of the wagambi replied the black  i will spare your life said tarzan if you will promise to help me to leave this island  what do you answer  i will help you replied mugambi  but now that you have killed all my warriors i do not know that even i can leave your country for there will be none to wield the paddles and without paddlers we cannot cross the water  tarzan rose and allowed his prisoner to come to his feet   the fellow was a magnificent specimen of manhooda black counterpart in physique of the splendid white man whom he faced  come said the apeman and started back in the direction from which they could hear the snarling and growling of the feasting pack mugambi drew back  they will kill us he said  i think not replied tarzan  they are mine  still the black hesitated fearful of the consequences of approaching the terrible creatures that were dining upon the bodies of his warriors but tarzan forced him to accompany him and presently the two emerged from the jungle in full view of the grisly spectacle upon the beach  at sight of the men the beasts looked up with menacing growls but tarzan strode in among them dragging the trembling wagambi with him  as he had taught the apes to accept sheeta so he taught them to adopt mugambi as well and much more easily but sheeta seemed quite unable to understand that though he had been called upon to devour mugambis warriors he was not to be allowed to proceed after the same fashion with mugambi   however being well filled he contented himself with walking round the terrorstricken savage emitting low menacing growls the while he kept his flaming baleful eyes riveted upon the black  mugambi on his part clung closely to tarzan so that the apeman could scarce control his laughter at the pitiable condition to which the chiefs fear had reduced him but at length the white took the great cat by the scruff of the neck and dragging it quite close to the wagambi slapped it sharply upon the nose each time that it growled at the stranger  at the sight of the thinga man mauling with his bare hands one of the most relentless and fierce of the jungle carnivoramugambis eyes bulged from their sockets and from entertaining a sullen respect for the giant white man who had made him prisoner the black felt an almost worshipping awe of tarzan  the education of sheeta progressed so well that in a short time mugambi ceased to be the object of his hungry attention and the black felt a degree more of safety in his society  to say that mugambi was entirely happy or at ease in his new environment would not be to adhere strictly to the truth  his eyes were constantly rolling apprehensively from side to side as now one and now another of the fierce pack chanced to wander near him so that for the most of the time it was principally the whites that showed  together tarzan and mugambi with sheeta and akut lay in wait at the ford for a deer and when at a word from the apeman the four of them leaped out upon the affrighted animal the black was sure that the poor creature died of fright before ever one of the great beasts touched it  mugambi built a fire and cooked his portion of the kill but tarzan sheeta and akut tore theirs raw with their sharp teeth growling among themselves when one ventured to encroach upon the share of another  it was not after all strange that the white mans ways should have been so much more nearly related to those of the beasts than were the savage blacks  we are all of us creatures of habit and when the seeming necessity for schooling ourselves in new ways ceases to exist we fall naturally and easily into the manners and customs which long usage has implanted ineradicably within us  mugambi from childhood had eaten no meat until it had been cooked while tarzan on the other hand had never tasted cooked food of any sort until he had grown almost to manhood and only within the past three or four years had he eaten cooked meat  not only did the habit of a lifetime prompt him to eat it raw but the craving of his palate as well for to him cooked flesh was spoiled flesh when compared with the rich and juicy meat of a fresh hot kill  that he could with relish eat raw meat that had been buried by himself weeks before and enjoy small rodents and disgusting grubs seems to us who have been always civilized a revolting fact but had we learned in childhood to eat these things and had we seen all those about us eat them they would seem no more sickening to us now than do many of our greatest dainties at which a savage african cannibal would look with repugnance and turn up his nose  for instance there is a tribe in the vicinity of lake rudolph that will eat no sheep or cattle though its next neighbors do so  near by is another tribe that eats donkeymeata custom most revolting to the surrounding tribes that do not eat donkey  so who may say that it is nice to eat snails and frogs legs and oysters but disgusting to feed upon grubs and beetles or that a raw oyster hoof horns and tail is less revolting than the sweet clean meat of a freshkilled buck  the next few days tarzan devoted to the weaving of a barkcloth sail with which to equip the canoe for he despaired of being able to teach the apes to wield the paddles though he did manage to get several of them to embark in the frail craft which he and mugambi paddled about inside the reef where the water was quite smooth  during these trips he had placed paddles in their hands when they attempted to imitate the movements of him and mugambi but so difficult is it for them long to concentrate upon a thing that he soon saw that it would require weeks of patient training before they would be able to make any effective use of these new implements if in fact they should ever do so  there was one exception however and he was akut  almost from the first he showed an interest in this new sport that revealed a much higher plane of intelligence than that attained by any of his tribe he seemed to grasp the purpose of the paddles and when tarzan saw that this was so he took much pains to explain in the meagre language of the anthropoid how they might be used to the best advantage  from mugambi tarzan learned that the mainland lay but a short distance from the island  it seemed that the wagambi warriors had ventured too far out in their frail craft and when caught by a heavy tide and a high wind from offshore they had been driven out of sight of land after paddling for a whole night thinking that they were headed for home they had seen this land at sunrise and still taking it for the mainland had hailed it with joy nor had mugambi been aware that it was an island until tarzan had told him that this was the fact  the wagambi chief was quite dubious as to the sail for he had never seen such a contrivance used  his country lay far up the broad ugambi river and this was the first occasion that any of his people had found their way to the ocean  tarzan however was confident that with a good west wind he could navigate the little craft to the mainland  at any rate he decided it would be preferable to perish on the way than to remain indefinitely upon this evidently uncharted island to which no ships might ever be expected to come  and so it was that when the first fair wind rose he embarked upon his cruise and with him he took as strange and fearsome a crew as ever sailed under a savage master  mugambi and akut went with him and sheeta the panther and a dozen great males of the tribe of akut     chapter 6  a hideous crew   the warcanoe with its savage load moved slowly toward the break in the reef through which it must pass to gain the open sea  tarzan mugambi and akut wielded the paddles for the shore kept the west wind from the little sail  sheeta crouched in the bow at the apemans feet for it had seemed best to tarzan always to keep the wicked beast as far from the other members of the party as possible since it would require little or no provocation to send him at the throat of any than the white man whom he evidently now looked upon as his master  in the stern was mugambi and just in front of him squatted akut while between akut and tarzan the twelve hairy apes sat upon their haunches blinking dubiously this way and that and now and then turning their eyes longingly back toward shore  all went well until the canoe had passed beyond the reef   here the breeze struck the sail sending the rude craft lunging among the waves that ran higher and higher as they drew away from the shore  with the tossing of the boat the apes became panicstricken  they first moved uneasily about and then commenced grumbling and whining with difficulty akut kept them in hand for a time but when a particularly large wave struck the dugout simultaneously with a little squall of wind their terror broke all bounds and leaping to their feet they all but overturned the boat before akut and tarzan together could quiet them  at last calm was restored and eventually the apes became accustomed to the strange antics of their craft after which no more trouble was experienced with them  the trip was uneventful the wind held and after ten hours steady sailing the black shadows of the coast loomed close before the straining eyes of the apeman in the bow  it was far too dark to distinguish whether they had approached close to the mouth of the ugambi or not so tarzan ran in through the surf at the closest point to await the dawn  the dugout turned broadside the instant that its nose touched the sand and immediately it rolled over with all its crew scrambling madly for the shore  the next breaker rolled them over and over but eventually they all succeeded in crawling to safety and in a moment more their ungainly craft had been washed up beside them  the balance of the night the apes sat huddled close to one another for warmth while mugambi built a fire close to them over which he crouched  tarzan and sheeta however were of a different mind for neither of them feared the jungle night and the insistent craving of their hunger sent them off into the stygian blackness of the forest in search of prey  side by side they walked when there was room for two abreast  at other times in single file first one and then the other in advance  it was tarzan who first caught the scent of meata bull buffaloand presently the two came stealthily upon the sleeping beast in the midst of a dense jungle of reeds close to a river  closer and closer they crept toward the unsuspecting beast sheeta upon his right side and tarzan upon his left nearest the great heart  they had hunted together now for some time so that they worked in unison with only low purring sounds as signals  for a moment they lay quite silent near their prey and then at a sign from the apeman sheeta sprang upon the great back burying his strong teeth in the bulls neck   instantly the brute sprang to his feet with a bellow of pain and rage and at the same instant tarzan rushed in upon his left side with the stone knife striking repeatedly behind the shoulder  one of the apemans hands clutched the thick mane and as the bull raced madly through the reeds the thing striking at his life was dragged beside him  sheeta but clung tenaciously to his hold upon the neck and back biting deep in an effort to reach the spine  for several hundred yards the bellowing bull carried his two savage antagonists until at last the blade found his heart when with a final bellow that was halfscream he plunged headlong to the earth  then tarzan and sheeta feasted to repletion  after the meal the two curled up together in a thicket the mans black head pillowed upon the tawny side of the panther   shortly after dawn they awoke and ate again and then returned to the beach that tarzan might lead the balance of the pack to the kill  when the meal was done the brutes were for curling up to sleep so tarzan and mugambi set off in search of the ugambi river   they had proceeded scarce a hundred yards when they came suddenly upon a broad stream which the negro instantly recognized as that down which he and his warriors had paddled to the sea upon their illstarred expedition  the two now followed the stream down to the ocean finding that it emptied into a bay not over a mile from the point upon the beach at which the canoe had been thrown the night before  tarzan was much elated by the discovery as he knew that in the vicinity of a large watercourse he should find natives and from some of these he had little doubt but that he should obtain news of rokoff and the child for he felt reasonably certain that the russian would rid himself of the baby as quickly as possible after having disposed of tarzan  he and mugambi now righted and launched the dugout though it was a most difficult feat in the face of the surf which rolled continuously in upon the beach but at last they were successful and soon after were paddling up the coast toward the mouth of the ugambi  here they experienced considerable difficulty in making an entrance against the combined current and ebb tide but by taking advantage of eddies close in to shore they came about dusk to a point nearly opposite the spot where they had left the pack asleep  making the craft fast to an overhanging bough the two made their way into the jungle presently coming upon some of the apes feeding upon fruit a little beyond the reeds where the buffalo had fallen  sheeta was not anywhere to be seen nor did he return that night so that tarzan came to believe that he had wandered away in search of his own kind  early the next morning the apeman led his band down to the river and as he walked he gave vent to a series of shrill cries  presently from a great distance and faintly there came an answering scream and a halfhour later the lithe form of sheeta bounded into view where the others of the pack were clambering gingerly into the canoe  the great beast with arched back and purring like a contented tabby rubbed his sides against the apeman and then at a word from the latter sprang lightly to his former place in the bow of the dugout  when all were in place it was discovered that two of the apes of akut were missing and though both the king ape and tarzan called to them for the better part of an hour there was no response and finally the boat put off without them   as it happened that the two missing ones were the very same who had evinced the least desire to accompany the expedition from the island and had suffered the most from fright during the voyage tarzan was quite sure that they had absented themselves purposely rather than again enter the canoe  as the party were putting in for the shore shortly after noon to search for food a slender naked savage watched them for a moment from behind the dense screen of verdure which lined the rivers bank then he melted away upstream before any of those in the canoe discovered him  like a deer he bounded along the narrow trail until filled with the excitement of his news he burst into a native village several miles above the point at which tarzan and his pack had stopped to hunt  another white man is coming he cried to the chief who squatted before the entrance to his circular hut   another white man and with him are many warriors   they come in a great warcanoe to kill and rob as did the blackbearded one who has just left us  kaviri leaped to his feet  he had but recently had a taste of the white mans medicine and his savage heart was filled with bitterness and hate  in another moment the rumble of the wardrums rose from the village calling in the hunters from the forest and the tillers from the fields  seven warcanoes were launched and manned by paintdaubed befeathered warriors  long spears bristled from the rude battleships as they slid noiselessly over the bosom of the water propelled by giant muscles rolling beneath glistening ebony hides  there was no beating of tomtoms now nor blare of native horn for kaviri was a crafty warrior and it was in his mind to take no chances if they could be avoided  he would swoop noiselessly down with his seven canoes upon the single one of the white man and before the guns of the latter could inflict much damage upon his people he would have overwhelmed the enemy by force of numbers  kaviris own canoe went in advance of the others a short distance and as it rounded a sharp bend in the river where the swift current bore it rapidly on its way it came suddenly upon the thing that kaviri sought  so close were the two canoes to one another that the black had only an opportunity to note the white face in the bow of the oncoming craft before the two touched and his own men were upon their feet yelling like mad devils and thrusting their long spears at the occupants of the other canoe  but a moment later when kaviri was able to realize the nature of the crew that manned the white mans dugout he would have given all the beads and iron wire that he possessed to have been safely within his distant village   scarcely had the two craft come together than the frightful apes of akut rose growling and barking from the bottom of the canoe and with long hairy arms far outstretched grasped the menacing spears from the hands of kaviris warriors  the blacks were overcome with terror but there was nothing to do other than to fight  now came the other warcanoes rapidly down upon the two craft  their occupants were eager to join the battle for they thought that their foes were white men and their native porters  they swarmed about tarzans craft but when they saw the nature of the enemy all but one turned and paddled swiftly upriver   that one came too close to the apemans craft before its occupants realized that their fellows were pitted against demons instead of men  as it touched tarzan spoke a few low words to sheeta and akut so that before the attacking warriors could draw away there sprang upon them with a bloodfreezing scream a huge panther and into the other end of their canoe clambered a great ape  at one end the panther wrought fearful havoc with his mighty talons and long sharp fangs while akut at the other buried his yellow canines in the necks of those that came within his reach hurling the terrorstricken blacks overboard as he made his way toward the centre of the canoe  kaviri was so busily engaged with the demons that had entered his own craft that he could offer no assistance to his warriors in the other a giant of a white devil had wrested his spear from him as though he the mighty kaviri had been but a newborn babe  hairy monsters were overcoming his fighting men and a black chieftain like himself was fighting shoulder to shoulder with the hideous pack that opposed him  kaviri battled bravely against his antagonist for he felt that death had already claimed him and so the least that he could do would be to sell his life as dearly as possible but it was soon evident that his best was quite futile when pitted against the superhuman brawn and agility of the creature that at last found his throat and bent him back into the bottom of the canoe  presently kaviris head began to whirlobjects became confused and dim before his eyesthere was a great pain in his chest as he struggled for the breath of life that the thing upon him was shutting off for ever  then he lost consciousness  when he opened his eyes once more he found much to his surprise that he was not dead  he lay securely bound in the bottom of his own canoe  a great panther sat upon its haunches looking down upon him  kaviri shuddered and closed his eyes again waiting for the ferocious creature to spring upon him and put him out of his misery of terror  after a moment no rending fangs having buried themselves in his trembling body he again ventured to open his eyes   beyond the panther kneeled the white giant who had overcome him  the man was wielding a paddle while directly behind him kaviri saw some of his own warriors similarly engaged   back of them again squatted several of the hairy apes  tarzan seeing that the chief had regained consciousness addressed him  your warriors tell me that you are the chief of a numerous people and that your name is kaviri he said  yes replied the black  why did you attack me  i came in peace  another white man came in peace three moons ago replied kaviri and after we had brought him presents of a goat and cassava and milk he set upon us with his guns and killed many of my people and then went on his way taking all of our goats and many of our young men and women  i am not as this other white man replied tarzan   i should not have harmed you had you not set upon me   tell me what was the face of this bad white man like  i am searching for one who has wronged me possibly this may be the very one  he was a man with a bad face covered with a great black beard and he was very very wickedyes very wicked indeed  was there a little white child with him asked tarzan his heart almost stopped as he awaited the blacks answer  no bwana replied kaviri the white child was not with this mans partyit was with the other party  other party exclaimed tarzan  what other party  with the party that the very bad white man was pursuing   there was a white man woman and the child with six mosula porters  they passed up the river three days ahead of the very bad white man  i think that they were running away from him  a white man woman and child  tarzan was puzzled  the child must be his little jack but who could the woman beand the man  was it possible that one of rokoffs confederates had conspired with some womanwho had accompanied the russianto steal the baby from him  if this was the case they had doubtless purposed returning the child to civilization and there either claiming a reward or holding the little prisoner for ransom  but now that rokoff had succeeded in chasing them far inland up the savage river there could be little doubt but that he would eventually overhaul them unless as was still more probable they should be captured and killed by the very cannibals farther up the ugambi to whom tarzan was now convinced it had been rokoffs intention to deliver the baby  as he talked to kaviri the canoes had been moving steadily upriver toward the chiefs village  kaviris warriors plied the paddles in the three canoes casting sidelong terrified glances at their hideous passengers  three of the apes of akut had been killed in the encounter but there were with akut eight of the frightful beasts remaining and there was sheeta the panther and tarzan and mugambi  kaviris warriors thought that they had never seen so terrible a crew in all their lives  momentarily they expected to be pounced upon and torn asunder by some of their captors and in fact it was all that tarzan and mugambi and akut could do to keep the snarling illnatured brutes from snapping at the glistening naked bodies that brushed against them now and then with the movements of the paddlers whose very fear added incitement to the beasts  at kaviris camp tarzan paused only long enough to eat the food that the blacks furnished and arrange with the chief for a dozen men to man the paddles of his canoe  kaviri was only too glad to comply with any demands that the apeman might make if only such compliance would hasten the departure of the horrid pack but it was easier he discovered to promise men than to furnish them for when his people learned his intentions those that had not already fled into the jungle proceeded to do so without loss of time so that when kaviri turned to point out those who were to accompany tarzan he discovered that he was the only member of his tribe left within the village  tarzan could not repress a smile  they do not seem anxious to accompany us he said but just remain quietly here kaviri and presently you shall see your people flocking to your side  then the apeman rose and calling his pack about him commanded that mugambi remain with kaviri and disappeared in the jungle with sheeta and the apes at his heels  for half an hour the silence of the grim forest was broken only by the ordinary sounds of the teeming life that but adds to its lowering loneliness  kaviri and mugambi sat alone in the palisaded village waiting  presently from a great distance came a hideous sound   mugambi recognized the weird challenge of the apeman   immediately from different points of the compass rose a horrid semicircle of similar shrieks and screams punctuated now and again by the bloodcurdling cry of a hungry panther     chapter 7  betrayed   the two savages kaviri and mugambi squatting before the entrance to kaviris hut looked at one anotherkaviri with illconcealed alarm  what is it he whispered  it is bwana tarzan and his people replied mugambi   but what they are doing i know not unless it be that they are devouring your people who ran away  kaviri shuddered and rolled his eyes fearfully toward the jungle  in all his long life in the savage forest he had never heard such an awful fearsome din  closer and closer came the sounds and now with them were mingled the terrified shrieks of women and children and of men  for twenty long minutes the bloodcurdling cries continued until they seemed but a stones throw from the palisade  kaviri rose to flee but mugambi seized and held him for such had been the command of tarzan  a moment later a horde of terrified natives burst from the jungle racing toward the shelter of their huts  like frightened sheep they ran and behind them driving them as sheep might be driven came tarzan and sheeta and the hideous apes of akut  presently tarzan stood before kaviri the old quiet smile upon his lips  your people have returned my brother he said and now you may select those who are to accompany me and paddle my canoe  tremblingly kaviri tottered to his feet calling to his people to come from their huts but none responded to his summons  tell them suggested tarzan that if they do not come i shall send my people in after them  kaviri did as he was bid and in an instant the entire population of the village came forth their wide and frightened eyes rolling from one to another of the savage creatures that wandered about the village street  quickly kaviri designated a dozen warriors to accompany tarzan  the poor fellows went almost white with terror at the prospect of close contact with the panther and the apes in the narrow confines of the canoes but when kaviri explained to them that there was no escapethat bwana tarzan would pursue them with his grim horde should they attempt to run away from the dutythey finally went gloomily down to the river and took their places in the canoe  it was with a sigh of relief that their chieftain saw the party disappear about a headland a short distance upriver  for three days the strange company continued farther and farther into the heart of the savage country that lies on either side of the almost unexplored ugambi  three of the twelve warriors deserted during that time but as several of the apes had finally learned the secret of the paddles tarzan felt no dismay because of the loss  as a matter of fact he could have travelled much more rapidly on shore but he believed that he could hold his own wild crew together to better advantage by keeping them to the boat as much as possible twice a day they landed to hunt and feed and at night they slept upon the bank of the mainland or on one of the numerous little islands that dotted the river  before them the natives fled in alarm so that they found only deserted villages in their path as they proceeded   tarzan was anxious to get in touch with some of the savages who dwelt upon the rivers banks but so far he had been unable to do so  finally he decided to take to the land himself leaving his company to follow after him by boat  he explained to mugambi the thing that he had in mind and told akut to follow the directions of the black  i will join you again in a few days he said  now i go ahead to learn what has become of the very bad white man whom i seek  at the next halt tarzan took to the shore and was soon lost to the view of his people  the first few villages he came to were deserted showing that news of the coming of his pack had travelled rapidly but toward evening he came upon a distant cluster of thatched huts surrounded by a rude palisade within which were a couple of hundred natives  the women were preparing the evening meal as tarzan of the apes poised above them in the branches of a giant tree which overhung the palisade at one point  the apeman was at a loss as to how he might enter into communication with these people without either frightening them or arousing their savage love of battle  he had no desire to fight now for he was upon a much more important mission than that of battling with every chance tribe that he should happen to meet with  at last he hit upon a plan and after seeing that he was concealed from the view of those below he gave a few hoarse grunts in imitation of a panther  all eyes immediately turned upward toward the foliage above  it was growing dark and they could not penetrate the leafy screen which shielded the apeman from their view  the moment that he had won their attention he raised his voice to the shriller and more hideous scream of the beast he personated and then scarce stirring a leaf in his descent dropped to the ground once again outside the palisade and with the speed of a deer ran quickly round to the village gate  here he beat upon the fibrebound saplings of which the barrier was constructed shouting to the natives in their own tongue that he was a friend who wished food and shelter for the night  tarzan knew well the nature of the black man  he was aware that the grunting and screaming of sheeta in the tree above them would set their nerves on edge and that his pounding upon their gate after dark would still further add to their terror  that they did not reply to his hail was no surprise for natives are fearful of any voice that comes out of the night from beyond their palisades attributing it always to some demon or other ghostly visitor but still he continued to call  let me in my friends he cried  i am a white man pursuing the very bad white man who passed this way a few days ago  i follow to punish him for the sins he has committed against you and me  if you doubt my friendship i will prove it to you by going into the tree above your village and driving sheeta back into the jungle before he leaps among you  if you will not promise to take me in and treat me as a friend i shall let sheeta stay and devour you  for a moment there was silence  then the voice of an old man came out of the quiet of the village street  if you are indeed a white man and a friend we will let you come in but first you must drive sheeta away  very well replied tarzan  listen and you shall hear sheeta fleeing before me  the apeman returned quickly to the tree and this time he made a great noise as he entered the branches at the same time growling ominously after the manner of the panther so that those below would believe that the great beast was still there  when he reached a point well above the village street he made a great commotion shaking the tree violently crying aloud to the panther to flee or be killed and punctuating his own voice with the screams and mouthings of an angry beast  presently he raced toward the opposite side of the tree and off into the jungle pounding loudly against the boles of trees as he went and voicing the panthers diminishing growls as he drew farther and farther away from the village  a few minutes later he returned to the village gate calling to the natives within  i have driven sheeta away he said  now come and admit me as you promised  for a time there was the sound of excited discussion within the palisade but at length a halfdozen warriors came and opened the gates peering anxiously out in evident trepidation as to the nature of the creature which they should find waiting there  they were not much relieved at sight of an almost naked white man but when tarzan had reassured them in quiet tones protesting his friendship for them they opened the barrier a trifle farther and admitted him  when the gates had been once more secured the selfconfidence of the savages returned and as tarzan walked up the village street toward the chiefs hut he was surrounded by a host of curious men women and children  from the chief he learned that rokoff had passed up the river a week previous and that he had horns growing from his forehead and was accompanied by a thousand devils   later the chief said that the very bad white man had remained a month in his village  though none of these statements agreed with kaviris that the russian was but three days gone from the chieftains village and that his following was much smaller than now stated tarzan was in no manner surprised at the discrepancies for he was quite familiar with the savage minds strange manner of functioning  what he was most interested in knowing was that he was upon the right trail and that it led toward the interior  in this circumstance he knew that rokoff could never escape him  after several hours of questioning and crossquestioning the apeman learned that another party had preceded the russian by several daysthree whitesa man a woman and a little manchild with several mosulas  tarzan explained to the chief that his people would follow him in a canoe probably the next day and that though he might go on ahead of them the chief was to receive them kindly and have no fear of them for mugambi would see that they did not harm the chiefs people if they were accorded a friendly reception  and now he concluded i shall lie down beneath this tree and sleep i am very tired  permit no one to disturb me  the chief offered him a hut but tarzan from past experience of native dwellings preferred the open air and further he had plans of his own that could be better carried out if he remained beneath the tree he gave as his reason a desire to be close at hand should sheeta return and after this explanation the chief was very glad to permit him to sleep beneath the tree  tarzan had always found that it stood him in good stead to leave with natives the impression that he was to some extent possessed of more or less miraculous powers  he might easily have entered their village without recourse to the gates but he believed that a sudden and unaccountable disappearance when he was ready to leave them would result in a more lasting impression upon their childlike minds and so as soon as the village was quiet in sleep he rose and leaping into the branches of the tree above him faded silently into the black mystery of the jungle night  all the balance of that night the apeman swung rapidly through the upper and middle terraces of the forest  when the going was good there he preferred the upper branches of the giant trees for then his way was better lighted by the moon but so accustomed were all his senses to the grim world of his birth that it was possible for him even in the dense black shadows near the ground to move with ease and rapidity   you or i walking beneath the arcs of main street or broadway or state street could not have moved more surely or with a tenth the speed of the agile apeman through the gloomy mazes that would have baffled us entirely  at dawn he stopped to feed and then he slept for several hours taking up the pursuit again toward noon  twice he came upon natives and though he had considerable difficulty in approaching them he succeeded in each instance in quieting both their fears and bellicose intentions toward him and learned from them that he was upon the trail of the russian  two days later still following up the ugambi he came upon a large village  the chief a wickedlooking fellow with the sharpfiled teeth that often denote the cannibal received him with apparent friendliness  the apeman was now thoroughly fatigued and had determined to rest for eight or ten hours that he might be fresh and strong when he caught up with rokoff as he was sure he must do within a very short time  the chief told him that the bearded white man had left his village only the morning before and that doubtless he would be able to overtake him in a short time  the other party the chief had not seen or heard of so he said  tarzan did not like the appearance or manner of the fellow who seemed though friendly enough to harbour a certain contempt for this halfnaked white man who came with no followers and offered no presents but he needed the rest and food that the village would afford him with less effort than the jungle and so as he knew no fear of man beast or devil he curled himself up in the shadow of a hut and was soon asleep  scarcely had he left the chief than the latter called two of his warriors to whom he whispered a few instructions   a moment later the sleek black bodies were racing along the river path upstream toward the east  in the village the chief maintained perfect quiet  he would permit no one to approach the sleeping visitor nor any singing nor loud talking  he was remarkably solicitous lest his guest be disturbed  three hours later several canoes came silently into view from up the ugambi  they were being pushed ahead rapidly by the brawny muscles of their black crews  upon the bank before the river stood the chief his spear raised in a horizontal position above his head as though in some manner of predetermined signal to those within the boats  and such indeed was the purpose of his attitudewhich meant that the white stranger within his village still slept peacefully  in the bows of two of the canoes were the runners that the chief had sent forth three hours earlier  it was evident that they had been dispatched to follow and bring back this party and that the signal from the bank was one that had been determined upon before they left the village  in a few moments the dugouts drew up to the verdureclad bank   the native warriors filed out and with them a halfdozen white men sullen uglylooking customers they were and none more so than the evilfaced blackbearded man who commanded them  where is the white man your messengers report to be with you he asked of the chief  this way bwana replied the native  carefully have i kept silence in the village that he might be still asleep when you returned  i do not know that he is one who seeks you to do you harm but he questioned me closely about your coming and your going and his appearance is as that of the one you described but whom you believed safe in the country which you called jungle island  had you not told me this tale i should not have recognized him and then he might have gone after and slain you   if he is a friend and no enemy then no harm has been done bwana but if he proves to be an enemy i should like very much to have a rifle and some ammunition  you have done well replied the white man and you shall have the rifle and ammunition whether he be a friend or enemy provided that you stand with me  i shall stand with you bwana said the chief and now come and look upon the stranger who sleeps within my village  so saying he turned and led the way toward the hut in the shadow of which the unconscious tarzan slept peacefully  behind the two men came the remaining whites and a score of warriors but the raised forefingers of the chief and his companion held them all to perfect silence  as they turned the corner of the hut cautiously and upon tiptoe an ugly smile touched the lips of the white as his eyes fell upon the giant figure of the sleeping apeman  the chief looked at the other inquiringly  the latter nodded his head to signify that the chief had made no mistake in his suspicions  then he turned to those behind him and pointing to the sleeping man motioned for them to seize and bind him  a moment later a dozen brutes had leaped upon the surprised tarzan and so quickly did they work that he was securely bound before he could make half an effort to escape  then they threw him down upon his back and as his eyes turned toward the crowd that stood near they fell upon the malign face of nikolas rokoff  a sneer curled the russians lips  he stepped quite close to tarzan  pig he cried  have you not learned sufficient wisdom to keep away from nikolas rokoff  then he kicked the prostrate man full in the face  that for your welcome he said  tonight before my ethiop friends eat you i shall tell you what has already befallen your wife and child and what further plans i have for their futures     chapter 8  the dance of death   through the luxuriant tangled vegetation of the stygian jungle night a great lithe body made its way sinuously and in utter silence upon its soft padded feet  only two blazing points of yellowgreen flame shone occasionally with the reflected light of the equatorial moon that now and again pierced the softly sighing roof rustling in the night wind  occasionally the beast would stop with highheld nose sniffing searchingly  at other times a quick brief incursion into the branches above delayed it momentarily in its steady journey toward the east  to its sensitive nostrils came the subtle unseen spoor of many a tender fourfooted creature bringing the slaver of hunger to the cruel drooping jowl  but steadfastly it kept on its way strangely ignoring the cravings of appetite that at another time would have sent the rolling furclad muscles flying at some soft throat  all that night the creature pursued its lonely way and the next day it halted only to make a single kill which it tore to fragments and devoured with sullen grumbling rumbles as though half famished for lack of food  it was dusk when it approached the palisade that surrounded a large native village  like the shadow of a swift and silent death it circled the village nose to ground halting at last close to the palisade where it almost touched the backs of several huts  here the beast sniffed for a moment and then turning its head upon one side listened with uppricked ears  what it heard was no sound by the standards of human ears yet to the highly attuned and delicate organs of the beast a message seemed to be borne to the savage brain  a wondrous transformation was wrought in the motionless mass of statuesque bone and muscle that had an instant before stood as though carved out of the living bronze  as if it had been poised upon steel springs suddenly released it rose quickly and silently to the top of the palisade disappearing stealthily and catlike into the dark space between the wall and the back of an adjacent hut  in the village street beyond women were preparing many little fires and fetching cookingpots filled with water for a great feast was to be celebrated ere the night was many hours older   about a stout stake near the centre of the circling fires a little knot of black warriors stood conversing their bodies smeared with white and blue and ochre in broad and grotesque bands   great circles of colour were drawn about their eyes and lips their breasts and abdomens and from their clayplastered coiffures rose gay feathers and bits of long straight wire  the village was preparing for the feast while in a hut at one side of the scene of the coming orgy the bound victim of their bestial appetites lay waiting for the end  and such an end  tarzan of the apes tensing his mighty muscles strained at the bonds that pinioned him but they had been reenforced many times at the instigation of the russian so that not even the apemans giant brawn could budge them  death  tarzan had looked the hideous hunter in the face many a time and smiled  and he would smile again tonight when he knew the end was coming quickly but now his thoughts were not of himself but of those othersthe dear ones who must suffer most because of his passing  jane would never know the manner of it  for that he thanked heaven and he was thankful also that she at least was safe in the heart of the worlds greatest city  safe among kind and loving friends who would do their best to lighten her misery  but the boy  tarzan writhed at the thought of him  his son  and now hethe mighty lord of the junglehe tarzan king of the apes the only one in all the world fitted to find and save the child from the horrors that rokoffs evil mind had plannedhad been trapped like a silly dumb creature  he was to die in a few hours and with him would go the childs last chance of succour  rokoff had been in to see and revile and abuse him several times during the afternoon but he had been able to wring no word of remonstrance or murmur of pain from the lips of the giant captive  so at last he had given up reserving his particular bit of exquisite mental torture for the last moment when just before the savage spears of the cannibals should for ever make the object of his hatred immune to further suffering the russian planned to reveal to his enemy the true whereabouts of his wife whom he thought safe in england  dusk had fallen upon the village and the apemen could hear the preparations going forward for the torture and the feast   the dance of death he could picture in his minds eyefor he had seen the thing many times in the past  now he was to be the central figure bound to the stake  the torture of the slow death as the circling warriors cut him to bits with the fiendish skill that mutilated without bringing unconsciousness had no terrors for him  he was inured to suffering and to the sight of blood and to cruel death but the desire to live was no less strong within him and until the last spark of life should flicker and go out his whole being would remain quick with hope and determination   let them relax their watchfulness but for an instant he knew that his cunning mind and giant muscles would find a way to escapeescape and revenge  as he lay thinking furiously on every possibility of selfsalvation there came to his sensitive nostrils a faint and a familiar scent instantly every faculty of his mind was upon the alert  presently his trained ears caught the sound of the soundless presence withoutbehind the hut wherein he lay   his lips moved and though no sound came forth that might have been appreciable to a human ear beyond the walls of his prison yet he realized that the one beyond would hear  already he knew who that one was for his nostrils had told him as plainly as your eyes or mine tell us of the identity of an old friend whom we come upon in broad daylight  an instant later he heard the soft sound of a furclad body and padded feet scaling the outer wall behind the hut and then a tearing at the poles which formed the wall   presently through the hole thus made slunk a great beast pressing its cold muzzle close to his neck  it was sheeta the panther  the beast snuffed round the prostrate man whining a little  there was a limit to the interchange of ideas which could take place between these two and so tarzan could not be sure that sheeta understood all that he attempted to communicate to him  that the man was tied and helpless sheeta could of course see but that to the mind of the panther this would carry any suggestion of harm in so far as his master was concerned tarzan could not guess  what had brought the beast to him  the fact that he had come augured well for what he might accomplish but when tarzan tried to get sheeta to gnaw his bonds asunder the great animal could not seem to understand what was expected of him and instead but licked the wrists and arms of the prisoner  presently there came an interruption  some one was approaching the hut  sheeta gave a low growl and slunk into the blackness of a far corner  evidently the visitor did not hear the warning sound for almost immediately he entered the huta tall naked savage warrior  he came to tarzans side and pricked him with a spear   from the lips of the apeman came a weird uncanny sound and in answer to it there leaped from the blackness of the huts farthermost corner a bolt of furclad death  full upon the breast of the painted savage the great beast struck burying sharp talons in the black flesh and sinking great yellow fangs in the ebon throat  there was a fearful scream of anguish and terror from the black and mingled with it was the hideous challenge of the killing panther  then came silencesilence except for the rending of bloody flesh and the crunching of human bones between mighty jaws  the noise had brought sudden quiet to the village without   then there came the sound of voices in consultation  highpitched fearfilled voices and deep low tones of authority as the chief spoke  tarzan and the panther heard the approaching footsteps of many men and then to tarzans surprise the great cat rose from across the body of its kill and slunk noiselessly from the hut through the aperture through which it had entered  the man heard the soft scraping of the body as it passed over the top of the palisade and then silence  from the opposite side of the hut he heard the savages approaching to investigate  he had little hope that sheeta would return for had the great cat intended to defend him against all comers it would have remained by his side as it heard the approaching savages without  tarzan knew how strange were the workings of the brains of the mighty carnivora of the junglehow fiendishly fearless they might be in the face of certain death and again how timid upon the slightest provocation  there was doubt in his mind that some note of the approaching blacks vibrating with fear had struck an answering chord in the nervous system of the panther sending him slinking through the jungle his tail between his legs  the man shrugged  well what of it  he had expected to die and after all what might sheeta have done for him other than to maul a couple of his enemies before a rifle in the hands of one of the whites should have dispatched him  if the cat could have released him  ah that would have resulted in a very different story but it had proved beyond the understanding of sheeta and now the beast was gone and tarzan must definitely abandon hope  the natives were at the entrance to the hut now peering fearfully into the dark interior  two in advance held lighted torches in their left hands and ready spears in their right   they held back timorously against those behind who were pushing them forward  the shrieks of the panthers victim mingled with those of the great cat had wrought mightily upon their poor nerves and now the awful silence of the dark interior seemed even more terribly ominous than had the frightful screaming  presently one of those who was being forced unwillingly within hit upon a happy scheme for learning first the precise nature of the danger which menaced him from the silent interior   with a quick movement he flung his lighted torch into the centre of the hut  instantly all within was illuminated for a brief second before the burning brand was dashed out against the earth floor  there was the figure of the white prisoner still securely bound as they had last seen him and in the centre of the hut another figure equally as motionless its throat and breasts horribly torn and mangled  the sight that met the eyes of the foremost savages inspired more terror within their superstitious breasts than would the presence of sheeta for they saw only the result of a ferocious attack upon one of their fellows  not seeing the cause their fearridden minds were free to attribute the ghastly work to supernatural causes and with the thought they turned screaming from the hut bowling over those who stood directly behind them in the exuberance of their terror  for an hour tarzan heard only the murmur of excited voices from the far end of the village  evidently the savages were once more attempting to work up their flickering courage to a point that would permit them to make another invasion of the hut for now and then came a savage yell such as the warriors give to bolster up their bravery upon the field of battle  but in the end it was two of the whites who first entered carrying torches and guns  tarzan was not surprised to discover that neither of them was rokoff  he would have wagered his soul that no power on earth could have tempted that great coward to face the unknown menace of the hut  when the natives saw that the white men were not attacked they too crowded into the interior their voices hushed with terror as they looked upon the mutilated corpse of their comrade   the whites tried in vain to elicit an explanation from tarzan but to all their queries he but shook his head a grim and knowing smile curving his lips  at last rokoff came  his face grew very white as his eyes rested upon the bloody thing grinning up at him from the floor the face set in a death mask of excruciating horror  come he said to the chief  let us get to work and finish this demon before he has an opportunity to repeat this thing upon more of your people  the chief gave orders that tarzan should be lifted and carried to the stake but it was several minutes before he could prevail upon any of his men to touch the prisoner  at last however four of the younger warriors dragged tarzan roughly from the hut and once outside the pall of terror seemed lifted from the savage hearts  a score of howling blacks pushed and buffeted the prisoner down the village street and bound him to the post in the centre of the circle of little fires and boiling cookingpots  when at last he was made fast and seemed quite helpless and beyond the faintest hope of succour rokoffs shrivelled wart of courage swelled to its usual proportions when danger was not present  he stepped close to the apeman and seizing a spear from the hands of one of the savages was the first to prod the helpless victim  a little stream of blood trickled down the giants smooth skin from the wound in his side but no murmur of pain passed his lips  the smile of contempt upon his face seemed to infuriate the russian with a volley of oaths he leaped at the helpless captive beating him upon the face with his clenched fists and kicking him mercilessly about the legs  then he raised the heavy spear to drive it through the mighty heart and still tarzan of the apes smiled contemptuously upon him  before rokoff could drive the weapon home the chief sprang upon him and dragged him away from his intended victim  stop white man he cried  rob us of this prisoner and our deathdance and you yourself may have to take his place  the threat proved most effective in keeping the russian from further assaults upon the prisoner though he continued to stand a little apart and hurl taunts at his enemy  he told tarzan that he himself was going to eat the apemans heart   he enlarged upon the horrors of the future life of tarzans son and intimated that his vengeance would reach as well to jane clayton  you think your wife safe in england said rokoff   poor fool  she is even now in the hands of one not even of decent birth and far from the safety of london and the protection of her friends  i had not meant to tell you this until i could bring to you upon jungle island proof of her fate  now that you are about to die the most unthinkably horrid death that it is given a white man to dielet this word of the plight of your wife add to the torments that you must suffer before the last savage spearthrust releases you from your torture  the dance had commenced now and the yells of the circling warriors drowned rokoffs further attempts to distress his victim  the leaping savages the flickering firelight playing upon their painted bodies circled about the victim at the stake  to tarzans memory came a similar scene when he had rescued darnot from a like predicament at the last moment before the final spearthrust should have ended his sufferings   who was there now to rescue him  in all the world there was none able to save him from the torture and the death  the thought that these human fiends would devour him when the dance was done caused him not a single qualm of horror or disgust  it did not add to his sufferings as it would have to those of an ordinary white man for all his life tarzan had seen the beasts of the jungle devour the flesh of their kills  had he not himself battled for the grisly forearm of a great ape at that longgone dumdum when he had slain the fierce tublat and won his niche in the respect of the apes of kerchak  the dancers were leaping more closely to him now  the spears were commencing to find his body in the first torturing pricks that prefaced the more serious thrusts  it would not be long now  the apeman longed for the last savage lunge that would end his misery  and then far out in the mazes of the weird jungle rose a shrill scream  for an instant the dancers paused and in the silence of the interval there rose from the lips of the fastbound white man an answering shriek more fearsome and more terrible than that of the junglebeast that had roused it  for several minutes the blacks hesitated then at the urging of rokoff and their chief they leaped in to finish the dance and the victim but ere ever another spear touched the brown hide a tawny streak of greeneyed hate and ferocity bounded from the door of the hut in which tarzan had been imprisoned and sheeta the panther stood snarling beside his master  for an instant the blacks and the whites stood transfixed with terror their eyes were riveted upon the bared fangs of the jungle cat  only tarzan of the apes saw what else there was emerging from the dark interior of the hut     chapter 9  chivalry or villainy   from her cabin port upon the kincaid jane clayton had seen her husband rowed to the verdureclad shore of jungle island and then the ship once more proceeded upon its way  for several days she saw no one other than sven anderssen the kincaids taciturn and repellent cook  she asked him the name of the shore upon which her husband had been set  ay tank it blow purty soon purty hard replied the swede and that was all that she could get out of him  she had come to the conclusion that he spoke no other english and so she ceased to importune him for information but never did she forget to greet him pleasantly or to thank him for the hideous nauseating meals he brought her  three days from the spot where tarzan had been marooned the kincaid came to anchor in the mouth of a great river and presently rokoff came to jane claytons cabin  we have arrived my dear he said with a sickening leer   i have come to offer you safety liberty and ease  my heart has been softened toward you in your suffering and i would make amends as best i may  your husband was a bruteyou know that best who found him naked in his native jungle roaming wild with the savage beasts that were his fellows  now i am a gentleman not only born of noble blood but raised gently as befits a man of quality  to you dear jane i offer the love of a cultured man and association with one of culture and refinement which you must have sorely missed in your relations with the poor ape that through your girlish infatuation you married so thoughtlessly   i love you jane  you have but to say the word and no further sorrows shall afflict youeven your baby shall be returned to you unharmed  outside the door sven anderssen paused with the noonday meal he had been carrying to lady greystoke  upon the end of his long stringy neck his little head was cocked to one side his closeset eyes were half closed his ears so expressive was his whole attitude of stealthy eavesdropping seemed truly to be cocked forwardeven his long yellow straggly moustache appeared to assume a sly droop  as rokoff closed his appeal awaiting the reply he invited the look of surprise upon jane claytons face turned to one of disgust  she fairly shuddered in the fellows face  i would not have been surprised m  rokoff she said had you attempted to force me to submit to your evil desires but that you should be so fatuous as to believe that i wife of john clayton would come to you willingly even to save my life i should never have imagined  i have known you for a scoundrel m  rokoff but until now i had not taken you for a fool  rokoffs eyes narrowed and the red of mortification flushed out the pallor of his face  he took a step toward the girl threateningly  we shall see who is the fool at last he hissed when i have broken you to my will and your plebeian yankee stubbornness has cost you all that you hold deareven the life of your babyfor by the bones of st  peter ill forego all that i had planned for the brat and cut its heart out before your very eyes  youll learn what it means to insult nikolas rokoff  jane clayton turned wearily away  what is the use she said of expatiating upon the depths to which your vengeful nature can sink  you cannot move me either by threats or deeds  my baby cannot judge yet for himself but i his mother can foresee that should it have been given him to survive to mans estate he would willingly sacrifice his life for the honour of his mother love him as i do i would not purchase his life at such a price   did i he would execrate my memory to the day of his death  rokoff was now thoroughly angered because of his failure to reduce the girl to terror  he felt only hate for her but it had come to his diseased mind that if he could force her to accede to his demands as the price of her life and her childs the cup of his revenge would be filled to brimming when he could flaunt the wife of lord greystoke in the capitals of europe as his mistress  again he stepped closer to her  his evil face was convulsed with rage and desire  like a wild beast he sprang upon her and with his strong fingers at her throat forced her backward upon the berth  at the same instant the door of the cabin opened noisily   rokoff leaped to his feet and turning faced the swede cook  into the fellows usually foxy eyes had come an expression of utter stupidity  his lower jaw drooped in vacuous harmony   he busied himself in arranging lady greystokes meal upon the tiny table at one side of her cabin  the russian glared at him  what do you mean he cried by entering here without permission get out  the cook turned his watery blue eyes upon rokoff and smiled vacuously  ay tank it blow purty soon purty hard he said and then he began rearranging the few dishes upon the little table  get out of here or ill throw you out you miserable blockhead roared rokoff taking a threatening step toward the swede  anderssen continued to smile foolishly in his direction but one hamlike paw slid stealthily to the handle of the long slim knife that protruded from the greasy cord supporting his soiled apron  rokoff saw the move and stopped short in his advance   then he turned toward jane clayton  i will give you until tomorrow he said to reconsider your answer to my offer  all will be sent ashore upon one pretext or another except you and the child paulvitch and myself   then without interruption you will be able to witness the death of the baby  he spoke in french that the cook might not understand the sinister portent of his words  when he had done he banged out of the cabin without another look at the man who had interrupted him in his sorry work  when he had gone sven anderssen turned toward lady greystokethe idiotic expression that had masked his thoughts had fallen away and in its place was one of craft and cunning  hay tank ay ban a fool he said  hay ben the fool  ay savvy franch  jane clayton looked at him in surprise  you understood all that he said then  anderssen grinned  you bat he said  and you heard what was going on in here and came to protect me  you bane good to me explained the swede  hay treat me like darty dog  ay help you lady  you yust vaitay help you  ay ban vast coast lots times  but how can you help me sven she asked when all these men will be against us  ay tank said sven anderssen it blow purty soon purty hard and then he turned and left the cabin  though jane clayton doubted the cooks ability to be of any material service to her she was nevertheless deeply grateful to him for what he already had done  the feeling that among these enemies she had one friend brought the first ray of comfort that had come to lighten the burden of her miserable apprehensions throughout the long voyage of the kincaid  she saw no more of rokoff that day nor of any other until sven came with her evening meal  she tried to draw him into conversation relative to his plans to aid her but all that she could get from him was his stereotyped prophecy as to the future state of the wind  he seemed suddenly to have relapsed into his wonted state of dense stupidity  however when he was leaving her cabin a little later with the empty dishes he whispered very low leave on your clothes an roll up your blankets  ay come back after you purty soon  he would have slipped from the room at once but jane laid her hand upon his sleeve  my baby she asked  i cannot go without him  you do wot ay tal you said anderssen scowling   ay ban halpin you so dont you gat too fonny  when he had gone jane clayton sank down upon her berth in utter bewilderment  what was she to do  suspicions as to the intentions of the swede swarmed her brain  might she not be infinitely worse off if she gave herself into his power than she already was  no she could be no worse off in company with the devil himself than with nikolas rokoff for the devil at least bore the reputation of being a gentleman  she swore a dozen times that she would not leave the kincaid without her baby and yet she remained clothed long past her usual hour for retiring and her blankets were neatly rolled and bound with stout cord when about midnight there came a stealthy scratching upon the panels of her door  swiftly she crossed the room and drew the bolt  softly the door swung open to admit the muffled figure of the swede   on one arm he carried a bundle evidently his blankets   his other hand was raised in a gesture commanding silence a grimy forefinger upon his lips  he came quite close to her  carry this he said  do not make some noise when you see it  it ban your kid  quick hands snatched the bundle from the cook and hungry mother arms folded the sleeping infant to her breast while hot tears of joy ran down her cheeks and her whole frame shook with the emotion of the moment  come said anderssen  we got no time to vaste  he snatched up her bundle of blankets and outside the cabin door his own as well  then he led her to the ships side steadied her descent of the monkeyladder holding the child for her as she climbed to the waiting boat below  a moment later he had cut the rope that held the small boat to the steamers side and bending silently to the muffled oars was pulling toward the black shadows up the ugambi river  anderssen rowed on as though quite sure of his ground and when after half an hour the moon broke through the clouds there was revealed upon their left the mouth of a tributary running into the ugambi  up this narrow channel the swede turned the prow of the small boat  jane clayton wondered if the man knew where he was bound   she did not know that in his capacity as cook he had that day been rowed up this very stream to a little village where he had bartered with the natives for such provisions as they had for sale and that he had there arranged the details of his plan for the adventure upon which they were now setting forth  even though the moon was full the surface of the small river was quite dark  the giant trees overhung its narrow banks meeting in a great arch above the centre of the river   spanish moss dropped from the gracefully bending limbs and enormous creepers clambered in riotous profusion from the ground to the loftiest branch falling in curving loops almost to the waters placid breast  now and then the rivers surface would be suddenly broken ahead of them by a huge crocodile startled by the splashing of the oars or snorting and blowing a family of hippos would dive from a sandy bar to the cool safe depths of the bottom  from the dense jungles upon either side came the weird night cries of the carnivorathe maniacal voice of the hyena the coughing grunt of the panther the deep and awful roar of the lion  and with them strange uncanny notes that the girl could not ascribe to any particular night prowlermore terrible because of their mystery  huddled in the stern of the boat she sat with her baby strained close to her bosom and because of that little tender helpless thing she was happier tonight than she had been for many a sorrowridden day  even though she knew not to what fate she was going or how soon that fate might overtake her still was she happy and thankful for the moment however brief that she might press her baby tightly in her arms  she could scarce wait for the coming of the day that she might look again upon the bright face of her little blackeyed jack  again and again she tried to strain her eyes through the blackness of the jungle night to have but a tiny peep at those beloved features but only the dim outline of the baby face rewarded her efforts  then once more she would cuddle the warm little bundle close to her throbbing heart  it must have been close to three oclock in the morning that anderssen brought the boats nose to the shore before a clearing where could be dimly seen in the waning moonlight a cluster of native huts encircled by a thorn boma  at the village gate they were admitted by a native woman the wife of the chief whom anderssen had paid to assist him   she took them to the chiefs hut but anderssen said that they would sleep without upon the ground and so her duty having been completed she left them to their own devices  the swede after explaining in his gruff way that the huts were doubtless filthy and verminridden spread janes blankets on the ground for her and at a little distance unrolled his own and lay down to sleep  it was some time before the girl could find a comfortable position upon the hard ground but at last the baby in the hollow of her arm she dropped asleep from utter exhaustion   when she awoke it was broad daylight  about her were clustered a score of curious nativesmostly men for among the aborigines it is the male who owns this characteristic in its most exaggerated form   instinctively jane clayton drew the baby more closely to her though she soon saw that the blacks were far from intending her or the child any harm  in fact one of them offered her a gourd of milka filthy smokebegrimed gourd with the ancient rind of longcurdled milk caked in layers within its neck but the spirit of the giver touched her deeply and her face lightened for a moment with one of those almost forgotten smiles of radiance that had helped to make her beauty famous both in baltimore and london  she took the gourd in one hand and rather than cause the giver pain raised it to her lips though for the life of her she could scarce restrain the qualm of nausea that surged through her as the malodorous thing approached her nostrils  it was anderssen who came to her rescue and taking the gourd from her drank a portion himself and then returned it to the native with a gift of blue beads  the sun was shining brightly now and though the baby still slept jane could scarce restrain her impatient desire to have at least a brief glance at the beloved face  the natives had withdrawn at a command from their chief who now stood talking with anderssen a little apart from her  as she debated the wisdom of risking disturbing the childs slumber by lifting the blanket that now protected its face from the sun she noted that the cook conversed with the chief in the language of the negro  what a remarkable man the fellow was indeed  she had thought him ignorant and stupid but a short day before and now within the past twentyfour hours she had learned that he spoke not only english but french as well and the primitive dialect of the west coast  she had thought him shifty cruel and untrustworthy yet in so far as she had reason to believe he had proved himself in every way the contrary since the day before  it scarce seemed credible that he could be serving her from motives purely chivalrous  there must be something deeper in his intentions and plans than he had yet disclosed  she wondered and when she looked at himat his closeset shifty eyes and repulsive features she shuddered for she was convinced that no lofty characteristics could be hid behind so foul an exterior  as she was thinking of these things the while she debated the wisdom of uncovering the babys face there came a little grunt from the wee bundle in her lap and then a gurgling coo that set her heart in raptures  the baby was awake  now she might feast her eyes upon him  quickly she snatched the blanket from before the infants face anderssen was looking at her as she did so  he saw her stagger to her feet holding the baby at arms length from her her eyes glued in horror upon the little chubby face and twinkling eyes  then he heard her piteous cry as her knees gave beneath her and she sank to the ground in a swoon     chapter 10  the swede   as the warriors clustered thick about tarzan and sheeta realized that it was a fleshandblood panther that had interrupted their dance of death they took heart a trifle for in the face of all those circling spears even the mighty sheeta would be doomed  rokoff was urging the chief to have his spearmen launch their missiles and the black was upon the instant of issuing the command when his eyes strayed beyond tarzan following the gaze of the apeman  with a yell of terror the chief turned and fled toward the village gate and as his people looked to see the cause of his fright they too took to their heelsfor there lumbering down upon them their huge forms exaggerated by the play of moonlight and camp fire came the hideous apes of akut  the instant the natives turned to flee the apemans savage cry rang out above the shrieks of the blacks and in answer to it sheeta and the apes leaped growling after the fugitives   some of the warriors turned to battle with their enraged antagonists but before the fiendish ferocity of the fierce beasts they went down to bloody death  others were dragged down in their flight and it was not until the village was empty and the last of the blacks had disappeared into the bush that tarzan was able to recall his savage pack to his side  then it was that he discovered to his chagrin that he could not make one of them not even the comparatively intelligent akut understand that he wished to be freed from the bonds that held him to the stake  in time of course the idea would filter through their thick skulls but in the meanwhile many things might happenthe blacks might return in force to regain their village the whites might readily pick them all off with their rifles from the surrounding trees he might even starve to death before the dullwitted apes realized that he wished them to gnaw through his bonds  as for sheetathe great cat understood even less than the apes but yet tarzan could not but marvel at the remarkable characteristics this beast had evidenced  that it felt real affection for him there seemed little doubt for now that the blacks were disposed of it walked slowly back and forth about the stake rubbing its sides against the apemans legs and purring like a contented tabby  that it had gone of its own volition to bring the balance of the pack to his rescue tarzan could not doubt  his sheeta was indeed a jewel among beasts  mugambis absence worried the apeman not a little   he attempted to learn from akut what had become of the black fearing that the beasts freed from the restraint of tarzans presence might have fallen upon the man and devoured him but to all his questions the great ape but pointed back in the direction from which they had come out of the jungle  the night passed with tarzan still fast bound to the stake and shortly after dawn his fears were realized in the discovery of naked black figures moving stealthily just within the edge of the jungle about the village  the blacks were returning  with daylight their courage would be equal to the demands of a charge upon the handful of beasts that had routed them from their rightful abodes  the result of the encounter seemed foregone if the savages could curb their superstitious terror for against their overwhelming numbers their long spears and poisoned arrows the panther and the apes could not be expected to survive a really determined attack  that the blacks were preparing for a charge became apparent a few moments later when they commenced to show themselves in force upon the edge of the clearing dancing and jumping about as they waved their spears and shouted taunts and fierce warcries toward the village  these manoeuvres tarzan knew would continue until the blacks had worked themselves into a state of hysterical courage sufficient to sustain them for a short charge toward the village and even though he doubted that they would reach it at the first attempt he believed that at the second or the third they would swarm through the gateway when the outcome could not be aught than the extermination of tarzans bold but unarmed and undisciplined defenders  even as he had guessed the first charge carried the howling warriors but a short distance into the opena shrill weird challenge from the apeman being all that was necessary to send them scurrying back to the bush  for half an hour they pranced and yelled their courage to the stickingpoint and again essayed a charge  this time they came quite to the village gate but when sheeta and the hideous apes leaped among them they turned screaming in terror and again fled to the jungle  again was the dancing and shouting repeated  this time tarzan felt no doubt they would enter the village and complete the work that a handful of determined white men would have carried to a successful conclusion at the first attempt  to have rescue come so close only to be thwarted because he could not make his poor savage friends understand precisely what he wanted of them was most irritating but he could not find it in his heart to place blame upon them   they had done their best and now he was sure they would doubtless remain to die with him in a fruitless effort to defend him  the blacks were already preparing for the charge  a few individuals had advanced a short distance toward the village and were exhorting the others to follow them  in a moment the whole savage horde would be racing across the clearing  tarzan thought only of the little child somewhere in this cruel relentless wilderness  his heart ached for the son that he might no longer seek to savethat and the realization of janes suffering were all that weighed upon his brave spirit in these that he thought his last moments of life  succour all that he could hope for had come to him in the instant of his extremityand failed  there was nothing further for which to hope  the blacks were halfway across the clearing when tarzans attention was attracted by the actions of one of the apes  the beast was glaring toward one of the huts  tarzan followed his gaze  to his infinite relief and delight he saw the stalwart form of mugambi racing toward him  the huge black was panting heavily as though from strenuous physical exertion and nervous excitement  he rushed to tarzans side and as the first of the savages reached the village gate the natives knife severed the last of the cords that bound tarzan to the stake  in the street lay the corpses of the savages that had fallen before the pack the night before  from one of these tarzan seized a spear and knob stick and with mugambi at his side and the snarling pack about him he met the natives as they poured through the gate  fierce and terrible was the battle that ensued but at last the savages were routed more by terror perhaps at sight of a black man and a white fighting in company with a panther and the huge fierce apes of akut than because of their inability to overcome the relatively small force that opposed them  one prisoner fell into the hands of tarzan and him the apeman questioned in an effort to learn what had become of rokoff and his party  promised his liberty in return for the information the black told all he knew concerning the movements of the russian  it seemed that early in the morning their chief had attempted to prevail upon the whites to return with him to the village and with their guns destroy the ferocious pack that had taken possession of it but rokoff appeared to entertain even more fears of the giant white man and his strange companions than even the blacks themselves  upon no conditions would he consent to returning even within sight of the village  instead he took his party hurriedly to the river where they stole a number of canoes the blacks had hidden there  the last that had been seen of them they had been paddling strongly upstream their porters from kaviris village wielding the blades  so once more tarzan of the apes with his hideous pack took up his search for the apemans son and the pursuit of his abductor  for weary days they followed through an almost uninhabited country only to learn at last that they were upon the wrong trail  the little band had been reduced by three for three of akuts apes had fallen in the fighting at the village   now with akut there were five great apes and sheeta was thereand mugambi and tarzan  the apeman no longer heard rumors even of the three who had preceded rokoffthe white man and woman and the child  who the man and woman were he could not guess but that the child was his was enough to keep him hot upon the trail  he was sure that rokoff would be following this trio and so he felt confident that so long as he could keep upon the russians trail he would be winning so much nearer to the time he might snatch his son from the dangers and horrors that menaced him  in retracing their way after losing rokoffs trail tarzan picked it up again at a point where the russian had left the river and taken to the brush in a northerly direction  he could only account for this change on the ground that the child had been carried away from the river by the two who now had possession of it  nowhere along the way however could he gain definite information that might assure him positively that the child was ahead of him  not a single native they questioned had seen or heard of this other party though nearly all had had direct experience with the russian or had talked with others who had  it was with difficulty that tarzan could find means to communicate with the natives as the moment their eyes fell upon his companions they fled precipitately into the bush  his only alternative was to go ahead of his pack and waylay an occasional warrior whom he found alone in the jungle  one day as he was thus engaged tracking an unsuspecting savage he came upon the fellow in the act of hurling a spear at a wounded white man who crouched in a clump of bush at the trails side  the white was one whom tarzan had often seen and whom he recognized at once  deep in his memory was implanted those repulsive featuresthe closeset eyes the shifty expression the drooping yellow moustache  instantly it occurred to the apeman that this fellow had not been among those who had accompanied rokoff at the village where tarzan had been a prisoner  he had seen them all and this fellow had not been there  there could be but one explanationhe it was who had fled ahead of the russian with the woman and the childand the woman had been jane clayton   he was sure now of the meaning of rokoffs words  the apemans face went white as he looked upon the pasty vicemarked countenance of the swede  across tarzans forehead stood out the broad band of scarlet that marked the scar where years before terkoz had torn a great strip of the apemans scalp from his skull in the fierce battle in which tarzan had sustained his fitness to the kingship of the apes of kerchak  the man was his preythe black should not have him and with the thought he leaped upon the warrior striking down the spear before it could reach its mark  the black whipping out his knife turned to do battle with this new enemy while the swede lying in the bush witnessed a duel the like of which he had never dreamed to seea halfnaked white man battling with a halfnaked black hand to hand with the crude weapons of primeval man at first and then with hands and teeth like the primordial brutes from whose loins their forebears sprung  for a time anderssen did not recognize the white and when at last it dawned upon him that he had seen this giant before his eyes went wide in surprise that this growling rending beast could ever have been the wellgroomed english gentleman who had been a prisoner aboard the kincaid  an english nobleman  he had learned the identity of the kincaids prisoners from lady greystoke during their flight up the ugambi before in common with the other members of the crew of the steamer he had not known who the two might be  the fight was over  tarzan had been compelled to kill his antagonist as the fellow would not surrender  the swede saw the white man leap to his feet beside the corpse of his foe and placing one foot upon the broken neck lift his voice in the hideous challenge of the victorious bullape  anderssen shuddered  then tarzan turned toward him  his face was cold and cruel and in the grey eyes the swede read murder  where is my wife growled the apeman  where is the child  anderssen tried to reply but a sudden fit of coughing choked him there was an arrow entirely through his chest and as he coughed the blood from his wounded lung poured suddenly from his mouth and nostrils  tarzan stood waiting for the paroxysm to pass  like a bronze imagecold hard and relentlesshe stood over the helpless man waiting to wring such information from him as he needed and then to kill  presently the coughing and haemorrhage ceased and again the wounded man tried to speak  tarzan knelt near the faintly moving lips  the wife and child he repeated  where are they  anderssen pointed up the trail  the russianhe got them he whispered  how did you come here continued tarzan  why are you not with rokoff  they catch us replied anderssen in a voice so low that the apeman could just distinguish the words   they catch us  ay fight but my men they all run away   then they get me when ay ban vounded  rokoff he say leave me here for the hyenas  that vas vorse than to kill   he tak your vife and kid  what were you doing with themwhere were you taking them asked tarzan and then fiercely leaping close to the fellow with fierce eyes blazing with the passion of hate and vengeance that he had with difficulty controlled what harm did you do to my wife or child speak quick before i kill you  make your peace with god  tell me the worst or i will tear you to pieces with my hands and teeth  you have seen that i can do it  a look of wideeyed surprise overspread anderssens face  why he whispered ay did not hurt them  ay tried to save them from that russian  your vife was kind to me on the kincaid and ay hear that little baby cry sometimes   ay got a vife an kid for my own by christiania an ay couldnt bear for to see them separated an in rokoffs hands any more   that vas all  do ay look like ay ban here to hurt them he continued after a pause pointing to the arrow protruding from his breast  there was something in the mans tone and expression that convinced tarzan of the truth of his assertions  more weighty than anything else was the fact that anderssen evidently seemed more hurt than frightened he knew he was going to die so tarzans threats had little effect upon him but it was quite apparent that he wished the englishman to know the truth and not to wrong him by harbouring the belief that his words and manner indicated that he had entertained  the apeman instantly dropped to his knees beside the swede  i am sorry he said very simply  i had looked for none but knaves in company with rokoff  i see that i was wrong   that is past now and we will drop it for the more important matter of getting you to a place of comfort and looking after your wounds  we must have you on your feet again as soon as possible  the swede smiling shook his head  you go on an look for the vife an kid he said   ay ban as gude as dead already buthe hesitateday hate to think of the hyenas vont you finish up this job  tarzan shuddered  a moment ago he had been upon the point of killing this man  now he could no more have taken his life than he could have taken the life of any of his best friends  he lifted the swedes head in his arms to change and ease his position  again came a fit of coughing and the terrible haemorrhage   after it was over anderssen lay with closed eyes  tarzan thought that he was dead until he suddenly raised his eyes to those of the apeman sighed and spokein a very low weak whisper  ay tank it blow purty soon purty hard he said and died     chapter 11  tambudza   tarzan scooped a shallow grave for the kincaids cook beneath whose repulsive exterior had beaten the heart of a chivalrous gentleman that was all he could do in the cruel jungle for the man who had given his life in the service of his little son and his wife  then tarzan took up again the pursuit of rokoff  now that he was positive that the woman ahead of him was indeed jane and that she had again fallen into the hands of the russian it seemed that with all the incredible speed of his fleet and agile muscles he moved at but a snails pace  it was with difficulty that he kept the trail for there were many paths through the jungle at this pointcrossing and crisscrossing forking and branching in all directions and over them all had passed natives innumerable coming and going   the spoor of the white men was obliterated by that of the native carriers who had followed them and over all was the spoor of other natives and of wild beasts  it was most perplexing yet tarzan kept on assiduously checking his sense of sight against his sense of smell that he might more surely keep to the right trail  but with all his care night found him at a point where he was positive that he was on the wrong trail entirely  he knew that the pack would follow his spoor and so he had been careful to make it as distinct as possible brushing often against the vines and creepers that walled the junglepath and in other ways leaving his scentspoor plainly discernible  as darkness settled a heavy rain set in and there was nothing for the baffled apeman to do but wait in the partial shelter of a huge tree until morning but the coming of dawn brought no cessation of the torrential downpour  for a week the sun was obscured by heavy clouds while violent rain and wind storms obliterated the last remnants of the spoor tarzan constantly though vainly sought  during all this time he saw no signs of natives nor of his own pack the members of which he feared had lost his trail during the terrific storm  as the country was strange to him he had been unable to judge his course accurately since he had had neither sun by day nor moon nor stars by night to guide him  when the sun at last broke through the clouds in the forenoon of the seventh day it looked down upon an almost frantic apeman  for the first time in his life tarzan of the apes had been lost in the jungle  that the experience should have befallen him at such a time seemed cruel beyond expression  somewhere in this savage land his wife and son lay in the clutches of the archfiend rokoff  what hideous trials might they not have undergone during those seven awful days that nature had thwarted him in his endeavours to locate them  tarzan knew the russian in whose power they were so well that he could not doubt but that the man filled with rage that jane had once escaped him and knowing that tarzan might be close upon his trail would wreak without further loss of time whatever vengeance his polluted mind might be able to conceive  but now that the sun shone once more the apeman was still at a loss as to what direction to take  he knew that rokoff had left the river in pursuit of anderssen but whether he would continue inland or return to the ugambi was a question  the apeman had seen that the river at the point he had left it was growing narrow and swift so that he judged that it could not be navigable even for canoes to any great distance farther toward its source  however if rokoff had not returned to the river in what direction had he proceeded  from the direction of anderssens flight with jane and the child tarzan was convinced that the man had purposed attempting the tremendous feat of crossing the continent to zanzibar but whether rokoff would dare so dangerous a journey or not was a question  fear might drive him to the attempt now that he knew the manner of horrible pack that was upon his trail and that tarzan of the apes was following him to wreak upon him the vengeance that he deserved  at last the apeman determined to continue toward the northeast in the general direction of german east africa until he came upon natives from whom he might gain information as to rokoffs whereabouts  the second day following the cessation of the rain tarzan came upon a native village the inhabitants of which fled into the bush the instant their eyes fell upon him  tarzan not to be thwarted in any such manner as this pursued them and after a brief chase caught up with a young warrior  the fellow was so badly frightened that he was unable to defend himself dropping his weapons and falling upon the ground wideeyed and screaming as he gazed on his captor  it was with considerable difficulty that the apeman quieted the fellows fears sufficiently to obtain a coherent statement from him as to the cause of his uncalledfor terror  from him tarzan learned by dint of much coaxing that a party of whites had passed through the village several days before  these men had told them of a terrible white devil that pursued them warning the natives against it and the frightful pack of demons that accompanied it  the black had recognized tarzan as the white devil from the descriptions given by the whites and their black servants   behind him he had expected to see a horde of demons disguised as apes and panthers  in this tarzan saw the cunning hand of rokoff  the russian was attempting to make travel as difficult as possible for him by turning the natives against him in superstitious fear  the native further told tarzan that the white man who had led the recent expedition had promised them a fabulous reward if they would kill the white devil  this they had fully intended doing should the opportunity present itself but the moment they had seen tarzan their blood had turned to water as the porters of the white men had told them would be the case  finding the apeman made no attempt to harm him the native at last recovered his grasp upon his courage and at tarzans suggestion accompanied the white devil back to the village calling as he went for his fellows to return also as the white devil has promised to do you no harm if you come back right away and answer his questions  one by one the blacks straggled into the village but that their fears were not entirely allayed was evident from the amount of white that showed about the eyes of the majority of them as they cast constant and apprehensive sidelong glances at the apeman  the chief was among the first to return to the village and as it was he that tarzan was most anxious to interview he lost no time in entering into a palaver with the black  the fellow was short and stout with an unusually low and degraded countenance and apelike arms  his whole expression denoted deceitfulness  only the superstitious terror engendered in him by the stories poured into his ears by the whites and blacks of the russians party kept him from leaping upon tarzan with his warriors and slaying him forthwith for he and his people were inveterate maneaters  but the fear that he might indeed be a devil and that out there in the jungle behind him his fierce demons waited to do his bidding kept mganwazam from putting his desires into action  tarzan questioned the fellow closely and by comparing his statements with those of the young warrior he had first talked with he learned that rokoff and his safari were in terrorstricken retreat in the direction of the far east coast  many of the russians porters had already deserted him   in that very village he had hanged five for theft and attempted desertion  judging however from what the waganwazam had learned from those of the russians blacks who were not too far gone in terror of the brutal rokoff to fear even to speak of their plans it was apparent that he would not travel any great distance before the last of his porters cooks tentboys gunbearers askari and even his headman would have turned back into the bush leaving him to the mercy of the merciless jungle  mganwazam denied that there had been any white woman or child with the party of whites but even as he spoke tarzan was convinced that he lied  several times the apeman approached the subject from different angles but never was he successful in surprising the wily cannibal into a direct contradiction of his original statement that there had been no women or children with the party  tarzan demanded food of the chief and after considerable haggling on the part of the monarch succeeded in obtaining a meal  he then tried to draw out others of the tribe especially the young man whom he had captured in the bush but mganwazams presence sealed their lips  at last convinced that these people knew a great deal more than they had told him concerning the whereabouts of the russian and the fate of jane and the child tarzan determined to remain overnight among them in the hope of discovering something further of importance  when he had stated his decision to the chief he was rather surprised to note the sudden change in the fellows attitude toward him  from apparent dislike and suspicion mganwazam became a most eager and solicitous host  nothing would do but that the apeman should occupy the best hut in the village from which mganwazams oldest wife was forthwith summarily ejected while the chief took up his temporary abode in the hut of one of his younger consorts  had tarzan chanced to recall the fact that a princely reward had been offered the blacks if they should succeed in killing him he might have more quickly interpreted mganwazams sudden change in front  to have the white giant sleeping peacefully in one of his own huts would greatly facilitate the matter of earning the reward and so the chief was urgent in his suggestions that tarzan doubtless being very much fatigued after his travels should retire early to the comforts of the anything but inviting palace  as much as the apeman detested the thought of sleeping within a native hut he had determined to do so this night on the chance that he might be able to induce one of the younger men to sit and chat with him before the fire that burned in the centre of the smokefilled dwelling and from him draw the truths he sought  so tarzan accepted the invitation of old mganwazam insisting however that he much preferred sharing a hut with some of the younger men rather than driving the chiefs old wife out in the cold  the toothless old hag grinned her appreciation of this suggestion and as the plan still better suited the chiefs scheme in that it would permit him to surround tarzan with a gang of picked assassins he readily assented so that presently tarzan had been installed in a hut close to the village gate  as there was to be a dance that night in honour of a band of recently returned hunters tarzan was left alone in the hut the young men as mganwazam explained having to take part in the festivities  as soon as the apeman was safely installed in the trap mganwazam called about him the young warriors whom he had selected to spend the night with the white devil  none of them was overly enthusiastic about the plan since deep in their superstitious hearts lay an exaggerated fear of the strange white giant but the word of mganwazam was law among his people so not one dared refuse the duty he was called upon to perform  as mganwazam unfolded his plan in whispers to the savages squatting about him the old toothless hag to whom tarzan had saved her hut for the night hovered about the conspirators ostensibly to replenish the supply of firewood for the blaze about which the men sat but really to drink in as much of their conversation as possible  tarzan had slept for perhaps an hour or two despite the savage din of the revellers when his keen senses came suddenly alert to a suspiciously stealthy movement in the hut in which he lay  the fire had died down to a little heap of glowing embers which accentuated rather than relieved the darkness that shrouded the interior of the evilsmelling dwelling yet the trained senses of the apeman warned him of another presence creeping almost silently toward him through the gloom  he doubted that it was one of his hut mates returning from the festivities for he still heard the wild cries of the dancers and the din of the tomtoms in the village street without   who could it be that took such pains to conceal his approach  as the presence came within reach of him the apeman bounded lightly to the opposite side of the hut his spear poised ready at his side  who is it he asked that creeps upon tarzan of the apes like a hungry lion out of the darkness  silence bwana replied an old cracked voice  it is tambudzashe whose hut you would not take and thus drive an old woman out into the cold night  what does tambudza want of tarzan of the apes asked the apeman  you were kind to me to whom none is now kind and i have come to warn you in payment of your kindness answered the old hag  warn me of what  mganwazam has chosen the young men who are to sleep in the hut with you replied tambudza  i was near as he talked with them and heard him issuing his instructions to them   when the dance is run well into the morning they are to come to the hut  if you are awake they are to pretend that they have come to sleep but if you sleep it is mganwazams command that you be killed  if you are not then asleep they will wait quietly beside you until you do sleep and then they will all fall upon you together and slay you  mganwazam is determined to win the reward the white man has offered  i had forgotten the reward said tarzan half to himself and then he added how may mganwazam hope to collect the reward now that the white men who are my enemies have left his country and gone he knows not where  oh they have not gone far replied tambudza   mganwazam knows where they camp  his runners could quickly overtake themthey move slowly  where are they asked tarzan  do you wish to come to them asked tambudza in way of reply  tarzan nodded  i cannot tell you where they lie so that you could come to the place yourself but i could lead you to them bwana  in their interest in the conversation neither of the speakers had noticed the little figure which crept into the darkness of the hut behind them nor did they see it when it slunk noiselessly out again  it was little buulaoo the chiefs son by one of his younger wivesa vindictive degenerate little rascal who hated tambudza and was ever seeking opportunities to spy upon her and report her slightest breach of custom to his father  come then said tarzan quickly let us be on our way  this buulaoo did not hear for he was already legging it up the village street to where his hideous sire guzzled native beer and watched the evolutions of the frantic dancers leaping high in the air and cavorting wildly in their hysterical capers  so it happened that as tarzan and tambudza sneaked warily from the village and melted into the stygian darkness of the jungle two lithe runners took their way in the same direction though by another trail  when they had come sufficiently far from the village to make it safe for them to speak above a whisper tarzan asked the old woman if she had seen aught of a white woman and a little child  yes bwana replied tambudza there was a woman with them and a little childa little white piccaninny   it died here in our village of the fever and they buried it     chapter 12  a black scoundrel   when jane clayton regained consciousness she saw anderssen standing over her holding the baby in his arms  as her eyes rested upon them an expression of misery and horror overspread her countenance  what is the matter he asked  you ban sick  where is my baby she cried ignoring his questions  anderssen held out the chubby infant but she shook her head  it is not mine she said  you knew that it was not mine   you are a devil like the russian  anderssens blue eyes stretched in surprise  not yours he exclaimed  you tole me the kid aboard the kincaid ban your kid  not this one replied jane dully  the other  where is the other there must have been two  i did not know about this one  there vasnt no other kid  ay tank this ban yours  ay am very sorry  anderssen fidgeted about standing first on one foot and then upon the other  it was perfectly evident to jane that he was honest in his protestations of ignorance of the true identity of the child  presently the baby commenced to crow and bounce up and down in the swedes arms at the same time leaning forward with little hands outreaching toward the young woman  she could not withstand the appeal and with a low cry she sprang to her feet and gathered the baby to her breast  for a few minutes she wept silently her face buried in the babys soiled little dress  the first shock of disappointment that the tiny thing had not been her beloved jack was giving way to a great hope that after all some miracle had occurred to snatch her baby from rokoffs hands at the last instant before the kincaid sailed from england  then too there was the mute appeal of this wee waif alone and unloved in the midst of the horrors of the savage jungle   it was this thought more than any other that had sent her mothers heart out to the innocent babe while still she suffered from disappointment that she had been deceived in its identity  have you no idea whose child this is she asked anderssen  the man shook his head  not now he said  if he aint ban your kid ay don know whose kid he do ban  rokoff said it was yours  ay tank he tank so too  what do we do with it now  ay cant go back to the kincaid   rokoff would have me shot but you can go back  ay take you to the sea and then some of these black men they take you to the shipeh  no no cried jane  not for the world  i would rather die than fall into the hands of that man again  no let us go on and take this poor little creature with us  if god is willing we shall be saved in one way or another  so they again took up their flight through the wilderness taking with them a halfdozen of the mosulas to carry provisions and the tents that anderssen had smuggled aboard the small boat in preparation for the attempted escape  the days and nights of torture that the young woman suffered were so merged into one long unbroken nightmare of hideousness that she soon lost all track of time  whether they had been wandering for days or years she could not tell   the one bright spot in that eternity of fear and suffering was the little child whose tiny hands had long since fastened their softly groping fingers firmly about her heart  in a way the little thing took the place and filled the aching void that the theft of her own baby had left  it could never be the same of course but yet day by day she found her motherlove enveloping the waif more closely until she sometimes sat with closed eyes lost in the sweet imagining that the little bundle of humanity at her breast was truly her own  for some time their progress inland was extremely slow   word came to them from time to time through natives passing from the coast on hunting excursions that rokoff had not yet guessed the direction of their flight  this and the desire to make the journey as light as possible for the gently bred woman kept anderssen to a slow advance of short and easy marches with many rests  the swede insisted upon carrying the child while they travelled and in countless other ways did what he could to help jane clayton conserve her strength  he had been terribly chagrined on discovering the mistake he had made in the identity of the baby but once the young woman became convinced that his motives were truly chivalrous she would not permit him longer to upbraid himself for the error that he could not by any means have avoided  at the close of each days march anderssen saw to the erection of a comfortable shelter for jane and the child   her tent was always pitched in the most favourable location   the thorn boma round it was the strongest and most impregnable that the mosula could construct  her food was the best that their limited stores and the rifle of the swede could provide but the thing that touched her heart the closest was the gentle consideration and courtesy which the man always accorded her  that such nobility of character could lie beneath so repulsive an exterior never ceased to be a source of wonder and amazement to her until at last the innate chivalry of the man and his unfailing kindliness and sympathy transformed his appearance in so far as jane was concerned until she saw only the sweetness of his character mirrored in his countenance  they had commenced to make a little better progress when word reached them that rokoff was but a few marches behind them and that he had at last discovered the direction of their flight  it was then that anderssen took to the river purchasing a canoe from a chief whose village lay a short distance from the ugambi upon the bank of a tributary  thereafter the little party of fugitives fled up the broad ugambi and so rapid had their flight become that they no longer received word of their pursuers  at the end of canoe navigation upon the river they abandoned their canoe and took to the jungle  here progress became at once arduous slow and dangerous  the second day after leaving the ugambi the baby fell ill with fever anderssen knew what the outcome must be but he had not the heart to tell jane clayton the truth for he had seen that the young woman had come to love the child almost as passionately as though it had been her own flesh and blood  as the babys condition precluded farther advance anderssen withdrew a little from the main trail he had been following and built a camp in a natural clearing on the bank of a little river  here jane devoted her every moment to caring for the tiny sufferer and as though her sorrow and anxiety were not all that she could bear a further blow came with the sudden announcement of one of the mosula porters who had been foraging in the jungle adjacent that rokoff and his party were camped quite close to them and were evidently upon their trail to this little nook which all had thought so excellent a hidingplace  this information could mean but one thing and that they must break camp and fly onward regardless of the babys condition   jane clayton knew the traits of the russian well enough to be positive that he would separate her from the child the moment that he recaptured them and she knew that separation would mean the immediate death of the baby  as they stumbled forward through the tangled vegetation along an old and almost overgrown game trail the mosula porters deserted them one by one  the men had been staunch enough in their devotion and loyalty as long as they were in no danger of being overtaken by the russian and his party  they had heard however so much of the atrocious disposition of rokoff that they had grown to hold him in mortal terror and now that they knew he was close upon them their timid hearts would fortify them no longer and as quickly as possible they deserted the three whites  yet on and on went anderssen and the girl  the swede went ahead to hew a way through the brush where the path was entirely overgrown so that on this march it was necessary that the young woman carry the child  all day they marched  late in the afternoon they realized that they had failed  close behind them they heard the noise of a large safari advancing along the trail which they had cleared for their pursuers  when it became quite evident that they must be overtaken in a short time anderssen hid jane behind a large tree covering her and the child with brush  there is a village about a mile farther on he said to her   the mosula told me its location before they deserted us   ay try to lead the russian off your trail then you go on to the village  ay tank the chief ban friendly to white menthe mosula tal me he ban  anyhow that was all we can do  after while you get chief to tak you down by the mosula village at the sea again an after a while a ship is sure to put into the mouth of the ugambi  then you be all right  gudeby an gude luck to you lady  but where are you going sven asked jane  why cant you hide here and go back to the sea with me  ay gotta tal the russian you ban dead so that he dont luke for you no more and anderssen grinned  why cant you join me then after you have told him that insisted the girl  anderssen shook his head  ay dont tank ay join anybody any more after ay tal the russian you ban dead he said  you dont mean that you think he will kill you asked jane and yet in her heart she knew that that was exactly what the great scoundrel would do in revenge for his having been thwarted by the swede anderssen did not reply other than to warn her to silence and point toward the path along which they had just come  i dont care whispered jane clayton  i shall not let you die to save me if i can prevent it in any way  give me your revolver  i can use that and together we may be able to hold them off until we can find some means of escape  it wont work lady replied anderssen  they would only get us both and then ay couldnt do you no good at all   think of the kid lady and what it would be for you both to fall into rokoffs hands again  for his sake you must do what ay say  here take my rifle and ammunition you may need them  he shoved the gun and bandoleer into the shelter beside jane   then he was gone  she watched him as he returned along the path to meet the oncoming safari of the russian  soon a turn in the trail hid him from view  her first impulse was to follow  with the rifle she might be of assistance to him and further she could not bear the terrible thought of being left alone at the mercy of the fearful jungle without a single friend to aid her  she started to crawl from her shelter with the intention of running after anderssen as fast as she could  as she drew the baby close to her she glanced down into its little face  how red it was  how unnatural the little thing looked   she raised the cheek to hers  it was fiery hot with fever  with a little gasp of terror jane clayton rose to her feet in the jungle path  the rifle and bandoleer lay forgotten in the shelter beside her  anderssen was forgotten and rokoff and her great peril  all that rioted through her fearmad brain was the fearful fact that this little helpless child was stricken with the terrible junglefever and that she was helpless to do aught to allay its sufferingssufferings that were sure to come during ensuing intervals of partial consciousness  her one thought was to find some one who could help hersome woman who had had children of her ownand with the thought came recollection of the friendly village of which anderssen had spoken  if she could but reach itin time  there was no time to be lost  like a startled antelope she turned and fled up the trail in the direction anderssen had indicated  from far behind came the sudden shouting of men the sound of shots and then silence  she knew that anderssen had met the russian  a halfhour later she stumbled exhausted into a little thatched village  instantly she was surrounded by men women and children eager curious excited natives plied her with a hundred questions no one of which she could understand or answer  all that she could do was to point tearfully at the baby now wailing piteously in her arms and repeat over and over feverfeverfever  the blacks did not understand her words but they saw the cause of her trouble and soon a young woman had pulled her into a hut and with several others was doing her poor best to quiet the child and allay its agony  the witch doctor came and built a little fire before the infant upon which he boiled some strange concoction in a small earthen pot making weird passes above it and mumbling strange monotonous chants presently he dipped a zebras tail into the brew and with further mutterings and incantations sprinkled a few drops of the liquid over the babys face  after he had gone the women sat about and moaned and wailed until jane thought that she should go mad but knowing that they were doing it all out of the kindness of their hearts she endured the frightful waking nightmare of those awful hours in dumb and patient suffering  it must have been well toward midnight that she became conscious of a sudden commotion in the village  she heard the voices of the natives raised in controversy but she could not understand the words  presently she heard footsteps approaching the hut in which she squatted before a bright fire with the baby on her lap   the little thing lay very still now its lids halfraised showed the pupils horribly upturned  jane clayton looked into the little face with fearhaunted eyes  it was not her babynot her flesh and bloodbut how close how dear the tiny helpless thing had become to her   her heart bereft of its own had gone out to this poor little nameless waif and lavished upon it all the love that had been denied her during the long bitter weeks of her captivity aboard the kincaid  she saw that the end was near and though she was terrified at contemplation of her loss still she hoped that it would come quickly now and end the sufferings of the little victim  the footsteps she had heard without the hut now halted before the door there was a whispered colloquy and a moment later mganwazam chief of the tribe entered  she had seen but little of him as the women had taken her in hand almost as soon as she had entered the village  mganwazam she now saw was an evilappearing savage with every mark of brutal degeneracy writ large upon his bestial countenance  to jane clayton he looked more gorilla than human  he tried to converse with her but without success and finally he called to some one without  in answer to his summons another negro entereda man of very different appearance from mganwazamso different in fact that jane clayton immediately decided that he was of another tribe  this man acted as interpreter and almost from the first question that mganwazam put to her jane felt an intuitive conviction that the savage was attempting to draw information from her for some ulterior motive  she thought it strange that the fellow should so suddenly have become interested in her plans and especially in her intended destination when her journey had been interrupted at his village  seeing no reason for withholding the information she told him the truth but when he asked if she expected to meet her husband at the end of the trip she shook her head negatively  then he told her the purpose of his visit talking through the interpreter  i have just learned he said from some men who live by the side of the great water that your husband followed you up the ugambi for several marches when he was at last set upon by natives and killed therefore i have told you this that you might not waste your time in a long journey if you expected to meet your husband at the end of it but instead could turn and retrace your steps to the coast  jane thanked mganwazam for his kindness though her heart was numb with suffering at this new blow  she who had suffered so much was at last beyond reach of the keenest of miserys pangs for her senses were numbed and calloused  with bowed head she sat staring with unseeing eyes upon the face of the baby in her lap  mganwazam had left the hut   sometime later she heard a noise at the entranceanother had entered  one of the women sitting opposite her threw a faggot upon the dying embers of the fire between them  with a sudden flare it burst into renewed flame lighting up the huts interior as though by magic  the flame disclosed to jane claytons horrified gaze that the baby was quite dead  how long it had been so she could not guess  a choking lump rose to her throat her head drooped in silent misery upon the little bundle that she had caught suddenly to her breast  for a moment the silence of the hut was unbroken  then the native woman broke into a hideous wail  a man coughed close before jane clayton and spoke her name  with a start she raised her eyes to look into the sardonic countenance of nikolas rokoff     chapter 13  escape   for a moment rokoff stood sneering down upon jane clayton then his eyes fell to the little bundle in her lap  jane had drawn one corner of the blanket over the childs face so that to one who did not know the truth it seemed but to be sleeping  you have gone to a great deal of unnecessary trouble said rokoff to bring the child to this village  if you had attended to your own affairs i should have brought it here myself  you would have been spared the dangers and fatigue of the journey but i suppose i must thank you for relieving me of the inconvenience of having to care for a young infant on the march  this is the village to which the child was destined from the first mganwazam will rear him carefully making a good cannibal of him and if you ever chance to return to civilization it will doubtless afford you much food for thought as you compare the luxuries and comforts of your life with the details of the life your son is living in the village of the waganwazam  again i thank you for bringing him here for me and now i must ask you to surrender him to me that i may turn him over to his foster parents as he concluded rokoff held out his hands for the child a nasty grin of vindictiveness upon his lips  to his surprise jane clayton rose and without a word of protest laid the little bundle in his arms  here is the child she said  thank god he is beyond your power to harm  grasping the import of her words rokoff snatched the blanket from the childs face to seek confirmation of his fears   jane clayton watched his expression closely  she had been puzzled for days for an answer to the question of rokoffs knowledge of the childs identity  if she had been in doubt before the last shred of that doubt was wiped away as she witnessed the terrible anger of the russian as he looked upon the dead face of the baby and realized that at the last moment his dearest wish for vengeance had been thwarted by a higher power  almost throwing the body of the child back into jane claytons arms rokoff stamped up and down the hut pounding the air with his clenched fists and cursing terribly  at last he halted in front of the young woman bringing his face down close to hers  you are laughing at me he shrieked  you think that you have beaten meeh  ill show you as i have shown the miserable ape you call husband what it means to interfere with the plans of nikolas rokoff  you have robbed me of the child  i cannot make him the son of a cannibal chief butand he paused as though to let the full meaning of his threat sink deepi can make the mother the wife of a cannibal and that i shall doafter i have finished with her myself  if he had thought to wring from jane clayton any sign of terror he failed miserably  she was beyond that  her brain and nerves were numb to suffering and shock  to his surprise a faint almost happy smile touched her lips   she was thinking with thankful heart that this poor little corpse was not that of her own wee jack and thatbest of allrokoff evidently did not know the truth  she would have liked to have flaunted the fact in his face but she dared not  if he continued to believe that the child had been hers so much safer would be the real jack wherever he might be  she had of course no knowledge of the whereabouts of her little sonshe did not know even that he still lived and yet there was the chance that he might  it was more than possible that without rokoffs knowledge this child had been substituted for hers by one of the russians confederates and that even now her son might be safe with friends in london where there were many both able and willing to have paid any ransom which the traitorous conspirator might have asked for the safe release of lord greystokes son  she had thought it all out a hundred times since she had discovered that the baby which anderssen had placed in her arms that night upon the kincaid was not her own and it had been a constant and gnawing source of happiness to her to dream the whole fantasy through in its every detail  no the russian must never know that this was not her baby   she realized that her position was hopelesswith anderssen and her husband dead there was no one in all the world with a desire to succour her who knew where she might be found  rokoffs threat she realized was no idle one  that he would do or attempt to do all that he had promised she was perfectly sure but at the worst it meant but a little earlier release from the hideous anguish that she had been enduring   she must find some way to take her own life before the russian could harm her further  just now she wanted timetime to think and prepare herself for the end  she felt that she could not take the last awful step until she had exhausted every possibility of escape   she did not care to live unless she might find her way back to her own child but slight as such a hope appeared she would not admit its impossibility until the last moment had come and she faced the fearful reality of choosing between the final alternativesnikolas rokoff on one hand and selfdestruction upon the other  go away she said to the russian  go away and leave me in peace with my dead  have you not brought sufficient misery and anguish upon me without attempting to harm me further  what wrong have i ever done you that you should persist in persecuting me  you are suffering for the sins of the monkey you chose when you might have had the love of a gentlemanof nikolas rokoff he replied  but where is the use in discussing the matter  we shall bury the child here and you will return with me at once to my own camp  tomorrow i shall bring you back and turn you over to your new husbandthe lovely mganwazam  come  he reached out for the child  jane who was on her feet now turned away from him  i shall bury the body she said  send some men to dig a grave outside the village  rokoff was anxious to have the thing over and get back to his camp with his victim  he thought he saw in her apathy a resignation to her fate stepping outside the hut he motioned her to follow him and a moment later with his men he escorted jane beyond the village where beneath a great tree the blacks scooped a shallow grave  wrapping the tiny body in a blanket jane laid it tenderly in the black hole and turning her head that she might not see the mouldy earth falling upon the pitiful little bundle she breathed a prayer beside the grave of the nameless waif that had won its way to the innermost recesses of her heart  then dryeyed but suffering she rose and followed the russian through the stygian blackness of the jungle along the winding leafy corridor that led from the village of mganwazam the black cannibal to the camp of nikolas rokoff the white fiend  beside them in the impenetrable thickets that fringed the path rising to arch above it and shut out the moon the girl could hear the stealthy muffled footfalls of great beasts and ever round about them rose the deafening roars of hunting lions until the earth trembled to the mighty sound  the porters lighted torches now and waved them upon either hand to frighten off the beasts of prey  rokoff urged them to greater speed and from the quavering note in his voice jane clayton knew that he was weak from terror  the sounds of the jungle night recalled most vividly the days and nights that she had spent in a similar jungle with her forest godwith the fearless and unconquerable tarzan of the apes  then there had been no thoughts of terror though the jungle noises were new to her and the roar of a lion had seemed the most aweinspiring sound upon the great earth  how different would it be now if she knew that he was somewhere there in the wilderness seeking her  then indeed would there be that for which to live and every reason to believe that succour was close at handbut he was dead  it was incredible that it should be so  there seemed no place in death for that great body and those mighty thews  had rokoff been the one to tell her of her lords passing she would have known that he lied   there could be no reason she thought why mganwazam should have deceived her  she did not know that the russian had talked with the savage a few minutes before the chief had come to her with his tale  at last they reached the rude boma that rokoffs porters had thrown up round the russians camp  here they found all in turmoil  she did not know what it was all about but she saw that rokoff was very angry and from bits of conversation which she could translate she gleaned that there had been further desertions while he had been absent and that the deserters had taken the bulk of his food and ammunition  when he had done venting his rage upon those who remained he returned to where jane stood under guard of a couple of his white sailors  he grasped her roughly by the arm and started to drag her toward his tent the girl struggled and fought to free herself while the two sailors stood by laughing at the rare treat  rokoff did not hesitate to use rough methods when he found that he was to have difficulty in carrying out his designs   repeatedly he struck jane clayton in the face until at last halfconscious she was dragged within his tent  rokoffs boy had lighted the russians lamp and now at a word from his master he made himself scarce  jane had sunk to the floor in the middle of the enclosure  slowly her numbed senses were returning to her and she was commencing to think very fast indeed  quickly her eyes ran round the interior of the tent taking in every detail of its equipment and contents  now the russian was lifting her to her feet and attempting to drag her to the camp cot that stood at one side of the tent   at his belt hung a heavy revolver  jane claytons eyes riveted themselves upon it  her palm itched to grasp the huge butt   she feigned again to swoon but through her halfclosed lids she waited her opportunity  it came just as rokoff was lifting her upon the cot  a noise at the tent door behind him brought his head quickly about and away from the girl  the butt of the gun was not an inch from her hand  with a single lightninglike move she snatched the weapon from its holster and at the same instant rokoff turned back toward her realizing his peril  she did not dare fire for fear the shot would bring his people about him and with rokoff dead she would fall into hands no better than his and to a fate probably even worse than he alone could have imagined the memory of the two brutes who stood and laughed as rokoff struck her was still vivid  as the rage and fearfilled countenance of the slav turned toward her jane clayton raised the heavy revolver high above the pasty face and with all her strength dealt the man a terrific blow between the eyes  without a sound he sank limp and unconscious to the ground   a moment later the girl stood beside himfor a moment at least free from the menace of his lust  outside the tent she again heard the noise that had distracted rokoffs attention  what it was she did not know but fearing the return of the servant and the discovery of her deed she stepped quickly to the camp table upon which burned the oil lamp and extinguished the smudgy evilsmelling flame  in the total darkness of the interior she paused for a moment to collect her wits and plan for the next step in her venture for freedom  about her was a camp of enemies  beyond these foes a black wilderness of savage jungle peopled by hideous beasts of prey and still more hideous human beasts  there was little or no chance that she could survive even a few days of the constant dangers that would confront her there but the knowledge that she had already passed through so many perils unscathed and that somewhere out in the faraway world a little child was doubtless at that very moment crying for her filled her with determination to make the effort to accomplish the seemingly impossible and cross that awful land of horror in search of the sea and the remote chance of succour she might find there  rokoffs tent stood almost exactly in the centre of the boma surrounding it were the tents and shelters of his white companions and the natives of his safari  to pass through these and find egress through the boma seemed a task too fraught with insurmountable obstacles to warrant even the slightest consideration and yet there was no other way  to remain in the tent until she should be discovered would be to set at naught all that she had risked to gain her freedom and so with stealthy step and every sense alert she approached the back of the tent to set out upon the first stage of her adventure  groping along the rear of the canvas wall she found that there was no opening there  quickly she returned to the side of the unconscious russian  in his belt her groping fingers came upon the hilt of a long huntingknife and with this she cut a hole in the back wall of the tent  silently she stepped without  to her immense relief she saw that the camp was apparently asleep  in the dim and flickering light of the dying fires she saw but a single sentry and he was dozing upon his haunches at the opposite side of the enclosure  keeping the tent between him and herself she crossed between the small shelters of the native porters to the boma wall beyond  outside in the darkness of the tangled jungle she could hear the roaring of lions the laughing of hyenas and the countless nameless noises of the midnight jungle  for a moment she hesitated trembling  the thought of the prowling beasts out there in the darkness was appalling   then with a sudden brave toss of her head she attacked the thorny boma wall with her delicate hands  torn and bleeding though they were she worked on breathlessly until she had made an opening through which she could worm her body and at last she stood outside the enclosure  behind her lay a fate worse than death at the hands of human beings  before her lay an almost certain fatebut it was only deathsudden merciful and honourable death  without a tremor and without regret she darted away from the camp and a moment later the mysterious jungle had closed about her     chapter 14  alone in the jungle   tambudza leading tarzan of the apes toward the camp of the russian moved very slowly along the winding jungle path for she was old and her legs stiff with rheumatism  so it was that the runners dispatched by mganwazam to warn rokoff that the white giant was in his village and that he would be slain that night reached the russians camp before tarzan and his ancient guide had covered half the distance  the guides found the white mans camp in a turmoil   rokoff had that morning been discovered stunned and bleeding within his tent  when he had recovered his senses and realized that jane clayton had escaped his rage was boundless  rushing about the camp with his rifle he had sought to shoot down the native sentries who had allowed the young woman to elude their vigilance but several of the other whites realizing that they were already in a precarious position owing to the numerous desertions that rokoffs cruelty had brought about seized and disarmed him  then came the messengers from mganwazam but scarce had they told their story and rokoff was preparing to depart with them for their village when other runners panting from the exertions of their swift flight through the jungle rushed breathless into the firelight crying that the great white giant had escaped from mganwazam and was already on his way to wreak vengeance against his enemies  instantly confusion reigned within the encircling boma  the blacks belonging to rokoffs safari were terrorstricken at the thought of the proximity of the white giant who hunted through the jungle with a fierce pack of apes and panthers at his heels  before the whites realized what had happened the superstitious fears of the natives had sent them scurrying into the bushtheir own carriers as well as the messengers from mganwazambut even in their haste they had not neglected to take with them every article of value upon which they could lay their hands  thus rokoff and the seven white sailors found themselves deserted and robbed in the midst of a wilderness  the russian following his usual custom berated his companions laying all the blame upon their shoulders for the events which had led up to the almost hopeless condition in which they now found themselves but the sailors were in no mood to brook his insults and his cursing  in the midst of this tirade one of them drew a revolver and fired pointblank at the russian  the fellows aim was poor but his act so terrified rokoff that he turned and fled for his tent  as he ran his eyes chanced to pass beyond the boma to the edge of the forest and there he caught a glimpse of that which sent his craven heart cold with a fear that almost expunged his terror of the seven men at his back who by this time were all firing in hate and revenge at his retreating figure  what he saw was the giant figure of an almost naked white man emerging from the bush  darting into his tent the russian did not halt in his flight but kept right on through the rear wall taking advantage of the long slit that jane clayton had made the night before  the terrorstricken muscovite scurried like a hunted rabbit through the hole that still gaped in the bomas wall at the point where his own prey had escaped and as tarzan approached the camp upon the opposite side rokoff disappeared into the jungle in the wake of jane clayton  as the apeman entered the boma with old tambudza at his elbow the seven sailors recognizing him turned and fled in the opposite direction  tarzan saw that rokoff was not among them and so he let them go their wayhis business was with the russian whom he expected to find in his tent  as to the sailors he was sure that the jungle would exact from them expiation for their villainies nor doubtless was he wrong for his were the last white mans eyes to rest upon any of them  finding rokoffs tent empty tarzan was about to set out in search of the russian when tambudza suggested to him that the departure of the white man could only have resulted from word reaching him from mganwazam that tarzan was in his village  he has doubtless hastened there argued the old woman  if you would find him let us return at once  tarzan himself thought that this would probably prove to be the fact so he did not waste time in an endeavour to locate the russians trail but instead set out briskly for the village of mganwazam leaving tambudza to plod slowly in his wake  his one hope was that jane was still safe and with rokoff   if this was the case it would be but a matter of an hour or more before he should be able to wrest her from the russian  he knew now that mganwazam was treacherous and that he might have to fight to regain possession of his wife   he wished that mugambi sheeta akut and the balance of the pack were with him for he realized that singlehanded it would be no childs play to bring jane safely from the clutches of two such scoundrels as rokoff and the wily mganwazam  to his surprise he found no sign of either rokoff or jane in the village and as he could not trust the word of the chief he wasted no time in futile inquiry  so sudden and unexpected had been his return and so quickly had he vanished into the jungle after learning that those he sought were not among the waganwazam that old mganwazam had no time to prevent his going  swinging through the trees he hastened back to the deserted camp he had so recently left for here he knew was the logical place to take up the trail of rokoff and jane  arrived at the boma he circled carefully about the outside of the enclosure until opposite a break in the thorny wall he came to indications that something had recently passed into the jungle  his acute sense of smell told him that both of those he sought had fled from the camp in this direction and a moment later he had taken up the trail and was following the faint spoor  far ahead of him a terrorstricken young woman was slinking along a narrow gametrail fearful that the next moment would bring her face to face with some savage beast or equally savage man  as she ran on hoping against hope that she had hit upon the direction that would lead her eventually to the great river she came suddenly upon a familiar spot  at one side of the trail beneath a giant tree lay a little heap of loosely piled brushto her dying day that little spot of jungle would be indelibly impressed upon her memory   it was where anderssen had hidden herwhere he had given up his life in the vain effort to save her from rokoff  at sight of it she recalled the rifle and ammunition that the man had thrust upon her at the last moment  until now she had forgotten them entirely  still clutched in her hand was the revolver she had snatched from rokoffs belt but that could contain at most not over six cartridgesnot enough to furnish her with food and protection both on the long journey to the sea  with bated breath she groped beneath the little mound scarce daring to hope that the treasure remained where she had left it but to her infinite relief and joy her hand came at once upon the barrel of the heavy weapon and then upon the bandoleer of cartridges  as she threw the latter about her shoulder and felt the weight of the big gamegun in her hand a sudden sense of security suffused her  it was with new hope and a feeling almost of assured success that she again set forward upon her journey  that night she slept in the crotch of a tree as tarzan had so often told her that he was accustomed to doing and early the next morning was upon her way again  late in the afternoon as she was about to cross a little clearing she was startled at the sight of a huge ape coming from the jungle upon the opposite side  the wind was blowing directly across the clearing between them and jane lost no time in putting herself downwind from the huge creature then she hid in a clump of heavy bush and watched holding the rifle ready for instant use  to her consternation she saw that the apes were pausing in the centre of the clearing  they came together in a little knot where they stood looking backward as though in expectation of the coming of others of their tribe   jane wished that they would go on for she knew that at any moment some little eddying gust of wind might carry her scent down to their nostrils and then what would the protection of her rifle amount to in the face of those gigantic muscles and mighty fangs  her eyes moved back and forth between the apes and the edge of the jungle toward which they were gazing until at last she perceived the object of their halt and the thing that they awaited  they were being stalked  of this she was positive as she saw the lithe sinewy form of a panther glide noiselessly from the jungle at the point at which the apes had emerged but a moment before  quickly the beast trotted across the clearing toward the anthropoids jane wondered at their apparent apathy and a moment later her wonder turned to amazement as she saw the great cat come quite close to the apes who appeared entirely unconcerned by its presence and squatting down in their midst fell assiduously to the business of preening which occupies most of the waking hours of the cat family  if the young woman was surprised by the sight of these natural enemies fraternizing it was with emotions little short of fear for her own sanity that she presently saw a tall muscular warrior enter the clearing and join the group of savage beasts assembled there  at first sight of the man she had been positive that he would be torn to pieces and she had half risen from her shelter raising her rifle to her shoulder to do what she could to avert the mans terrible fate  now she saw that he seemed actually conversing with the beastsissuing orders to them  presently the entire company filed on across the clearing and disappeared in the jungle upon the opposite side  with a gasp of mingled incredulity and relief jane clayton staggered to her feet and fled on away from the terrible horde that had just passed her while a halfmile behind her another individual following the same trail as she lay frozen with terror behind an anthill as the hideous band passed quite close to him  this one was rokoff but he had recognized the members of the awful aggregation as allies of tarzan of the apes   no sooner therefore had the beasts passed him than he rose and raced through the jungle as fast as he could go in order that he might put as much distance as possible between himself and these frightful beasts  so it happened that as jane clayton came to the bank of the river down which she hoped to float to the ocean and eventual rescue nikolas rokoff was but a short distance in her rear  upon the bank the girl saw a great dugout drawn halfway from the water and tied securely to a nearby tree  this she felt would solve the question of transportation to the sea could she but launch the huge unwieldy craft   unfastening the rope that had moored it to the tree jane pushed frantically upon the bow of the heavy canoe but for all the results that were apparent she might as well have been attempting to shove the earth out of its orbit  she was about winded when it occurred to her to try working the dugout into the stream by loading the stern with ballast and then rocking the bow back and forth along the bank until the craft eventually worked itself into the river  there were no stones or rocks available but along the shore she found quantities of driftwood deposited by the river at a slightly higher stage  these she gathered and piled far in the stern of the boat until at last to her immense relief she saw the bow rise gently from the mud of the bank and the stern drift slowly with the current until it again lodged a few feet farther downstream  jane found that by running back and forth between the bow and stern she could alternately raise and lower each end of the boat as she shifted her weight from one end to the other with the result that each time she leaped to the stern the canoe moved a few inches farther into the river  as the success of her plan approached more closely to fruition she became so wrapped in her efforts that she failed to note the figure of a man standing beneath a huge tree at the edge of the jungle from which he had just emerged  he watched her and her labours with a cruel and malicious grin upon his swarthy countenance  the boat at last became so nearly free of the retarding mud and of the bank that jane felt positive that she could pole it off into deeper water with one of the paddles which lay in the bottom of the rude craft  with this end in view she seized upon one of these implements and had just plunged it into the river bottom close to the shore when her eyes happened to rise to the edge of the jungle  as her gaze fell upon the figure of the man a little cry of terror rose to her lips  it was rokoff  he was running toward her now and shouting to her to wait or he would shootthough as he was entirely unarmed it was difficult to discover just how he intended making good his threat  jane clayton knew nothing of the various misfortunes that had befallen the russian since she had escaped from his tent so she believed that his followers must be close at hand  however she had no intention of falling again into the mans clutches she would rather die at once than that that should happen to her another minute and the boat would be free  once in the current of the river she would be beyond rokoffs power to stop her for there was no other boat upon the shore and no man and certainly not the cowardly rokoff would dare to attempt to swim the crocodileinfested water in an effort to overtake her  rokoff on his part was bent more upon escape than aught else   he would gladly have forgone any designs he might have had upon jane clayton would she but permit him to share this means of escape that she had discovered  he would promise anything if she would let him come aboard the dugout but he did not think that it was necessary to do so  he saw that he could easily reach the bow of the boat before it cleared the shore and then it would not be necessary to make promises of any sort  not that rokoff would have felt the slightest compunction in ignoring any promises he might have made the girl but he disliked the idea of having to sue for favour with one who had so recently assaulted and escaped him  already he was gloating over the days and nights of revenge that would be his while the heavy dugout drifted its slow way to the ocean  jane clayton working furiously to shove the boat beyond his reach suddenly realized that she was to be successful for with a little lurch the dugout swung quickly into the current just as the russian reached out to place his hand upon its bow  his fingers did not miss their goal by a halfdozen inches   the girl almost collapsed with the reaction from the terrific mental physical and nervous strain under which she had been labouring for the past few minutes  but thank heaven at last she was safe  even as she breathed a silent prayer of thanksgiving she saw a sudden expression of triumph lighten the features of the cursing russian and at the same instant he dropped suddenly to the ground grasping firmly upon something which wriggled through the mud toward the water  jane clayton crouched wideeyed and horrorstricken in the bottom of the boat as she realized that at the last instant success had been turned to failure and that she was indeed again in the power of the malignant rokoff  for the thing that the man had seen and grasped was the end of the trailing rope with which the dugout had been moored to the tree     chapter 15  down the ugambi   halfway between the ugambi and the village of the waganwazam tarzan came upon the pack moving slowly along his old spoor   mugambi could scarce believe that the trail of the russian and the mate of his savage master had passed so close to that of the pack  it seemed incredible that two human beings should have come so close to them without having been detected by some of the marvellously keen and alert beasts but tarzan pointed out the spoor of the two he trailed and at certain points the black could see that the man and the woman must have been in hiding as the pack passed them watching every move of the ferocious creatures  it had been apparent to tarzan from the first that jane and rokoff were not travelling together  the spoor showed distinctly that the young woman had been a considerable distance ahead of the russian at first though the farther the apeman continued along the trail the more obvious it became that the man was rapidly overhauling his quarry  at first there had been the spoor of wild beasts over the footprints of jane clayton while upon the top of all rokoffs spoor showed that he had passed over the trail after the animals had left their records upon the ground  but later there were fewer and fewer animal imprints occurring between those of janes and the russians feet until as he approached the river the apeman became aware that rokoff could not have been more than a few hundred yards behind the girl  he felt they must be close ahead of him now and with a little thrill of expectation he leaped rapidly forward ahead of the pack  swinging swiftly through the trees he came out upon the riverbank at the very point at which rokoff had overhauled jane as she endeavoured to launch the cumbersome dugout  in the mud along the bank the apeman saw the footprints of the two he sought but there was neither boat nor people there when he arrived nor at first glance any sign of their whereabouts  it was plain that they had shoved off a native canoe and embarked upon the bosom of the stream and as the apemans eye ran swiftly down the course of the river beneath the shadows of the overarching trees he saw in the distance just as it rounded a bend that shut it off from his view a drifting dugout in the stern of which was the figure of a man  just as the pack came in sight of the river they saw their agile leader racing down the rivers bank leaping from hummock to hummock of the swampy ground that spread between them and a little promontory which rose just where the river curved inward from their sight  to follow him it was necessary for the heavy cumbersome apes to make a wide detour and sheeta too who hated water   mugambi followed after them as rapidly as he could in the wake of the great white master  a halfhour of rapid travelling across the swampy neck of land and over the rising promontory brought tarzan by a short cut to the inward bend of the winding river and there before him upon the bosom of the stream he saw the dugout and in its stern nikolas rokoff  jane was not with the russian  at sight of his enemy the broad scar upon the apemans brow burned scarlet and there rose to his lips the hideous bestial challenge of the bullape  rokoff shuddered as the weird and terrible alarm fell upon his ears cowering in the bottom of the boat his teeth chattering in terror he watched the man he feared above all other creatures upon the face of the earth as he ran quickly to the edge of the water  even though the russian knew that he was safe from his enemy the very sight of him threw him into a frenzy of trembling cowardice which became frantic hysteria as he saw the white giant dive fearlessly into the forbidding waters of the tropical river  with steady powerful strokes the apeman forged out into the stream toward the drifting dugout  now rokoff seized one of the paddles lying in the bottom of the craft and with terrorwide eyes still glued upon the living death that pursued him struck out madly in an effort to augment the speed of the unwieldy canoe  and from the opposite bank a sinister ripple unseen by either man moved steadily toward the halfnaked swimmer  tarzan had reached the stern of the craft at last  one hand upstretched grasped the gunwale  rokoff sat frozen with fear unable to move a hand or foot his eyes riveted upon the face of his nemesis  then a sudden commotion in the water behind the swimmer caught his attention  he saw the ripple and he knew what caused it  at the same instant tarzan felt mighty jaws close upon his right leg he tried to struggle free and raise himself over the side of the boat his efforts would have succeeded had not this unexpected interruption galvanized the malign brain of the russian into instant action with its sudden promise of deliverance and revenge  like a venomous snake the man leaped toward the stern of the boat and with a single swift blow struck tarzan across the head with the heavy paddle  the apemans fingers slipped from their hold upon the gunwale  there was a short struggle at the surface and then a swirl of waters a little eddy and a burst of bubbles soon smoothed out by the flowing current marked for the instant the spot where tarzan of the apes lord of the jungle disappeared from the sight of men beneath the gloomy waters of the dark and forbidding ugambi  weak from terror rokoff sank shuddering into the bottom of the dugout for a moment he could not realize the good fortune that had befallen himall that he could see was the figure of a silent struggling white man disappearing beneath the surface of the river to unthinkable death in the slimy mud of the bottom  slowly all that it meant to him filtered into the mind of the russian and then a cruel smile of relief and triumph touched his lips but it was shortlived for just as he was congratulating himself that he was now comparatively safe to proceed upon his way to the coast unmolested a mighty pandemonium rose from the riverbank close by  as his eyes sought the authors of the frightful sound he saw standing upon the shore glaring at him with hatefilled eyes a devilfaced panther surrounded by the hideous apes of akut and in the forefront of them a giant black warrior who shook his fist at him threatening him with terrible death  the nightmare of that flight down the ugambi with the hideous horde racing after him by day and by night now abreast of him now lost in the mazes of the jungle far behind for hours and once for a whole day only to reappear again upon his trail grim relentless and terrible reduced the russian from a strong and robust man to an emaciated whitehaired feargibbering thing before ever the bay and the ocean broke upon his hopeless vision  past populous villages he had fled  time and again warriors had put out in their canoes to intercept him but each time the hideous horde had swept into view to send the terrified natives shrieking back to the shore to lose themselves in the jungle  nowhere in his flight had he seen aught of jane clayton   not once had his eyes rested upon her since that moment at the rivers brim his hand had closed upon the rope attached to the bow of her dugout and he had believed her safely in his power again only to be thwarted an instant later as the girl snatched up a heavy express rifle from the bottom of the craft and levelled it full at his breast  quickly he had dropped the rope then and seen her float away beyond his reach but a moment later he had been racing upstream toward a little tributary in the mouth of which was hidden the canoe in which he and his party had come thus far upon their journey in pursuit of the girl and anderssen  what had become of her  there seemed little doubt in the russians mind however but that she had been captured by warriors from one of the several villages she would have been compelled to pass on her way down to the sea  well he was at least rid of most of his human enemies  but at that he would gladly have had them all back in the land of the living could he thus have been freed from the menace of the frightful creatures who pursued him with awful relentlessness screaming and growling at him every time they came within sight of him  the one that filled him with the greatest terror was the pantherthe flamingeyed devilfaced panther whose grinning jaws gaped wide at him by day and whose fiery orbs gleamed wickedly out across the water from the cimmerian blackness of the jungle nights  the sight of the mouth of the ugambi filled rokoff with renewed hope for there upon the yellow waters of the bay floated the kincaid at anchor  he had sent the little steamer away to coal while he had gone up the river leaving paulvitch in charge of her and he could have cried aloud in his relief as he saw that she had returned in time to save him  frantically he alternately paddled furiously toward her and rose to his feet waving his paddle and crying aloud in an attempt to attract the attention of those on board  but loud as he screamed his cries awakened no answering challenge from the deck of the silent craft  upon the shore behind him a hurried backward glance revealed the presence of the snarling pack  even now he thought these manlike devils might yet find a way to reach him even upon the deck of the steamer unless there were those there to repel them with firearms  what could have happened to those he had left upon the kincaid  where was paulvitch  could it be that the vessel was deserted and that after all he was doomed to be overtaken by the terrible fate that he had been flying from through all these hideous days and nights  he shivered as might one upon whose brow death has already laid his clammy finger  yet he did not cease to paddle frantically toward the steamer and at last after what seemed an eternity the bow of the dugout bumped against the timbers of the kincaid  over the ships side hung a monkeyladder but as the russian grasped it to ascend to the deck he heard a warning challenge from above and looking up gazed into the cold relentless muzzle of a rifle  after jane clayton with rifle levelled at the breast of rokoff had succeeded in holding him off until the dugout in which she had taken refuge had drifted out upon the bosom of the ugambi beyond the mans reach she had lost no time in paddling to the swiftest sweep of the channel nor did she for long days and weary nights cease to hold her craft to the most rapidly moving part of the river except when during the hottest hours of the day she had been wont to drift as the current would take her lying prone in the bottom of the canoe her face sheltered from the sun with a great palm leaf  thus only did she gain rest upon the voyage at other times she continually sought to augment the movement of the craft by wielding the heavy paddle  rokoff on the other hand had used little or no intelligence in his flight along the ugambi so that more often than not his craft had drifted in the slowgoing eddies for he habitually hugged the bank farthest from that along which the hideous horde pursued and menaced him  thus it was that though he had put out upon the river but a short time subsequent to the girl yet she had reached the bay fully two hours ahead of him  when she had first seen the anchored ship upon the quiet water jane claytons heart had beat fast with hope and thanksgiving but as she drew closer to the craft and saw that it was the kincaid her pleasure gave place to the gravest misgivings  it was too late however to turn back for the current that carried her toward the ship was much too strong for her muscles  she could not have forced the heavy dugout upstream against it and all that was left her was to attempt either to make the shore without being seen by those upon the deck of the kincaid or to throw herself upon their mercyotherwise she must be swept out to sea  she knew that the shore held little hope of life for her as she had no knowledge of the location of the friendly mosula village to which anderssen had taken her through the darkness of the night of their escape from the kincaid  with rokoff away from the steamer it might be possible that by offering those in charge a large reward they could be induced to carry her to the nearest civilized port  it was worth riskingif she could make the steamer at all  the current was bearing her swiftly down the river and she found that only by dint of the utmost exertion could she direct the awkward craft toward the vicinity of the kincaid   having reached the decision to board the steamer she now looked to it for aid but to her surprise the decks appeared to be empty and she saw no sign of life aboard the ship  the dugout was drawing closer and closer to the bow of the vessel and yet no hail came over the side from any lookout aboard  in a moment more jane realized she would be swept beyond the steamer and then unless they lowered a boat to rescue her she would be carried far out to sea by the current and the swift ebb tide that was running  the young woman called loudly for assistance but there was no reply other than the shrill scream of some savage beast upon the jungleshrouded shore  frantically jane wielded the paddle in an effort to carry her craft close alongside the steamer  for a moment it seemed that she should miss her goal by but a few feet but at the last moment the canoe swung close beneath the steamers bow and jane barely managed to grasp the anchor chain  heroically she clung to the heavy iron links almost dragged from the canoe by the strain of the current upon her craft   beyond her she saw a monkeyladder dangling over the steamers side  to release her hold upon the chain and chance clambering to the ladder as her canoe was swept beneath it seemed beyond the pale of possibility yet to remain clinging to the anchor chain appeared equally as futile  finally her glance chanced to fall upon the rope in the bow of the dugout and making one end of this fast to the chain she succeeded in drifting the canoe slowly down until it lay directly beneath the ladder  a moment later her rifle slung about her shoulders she had clambered safely to the deserted deck  her first task was to explore the ship and this she did her rifle ready for instant use should she meet with any human menace aboard the kincaid  she was not long in discovering the cause of the apparently deserted condition of the steamer for in the forecastle she found the sailors who had evidently been left to guard the ship deep in drunken slumber  with a shudder of disgust she clambered above and to the best of her ability closed and made fast the hatch above the heads of the sleeping guard  next she sought the galley and food and having appeased her hunger she took her place on deck determined that none should board the kincaid without first having agreed to her demands  for an hour or so nothing appeared upon the surface of the river to cause her alarm but then about a bend upstream she saw a canoe appear in which sat a single figure  it had not proceeded far in her direction before she recognized the occupant as rokoff and when the fellow attempted to board he found a rifle staring him in the face  when the russian discovered who it was that repelled his advance he became furious cursing and threatening in a most horrible manner but finding that these tactics failed to frighten or move the girl he at last fell to pleading and promising  jane had but a single reply for his every proposition and that was that nothing would ever persuade her to permit rokoff upon the same vessel with her  that she would put her threats into action and shoot him should he persist in his endeavour to board the ship he was convinced  so as there was no other alternative the great coward dropped back into his dugout and at imminent risk of being swept to sea finally succeeded in making the shore far down the bay and upon the opposite side from that on which the horde of beasts stood snarling and roaring  jane clayton knew that the fellow could not alone and unaided bring his heavy craft back upstream to the kincaid and so she had no further fear of an attack by him   the hideous crew upon the shore she thought she recognized as the same that had passed her in the jungle far up the ugambi several days before for it seemed quite beyond reason that there should be more than one such a strangely assorted pack but what had brought them downstream to the mouth of the river she could not imagine  toward the days close the girl was suddenly alarmed by the shouting of the russian from the opposite bank of the stream and a moment later following the direction of his gaze she was terrified to see a ships boat approaching from upstream in which she felt assured there could be only members of the kincaids missing crewonly heartless ruffians and enemies     chapter 16  in the darkness of the night   when tarzan of the apes realized that he was in the grip of the great jaws of a crocodile he did not as an ordinary man might have done give up all hope and resign himself to his fate  instead he filled his lungs with air before the huge reptile dragged him beneath the surface and then with all the might of his great muscles fought bitterly for freedom  but out of his native element the apeman was too greatly handicapped to do more than excite the monster to greater speed as it dragged its prey swiftly through the water  tarzans lungs were bursting for a breath of pure fresh air   he knew that he could survive but a moment more and in the last paroxysm of his suffering he did what he could to avenge his own death  his body trailed out beside the slimy carcass of his captor and into the tough armour the apeman attempted to plunge his stone knife as he was borne to the creatures horrid den  his efforts but served to accelerate the speed of the crocodile and just as the apeman realized that he had reached the limit of his endurance he felt his body dragged to a muddy bed and his nostrils rise above the waters surface  all about him was the blackness of the pitthe silence of the grave  for a moment tarzan of the apes lay gasping for breath upon the slimy evilsmelling bed to which the animal had borne him  close at his side he could feel the cold hard plates of the creatures coat rising and falling as though with spasmodic efforts to breathe  for several minutes the two lay thus and then a sudden convulsion of the giant carcass at the mans side a tremor and a stiffening brought tarzan to his knees beside the crocodile   to his utter amazement he found that the beast was dead   the slim knife had found a vulnerable spot in the scaly armour  staggering to his feet the apeman groped about the reeking oozy den he found that he was imprisoned in a subterranean chamber amply large enough to have accommodated a dozen or more of the huge animals such as the one that had dragged him thither  he realized that he was in the creatures hidden nest far under the bank of the stream and that doubtless the only means of ingress or egress lay through the submerged opening through which the crocodile had brought him  his first thought of course was of escape but that he could make his way to the surface of the river beyond and then to the shore seemed highly improbable  there might be turns and windings in the neck of the passage or most to be feared he might meet another of the slimy inhabitants of the retreat upon his journey outward  even should he reach the river in safety there was still the danger of his being again attacked before he could effect a safe landing  still there was no alternative and filling his lungs with the close and reeking air of the chamber tarzan of the apes dived into the dark and watery hole which he could not see but had felt out and found with his feet and legs  the leg which had been held within the jaws of the crocodile was badly lacerated but the bone had not been broken nor were the muscles or tendons sufficiently injured to render it useless  it gave him excruciating pain that was all  but tarzan of the apes was accustomed to pain and gave it no further thought when he found that the use of his legs was not greatly impaired by the sharp teeth of the monster  rapidly he crawled and swam through the passage which inclined downward and finally upward to open at last into the river bottom but a few feet from the shore line  as the apeman reached the surface he saw the heads of two great crocodiles but a short distance from him  they were making rapidly in his direction and with a superhuman effort the man struck out for the overhanging branches of a nearby tree  nor was he a moment too soon for scarcely had he drawn himself to the safety of the limb than two gaping mouths snapped venomously below him for a few minutes tarzan rested in the tree that had proved the means of his salvation   his eyes scanned the river as far downstream as the tortuous channel would permit but there was no sign of the russian or his dugout  when he had rested and bound up his wounded leg he started on in pursuit of the drifting canoe  he found himself upon the opposite of the river to that at which he had entered the stream but as his quarry was upon the bosom of the water it made little difference to the apeman upon which side he took up the pursuit  to his intense chagrin he soon found that his leg was more badly injured than he had thought and that its condition seriously impeded his progress  it was only with the greatest difficulty that he could proceed faster than a walk upon the ground and in the trees he discovered that it not only impeded his progress but rendered travelling distinctly dangerous  from the old negress tambudza tarzan had gathered a suggestion that now filled his mind with doubts and misgivings  when the old woman had told him of the childs death she had also added that the white woman though griefstricken had confided to her that the baby was not hers  tarzan could see no reason for believing that jane could have found it advisable to deny her identity or that of the child the only explanation that he could put upon the matter was that after all the white woman who had accompanied his son and the swede into the jungle fastness of the interior had not been jane at all  the more he gave thought to the problem the more firmly convinced he became that his son was dead and his wife still safe in london and in ignorance of the terrible fate that had overtaken her firstborn  after all then his interpretation of rokoffs sinister taunt had been erroneous and he had been bearing the burden of a double apprehension needlesslyat least so thought the apeman   from this belief he garnered some slight surcease from the numbing grief that the death of his little son had thrust upon him  and such a death  even the savage beast that was the real tarzan inured to the sufferings and horrors of the grim jungle shuddered as he contemplated the hideous fate that had overtaken the innocent child  as he made his way painfully towards the coast he let his mind dwell so constantly upon the frightful crimes which the russian had perpetrated against his loved ones that the great scar upon his forehead stood out almost continuously in the vivid scarlet that marked the mans most relentless and bestial moods of rage  at times he startled even himself and sent the lesser creatures of the wild jungle scampering to their hiding places as involuntary roars and growls rumbled from his throat  could he but lay his hand upon the russian  twice upon the way to the coast bellicose natives ran threateningly from their villages to bar his further progress but when the awful cry of the bullape thundered upon their affrighted ears and the great white giant charged bellowing upon them they had turned and fled into the bush nor ventured thence until he had safely passed  though his progress seemed tantalizingly slow to the apeman whose idea of speed had been gained by such standards as the lesser apes attain he made as a matter of fact almost as rapid progress as the drifting canoe that bore rokoff on ahead of him so that he came to the bay and within sight of the ocean just after darkness had fallen upon the same day that jane clayton and the russian ended their flights from the interior  the darkness lowered so heavily upon the black river and the encircling jungle that tarzan even with eyes accustomed to much use after dark could make out nothing a few yards from him  his idea was to search the shore that night for signs of the russian and the woman who he was certain must have preceded rokoff down the ugambi  that the kincaid or other ship lay at anchor but a hundred yards from him he did not dream for no light showed on board the steamer  even as he commenced his search his attention was suddenly attracted by a noise that he had not at first perceivedthe stealthy dip of paddles in the water some distance from the shore and about opposite the point at which he stood   motionless as a statue he stood listening to the faint sound  presently it ceased to be followed by a shuffling noise that the apemans trained ears could interpret as resulting from but a single causethe scraping of leathershod feet upon the rounds of a ships monkeyladder  and yet as far as he could see there was no ship therenor might there be one within a thousand miles  as he stood thus peering out into the darkness of the cloudenshrouded night there came to him from across the water like a slap in the face so sudden and unexpected was it the sharp staccato of an exchange of shots and then the scream of a woman  wounded though he was and with the memory of his recent horrible experience still strong upon him tarzan of the apes did not hesitate as the notes of that frightened cry rose shrill and piercing upon the still night air  with a bound he cleared the intervening bushthere was a splash as the water closed about himand then with powerful strokes he swam out into the impenetrable night with no guide save the memory of an illusive cry and for company the hideous denizens of an equatorial river   the boat that had attracted janes attention as she stood guard upon the deck of the kincaid had been perceived by rokoff upon one bank and mugambi and the horde upon the other   the cries of the russian had brought the dugout first to him and then after a conference it had been turned toward the kincaid but before ever it covered half the distance between the shore and the steamer a rifle had spoken from the latters deck and one of the sailors in the bow of the canoe had crumpled and fallen into the water  after that they went more slowly and presently when janes rifle had found another member of the party the canoe withdrew to the shore where it lay as long as daylight lasted  the savage snarling pack upon the opposite shore had been directed in their pursuit by the black warrior mugambi chief of the wagambi only he knew which might be foe and which friend of their lost master  could they have reached either the canoe or the kincaid they would have made short work of any whom they found there but the gulf of black water intervening shut them off from farther advance as effectually as though it had been the broad ocean that separated them from their prey  mugambi knew something of the occurrences which had led up to the landing of tarzan upon jungle island and the pursuit of the whites up the ugambi  he knew that his savage master sought his wife and child who had been stolen by the wicked white man whom they had followed far into the interior and now back to the sea  he believed also that this same man had killed the great white giant whom he had come to respect and love as he had never loved the greatest chiefs of his own people  and so in the wild breast of mugambi burned an iron resolve to win to the side of the wicked one and wreak vengeance upon him for the murder of the apeman  but when he saw the canoe come down the river and take in rokoff when he saw it make for the kincaid he realized that only by possessing himself of a canoe could he hope to transport the beasts of the pack within striking distance of the enemy  so it happened that even before jane clayton fired the first shot into rokoffs canoe the beasts of tarzan had disappeared into the jungle  after the russian and his party which consisted of paulvitch and the several men he had left upon the kincaid to attend to the matter of coaling had retreated before her fire jane realized that it would be but a temporary respite from their attentions which she had gained and with the conviction came a determination to make a bold and final stroke for freedom from the menacing threat of rokoffs evil purpose  with this idea in view she opened negotiations with the two sailors she had imprisoned in the forecastle and having forced their consent to her plans upon pain of death should they attempt disloyalty she released them just as darkness closed about the ship  with ready revolver to compel obedience she let them up one by one searching them carefully for concealed weapons as they stood with hands elevated above their heads  once satisfied that they were unarmed she set them to work cutting the cable which held the kincaid to her anchorage for her bold plan was nothing less than to set the steamer adrift and float with her out into the open sea there to trust to the mercy of the elements which she was confident would be no more merciless than nikolas rokoff should he again capture her  there was too the chance that the kincaid might be sighted by some passing ship and as she was well stocked with provisions and waterthe men had assured her of this factand as the season of storm was well over she had every reason to hope for the eventual success of her plan  the night was deeply overcast heavy clouds riding low above the jungle and the wateronly to the west where the broad ocean spread beyond the rivers mouth was there a suggestion of lessening gloom  it was a perfect night for the purposes of the work in hand  her enemies could not see the activity aboard the ship nor mark her course as the swift current bore her outward into the ocean  before daylight broke the ebbtide would have carried the kincaid well into the benguela current which flows northward along the coast of africa and as a south wind was prevailing jane hoped to be out of sight of the mouth of the ugambi before rokoff could become aware of the departure of the steamer  standing over the labouring seamen the young woman breathed a sigh of relief as the last strand of the cable parted and she knew that the vessel was on its way out of the maw of the savage ugambi  with her two prisoners still beneath the coercing influence of her rifle she ordered them upon deck with the intention of again imprisoning them in the forecastle but at length she permitted herself to be influenced by their promises of loyalty and the arguments which they put forth that they could be of service to her and permitted them to remain above  for a few minutes the kincaid drifted rapidly with the current and then with a grinding jar she stopped in midstream   the ship had run upon a lowlying bar that splits the channel about a quarter of a mile from the sea  for a moment she hung there and then swinging round until her bow pointed toward the shore she broke adrift once more  at the same instant just as jane clayton was congratulating herself that the ship was once more free there fell upon her ears from a point up the river about where the kincaid had been anchored the rattle of musketry and a womans screamshrill piercing fearladen  the sailors heard the shots with certain conviction that they announced the coming of their employer and as they had no relish for the plan that would consign them to the deck of a drifting derelict they whispered together a hurried plan to overcome the young woman and hail rokoff and their companions to their rescue  it seemed that fate would play into their hands for with the reports of the guns jane claytons attention had been distracted from her unwilling assistants and instead of keeping one eye upon them as she had intended doing she ran to the bow of the kincaid to peer through the darkness toward the source of the disturbance upon the rivers bosom  seeing that she was off her guard the two sailors crept stealthily upon her from behind  the scraping upon the deck of the shoes of one of them startled the girl to a sudden appreciation of her danger but the warning had come too late  as she turned both men leaped upon her and bore her to the deck and as she went down beneath them she saw outlined against the lesser gloom of the ocean the figure of another man clamber over the side of the kincaid  after all her pains her heroic struggle for freedom had failed  with a stifled sob she gave up the unequal battle     chapter 17  on the deck of the kincaid   when mugambi had turned back into the jungle with the pack he had a definite purpose in view  it was to obtain a dugout wherewith to transport the beasts of tarzan to the side of the kincaid  nor was he long in coming upon the object which he sought  just at dusk he found a canoe moored to the bank of a small tributary of the ugambi at a point where he had felt certain that he should find one  without loss of time he piled his hideous fellows into the craft and shoved out into the stream  so quickly had they taken possession of the canoe that the warrior had not noticed that it was already occupied  the huddled figure sleeping in the bottom had entirely escaped his observation in the darkness of the night that had now fallen  but no sooner were they afloat than a savage growling from one of the apes directly ahead of him in the dugout attracted his attention to a shivering and cowering figure that trembled between him and the great anthropoid  to mugambis astonishment he saw that it was a native woman  with difficulty he kept the ape from her throat and after a time succeeded in quelling her fears  it seemed that she had been fleeing from marriage with an old man she loathed and had taken refuge for the night in the canoe she had found upon the rivers edge  mugambi did not wish her presence but there she was and rather than lose time by returning her to the shore the black permitted her to remain on board the canoe  as quickly as his awkward companions could paddle the dugout downstream toward the ugambi and the kincaid they moved through the darkness  it was with difficulty that mugambi could make out the shadowy form of the steamer but as he had it between himself and the ocean it was much more apparent than to one upon either shore of the river  as he approached it he was amazed to note that it seemed to be receding from him and finally he was convinced that the vessel was moving downstream  just as he was about to urge his creatures to renewed efforts to overtake the steamer the outline of another canoe burst suddenly into view not three yards from the bow of his own craft  at the same instant the occupants of the stranger discovered the proximity of mugambis horde but they did not at first recognize the nature of the fearful crew  a man in the bow of the oncoming boat challenged them just as the two dugouts were about to touch  for answer came the menacing growl of a panther and the fellow found himself gazing into the flaming eyes of sheeta who had raised himself with his forepaws upon the bow of the boat ready to leap in upon the occupants of the other craft  instantly rokoff realized the peril that confronted him and his fellows  he gave a quick command to fire upon the occupants of the other canoe and it was this volley and the scream of the terrified native woman in the canoe with mugambi that both tarzan and jane had heard  before the slower and less skilled paddlers in mugambis canoe could press their advantage and effect a boarding of the enemy the latter had turned swiftly downstream and were paddling for their lives in the direction of the kincaid which was now visible to them  the vessel after striking upon the bar had swung loose again into a slowmoving eddy which returns upstream close to the southern shore of the ugambi only to circle out once more and join the downward flow a hundred yards or so farther up  thus the kincaid was returning jane clayton directly into the hands of her enemies  it so happened that as tarzan sprang into the river the vessel was not visible to him and as he swam out into the night he had no idea that a ship drifted so close at hand   he was guided by the sounds which he could hear coming from the two canoes  as he swam he had vivid recollections of the last occasion upon which he had swum in the waters of the ugambi and with them a sudden shudder shook the frame of the giant  but though he twice felt something brush his legs from the slimy depths below him nothing seized him and of a sudden he quite forgot about crocodiles in the astonishment of seeing a dark mass loom suddenly before him where he had still expected to find the open river  so close was it that a few strokes brought him up to the thing when to his amazement his outstretched hand came in contact with a ships side  as the agile apeman clambered over the vessels rail there came to his sensitive ears the sound of a struggle at the opposite side of the deck  noiselessly he sped across the intervening space  the moon had risen now and though the sky was still banked with clouds a lesser darkness enveloped the scene than that which had blotted out all sight earlier in the night  his keen eyes therefore saw the figures of two men grappling with a woman  that it was the woman who had accompanied anderssen toward the interior he did not know though he suspected as much as he was now quite certain that this was the deck of the kincaid upon which chance had led him  but he wasted little time in idle speculation  there was a woman in danger of harm from two ruffians which was enough excuse for the apeman to project his giant thews into the conflict without further investigation  the first that either of the sailors knew that there was a new force at work upon the ship was the falling of a mighty hand upon a shoulder of each  as if they had been in the grip of a flywheel they were jerked suddenly from their prey  what means this asked a low voice in their ears  they were given no time to reply however for at the sound of that voice the young woman had sprung to her feet and with a little cry of joy leaped toward their assailant  tarzan she cried  the apeman hurled the two sailors across the deck where they rolled stunned and terrified into the scuppers upon the opposite side and with an exclamation of incredulity gathered the girl into his arms  brief however were the moments for their greeting  scarcely had they recognized one another than the clouds above them parted to show the figures of a halfdozen men clambering over the side of the kincaid to the steamers deck  foremost among them was the russian  as the brilliant rays of the equatorial moon lighted the deck and he realized that the man before him was lord greystoke he screamed hysterical commands to his followers to fire upon the two  tarzan pushed jane behind the cabin near which they had been standing and with a quick bound started for rokoff   the men behind the russian at least two of them raised their rifles and fired at the charging apeman but those behind them were otherwise engagedfor up the monkeyladder in their rear was thronging a hideous horde  first came five snarling apes huge manlike beasts with bared fangs and slavering jaws and after them a giant black warrior his long spear gleaming in the moonlight  behind him again scrambled another creature and of all the horrid horde it was this they most fearedsheeta the panther with gleaming jaws agape and fiery eyes blazing at them in the mightiness of his hate and of his blood lust  the shots that had been fired at tarzan missed him and he would have been upon rokoff in another instant had not the great coward dodged backward between his two henchmen and screaming in hysterical terror bolted forward toward the forecastle  for the moment tarzans attention was distracted by the two men before him so that he could not at the time pursue the russian  about him the apes and mugambi were battling with the balance of the russians party  beneath the terrible ferocity of the beasts the men were soon scampering in all directionsthose who still lived to scamper for the great fangs of the apes of akut and the tearing talons of sheeta already had found more than a single victim  four however escaped and disappeared into the forecastle where they hoped to barricade themselves against further assault   here they found rokoff and enraged at his desertion of them in their moment of peril no less than at the uniformly brutal treatment it had been his wont to accord them they gloated upon the opportunity now offered them to revenge themselves in part upon their hated employer  despite his prayers and grovelling pleas therefore they hurled him bodily out upon the deck delivering him to the mercy of the fearful things from which they had themselves just escaped  tarzan saw the man emerge from the forecastlesaw and recognized his enemy but another saw him even as soon  it was sheeta and with grinning jaws the mighty beast slunk silently toward the terrorstricken man  when rokoff saw what it was that stalked him his shrieks for help filled the air as with trembling knees he stood as one paralyzed before the hideous death that was creeping upon him  tarzan took a step toward the russian his brain burning with a raging fire of vengeance  at last he had the murderer of his son at his mercy  his was the right to avenge  once jane had stayed his hand that time that he sought to take the law into his own power and mete to rokoff the death that he had so long merited but this time none should stay him  his fingers clenched and unclenched spasmodically as he approached the trembling russ beastlike and ominous as a brute of prey  presently he saw that sheeta was about to forestall him robbing him of the fruits of his great hate  he called sharply to the panther and the words as if they had broken a hideous spell that had held the russian galvanized him into sudden action  with a scream he turned and fled toward the bridge  after him pounced sheeta the panther unmindful of his masters warning voice  tarzan was about to leap after the two when he felt a light touch upon his arm  turning he found jane at his elbow  do not leave me she whispered  i am afraid  tarzan glanced behind her  all about were the hideous apes of akut  some even were approaching the young woman with bared fangs and menacing guttural warnings  the apeman warned them back  he had forgotten for the moment that these were but beasts unable to differentiate his friends and his foes  their savage natures were roused by their recent battle with the sailors and now all flesh outside the pack was meat to them  tarzan turned again toward the russian chagrined that he should have to forgo the pleasure of personal revengeunless the man should escape sheeta  but as he looked he saw that there could be no hope of that the fellow had retreated to the end of the bridge where he now stood trembling and wideeyed facing the beast that moved slowly toward him  the panther crawled with belly to the planking uttering uncanny mouthings  rokoff stood as though petrified his eyes protruding from their sockets his mouth agape and the cold sweat of terror clammy upon his brow  below him upon the deck he had seen the great anthropoids and so had not dared to seek escape in that direction   in fact even now one of the brutes was leaping to seize the bridgerail and draw himself up to the russians side  before him was the panther silent and crouched  rokoff could not move  his knees trembled  his voice broke in inarticulate shrieks  with a last piercing wail he sank to his kneesand then sheeta sprang  full upon the mans breast the tawny body hurtled tumbling the russian to his back  as the great fangs tore at the throat and chest jane clayton turned away in horror but not so tarzan of the apes  a cold smile of satisfaction touched his lips  the scar upon his forehead that had burned scarlet faded to the normal hue of his tanned skin and disappeared  rokoff fought furiously but futilely against the growling rending fate that had overtaken him  for all his countless crimes he was punished in the brief moment of the hideous death that claimed him at the last  after his struggles ceased tarzan approached at janes suggestion to wrest the body from the panther and give what remained of it decent human burial but the great cat rose snarling above its kill threatening even the master it loved in its savage way so that rather than kill his friend of the jungle tarzan was forced to relinquish his intentions  all that night sheeta the panther crouched upon the grisly thing that had been nikolas rokoff  the bridge of the kincaid was slippery with blood  beneath the brilliant tropic moon the great beast feasted until when the sun rose the following morning there remained of tarzans great enemy only gnawed and broken bones   of the russians party all were accounted for except paulvitch  four were prisoners in the kincaids forecastle  the rest were dead  with these men tarzan got up steam upon the vessel and with the knowledge of the mate who happened to be one of those surviving he planned to set out in quest of jungle island but as the morning dawned there came with it a heavy gale from the west which raised a sea into which the mate of the kincaid dared not venture  all that day the ship lay within the shelter of the mouth of the river for though night witnessed a lessening of the wind it was thought safer to wait for daylight before attempting the navigation of the winding channel to the sea  upon the deck of the steamer the pack wandered without let or hindrance by day for they had soon learned through tarzan and mugambi that they must harm no one upon the kincaid but at night they were confined below  tarzans joy had been unbounded when he learned from his wife that the little child who had died in the village of mganwazam was not their son  who the baby could have been or what had become of their own they could not imagine and as both rokoff and paulvitch were gone there was no way of discovering  there was however a certain sense of relief in the knowledge that they might yet hope  until positive proof of the babys death reached them there was always that to buoy them up  it seemed quite evident that their little jack had not been brought aboard the kincaid  anderssen would have known of it had such been the case but he had assured jane time and time again that the little one he had brought to her cabin the night he aided her to escape was the only one that had been aboard the kincaid since she lay at dover     chapter 18  paulvitch plots revenge   as jane and tarzan stood upon the vessels deck recounting to one another the details of the various adventures through which each had passed since they had parted in their london home there glared at them from beneath scowling brows a hidden watcher upon the shore  through the mans brain passed plan after plan whereby he might thwart the escape of the englishman and his wife for so long as the vital spark remained within the vindictive brain of alexander paulvitch none who had aroused the enmity of the russian might be entirely safe  plan after plan he formed only to discard each either as impracticable or unworthy the vengeance his wrongs demanded   so warped by faulty reasoning was the criminal mind of rokoffs lieutenant that he could not grasp the real truth of that which lay between himself and the apeman and see that always the fault had been not with the english lord but with himself and his confederate  and at the rejection of each new scheme paulvitch arrived always at the same conclusionthat he could accomplish naught while half the breadth of the ugambi separated him from the object of his hatred  but how was he to span the crocodileinfested waters  there was no canoe nearer than the mosula village and paulvitch was none too sure that the kincaid would still be at anchor in the river when he returned should he take the time to traverse the jungle to the distant village and return with a canoe  yet there was no other way and so convinced that thus alone might he hope to reach his prey paulvitch with a parting scowl at the two figures upon the kincaids deck turned away from the river  hastening through the dense jungle his mind centred upon his one fetichrevengethe russian forgot even his terror of the savage world through which he moved  baffled and beaten at every turn of fortunes wheel reacted upon time after time by his own malign plotting the principal victim of his own criminality paulvitch was yet so blind as to imagine that his greatest happiness lay in a continuation of the plottings and schemings which had ever brought him and rokoff to disaster and the latter finally to a hideous death  as the russian stumbled on through the jungle toward the mosula village there presently crystallized within his brain a plan which seemed more feasible than any that he had as yet considered  he would come by night to the side of the kincaid and once aboard would search out the members of the ships original crew who had survived the terrors of this frightful expedition and enlist them in an attempt to wrest the vessel from tarzan and his beasts  in the cabin were arms and ammunition and hidden in a secret receptacle in the cabin table was one of those infernal machines the construction of which had occupied much of paulvitchs spare time when he had stood high in the confidence of the nihilists of his native land  that was before he had sold them out for immunity and gold to the police of petrograd  paulvitch winced as he recalled the denunciation of him that had fallen from the lips of one of his former comrades ere the poor devil expiated his political sins at the end of a hempen rope  but the infernal machine was the thing to think of now   he could do much with that if he could but get his hands upon it  within the little hardwood case hidden in the cabin table rested sufficient potential destructiveness to wipe out in the fraction of a second every enemy aboard the kincaid  paulvitch licked his lips in anticipatory joy and urged his tired legs to greater speed that he might not be too late to the ships anchorage to carry out his designs  all depended of course upon when the kincaid departed   the russian realized that nothing could be accomplished beneath the light of day darkness must shroud his approach to the ships side for should he be sighted by tarzan or lady greystoke he would have no chance to board the vessel  the gale that was blowing was he believed the cause of the delay in getting the kincaid under way and if it continued to blow until night then the chances were all in his favour for he knew that there was little likelihood of the apeman attempting to navigate the tortuous channel of the ugambi while darkness lay upon the surface of the water hiding the many bars and the numerous small islands which are scattered over the expanse of the rivers mouth  it was well after noon when paulvitch came to the mosula village upon the bank of the tributary of the ugambi   here he was received with suspicion and unfriendliness by the native chief who like all those who came in contact with rokoff or paulvitch had suffered in some manner from the greed the cruelty or the lust of the two muscovites  when paulvitch demanded the use of a canoe the chief grumbled a surly refusal and ordered the white man from the village  surrounded by angry muttering warriors who seemed to be but waiting some slight pretext to transfix him with their menacing spears the russian could do naught else than withdraw  a dozen fighting men led him to the edge of the clearing leaving him with a warning never to show himself again in the vicinity of their village  stifling his anger paulvitch slunk into the jungle but once beyond the sight of the warriors he paused and listened intently  he could hear the voices of his escort as the men returned to the village and when he was sure that they were not following him he wormed his way through the bushes to the edge of the river still determined some way to obtain a canoe  life itself depended upon his reaching the kincaid and enlisting the survivors of the ships crew in his service for to be abandoned here amidst the dangers of the african jungle where he had won the enmity of the natives was he well knew practically equivalent to a sentence of death  a desire for revenge acted as an almost equally powerful incentive to spur him into the face of danger to accomplish his design so that it was a desperate man that lay hidden in the foliage beside the little river searching with eager eyes for some sign of a small canoe which might be easily handled by a single paddle  nor had the russian long to wait before one of the awkward little skiffs which the mosula fashion came in sight upon the bosom of the river  a youth was paddling lazily out into midstream from a point beside the village  when he reached the channel he allowed the sluggish current to carry him slowly along while he lolled indolently in the bottom of his crude canoe  all ignorant of the unseen enemy upon the rivers bank the lad floated slowly down the stream while paulvitch followed along the jungle path a few yards behind him  a mile below the village the black boy dipped his paddle into the water and forced his skiff toward the bank   paulvitch elated by the chance which had drawn the youth to the same side of the river as that along which he followed rather than to the opposite side where he would have been beyond the stalkers reach hid in the brush close beside the point at which it was evident the skiff would touch the bank of the slowmoving stream which seemed jealous of each fleeting instant which drew it nearer to the broad and muddy ugambi where it must for ever lose its identity in the larger stream that would presently cast its waters into the great ocean  equally indolent were the motions of the mosula youth as he drew his skiff beneath an overhanging limb of a great tree that leaned down to implant a farewell kiss upon the bosom of the departing water caressing with green fronds the soft breast of its languorous love  and snakelike amidst the concealing foliage lay the malevolent russ cruel shifty eyes gloated upon the outlines of the coveted canoe and measured the stature of its owner while the crafty brain weighed the chances of the white man should physical encounter with the black become necessary  only direct necessity could drive alexander paulvitch to personal conflict but it was indeed dire necessity which goaded him on to action now  there was time just time enough to reach the kincaid by nightfall would the black fool never quit his skiff  paulvitch squirmed and fidgeted  the lad yawned and stretched   with exasperating deliberateness he examined the arrows in his quiver tested his bow and looked to the edge upon the huntingknife in his loincloth  again he stretched and yawned glanced up at the riverbank shrugged his shoulders and lay down in the bottom of his canoe for a little nap before he plunged into the jungle after the prey he had come forth to hunt  paulvitch half rose and with tensed muscles stood glaring down upon his unsuspecting victim  the boys lids drooped and closed  presently his breast rose and fell to the deep breaths of slumber  the time had come  the russian crept stealthily nearer  a branch rustled beneath his weight and the lad stirred in his sleep  paulvitch drew his revolver and levelled it upon the black  for a moment he remained in rigid quiet and then again the youth relapsed into undisturbed slumber  the white man crept closer  he could not chance a shot until there was no risk of missing  presently he leaned close above the mosula  the cold steel of the revolver in his hand insinuated itself nearer and nearer to the breast of the unconscious lad  now it stopped but a few inches above the strongly beating heart  but the pressure of a finger lay between the harmless boy and eternity the soft bloom of youth still lay upon the brown cheek a smile half parted the beardless lips  did any qualm of conscience point its disquieting finger of reproach at the murderer  to all such was alexander paulvitch immune  a sneer curled his bearded lip as his forefinger closed upon the trigger of his revolver  there was a loud report  a little hole appeared above the heart of the sleeping boy a little hole about which lay a blackened rim of powderburned flesh  the youthful body half rose to a sitting posture  the smiling lips tensed to the nervous shock of a momentary agony which the conscious mind never apprehended and then the dead sank limply back into that deepest of slumbers from which there is no awakening  the killer dropped quickly into the skiff beside the killed  ruthless hands seized the dead boy heartlessly and raised him to the low gunwale  a little shove a splash some widening ripples broken by the sudden surge of a dark hidden body from the slimy depths and the coveted canoe was in the sole possession of the white manmore savage than the youth whose life he had taken  casting off the tie rope and seizing the paddle paulvitch bent feverishly to the task of driving the skiff downward toward the ugambi at top speed  night had fallen when the prow of the bloodstained craft shot out into the current of the larger stream  constantly the russian strained his eyes into the increasing darkness ahead in vain endeavour to pierce the black shadows which lay between him and the anchorage of the kincaid  was the ship still riding there upon the waters of the ugambi or had the apeman at last persuaded himself of the safety of venturing forth into the abating storm  as paulvitch forged ahead with the current he asked himself these questions and many more beside not the least disquieting of which were those which related to his future should it chance that the kincaid had already steamed away leaving him to the merciless horrors of the savage wilderness  in the darkness it seemed to the paddler that he was fairly flying over the water and he had become convinced that the ship had left her moorings and that he had already passed the spot at which she had lain earlier in the day when there appeared before him beyond a projecting point which he had but just rounded the flickering light from a ships lantern  alexander paulvitch could scarce restrain an exclamation of triumph the kincaid had not departed  life and vengeance were not to elude him after all  he stopped paddling the moment that he descried the gleaming beacon of hope ahead of him  silently he drifted down the muddy waters of the ugambi occasionally dipping his paddles blade gently into the current that he might guide his primitive craft to the vessels side  as he approached more closely the dark bulk of a ship loomed before him out of the blackness of the night   no sound came from the vessels deck  paulvitch drifted unseen close to the kincaids side  only the momentary scraping of his canoes nose against the ships planking broke the silence of the night  trembling with nervous excitement the russian remained motionless for several minutes but there was no sound from the great bulk above him to indicate that his coming had been noted  stealthily he worked his craft forward until the stays of the bowsprit were directly above him  he could just reach them   to make his canoe fast there was the work of but a minute or two and then the man raised himself quietly aloft  a moment later he dropped softly to the deck  thoughts of the hideous pack which tenanted the ship induced cold tremors along the spine of the cowardly prowler but life itself depended upon the success of his venture and so he was enabled to steel himself to the frightful chances which lay before him  no sound or sign of watch appeared upon the ships deck   paulvitch crept stealthily toward the forecastle   all was silence  the hatch was raised and as the man peered downward he saw one of the kincaids crew reading by the light of the smoky lantern depending from the ceiling of the crews quarters  paulvitch knew the man well a surly cutthroat upon whom he figured strongly in the carrying out of the plan which he had conceived gently the russ lowered himself through the aperture to the rounds of the ladder which led into the forecastle  he kept his eyes turned upon the reading man ready to warn him to silence the moment that the fellow discovered him but so deeply immersed was the sailor in the magazine that the russian came unobserved to the forecastle floor  there he turned and whispered the readers name  the man raised his eyes from the magazineeyes that went wide for a moment as they fell upon the familiar countenance of rokoffs lieutenant only to narrow instantly in a scowl of disapproval  the devil he ejaculated  where did you come from  we all thought you were done for and gone where you ought to have gone a long time ago  his lordship will be mighty pleased to see you  paulvitch crossed to the sailors side  a friendly smile lay on the russians lips and his right hand was extended in greeting as though the other might have been a dear and long lost friend  the sailor ignored the proffered hand nor did he return the others smile  ive come to help you explained paulvitch  im going to help you get rid of the englishman and his beaststhen there will be no danger from the law when we get back to civilization   we can sneak in on them while they sleepthat is greystoke his wife and that black scoundrel mugambi  afterward it will be a simple matter to clean up the beasts  where are they  theyre below replied the sailor but just let me tell you something paulvitch  you havent got no more show to turn us men against the englishman than nothing  we had all we wanted of you and that other beast  hes dead an if i dont miss my guess a whole lot youll be dead too before long   you two treated us like dogs and if you think we got any love for you you better forget it  you mean to say that youre going to turn against me demanded paulvitch  the other nodded and then after a momentary pause during which an idea seemed to have occurred to him he spoke again  unless he said you can make it worth my while to let you go before the englishman finds you here  you wouldnt turn me away in the jungle would you asked paulvitch why id die there in a week  youd have a chance there replied the sailor  here you wouldnt have no chance  why if i woke up my maties here theyd probably cut your heart out of you before the englishman got a chance at you at all its mighty lucky for you that im the one to be awake now and not none of the others  youre crazy cried paulvitch  dont you know that the englishman will have you all hanged when he gets you back where the law can get hold of you  no he wont do nothing of the kind replied the sailor  hes told us as much for he says that there wasnt nobody to blame but you and rokoffthe rest of us was just tools  see  for half an hour the russian pleaded or threatened as the mood seized him  sometimes he was upon the verge of tears and again he was promising his listener either fabulous rewards or condign punishment but the other was obdurate  condign of equal value  he made it plain to the russian that there were but two plans open to himeither he must consent to being turned over immediately to lord greystoke or he must pay to the sailor as a price for permission to quit the kincaid unmolested every cent of money and article of value upon his person and in his cabin  and youll have to make up your mind mighty quick growled the man for i want to turn in  come now choosehis lordship or the jungle  youll be sorry for this grumbled the russian  shut up admonished the sailor  if you get funny i may change my mind and keep you here after all  now paulvitch had no intention of permitting himself to fall into the hands of tarzan of the apes if he could possibly avoid it and while the terrors of the jungle appalled him they were to his mind infinitely preferable to the certain death which he knew he merited and for which he might look at the hands of the apeman  is anyone sleeping in my cabin he asked  the sailor shook his head  no he said lord and lady greystoke have the captains cabin  the mate is in his own and there aint no one in yours  ill go and get my valuables for you said paulvitch  ill go with you to see that you dont try any funny business said the sailor and he followed the russian up the ladder to the deck  at the cabin entrance the sailor halted to watch permitting paulvitch to go alone to his cabin  here he gathered together his few belongings that were to buy him the uncertain safety of escape and as he stood for a moment beside the little table on which he had piled them he searched his brain for some feasible plan either to ensure his safety or to bring revenge upon his enemies  and presently as he thought there recurred to his memory the little black box which lay hidden in a secret receptacle beneath a false top upon the table where his hand rested  the russians face lighted to a sinister gleam of malevolent satisfaction as he stooped and felt beneath the table top   a moment later he withdrew from its hidingplace the thing he sought  he had lighted the lantern swinging from the beams overhead that he might see to collect his belongings and now he held the black box well in the rays of the lamplight while he fingered at the clasp that fastened its lid  the lifted cover revealed two compartments within the box   in one was a mechanism which resembled the works of a small clock  there also was a little battery of two dry cells  a wire ran from the clockwork to one of the poles of the battery and from the other pole through the partition into the other compartment a second wire returning directly to the clockwork  whatever lay within the second compartment was not visible for a cover lay over it and appeared to be sealed in place by asphaltum  in the bottom of the box beside the clockwork lay a key and this paulvitch now withdrew and fitted to the winding stem  gently he turned the key muffling the noise of the winding operation by throwing a couple of articles of clothing over the box  all the time he listened intently for any sound which might indicate that the sailor or another were approaching his cabin but none came to interrupt his work  when the winding was completed the russian set a pointer upon a small dial at the side of the clockwork then he replaced the cover upon the black box and returned the entire machine to its hidingplace in the table  a sinister smile curled the mans bearded lips as he gathered up his valuables blew out the lamp and stepped from his cabin to the side of the waiting sailor  here are my things said the russian now let me go  ill first take a look in your pockets replied the sailor   you might have overlooked some trifling thing that wont be of no use to you in the jungle but thatll come in mighty handy to a poor sailorman in london  ah just as i feared he ejaculated an instant later as he withdrew a roll of banknotes from paulvitchs inside coat pocket  the russian scowled muttering an imprecation but nothing could be gained by argument and so he did his best to reconcile himself to his loss in the knowledge that the sailor would never reach london to enjoy the fruits of his thievery  it was with difficulty that paulvitch restrained a consuming desire to taunt the man with a suggestion of the fate that would presently overtake him and the other members of the kincaids company but fearing to arouse the fellows suspicions he crossed the deck and lowered himself in silence into his canoe  a minute or two later he was paddling toward the shore to be swallowed up in the darkness of the jungle night and the terrors of a hideous existence from which could he have had even a slight foreknowledge of what awaited him in the long years to come he would have fled to the certain death of the open sea rather than endure it  the sailor having made sure that paulvitch had departed returned to the forecastle where he hid away his booty and turned into his bunk while in the cabin that had belonged to the russian there ticked on and on through the silences of the night the little mechanism in the small black box which held for the unconscious sleepers upon the illstarred kincaid the coming vengeance of the thwarted russian     chapter 19  the last of the kincaid   shortly after the break of day tarzan was on deck noting the condition of the weather  the wind had abated   the sky was cloudless  every condition seemed ideal for the commencement of the return voyage to jungle island where the beasts were to be left  and thenhome  the apeman aroused the mate and gave instructions that the kincaid sail at the earliest possible moment   the remaining members of the crew safe in lord greystokes assurance that they would not be prosecuted for their share in the villainies of the two russians hastened with cheerful alacrity to their several duties  the beasts liberated from the confinement of the hold wandered about the deck not a little to the discomfiture of the crew in whose minds there remained a still vivid picture of the savagery of the beasts in conflict with those who had gone to their deaths beneath the fangs and talons which even now seemed itching for the soft flesh of further prey  beneath the watchful eyes of tarzan and mugambi however sheeta and the apes of akut curbed their desires so that the men worked about the deck amongst them in far greater security than they imagined  at last the kincaid slipped down the ugambi and ran out upon the shimmering waters of the atlantic  tarzan and jane clayton watched the verdureclad shoreline receding in the ships wake and for once the apeman left his native soil without one single pang of regret  no ship that sailed the seven seas could have borne him away from africa to resume his search for his lost boy with half the speed that the englishman would have desired and the slowmoving kincaid seemed scarce to move at all to the impatient mind of the bereaved father  yet the vessel made progress even when she seemed to be standing still and presently the low hills of jungle island became distinctly visible upon the western horizon ahead  in the cabin of alexander paulvitch the thing within the black box ticked ticked ticked with apparently unending monotony but yet second by second a little arm which protruded from the periphery of one of its wheels came nearer and nearer to another little arm which projected from the hand which paulvitch had set at a certain point upon the dial beside the clockwork  when those two arms touched one another the ticking of the mechanism would ceasefor ever  jane and tarzan stood upon the bridge looking out toward jungle island the men were forward also watching the land grow upward out of the ocean  the beasts had sought the shade of the galley where they were curled up in sleep   all was quiet and peace upon the ship and upon the waters  suddenly without warning the cabin roof shot up into the air a cloud of dense smoke puffed far above the kincaid there was a terrific explosion which shook the vessel from stem to stern  instantly pandemonium broke loose upon the deck  the apes of akut terrified by the sound ran hither and thither snarling and growling sheeta leaped here and there screaming out his startled terror in hideous cries that sent the ice of fear straight to the hearts of the kincaids crew  mugambi too was trembling  only tarzan of the apes and his wife retained their composure  scarce had the debris settled than the apeman was among the beasts quieting their fears talking to them in low pacific tones stroking their shaggy bodies and assuring them as only he could that the immediate danger was over  an examination of the wreckage showed that their greatest danger now lay in fire for the flames were licking hungrily at the splintered wood of the wrecked cabin and had already found a foothold upon the lower deck through a great jagged hole which the explosion had opened  by a miracle no member of the ships company had been injured by the blast the origin of which remained for ever a total mystery to all but onethe sailor who knew that paulvitch had been aboard the kincaid and in his cabin the previous night   he guessed the truth but discretion sealed his lips  it would doubtless fare none too well for the man who had permitted the arch enemy of them all aboard the ship in the watches of the night where later he might set an infernal machine to blow them all to kingdom come  no the man decided that he would keep this knowledge to himself  as the flames gained headway it became apparent to tarzan that whatever had caused the explosion had scattered some highly inflammable substance upon the surrounding woodwork for the water which they poured in from the pump seemed rather to spread than to extinguish the blaze  fifteen minutes after the explosion great black clouds of smoke were rising from the hold of the doomed vessel   the flames had reached the engineroom and the ship no longer moved toward the shore  her fate was as certain as though the waters had already closed above her charred and smoking remains  it is useless to remain aboard her longer remarked the apeman to the mate  there is no telling but there may be other explosions and as we cannot hope to save her the safest thing which we can do is to take to the boats without further loss of time and make land  nor was there other alternative  only the sailors could bring away any belongings for the fire which had not yet reached the forecastle had consumed all in the vicinity of the cabin which the explosion had not destroyed  two boats were lowered and as there was no sea the landing was made with infinite ease  eager and anxious the beasts of tarzan sniffed the familiar air of their native island as the small boats drew in toward the beach and scarce had their keels grated upon the sand than sheeta and the apes of akut were over the bows and racing swiftly toward the jungle   a halfsad smile curved the lips of the apeman as he watched them go  goodbye my friends he murmured  you have been good and faithful allies and i shall miss you  they will return will they not dear asked jane clayton at his side  they may and they may not replied the apeman  they have been ill at ease since they were forced to accept so many human beings into their confidence  mugambi and i alone affected them less for he and i are at best but half human  you however and the members of the crew are far too civilized for my beastsit is you whom they are fleeing   doubtless they feel that they cannot trust themselves in the close vicinity of so much perfectly good food without the danger that they may help themselves to a mouthful some time by mistake  jane laughed  i think they are just trying to escape you she retorted  you are always making them stop something which they see no reason why they should not do  like little children they are doubtless delighted at this opportunity to flee from the zone of parental discipline  if they come back though i hope they wont come by night  or come hungry eh laughed tarzan  for two hours after landing the little party stood watching the burning ship which they had abandoned  then there came faintly to them from across the water the sound of a second explosion   the kincaid settled rapidly almost immediately thereafter and sank within a few minutes  the cause of the second explosion was less a mystery than that of the first the mate attributing it to the bursting of the boilers when the flames had finally reached them but what had caused the first explosion was a subject of considerable speculation among the stranded company     chapter 20  jungle island again   the first consideration of the party was to locate fresh water and make camp for all knew that their term of existence upon jungle island might be drawn out to months or even years  tarzan knew the nearest water and to this he immediately led the party  here the men fell to work to construct shelters and rude furniture while tarzan went into the jungle after meat leaving the faithful mugambi and the mosula woman to guard jane whose safety he would never trust to any member of the kincaids cutthroat crew  lady greystoke suffered far greater anguish than any other of the castaways for the blow to her hopes and her already cruelly lacerated motherheart lay not in her own privations but in the knowledge that she might now never be able to learn the fate of her firstborn or do aught to discover his whereabouts or ameliorate his conditiona condition which imagination naturally pictured in the most frightful forms  for two weeks the party divided the time amongst the various duties which had been allotted to each  a daylight watch was maintained from sunrise to sunset upon a bluff near the campa jutting shoulder of rock which overlooked the sea  here ready for instant lighting was gathered a huge pile of dry branches while from a lofty pole which they had set in the ground there floated an improvised distress signal fashioned from a red undershirt which belonged to the mate of the kincaid  but never a speck upon the horizon that might be sail or smoke rewarded the tired eyes that in their endless hopeless vigil strained daily out across the vast expanse of ocean  it was tarzan who suggested finally that they attempt to construct a vessel that would bear them back to the mainland   he alone could show them how to fashion rude tools and when the idea had taken root in the minds of the men they were eager to commence their labours  but as time went on and the herculean nature of their task became more and more apparent they fell to grumbling and to quarrelling among themselves so that to the other dangers were now added dissension and suspicion  more than before did tarzan now fear to leave jane among the half brutes of the kincaids crew but hunting he must do for none other could so surely go forth and return with meat as he  sometimes mugambi spelled him at the hunting but the blacks spear and arrows were never so sure of results as the rope and knife of the apeman  finally the men shirked their work going off into the jungle by twos to explore and to hunt  all this time the camp had had no sight of sheeta or akut and the other great apes though tarzan had sometimes met them in the jungle as he hunted  and as matters tended from bad to worse in the camp of the castaways upon the east coast of jungle island another camp came into being upon the north coast  here in a little cove lay a small schooner the cowrie whose decks had but a few days since run red with the blood of her officers and the loyal members of her crew for the cowrie had fallen upon bad days when it had shipped such men as gust and momulla the maori and that archfiend kai shang of fachan  there were others too ten of them all told the scum of the south sea ports but gust and momulla and kai shang were the brains and cunning of the company  it was they who had instigated the mutiny that they might seize and divide the catch of pearls which constituted the wealth of the cowries cargo  it was kai shang who had murdered the captain as he lay asleep in his berth and it had been momulla the maori who had led the attack upon the officer of the watch  gust after his own peculiar habit had found means to delegate to the others the actual taking of life  not that gust entertained any scruples on the subject other than those which induced in him a rare regard for his own personal safety   there is always a certain element of risk to the assassin for victims of deadly assault are seldom prone to die quietly and considerately  there is always a certain element of risk to go so far as to dispute the issue with the murderer  it was this chance of dispute which gust preferred to forgo  but now that the work was done the swede aspired to the position of highest command among the mutineers  he had even gone so far as to appropriate and wear certain articles belonging to the murdered captain of the cowriearticles of apparel which bore upon them the badges and insignia of authority  kai shang was peeved  he had no love for authority and certainly not the slightest intention of submitting to the domination of an ordinary swede sailor  the seeds of discontent were therefore already planted in the camp of the mutineers of the cowrie at the north edge of jungle island  but kai shang realized that he must act with circumspection for gust alone of the motley horde possessed sufficient knowledge of navigation to get them out of the south atlantic and around the cape into more congenial waters where they might find a market for their illgotten wealth and no questions asked  the day before they sighted jungle island and discovered the little landlocked harbour upon the bosom of which the cowrie now rode quietly at anchor the watch had discovered the smoke and funnels of a warship upon the southern horizon  the chance of being spoken to and investigated by a manofwar appealed not at all to any of them so they put into hiding for a few days until the danger should have passed  and now gust did not wish to venture out to sea again   there was no telling he insisted but that the ship they had seen was actually searching for them  kai shang pointed out that such could not be the case since it was impossible for any human being other than themselves to have knowledge of what had transpired aboard the cowrie  but gust was not to be persuaded  in his wicked heart he nursed a scheme whereby he might increase his share of the booty by something like one hundred per cent  he alone could sail the cowrie therefore the others could not leave jungle island without him but what was there to prevent gust with just sufficient men to man the schooner slipping away from kai shang momulla the maori and some half of the crew when opportunity presented  it was for this opportunity that gust waited  some day there would come a moment when kai shang momulla and three or four of the others would be absent from camp exploring or hunting  the swede racked his brain for some plan whereby he might successfully lure from the sight of the anchored ship those whom he had determined to abandon  to this end he organized hunting party after hunting party but always the devil of perversity seemed to enter the soul of kai shang so that wily celestial would never hunt except in the company of gust himself  one day kai shang spoke secretly with momulla the maori pouring into the brown ear of his companion the suspicions which he harboured concerning the swede  momulla was for going immediately and running a long knife through the heart of the traitor  it is true that kai shang had no other evidence than the natural cunning of his own knavish soulbut he imagined in the intentions of gust what he himself would have been glad to accomplish had the means lain at hand  but he dared not let momulla slay the swede upon whom they depended to guide them to their destination   they decided however that it would do no harm to attempt to frighten gust into acceding to their demands and with this purpose in mind the maori sought out the selfconstituted commander of the party  when he broached the subject of immediate departure gust again raised his former objectionthat the warship might very probably be patrolling the sea directly in their southern path waiting for them to make the attempt to reach other waters  momulla scoffed at the fears of his fellow pointing out that as no one aboard any warship knew of their mutiny there could be no reason why they should be suspected  ah exclaimed gust there is where you are wrong   there is where you are lucky that you have an educated man like me to tell you what to do  you are an ignorant savage momulla and so you know nothing of wireless  the maori leaped to his feet and laid his hand upon the hilt of his knife  i am no savage he shouted  i was only joking the swede hastened to explain  we are old friends momulla we cannot afford to quarrel at least not while old kai shang is plotting to steal all the pearls from us  if he could find a man to navigate the cowrie he would leave us in a minute  all his talk about getting away from here is just because he has some scheme in his head to get rid of us  but the wireless asked momulla  what has the wireless to do with our remaining here  oh yes replied gust scratching his head  he was wondering if the maori were really so ignorant as to believe the preposterous lie he was about to unload upon him  oh yes  you see every warship is equipped with what they call a wireless apparatus  it lets them talk to other ships hundreds of miles away and it lets them listen to all that is said on these other ships  now you see when you fellows were shooting up the cowrie you did a whole lot of loud talking and there isnt any doubt but that that warship was alyin off south of us listenin to it all  of course they might not have learned the name of the ship but they heard enough to know that the crew of some ship was mutinying and killin her officers  so you see theyll be waiting to search every ship they sight for a long time to come and they may not be far away now  when he had ceased speaking the swede strove to assume an air of composure that his listener might not have his suspicions aroused as to the truth of the statements that had just been made  momulla sat for some time in silence eyeing gust  at last he rose  you are a great liar he said  if you dont get us on our way by tomorrow youll never have another chance to lie for i heard two of the men saying that theyd like to run a knife into you and that if you kept them in this hole any longer theyd do it  go and ask kai shang if there is not a wireless replied gust  he will tell you that there is such a thing and that vessels can talk to one another across hundreds of miles of water   then say to the two men who wish to kill me that if they do so they will never live to spend their share of the swag for only i can get you safely to any port  so momulla went to kai shang and asked him if there was such an apparatus as a wireless by means of which ships could talk with each other at great distances and kai shang told him that there was  momulla was puzzled but still he wished to leave the island and was willing to take his chances on the open sea rather than to remain longer in the monotony of the camp  if we only had someone else who could navigate a ship wailed kai shang  that afternoon momulla went hunting with two other maoris   they hunted toward the south and had not gone far from camp when they were surprised by the sound of voices ahead of them in the jungle  they knew that none of their own men had preceded them and as all were convinced that the island was uninhabited they were inclined to flee in terror on the hypothesis that the place was hauntedpossibly by the ghosts of the murdered officers and men of the cowrie  but momulla was even more curious than he was superstitious and so he quelled his natural desire to flee from the supernatural  motioning his companions to follow his example he dropped to his hands and knees crawling forward stealthily and with quakings of heart through the jungle in the direction from which came the voices of the unseen speakers  presently at the edge of a little clearing he halted and there he breathed a deep sigh of relief for plainly before him he saw two fleshandblood men sitting upon a fallen log and talking earnestly together  one was schneider mate of the kincaid and the other was a seaman named schmidt  i think we can do it schmidt schneider was saying   a good canoe wouldnt be hard to build and three of us could paddle it to the mainland in a day if the wind was right and the sea reasonably calm there aint no use waiting for the men to build a big enough boat to take the whole party for theyre sore now and sick of working like slaves all day long   it aint none of our business anyway to save the englishman   let him look out for himself says i  he paused for a moment and then eyeing the other to note the effect of his next words he continued but we might take the woman  it would be a shame to leave a nicelookin piece like she is in such a gottforsaken hole as this here island  schmidt looked up and grinned  so thats how shes blowin is it he asked  why didnt you say so in the first place  wots in it for me if i help you  she ought to pay us well to get her back to civilization explained schneider an i tell you what ill do  ill just whack up with the two men that helps me  ill take half an they can divide the other halfyou an whoever the other bloke is  im sick of this place an the sooner i get out of it the better ill like it  what do you say  suits me replied schmidt  i wouldnt know how to reach the mainland myself an know that none o the other fellows would sos youre the only one that knows anything of navigation youre the fellow ill tie to  momulla the maori pricked up his ears  he had a smattering of every tongue that is spoken upon the seas and more than a few times had he sailed on english ships so that he understood fairly well all that had passed between schneider and schmidt since he had stumbled upon them  he rose to his feet and stepped into the clearing  schneider and his companion started as nervously as though a ghost had risen before them schneider reached for his revolver  momulla raised his right hand palm forward as a sign of his pacific intentions  i am a friend he said  i heard you but do not fear that i will reveal what you have said  i can help you and you can help me  he was addressing schneider  you can navigate a ship but you have no ship  we have a ship but no one to navigate it  if you will come with us and ask no questions we will let you take the ship where you will after you have landed us at a certain port the name of which we will give you later  you can take the woman of whom you speak and we will ask no questions either  is it a bargain  schneider desired more information and got as much as momulla thought best to give him  then the maori suggested that they speak with kai shang  the two members of the kincaids company followed momulla and his fellows to a point in the jungle close by the camp of the mutineers   here momulla hid them while he went in search of kai shang first admonishing his maori companions to stand guard over the two sailors lest they change their minds and attempt to escape schneider and schmidt were virtually prisoners though they did not know it  presently momulla returned with kai shang to whom he had briefly narrated the details of the stroke of good fortune that had come to them  the chinaman spoke at length with schneider until notwithstanding his natural suspicion of the sincerity of all men he became quite convinced that schneider was quite as much a rogue as himself and that the fellow was anxious to leave the island  these two premises accepted there could be little doubt that schneider would prove trustworthy in so far as accepting the command of the cowrie was concerned after that kai shang knew that he could find means to coerce the man into submission to his further wishes  when schneider and schmidt left them and set out in the direction of their own camp it was with feelings of far greater relief than they had experienced in many a day   now at last they saw a feasible plan for leaving the island upon a seaworthy craft  there would be no more hard labour at shipbuilding and no risking their lives upon a crudely built makeshift that would be quite as likely to go to the bottom as it would to reach the mainland  also they were to have assistance in capturing the woman or rather women for when momulla had learned that there was a black woman in the other camp he had insisted that she be brought along as well as the white woman  as kai shang and momulla entered their camp it was with a realization that they no longer needed gust   they marched straight to the tent in which they might expect to find him at that hour of the day for though it would have been more comfortable for the entire party to remain aboard the ship they had mutually decided that it would be safer for all concerned were they to pitch their camp ashore  each knew that in the heart of the others was sufficient treachery to make it unsafe for any member of the party to go ashore leaving the others in possession of the cowrie so not more than two or three men at a time were ever permitted aboard the vessel unless all the balance of the company was there too  as the two crossed toward gusts tent the maori felt the edge of his long knife with one grimy calloused thumb   the swede would have felt far from comfortable could he have seen this significant action or read what was passing amid the convolutions of the brown mans cruel brain  now it happened that gust was at that moment in the tent occupied by the cook and this tent stood but a few feet from his own  so that he heard the approach of kai shang and momulla though he did not of course dream that it had any special significance for him  chance had it though that he glanced out of the doorway of the cooks tent at the very moment that kai shang and momulla approached the entrance to his and he thought that he noted a stealthiness in their movements that comported poorly with amicable or friendly intentions and then just as they two slunk within the interior gust caught a glimpse of the long knife which momulla the maori was then carrying behind his back  the swedes eyes opened wide and a funny little sensation assailed the roots of his hairs  also he turned almost white beneath his tan quite precipitately he left the cooks tent   he was not one who required a detailed exposition of intentions that were quite all too obvious  as surely as though he had heard them plotting he knew that kai shang and momulla had come to take his life   the knowledge that he alone could navigate the cowrie had up to now been sufficient assurance of his safety but quite evidently something had occurred of which he had no knowledge that would make it quite worth the while of his coconspirators to eliminate him  without a pause gust darted across the beach and into the jungle  he was afraid of the jungle uncanny noises that were indeed frightful came forth from its recessesthe tangled mazes of the mysterious country back of the beach  but if gust was afraid of the jungle he was far more afraid of kai shang and momulla  the dangers of the jungle were more or less problematical while the danger that menaced him at the hands of his companions was a perfectly wellknown quantity which might be expressed in terms of a few inches of cold steel or the coil of a light rope  he had seen kai shang garrotte a man at paisha in a dark alleyway back of loo kotais place  he feared the rope therefore more than he did the knife of the maori but he feared them both too much to remain within reach of either  therefore he chose the pitiless jungle     chapter 21  the law of the jungle   in tarzans camp by dint of threats and promised rewards the apeman had finally succeeded in getting the hull of a large skiff almost completed  much of the work he and mugambi had done with their own hands in addition to furnishing the camp with meat  schneider the mate had been doing considerable grumbling and had at last openly deserted the work and gone off into the jungle with schmidt to hunt  he said that he wanted a rest and tarzan rather than add to the unpleasantness which already made camp life almost unendurable had permitted the two men to depart without a remonstrance  upon the following day however schneider affected a feeling of remorse for his action and set to work with a will upon the skiff schmidt also worked goodnaturedly and lord greystoke congratulated himself that at last the men had awakened to the necessity for the labour which was being asked of them and to their obligations to the balance of the party  it was with a feeling of greater relief than he had experienced for many a day that he set out that noon to hunt deep in the jungle for a herd of small deer which schneider reported that he and schmidt had seen there the day before  the direction in which schneider had reported seeing the deer was toward the southwest and to that point the apeman swung easily through the tangled verdure of the forest  and as he went there approached from the north a halfdozen illfeatured men who went stealthily through the jungle as go men bent upon the commission of a wicked act  they thought that they travelled unseen but behind them almost from the moment they quitted their own camp a tall man crept upon their trail  in the mans eyes were hate and fear and a great curiosity why went kai shang and momulla and the others thus stealthily toward the south  what did they expect to find there  gust shook his lowbrowed head in perplexity  but he would know  he would follow them and learn their plans and then if he could thwart them he wouldthat went without question  at first he had thought that they searched for him but finally his better judgment assured him that such could not be the case since they had accomplished all they really desired by chasing him out of camp never would kai shang or momulla go to such pains to slay him or another unless it would put money into their pockets and as gust had no money it was evident that they were searching for someone else  presently the party he trailed came to a halt  its members concealed themselves in the foliage bordering the game trail along which they had come  gust that he might the better observe clambered into the branches of a tree to the rear of them being careful that the leafy fronds hid him from the view of his erstwhile mates  he had not long to wait before he saw a strange white man approach carefully along the trail from the south  at sight of the newcomer momulla and kai shang arose from their places of concealment and greeted him  gust could not overhear what passed between them  then the man returned in the direction from which he had come  he was schneider  nearing his camp he circled to the opposite side of it and presently came running in breathlessly   excitedly he hastened to mugambi  quick he cried  those apes of yours have caught schmidt and will kill him if we do not hasten to his aid  you alone can call them off take jones and sullivanyou may need helpand get to him as quick as you can  follow the game trail south for about a mile  i will remain here  i am too spent with running to go back with you and the mate of the kincaid threw himself upon the ground panting as though he was almost done for  mugambi hesitated  he had been left to guard the two women   he did not know what to do and then jane clayton who had heard schneiders story added her pleas to those of the mate  do not delay she urged  we shall be all right here   mr schneider will remain with us  go mugambi  the poor fellow must be saved  schmidt who lay hidden in a bush at the edge of the camp grinned mugambi heeding the commands of his mistress though still doubtful of the wisdom of his action started off toward the south with jones and sullivan at his heels  no sooner had he disappeared than schmidt rose and darted north into the jungle and a few minutes later the face of kai shang of fachan appeared at the edge of the clearing  schneider saw the chinaman and motioned to him that the coast was clear  jane clayton and the mosula woman were sitting at the opening of the formers tent their backs toward the approaching ruffians  the first intimation that either had of the presence of strangers in camp was the sudden appearance of a halfdozen ragged villains about them  come said kai shang motioning that the two arise and follow him  jane clayton sprang to her feet and looked about for schneider only to see him standing behind the newcomers a grin upon his face  at his side stood schmidt  instantly she saw that she had been made the victim of a plot  what is the meaning of this she asked addressing the mate  it means that we have found a ship and that we can now escape from jungle island replied the man  why did you send mugambi and the others into the jungle she inquired  they are not coming with usonly you and i and the mosula woman  come repeated kai shang and seized jane claytons wrist  one of the maoris grasped the black woman by the arm and when she would have screamed struck her across the mouth  mugambi raced through the jungle toward the south  jones and sullivan trailed far behind  for a mile he continued upon his way to the relief of schmidt but no signs saw he of the missing man or of any of the apes of akut  at last he halted and called aloud the summons which he and tarzan had used to hail the great anthropoids  there was no response  jones and sullivan came up with the black warrior as the latter stood voicing his weird call  for another halfmile the black searched calling occasionally  finally the truth flashed upon him and then like a frightened deer he wheeled and dashed back toward camp   arriving there it was but a moment before full confirmation of his fears was impressed upon him lady greystoke and the mosula woman were gone  so likewise was schneider  when jones and sullivan joined mugambi he would have killed them in his anger thinking them parties to the plot but they finally succeeded in partially convincing him that they had known nothing of it  as they stood speculating upon the probable whereabouts of the women and their abductor and the purpose which schneider had in mind in taking them from camp tarzan of the apes swung from the branches of a tree and crossed the clearing toward them  his keen eyes detected at once that something was radically wrong and when he had heard mugambis story his jaws clicked angrily together as he knitted his brows in thought  what could the mate hope to accomplish by taking jane clayton from a camp upon a small island from which there was no escape from the vengeance of tarzan  the apeman could not believe the fellow such a fool and then a slight realization of the truth dawned upon him  schneider would not have committed such an act unless he had been reasonably sure that there was a way by which he could quit jungle island with his prisoners  but why had he taken the black woman as well  there must have been others one of whom wanted the dusky female  come said tarzan there is but one thing to do now and that is to follow the trail  as he finished speaking a tall ungainly figure emerged from the jungle north of the camp  he came straight toward the four men  he was an entire stranger to all of them not one of whom had dreamed that another human being than those of their own camp dwelt upon the unfriendly shores of jungle island  it was gust  he came directly to the point  your women were stolen he said  if you want ever to see them again come quickly and follow me  if we do not hurry the cowrie will be standing out to sea by the time we reach her anchorage  who are you asked tarzan  what do you know of the theft of my wife and the black woman  i heard kai shang and momulla the maori plot with two men of your camp  they had chased me from our camp and would have killed me  now i will get even with them  come  gust led the four men of the kincaids camp at a rapid trot through the jungle toward the north  would they come to the sea in time  but a few more minutes would answer the question  and when at last the little party did break through the last of the screening foliage and the harbour and the ocean lay before them they realized that fate had been most cruelly unkind for the cowrie was already under sail and moving slowly out of the mouth of the harbour into the open sea  what were they to do  tarzans broad chest rose and fell to the force of his pent emotions  the last blow seemed to have fallen and if ever in all his life tarzan of the apes had had occasion to abandon hope it was now that he saw the ship bearing his wife to some frightful fate moving gracefully over the rippling water so very near and yet so hideously far away  in silence he stood watching the vessel  he saw it turn toward the east and finally disappear around a headland on its way he knew not whither  then he dropped upon his haunches and buried his face in his hands  it was after dark that the five men returned to the camp on the east shore  the night was hot and sultry  no slightest breeze ruffled the foliage of the trees or rippled the mirrorlike surface of the ocean only a gentle swell rolled softly in upon the beach  never had tarzan seen the great atlantic so ominously at peace  he was standing at the edge of the beach gazing out to sea in the direction of the mainland his mind filled with sorrow and hopelessness when from the jungle close behind the camp came the uncanny wail of a panther  there was a familiar note in the weird cry and almost mechanically tarzan turned his head and answered  a moment later the tawny figure of sheeta slunk out into the halflight of the beach  there was no moon but the sky was brilliant with stars  silently the savage brute came to the side of the man  it had been long since tarzan had seen his old fighting companion but the soft purr was sufficient to assure him that the animal still recalled the bonds which had united them in the past  the apeman let his fingers fall upon the beasts coat and as sheeta pressed close against his leg he caressed and fondled the wicked head while his eyes continued to search the blackness of the waters  presently he started  what was that  he strained his eyes into the night  then he turned and called aloud to the men smoking upon their blankets in the camp  they came running to his side but gust hesitated when he saw the nature of tarzans companion  look cried tarzan  a light  a ships light  it must be the cowrie  they are becalmed  and then with an exclamation of renewed hope we can reach them  the skiff will carry us easily  gust demurred  they are well armed he warned  we could not take the shipjust five of us  there are six now replied tarzan pointing to sheeta and we can have more still in a halfhour  sheeta is the equivalent of twenty men and the few others i can bring will add full a hundred to our fighting strength  you do not know them  the apeman turned and raised his head toward the jungle while there pealed from his lips time after time the fearsome cry of the bullape who would summon his fellows  presently from the jungle came an answering cry and then another and another  gust shuddered  among what sort of creatures had fate thrown him  were not kai shang and momulla to be preferred to this great white giant who stroked a panther and called to the beasts of the jungle  in a few minutes the apes of akut came crashing through the underbrush and out upon the beach while in the meantime the five men had been struggling with the unwieldy bulk of the skiffs hull  by dint of herculean efforts they had managed to get it to the waters edge  the oars from the two small boats of the kincaid which had been washed away by an offshore wind the very night that the party had landed had been in use to support the canvas of the sailcloth tents these were hastily requisitioned and by the time akut and his followers came down to the water all was ready for embarkation  once again the hideous crew entered the service of their master and without question took up their places in the skiff   the four men for gust could not be prevailed upon to accompany the party fell to the oars using them paddlewise while some of the apes followed their example and presently the ungainly skiff was moving quietly out to sea in the direction of the light which rose and fell gently with the swell  a sleepy sailor kept a poor vigil upon the cowries deck while in the cabin below schneider paced up and down arguing with jane clayton  the woman had found a revolver in a table drawer in the room in which she had been locked and now she kept the mate of the kincaid at bay with the weapon  the mosula woman kneeled behind her while schneider paced up and down before the door threatening and pleading and promising but all to no avail  presently from the deck above came a shout of warning and a shot  for an instant jane clayton relaxed her vigilance and turned her eyes toward the cabin skylight  simultaneously schneider was upon her  the first intimation the watch had that there was another craft within a thousand miles of the cowrie came when he saw the head and shoulders of a man poked over the ships side   instantly the fellow sprang to his feet with a cry and levelled his revolver at the intruder  it was his cry and the subsequent report of the revolver which threw jane clayton off her guard  upon deck the quiet of fancied security soon gave place to the wildest pandemonium  the crew of the cowrie rushed above armed with revolvers cutlasses and the long knives that many of them habitually wore but the alarm had come too late  already the beasts of tarzan were upon the ships deck with tarzan and the two men of the kincaids crew  in the face of the frightful beasts the courage of the mutineers wavered and broke  those with revolvers fired a few scattering shots and then raced for some place of supposed safety  into the shrouds went some but the apes of akut were more at home there than they  screaming with terror the maoris were dragged from their lofty perches the beasts uncontrolled by tarzan who had gone in search of jane loosed the full fury of their savage natures upon the unhappy wretches who fell into their clutches  sheeta in the meanwhile had felt his great fangs sink into but a single jugular  for a moment he mauled the corpse and then he spied kai shang darting down the companionway toward his cabin  with a shrill scream sheeta was after hima scream which awoke an almost equally uncanny cry in the throat of the terrorstricken chinaman  but kai shang reached his cabin a fraction of a second ahead of the panther and leaping within slammed the doorjust too late  sheetas great body hurtled against it before the catch engaged and a moment later kai shang was gibbering and shrieking in the back of an upper berth  lightly sheeta sprang after his victim and presently the wicked days of kai shang of fachan were ended and sheeta was gorging himself upon tough and stringy flesh  a moment scarcely had elapsed after schneider leaped upon jane clayton and wrenched the revolver from her hand when the door of the cabin opened and a tall and halfnaked white man stood framed within the portal  silently he leaped across the cabin  schneider felt sinewy fingers at his throat  he turned his head to see who had attacked him and his eyes went wide when he saw the face of the apeman close above his own  grimly the fingers tightened upon the mates throat  he tried to scream to plead but no sound came forth  his eyes protruded as he struggled for freedom for breath for life  jane clayton seized her husbands hands and tried to drag them from the throat of the dying man but tarzan only shook his head  not again he said quietly  before have i permitted scoundrels to live only to suffer and to have you suffer for my mercy  this time we shall make sure of one scoundrelsure that he will never again harm us or another and with a sudden wrench he twisted the neck of the perfidious mate until there was a sharp crack and the mans body lay limp and motionless in the apemans grasp  with a gesture of disgust tarzan tossed the corpse aside  then he returned to the deck followed by jane and the mosula woman  the battle there was over  schmidt and momulla and two others alone remained alive of all the company of the cowrie for they had found sanctuary in the forecastle  the others had died horribly and as they deserved beneath the fangs and talons of the beasts of tarzan and in the morning the sun rose on a grisly sight upon the deck of the unhappy cowrie but this time the blood which stained her white planking was the blood of the guilty and not of the innocent  tarzan brought forth the men who had hidden in the forecastle and without promises of immunity from punishment forced them to help work the vesselthe only alternative was immediate death  a stiff breeze had risen with the sun and with canvas spread the cowrie set in toward jungle island where a few hours later tarzan picked up gust and bid farewell to sheeta and the apes of akut for here he set the beasts ashore to pursue the wild and natural life they loved so well nor did they lose a moments time in disappearing into the cool depths of their beloved jungle  that they knew that tarzan was to leave them may be doubtedexcept possibly in the case of the more intelligent akut who alone of all the others remained upon the beach as the small boat drew away toward the schooner carrying his savage lord and master from him  and as long as their eyes could span the distance jane and tarzan standing upon the deck saw the lonely figure of the shaggy anthropoid motionless upon the surfbeaten sands of jungle island   it was three days later that the cowrie fell in with hm sloopofwar shorewater through whose wireless lord greystoke soon got in communication with london  thus he learned that which filled his and his wifes heart with joy and thanksgivinglittle jack was safe at lord greystokes town house  it was not until they reached london that they learned the details of the remarkable chain of circumstances that had preserved the infant unharmed  it developed that rokoff fearing to take the child aboard the kincaid by day had hidden it in a low den where nameless infants were harboured intending to carry it to the steamer after dark  his confederate and chief lieutenant paulvitch true to the long years of teaching of his wily master had at last succumbed to the treachery and greed that had always marked his superior and lured by the thoughts of the immense ransom that he might win by returning the child unharmed had divulged the secret of its parentage to the woman who maintained the foundling asylum  through her he had arranged for the substitution of another infant knowing full well that never until it was too late would rokoff suspect the trick that had been played upon him  the woman had promised to keep the child until paulvitch returned to england but she in turn had been tempted to betray her trust by the lure of gold and so had opened negotiations with lord greystokes solicitors for the return of the child  esmeralda the old negro nurse whose absence on a vacation in america at the time of the abduction of little jack had been attributed by her as the cause of the calamity had returned and positively identified the infant  the ransom had been paid and within ten days of the date of his kidnapping the future lord greystoke none the worse for his experience had been returned to his fathers home  and so that last and greatest of nikolas rokoffs many rascalities had not only miserably miscarried through the treachery he had taught his only friend but it had resulted in the archvillains death and given to lord and lady greystoke a peace of mind that neither could ever have felt so long as the vital spark remained in the body of the russian and his malign mind was free to formulate new atrocities against them  rokoff was dead and while the fate of paulvitch was unknown they had every reason to believe that he had succumbed to the dangers of the jungle where last they had seen himthe malicious tool of his master  and thus in so far as they might know they were to be freed for ever from the menace of these two menthe only enemies which tarzan of the apes ever had had occasion to fear because they struck at him cowardly blows through those he loved   it was a happy family party that were reunited in greystoke house the day that lord greystoke and his lady landed upon english soil from the deck of the shorewater  accompanying them were mugambi and the mosula woman whom he had found in the bottom of the canoe that night upon the bank of the little tributary of the ugambi  the woman had preferred to cling to her new lord and master  rather than return to the marriage she had tried to escape  tarzan had proposed to them that they might find a home upon his vast african estates in the land of the waziri where they were to be sent as soon as opportunity presented itself  possibly we shall see them all there amid the savage romance of the grim jungle and the great plains where tarzan of the apes loves best to be  who knows
