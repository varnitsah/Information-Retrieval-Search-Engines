4109924	the land that time forgot   by  edgar rice burroughs     chapter 1  it must have been a little after three oclock in the afternoon that it happenedthe afternoon of june 3rd 1916  it seems incredible that all that i have passed throughall those weird and terrifying experiencesshould have been encompassed within so short a span as three brief months  rather might i have experienced a cosmic cycle with all its changes and evolutions for that which i have seen with my own eyes in this brief interval of timethings that no other mortal eye had seen before glimpses of a world past a world dead a world so long dead that even in the lowest cambrian stratum no trace of it remains  fused with the melting inner crust it has passed forever beyond the ken of man other than in that lost pocket of the earth whither fate has borne me and where my doom is sealed i am here and here must remain   after reading this far my interest which already had been stimulated by the finding of the manuscript was approaching the boilingpoint  i had come to greenland for the summer on the advice of my physician and was slowly being bored to extinction as i had thoughtlessly neglected to bring sufficient readingmatter being an indifferent fisherman my enthusiasm for this form of sport soon waned yet in the absence of other forms of recreation i was now risking my life in an entirely inadequate boat off cape farewell at the southernmost extremity of greenland  greenland  as a descriptive appellation it is a sorry jokebut my story has nothing to do with greenland nothing to do with me so i shall get through with the one and the other as rapidly as possible  the inadequate boat finally arrived at a precarious landing the natives waistdeep in the surf assisting  i was carried ashore and while the evening meal was being prepared i wandered to and fro along the rocky shattered shore  bits of surfharried beach clove the worn granite or whatever the rocks of cape farewell may be composed of and as i followed the ebbing tide down one of these soft stretches i saw the thing  were one to bump into a bengal tiger in the ravine behind the bimini baths one could be no more surprised than was i to see a perfectly good quart thermos bottle turning and twisting in the surf of cape farewell at the southern extremity of greenland i rescued it but i was soaked above the knees doing it and then i sat down in the sand and opened it and in the long twilight read the manuscript neatly written and tightly folded which was its contents  you have read the opening paragraph and if you are an imaginative idiot like myself you will want to read the rest of it so i shall give it to you here omitting quotation markswhich are difficult of remembrance  in two minutes you will forget me   my home is in santa monica  i am or was junior member of my fathers firm  we are shipbuilders  of recent years we have specialized on submarines which we have built for germany england france and the united states  i know a sub as a mother knows her babys face and have commanded a score of them on their trial runs  yet my inclinations were all toward aviation i graduated under curtiss and after a long siege with my father obtained his permission to try for the lafayette escadrille  as a steppingstone i obtained an appointment in the american ambulance service and was on my way to france when three shrill whistles altered in as many seconds my entire scheme of life  i was sitting on deck with some of the fellows who were going into the american ambulance service with me my airedale crown prince nobbler asleep at my feet when the first blast of the whistle shattered the peace and security of the ship  ever since entering the uboat zone we had been on the lookout for periscopes and children that we were bemoaning the unkind fate that was to see us safely into france on the morrow without a glimpse of the dread marauders  we were young we craved thrills and god knows we got them that day yet by comparison with that through which i have since passed they were as tame as a punchandjudy show  i shall never forget the ashy faces of the passengers as they stampeded for their lifebelts though there was no panic nobs rose with a low growl  i rose also and over the ships side i saw not two hundred yards distant the periscope of a submarine while racing toward the liner the wake of a torpedo was distinctly visible  we were aboard an american shipwhich of course was not armed  we were entirely defenseless yet without warning we were being torpedoed  i stood rigid spellbound watching the white wake of the torpedo it struck us on the starboard side almost amidships  the vessel rocked as though the sea beneath it had been uptorn by a mighty volcano we were thrown to the decks bruised and stunned and then above the ship carrying with it fragments of steel and wood and dismembered human bodies rose a column of water hundreds of feet into the air  the silence which followed the detonation of the exploding torpedo was almost equally horrifying  it lasted for perhaps two seconds to be followed by the screams and moans of the wounded the cursing of the men and the hoarse commands of the ships officers  they were splendidthey and their crew  never before had i been so proud of my nationality as i was that moment  in all the chaos which followed the torpedoing of the liner no officer or member of the crew lost his head or showed in the slightest any degree of panic or fear  while we were attempting to lower boats the submarine emerged and trained guns on us  the officer in command ordered us to lower our flag but this the captain of the liner refused to do the ship was listing frightfully to starboard rendering the port boats useless while half the starboard boats had been demolished by the explosion even while the passengers were crowding the starboard rail and scrambling into the few boats left to us the submarine commenced shelling the ship  i saw one shell burst in a group of women and children and then i turned my head and covered my eyes  when i looked again to horror was added chagrin for with the emerging of the uboat i had recognized her as a product of our own shipyard  i knew her to a rivet  i had superintended her construction  i had sat in that very conningtower and directed the efforts of the sweating crew below when first her prow clove the sunny summer waters of the pacific and now this creature of my brain and hand had turned frankenstein bent upon pursuing me to my death  a second shell exploded upon the deck  one of the lifeboats frightfully overcrowded swung at a dangerous angle from its davits a fragment of the shell shattered the bow tackle and i saw the women and children and the men vomited into the sea beneath while the boat dangled stern up for a moment from its single davit and at last with increasing momentum dived into the midst of the struggling victims screaming upon the face of the waters  now i saw men spring to the rail and leap into the ocean  the deck was tilting to an impossible angle  nobs braced himself with all four feet to keep from slipping into the scuppers and looked up into my face with a questioning whine  i stooped and stroked his head  come on boy i cried and running to the side of the ship dived headforemost over the rail  when i came up the first thing i saw was nobs swimming about in a bewildered sort of way a few yards from me at sight of me his ears went flat and his lips parted in a characteristic grin  the submarine was withdrawing toward the north but all the time it was shelling the open boats three of them loaded to the gunwales with survivors  fortunately the small boats presented a rather poor target which combined with the bad marksmanship of the germans preserved their occupants from harm and after a few minutes a blotch of smoke appeared upon the eastern horizon and the uboat submerged and disappeared  all the time the lifeboats has been pulling away from the danger of the sinking liner and now though i yelled at the top of my lungs they either did not hear my appeals for help or else did not dare return to succor me  nobs and i had gained some little distance from the ship when it rolled completely over and sank we were caught in the suction only enough to be drawn backward a few yards neither of us being carried beneath the surface i glanced hurriedly about for something to which to cling my eyes were directed toward the point at which the liner had disappeared when there came from the depths of the ocean the muffled reverberation of an explosion and almost simultaneously a geyser of water in which were shattered lifeboats human bodies steam coal oil and the flotsam of a liners deck leaped high above the surface of the seaa watery column momentarily marking the grave of another ship in this greatest cemetery of the seas  when the turbulent waters had somewhat subsided and the sea had ceased to spew up wreckage i ventured to swim back in search of something substantial enough to support my weight and that of nobs as well  i had gotten well over the area of the wreck when not a halfdozen yards ahead of me a lifeboat shot bow foremost out of the ocean almost its entire length to flop down upon its keel with a mighty splash  it must have been carried far below held to its mother ship by a single rope which finally parted to the enormous strain put upon it  in no other way can i account for its having leaped so far out of the watera beneficent circumstance to which i doubtless owe my life and that of another far dearer to me than my own  i say beneficent circumstance even in the face of the fact that a fate far more hideous confronts us than that which we escaped that day for because of that circumstance i have met her whom otherwise i never should have known i have met and loved her  at least i have had that great happiness in life nor can caspak with all her horrors expunge that which has been  so for the thousandth time i thank the strange fate which sent that lifeboat hurtling upward from the green pit of destruction to which it had been draggedsent it far up above the surface emptying its water as it rose above the waves and dropping it upon the surface of the sea buoyant and safe  it did not take me long to clamber over its side and drag nobs in to comparative safety and then i glanced around upon the scene of death and desolation which surrounded us  the sea was littered with wreckage among which floated the pitiful forms of women and children buoyed up by their useless lifebelts some were torn and mangled others lay rolling quietly to the motion of the sea their countenances composed and peaceful others were set in hideous lines of agony or horror close to the boats side floated the figure of a girl  her face was turned upward held above the surface by her lifebelt and was framed in a floating mass of dark and waving hair  she was very beautiful  i had never looked upon such perfect features such a divine molding which was at the same time humanintensely human  it was a face filled with character and strength and femininitythe face of one who was created to love and to be loved  the cheeks were flushed to the hue of life and health and vitality and yet she lay there upon the bosom of the sea dead  i felt something rise in my throat as i looked down upon that radiant vision and i swore that i should live to avenge her murder  and then i let my eyes drop once more to the face upon the water and what i saw nearly tumbled me backward into the sea for the eyes in the dead face had opened the lips had parted and one hand was raised toward me in a mute appeal for succor  she lived she was not dead i leaned over the boats side and drew her quickly in to the comparative safety which god had given me  i removed her lifebelt and my soggy coat and made a pillow for her head  i chafed her hands and arms and feet  i worked over her for an hour and at last i was rewarded by a deep sigh and again those great eyes opened and looked into mine  at that i was all embarrassment  i have never been a ladies man at lelandstanford i was the butt of the class because of my hopeless imbecility in the presence of a pretty girl but the men liked me nevertheless  i was rubbing one of her hands when she opened her eyes and i dropped it as though it were a redhot rivet those eyes took me in slowly from head to foot then they wandered slowly around the horizon marked by the rising and falling gunwales of the lifeboat they looked at nobs and softened and then came back to me filled with questioning  ii i stammered moving away and stumbling over the next thwart the vision smiled wanly  ayeaye sir she replied faintly and again her lips drooped and her long lashes swept the firm fair texture of her skin  i hope that you are feeling better i finally managed to say  do you know she said after a moment of silence i have been awake for a long time  but i did not dare open my eyes i thought i must be dead and i was afraid to look for fear that i should see nothing but blackness about me  i am afraid to die  tell me what happened after the ship went down i remember all that happened beforeoh but i wish that i might forget it  a sob broke her voice  the beasts she went on after a moment  and to think that i was to have married one of thema lieutenant in the german navy  presently she resumed as though she had not ceased speaking i went down and down and down  i thought i should never cease to sink  i felt no particular distress until i suddenly started upward at everincreasing velocity then my lungs seemed about to burst and i must have lost consciousness for i remember nothing more until i opened my eyes after listening to a torrent of invective against germany and germans  tell me please all that happened after the ship sank  i told her then as well as i could all that i had seenthe submarine shelling the open boats and all the rest of it she thought it marvelous that we should have been spared in so providential a manner and i had a pretty speech upon my tongues end but lacked the nerve to deliver it  nobs had come over and nosed his muzzle into her lap and she stroked his ugly face and at last she leaned over and put her cheek against his forehead i have always admired nobs but this was the first time that it had ever occurred to me that i might wish to be nobs  i wondered how he would take it for he is as unused to women as i  but he took to it as a duck takes to water  what i lack of being a ladies man nobs certainly makes up for as a ladies dog the old scalawag just closed his eyes and put on one of the softest sugarwouldntmeltinmymouth expressions you ever saw and stood there taking it and asking for more  it made me jealous  you seem fond of dogs i said  i am fond of this dog she replied  whether she meant anything personal in that reply i did not know but i took it as personal and it made me feel mighty good  as we drifted about upon that vast expanse of loneliness it is not strange that we should quickly become well acquainted constantly we scanned the horizon for signs of smoke venturing guesses as to our chances of rescue but darkness settled and the black night enveloped us without ever the sight of a speck upon the waters  we were thirsty hungry uncomfortable and cold  our wet garments had dried but little and i knew that the girl must be in grave danger from the exposure to a night of cold and wet upon the water in an open boat without sufficient clothing and no food  i had managed to bail all the water out of the boat with cupped hands ending by mopping the balance up with my handkerchiefa slow and backbreaking procedure thus i had made a comparatively dry place for the girl to lie down low in the bottom of the boat where the sides would protect her from the night wind and when at last she did so almost overcome as she was by weakness and fatigue i threw my wet coat over her further to thwart the chill  but it was of no avail as i sat watching her the moonlight marking out the graceful curves of her slender young body i saw her shiver  isnt there something i can do i asked  you cant lie there chilled through all night  cant you suggest something  she shook her head  we must grin and bear it she replied after a moment  nobbler came and lay down on the thwart beside me his back against my leg and i sat staring in dumb misery at the girl knowing in my heart of hearts that she might die before morning came for what with the shock and exposure she had already gone through enough to kill almost any woman and as i gazed down at her so small and delicate and helpless there was born slowly within my breast a new emotion  it had never been there before now it will never cease to be there  it made me almost frantic in my desire to find some way to keep warm and cooling lifeblood in her veins  i was cold myself though i had almost forgotten it until nobbler moved and i felt a new sensation of cold along my leg against which he had lain and suddenly realized that in that one spot i had been warm  like a great light came the understanding of a means to warm the girl  immediately i knelt beside her to put my scheme into practice when suddenly i was overwhelmed with embarrassment  would she permit it even if i could muster the courage to suggest it  then i saw her frame convulse shudderingly her muscles reacting to her rapidly lowering temperature and casting prudery to the winds i threw myself down beside her and took her in my arms pressing her body close to mine  she drew away suddenly voicing a little cry of fright and tried to push me from her  forgive me i managed to stammer  it is the only way you will die of exposure if you are not warmed and nobs and i are the only means we can command for furnishing warmth and i held her tightly while i called nobs and bade him lie down at her back  the girl didnt struggle any more when she learned my purpose but she gave two or three little gasps and then began to cry softly burying her face on my arm and thus she fell asleep    chapter 2  toward morning  i must have dozed though it seemed to me at the time that i had lain awake for days instead of hours  when i finally opened my eyes it was daylight and the girls hair was in my face and she was breathing normally  i thanked god for that  she had turned her head during the night so that as i opened my eyes i saw her face not an inch from mine my lips almost touching hers  it was nobs who finally awoke her  he got up stretched turned around a few times and lay down again and the girl opened her eyes and looked into mine  hers went very wide at first and then slowly comprehension came to her and she smiled  you have been very good to me she said as i helped her to rise though if the truth were known i was more in need of assistance than she the circulation all along my left side seeming to be paralyzed entirely  you have been very good to me and that was the only mention she ever made of it yet i know that she was thankful and that only reserve prevented her from referring to what to say the least was an embarrassing situation however unavoidable  shortly after daylight we saw smoke apparently coming straight toward us and after a time we made out the squat lines of a tugone of those fearless exponents of englands supremacy of the sea that tows sailing ships into french and english ports i stood up on a thwart and waved my soggy coat above my head nobs stood upon another and barked  the girl sat at my feet straining her eyes toward the deck of the oncoming boat they see us she said at last  there is a man answering your signal she was right  a lump came into my throatfor her sake rather than for mine  she was saved and none too soon she could not have lived through another night upon the channel she might not have lived through the coming day  the tug came close beside us and a man on deck threw us a rope willing hands dragged us to the deck nobs scrambling nimbly aboard without assistance  the rough men were gentle as mothers with the girl  plying us both with questions they hustled her to the captains cabin and me to the boilerroom  they told the girl to take off her wet clothes and throw them outside the door that they might be dried and then to slip into the captains bunk and get warm  they didnt have to tell me to strip after i once got into the warmth of the boilerroom  in a jiffy my clothes hung about where they might dry most quickly and i myself was absorbing through every pore the welcome heat of the stifling compartment  they brought us hot soup and coffee and then those who were not on duty sat around and helped me damn the kaiser and his brood  as soon as our clothes were dry they bade us don them as the chances were always more than fair in those waters that we should run into trouble with the enemy as i was only too well aware what with the warmth and the feeling of safety for the girl and the knowledge that a little rest and food would quickly overcome the effects of her experiences of the past dismal hours i was feeling more content than i had experienced since those three whistleblasts had shattered the peace of my world the previous afternoon  but peace upon the channel has been but a transitory thing since august 1914  it proved itself such that morning for i had scarce gotten into my dry clothes and taken the girls apparel to the captains cabin when an order was shouted down into the engineroom for full speed ahead and an instant later i heard the dull boom of a gun in a moment i was up on deck to see an enemy submarine about two hundred yards off our port bow  she had signaled us to stop and our skipper had ignored the order but now she had her gun trained on us and the second shot grazed the cabin warning the belligerent tugcaptain that it was time to obey  once again an order went down to the engineroom and the tug reduced speed  the uboat ceased firing and ordered the tug to come about and approach  our momentum had carried us a little beyond the enemy craft but we were turning now on the arc of a circle that would bring us alongside her  as i stood watching the maneuver and wondering what was to become of us i felt something touch my elbow and turned to see the girl standing at my side  she looked up into my face with a rueful expression they seem bent on our destruction she said and it looks like the same boat that sunk us yesterday  it is i replied  i know her well  i helped design her and took her out on her first run  the girl drew back from me with a little exclamation of surprise and disappointment  i thought you were an american she said i had no idea you were aa  nor am i i replied  americans have been building submarines for all nations for many years  i wish though that we had gone bankrupt my father and i before ever we turned out that frankenstein of a thing  we were approaching the uboat at half speed now and i could almost distinguish the features of the men upon her deck a sailor stepped to my side and slipped something hard and cold into my hand  i did not have to look at it to know that it was a heavy pistol  tyke er an use er was all he said  our bow was pointed straight toward the uboat now as i heard word passed to the engine for full speed ahead  i instantly grasped the brazen effrontery of the plucky english skipperhe was going to ram five hundreds tons of uboat in the face of her trained gun  i could scarce repress a cheer  at first the boches didnt seem to grasp his intention  evidently they thought they were witnessing an exhibition of poor seamanship and they yelled their warnings to the tug to reduce speed and throw the helm hard to port  we were within fifty feet of them when they awakened to the intentional menace of our maneuver  their gun crew was off its guard but they sprang to their piece now and sent a futile shell above our heads nobs leaped about and barked furiously  let em have it commanded the tugcaptain and instantly revolvers and rifles poured bullets upon the deck of the submersible  two of the guncrew went down the other trained their piece at the waterline of the oncoming tug  the balance of those on deck replied to our smallarms fire directing their efforts toward the man at our wheel  i hastily pushed the girl down the companionway leading to the engineroom and then i raised my pistol and fired my first shot at a boche  what happened in the next few seconds happened so quickly that details are rather blurred in my memory  i saw the helmsman lunge forward upon the wheel pulling the helm around so that the tug sheered off quickly from her course and i recall realizing that all our efforts were to be in vain because of all the men aboard fate had decreed that this one should fall first to an enemy bullet  i saw the depleted guncrew on the submarine fire their piece and i felt the shock of impact and heard the loud explosion as the shell struck and exploded in our bows  i saw and realized these things even as i was leaping into the pilothouse and grasping the wheel standing astride the dead body of the helmsman  with all my strength i threw the helm to starboard but it was too late to effect the purpose of our skipper  the best i did was to scrape alongside the sub i heard someone shriek an order into the engineroom the boat shuddered and trembled to the sudden reversing of the engines and our speed quickly lessened  then i saw what that madman of a skipper planned since his first scheme had gone wrong  with a loudyelled command he leaped to the slippery deck of the submersible and at his heels came his hardy crew  i sprang from the pilothouse and followed not to be left out in the cold when it came to strafing the boches  from the engine room companionway came the engineer and stockers and together we leaped after the balance of the crew and into the handtohand fight that was covering the wet deck with red blood  beside me came nobs silent now and grim  germans were emerging from the open hatch to take part in the battle on deck at first the pistols cracked amidst the cursing of the men and the loud commands of the commander and his junior but presently we were too indiscriminately mixed to make it safe to use our firearms and the battle resolved itself into a handtohand struggle for possession of the deck  the sole aim of each of us was to hurl one of the opposing force into the sea  i shall never forget the hideous expression upon the face of the great prussian with whom chance confronted me he lowered his head and rushed at me bellowing like a bull with a quick sidestep and ducking low beneath his outstretched arms i eluded him and as he turned to come back at me i landed a blow upon his chin which sent him spinning toward the edge of the deck  i saw his wild endeavors to regain his equilibrium i saw him reel drunkenly for an instant upon the brink of eternity and then with a loud scream slip into the sea at the same instant a pair of giant arms encircled me from behind and lifted me entirely off my feet  kick and squirm as i would i could neither turn toward my antagonist nor free myself from his maniacal grasp  relentlessly he was rushing me toward the side of the vessel and death  there was none to stay him for each of my companions was more than occupied by from one to three of the enemy  for an instant i was fearful for myself and then i saw that which filled me with a far greater terror for another  my boche was bearing me toward the side of the submarine against which the tug was still pounding  that i should be ground to death between the two was lost upon me as i saw the girl standing alone upon the tugs deck as i saw the stern high in air and the bow rapidly settling for the final dive as i saw death from which i could not save her clutching at the skirts of the woman i now knew all too well that i loved  i had perhaps the fraction of a second longer to live when i heard an angry growl behind us mingle with a cry of pain and rage from the giant who carried me  instantly he went backward to the deck and as he did so he threw his arms outwards to save himself freeing me  i fell heavily upon him but was upon my feet in the instant  as i arose i cast a single glance at my opponent never again would he menace me or another for nobs great jaws had closed upon his throat  then i sprang toward the edge of the deck closest to the girl upon the sinking tug  jump i cried  jump  and i held out my arms to her instantly as though with implicit confidence in my ability to save her she leaped over the side of the tug onto the sloping slippery side of the uboat i reached far over to seize her hand  at the same instant the tug pointed its stern straight toward the sky and plunged out of sight  my hand missed the girls by a fraction of an inch and i saw her slip into the sea but scarce had she touched the water when i was in after her  the sinking tug drew us far below the surface but i had seized her the moment i struck the water and so we went down together and together we came upa few yards from the uboat  the first thing i heard was nobs barking furiously evidently he had missed me and was searching a single glance at the vessels deck assured me that the battle was over and that we had been victorious for i saw our survivors holding a handful of the enemy at pistol points while one by one the rest of the crew was coming out of the crafts interior and lining up on deck with the other prisoners  as i swam toward the submarine with the girl nobs persistent barking attracted the attention of some of the tugs crew so that as soon as we reached the side there were hands to help us aboard  i asked the girl if she was hurt but she assured me that she was none the worse for this second wetting nor did she seem to suffer any from shock  i was to learn for myself that this slender and seemingly delicate creature possessed the heart and courage of a warrior  as we joined our own party i found the tugs mate checking up our survivors  there were ten of us left not including the girl our brave skipper was missing as were eight others  there had been nineteen of us in the attacking party and we had accounted in one way and another during the battle for sixteen germans and had taken nine prisoners including the commander  his lieutenant had been killed  not a bad days work said bradley the mate when he had completed his roll  only losing the skipper he added was the worst  he was a fine man a fine man  olsonwho in spite of his name was irish and in spite of his not being scotch had been the tugs engineerwas standing with bradley and me  yis he agreed its a days worrk were after doin but what are we goin to be doin wid it now we got it  well run her into the nearest english port said bradley and then well all go ashore and get our v cs he concluded laughing  how you goin to run her queried olson  you cant trust these dutchmen  bradley scratched his head  i guess youre right he admitted and i dont know the first thing about a sub  i do i assured him  i know more about this particular sub than the officer who commanded her  both men looked at me in astonishment and then i had to explain all over again as i had explained to the girl  bradley and olson were delighted  immediately i was put in command and the first thing i did was to go below with olson and inspect the craft thoroughly for hidden boches and damaged machinery  there were no germans below and everything was intact and in shipshape working order  i then ordered all hands below except one man who was to act as lookout  questioning the germans i found that all except the commander were willing to resume their posts and aid in bringing the vessel into an english port i believe that they were relieved at the prospect of being detained at a comfortable english prisoncamp for the duration of the war after the perils and privations through which they had passed  the officer however assured me that he would never be a party to the capture of his vessel  there was therefore nothing to do but put the man in irons as we were preparing to put this decision into force the girl descended from the deck  it was the first time that she or the german officer had seen each others faces since we had boarded the uboat  i was assisting the girl down the ladder and still retained a hold upon her armpossibly after such support was no longer necessarywhen she turned and looked squarely into the face of the german  each voiced a sudden exclamation of surprise and dismay  lys he cried and took a step toward her  the girls eyes went wide and slowly filled with a great horror as she shrank back  then her slender figure stiffened to the erectness of a soldier and with chin in air and without a word she turned her back upon the officer  take him away i directed the two men who guarded him and put him in irons  when he had gone the girl raised her eyes to mine  he is the german of whom i spoke she said  he is baron von schoenvorts  i merely inclined my head  she had loved him  i wondered if in her heart of hearts she did not love him yet  immediately i became insanely jealous  i hated baron friedrich von schoenvorts with such utter intensity that the emotion thrilled me with a species of exaltation  but i didnt have much chance to enjoy my hatred then for almost immediately the lookout poked his face over the hatchway and bawled down that there was smoke on the horizon dead ahead immediately i went on deck to investigate and bradley came with me  if shes friendly he said well speak her  if shes not well sink hereh captain  yes lieutenant i replied and it was his turn to smile  we hoisted the union jack and remained on deck asking bradley to go below and assign to each member of the crew his duty placing one englishman with a pistol beside each german  half speed ahead i commanded  more rapidly now we closed the distance between ourselves and the stranger until i could plainly see the red ensign of the british merchant marine  my heart swelled with pride at the thought that presently admiring british tars would be congratulating us upon our notable capture and just about then the merchant steamer must have sighted us for she veered suddenly toward the north and a moment later dense volumes of smoke issued from her funnels then steering a zigzag course she fled from us as though we had been the bubonic plague  i altered the course of the submarine and set off in chase but the steamer was faster than we and soon left us hopelessly astern  with a rueful smile i directed that our original course be resumed and once again we set off toward merry england that was three months ago and we havent arrived yet nor is there any likelihood that we ever shall  the steamer we had just sighted must have wirelessed a warning for it wasnt half an hour before we saw more smoke on the horizon and this time the vessel flew the white ensign of the royal navy and carried guns  she didnt veer to the north or anywhere else but bore down on us rapidly  i was just preparing to signal her when a flame flashed from her bows and an instant later the water in front of us was thrown high by the explosion of a shell  bradley had come on deck and was standing beside me  about one more of those and shell have our range he said  she doesnt seem to take much stock in our union jack  a second shell passed over us and then i gave the command to change our direction at the same time directing bradley to go below and give the order to submerge  i passed nobs down to him and following saw to the closing and fastening of the hatch  it seemed to me that the divingtanks never had filled so slowly we heard a loud explosion apparently directly above us the craft trembled to the shock which threw us all to the deck  i expected momentarily to feel the deluge of inrushing water but none came instead we continued to submerge until the manometer registered forty feet and then i knew that we were safe  safe  i almost smiled i had relieved olson who had remained in the tower at my direction having been a member of one of the early british submarine crews and therefore having some knowledge of the business  bradley was at my side  he looked at me quizzically  what the devil are we to do he asked  the merchantman will flee us the warvessel will destroy us neither will believe our colors or give us a chance to explain  we will meet even a worse reception if we go nosing around a british portmines nets and all of it  we cant do it  lets try it again when this fellow has lost the scent i urged there must come a ship that will believe us  and try it again we did only to be almost rammed by a huge freighter later we were fired upon by a destroyer and two merchantmen turned and fled at our approach  for two days we cruised up and down the channel trying to tell some one who would listen that we were friends but no one would listen  after our encounter with the first warship i had given instructions that a wireless message be sent out explaining our predicament but to my chagrin i discovered that both sending and receiving instruments had disappeared  there is only one place you can go von schoenvorts sent word to me and that is kiel  you cant land anywhere else in these waters  if you wish i will take you there and i can promise that you will be treated well  there is another place we can go i sent back my reply and we will before well go to germany  that place is hell    chapter 3  those were anxious days during which i had but little opportunity to associate with lys  i had given her the commanders room bradley and i taking that of the deckofficer while olson and two of our best men occupied the room ordinarily allotted to petty officers  i made nobs bed down in lys room for i knew she would feel less alone  nothing of much moment occurred for a while after we left british waters behind us  we ran steadily along upon the surface making good time  the first two boats we sighted made off as fast as they could go and the third a huge freighter fired on us forcing us to submerge  it was after this that our troubles commenced one of the diesel engines broke down in the morning and while we were working on it the forward port divingtank commenced to fill  i was on deck at the time and noted the gradual list guessing at once what was happening i leaped for the hatch and slamming it closed above my head dropped to the centrale  by this time the craft was going down by the head with a most unpleasant list to port and i didnt wait to transmit orders to some one else but ran as fast as i could for the valve that let the sea into the forward port divingtank  it was wide open  to close it and to have the pump started that would empty it were the work of but a minute but we had had a close call  i knew that the valve had never opened itself  some one had opened itsome one who was willing to die himself if he might at the same time encompass the death of all of us  after that i kept a guard pacing the length of the narrow craft we worked upon the engine all that day and night and half the following day  most of the time we drifted idly upon the surface but toward noon we sighted smoke due west and having found that only enemies inhabited the world for us i ordered that the other engine be started so that we could move out of the path of the oncoming steamer  the moment the engine started to turn however there was a grinding sound of tortured steel and when it had been stopped we found that some one had placed a coldchisel in one of the gears  it was another two days before we were ready to limp along half repaired  the night before the repairs were completed the sentry came to my room and awoke me  he was rather an intelligent fellow of the english middle class in whom i had much confidence  well wilson i asked  whats the matter now  he raised his finger to his lips and came closer to me  i think ive found out whos doin the mischief he whispered and nodded his head toward the girls room  i seen her sneakin from the crews room just now he went on  shed been in gassin wit the boche commander benson seen her in there las night too but he never said nothin till i goes on watch tonight bensons sorter slow in the head an he never puts two an two together till some one else has made four out of it  if the man had come in and struck me suddenly in the face i could have been no more surprised  say nothing of this to anyone i ordered  keep your eyes and ears open and report every suspicious thing you see or hear  the man saluted and left me but for an hour or more i tossed restless upon my hard bunk in an agony of jealousy and fear finally i fell into a troubled sleep  it was daylight when i awoke we were steaming along slowly upon the surface my orders having been to proceed at half speed until we could take an observation and determine our position  the sky had been overcast all the previous day and all night but as i stepped into the centrale that morning i was delighted to see that the sun was again shining the spirits of the men seemed improved everything seemed propitious i forgot at once the cruel misgivings of the past night as i set to work to take my observations  what a blow awaited me  the sextant and chronometer had both been broken beyond repair  and they had been broken just this very night they had been broken upon the night that lys had been seen talking with von schoenvorts  i think that it was this last thought which hurt me the worst  i could look the other disaster in the face with equanimity but the bald fact that lys might be a traitor appalled me  i called bradley and olson on deck and told them what had happened but for the life of me i couldnt bring myself to repeat what wilson had reported to me the previous night in fact as i had given the matter thought it seemed incredible that the girl could have passed through my room in which bradley and i slept and then carried on a conversation in the crews room in which von schoenvorts was kept without having been seen by more than a single man  bradley shook his head  i cant make it out he said  one of those boches must be pretty clever to come it over us all like this but they havent harmed us as much as they think there are still the extra instruments  it was my turn now to shake a doleful head  there are no extra instruments i told them  they too have disappeared as did the wireless apparatus  both men looked at me in amazement  we still have the compass and the sun said olson  they may be after getting the compass some night but theys too many of us around in the daytime fer em to get the sun  it was then that one of the men stuck his head up through the hatchway and seeing me asked permission to come on deck and get a breath of fresh air  i recognized him as benson the man who wilson had said reported having seen lys with von schoenvorts two nights before  i motioned him on deck and then called him to one side asking if he had seen anything out of the way or unusual during his trick on watch the night before  the fellow scratched his head a moment and said no and then as though it was an afterthought he told me that he had seen the girl in the crews room about midnight talking with the german commander but as there hadnt seemed to him to be any harm in that he hadnt said anything about it  telling him never to fail to report to me anything in the slightest out of the ordinary routine of the ship i dismissed him  several of the other men now asked permission to come on deck and soon all but those actually engaged in some necessary duty were standing around smoking and talking all in the best of spirits i took advantage of the absence of the men upon the deck to go below for my breakfast which the cook was already preparing upon the electric stove  lys followed by nobs appeared as i entered the centrale  she met me with a pleasant good morning which i am afraid i replied to in a tone that was rather constrained and surly  will you breakfast with me i suddenly asked the girl determined to commence a probe of my own along the lines which duty demanded  she nodded a sweet acceptance of my invitation and together we sat down at the little table of the officers mess  you slept well last night i asked  all night she replied  i am a splendid sleeper  her manner was so straightforward and honest that i could not bring myself to believe in her duplicity yetthinking to surprise her into a betrayal of her guilt i blurted out  the chronometer and sextant were both destroyed last night there is a traitor among us  but she never turned a hair by way of evidencing guilty knowledge of the catastrophe  who could it have been she cried  the germans would be crazy to do it for their lives are as much at stake as ours  men are often glad to die for an idealan ideal of patriotism perhaps i replied and a willingness to martyr themselves includes a willingness to sacrifice others even those who love them  women are much the same except that they will go even further than most menthey will sacrifice everything even honor for love  i watched her face carefully as i spoke and i thought that i detected a very faint flush mounting her cheek  seeing an opening and an advantage i sought to follow it up  take von schoenvorts for instance i continued he would doubtless be glad to die and take us all with him could he prevent in no other way the falling of his vessel into enemy hands he would sacrifice anyone even you and if you still love him you might be his ready tool  do you understand me  she looked at me in wideeyed consternation for a moment and then she went very white and rose from her seat  i do she replied and turning her back upon me she walked quickly toward her room  i started to follow for even believing what i did i was sorry that i had hurt her  i reached the door to the crews room just behind her and in time to see von schoenvorts lean forward and whisper something to her as she passed but she must have guessed that she might be watched for she passed on  that afternoon it clouded over the wind mounted to a gale and the sea rose until the craft was wallowing and rolling frightfully nearly everyone aboard was sick the air became foul and oppressive for twentyfour hours i did not leave my post in the conning tower as both olson and bradley were sick  finally i found that i must get a little rest and so i looked about for some one to relieve me benson volunteered  he had not been sick and assured me that he was a former rn man and had been detailed for submarine duty for over two years i was glad that it was he for i had considerable confidence in his loyalty and so it was with a feeling of security that i went below and lay down  i slept twelve hours straight and when i awoke and discovered what i had done i lost no time in getting to the conning tower there sat benson as wide awake as could be and the compass showed that we were heading straight into the west  the storm was still raging nor did it abate its fury until the fourth day we were all pretty well done up and looked forward to the time when we could go on deck and fill our lungs with fresh air during the whole four days i had not seen the girl as she evidently kept closely to her room and during this time no untoward incident had occurred aboard the boata fact which seemed to strengthen the web of circumstantial evidence about her  for six more days after the storm lessened we still had fairly rough weather nor did the sun once show himself during all that time  for the seasonit was now the middle of junethe storm was unusual but being from southern california i was accustomed to unusual weather in fact i have discovered that the world over unusual weather prevails at all times of the year  we kept steadily to our westward course and as the u33 was one of the fastest submersibles we had ever turned out i knew that we must be pretty close to the north american coast  what puzzled me most was the fact that for six days we had not sighted a single ship  it seemed remarkable that we could cross the atlantic almost to the coast of the american continent without glimpsing smoke or sail and at last i came to the conclusion that we were way off our course but whether to the north or to the south of it i could not determine  on the seventh day the sea lay comparatively calm at early dawn there was a slight haze upon the ocean which had cut off our view of the stars but conditions all pointed toward a clear morrow and i was on deck anxiously awaiting the rising of the sun  my eyes were glued upon the impenetrable mist astern for there in the east i should see the first glow of the rising sun that would assure me we were still upon the right course  gradually the heavens lightened but astern i could see no intenser glow that would indicate the rising sun behind the mist  bradley was standing at my side  presently he touched my arm  look captain he said and pointed south  i looked and gasped for there directly to port i saw outlined through the haze the red top of the rising sun  hurrying to the tower i looked at the compass  it showed that we were holding steadily upon our westward course  either the sun was rising in the south or the compass had been tampered with  the conclusion was obvious  i went back to bradley and told him what i had discovered and i concluded we cant make another five hundred knots without oil our provisions are running low and so is our water god only knows how far south we have run  there is nothing to do he replied other than to alter our course once more toward the west we must raise land soon or we shall all be lost  i told him to do so and then i set to work improvising a crude sextant with which we finally took our bearings in a rough and most unsatisfactory manner for when the work was done we did not know how far from the truth the result might be  it showed us to be about 20 north and 30 westnearly twentyfive hundred miles off our course in short if our reading was anywhere near correct we must have been traveling due south for six days  bradley now relieved benson for we had arranged our shifts so that the latter and olson now divided the nights while bradley and i alternated with one another during the days  i questioned both olson and benson closely in the matter of the compass but each stoutly maintained that no one had tampered with it during his tour of duty  benson gave me a knowing smile as much as to say  well you and i know who did this  yet i could not believe that it was the girl  we kept to our westerly course for several hours when the lookouts cry announced a sail  i ordered the u33s course altered and we bore down upon the stranger for i had come to a decision which was the result of necessity  we could not lie there in the middle of the atlantic and starve to death if there was any way out of it  the sailing ship saw us while we were still a long way off as was evidenced by her efforts to escape there was scarcely any wind however and her case was hopeless so when we drew near and signaled her to stop she came into the wind and lay there with her sails flapping idly  we moved in quite close to her  she was the balmen of halmstad sweden with a general cargo from brazil for spain  i explained our circumstances to her skipper and asked for food water and oil but when he found that we were not german he became very angry and abusive and started to draw away from us but i was in no mood for any such business  turning toward bradley who was in the conningtower i snapped out gunservice on deck  to the diving stations  we had no opportunity for drill but every man had been posted as to his duties and the german members of the crew understood that it was obedience or death for them as each was accompanied by a man with a pistol  most of them though were only too glad to obey me  bradley passed the order down into the ship and a moment later the guncrew clambered up the narrow ladder and at my direction trained their piece upon the slowmoving swede  fire a shot across her bow i instructed the guncaptain  accept it from me it didnt take that swede long to see the error of his way and get the red and white pennant signifying i understand to the masthead  once again the sails flapped idly and then i ordered him to lower a boat and come after me with olson and a couple of the englishmen i boarded the ship and from her cargo selected what we neededoil provisions and water  i gave the master of the balmen a receipt for what we took together with an affidavit signed by bradley olson and myself stating briefly how we had come into possession of the u33 and the urgency of our need for what we took  we addressed both to any british agent with the request that the owners of the balmen be reimbursed but whether or not they were i do not know1  with water food and oil aboard we felt that we had obtained a new lease of life  now too we knew definitely where we were and i determined to make for georgetown british guianabut i was destined to again suffer bitter disappointment  six of us of the loyal crew had come on deck either to serve the gun or board the swede during our setto with her and now one by one we descended the ladder into the centrale  i was the last to come and when i reached the bottom i found myself looking into the muzzle of a pistol in the hands of baron friedrich von schoenvortsi saw all my men lined up at one side with the remaining eight germans standing guard over them   i couldnt imagine how it had happened but it had  later i learned that they had first overpowered benson who was asleep in his bunk and taken his pistol from him and then had found it an easy matter to disarm the cook and the remaining two englishmen below  after that it had been comparatively simple to stand at the foot of the ladder and arrest each individual as he descended  the first thing von schoenvorts did was to send for me and announce that as a pirate i was to be shot early the next morning then he explained that the u33 would cruise in these waters for a time sinking neutral and enemy shipping indiscriminately and looking for one of the german raiders that was supposed to be in these parts  he didnt shoot me the next morning as he had promised and it has never been clear to me why he postponed the execution of my sentence instead he kept me ironed just as he had been then he kicked bradley out of my room and took it all to himself  we cruised for a long time sinking many vessels all but one by gunfire but we did not come across a german raider  i was surprised to note that von schoenvorts often permitted benson to take command but i reconciled this by the fact that benson appeared to know more of the duties of a submarine commander than did any of the stupid germans  once or twice lys passed me but for the most part she kept to her room  the first time she hesitated as though she wished to speak to me but i did not raise my head and finally she passed on then one day came the word that we were about to round the horn and that von schoenvorts had taken it into his fool head to cruise up along the pacific coast of north america and prey upon all sorts and conditions of merchantmen  ill put the fear of god and the kaiser into them he said  the very first day we entered the south pacific we had an adventure it turned out to be quite the most exciting adventure i had ever encountered  it fell about this way  about eight bells of the forenoon watch i heard a hail from the deck and presently the footsteps of the entire ships company from the amount of noise i heard at the ladder  some one yelled back to those who had not yet reached the level of the deck  its the raider the german raider geier  i saw that we had reached the end of our rope  below all was quietnot a man remained  a door opened at the end of the narrow hull and presently nobs came trotting up to me  he licked my face and rolled over on his back reaching for me with his big awkward paws then other footsteps sounded approaching me i knew whose they were and i looked straight down at the flooring the girl was coming almost at a runshe was at my side immediately here she cried  quick and she slipped something into my hand it was a keythe key to my irons  at my side she also laid a pistol and then she went on into the centrale  as she passed me i saw that she carried another pistol for herself  it did not take me long to liberate myself and then i was at her side how can i thank you i started but she shut me up with a word  do not thank me she said coldly  i do not care to hear your thanks or any other expression from you  do not stand there looking at me  i have given you a chance to do somethingnow do it the last was a peremptory command that made me jump  glancing up i saw that the tower was empty and i lost no time in clambering up looking about me  about a hundred yards off lay a small swift cruiserraider and above her floated the german manofwars flag  a boat had just been lowered and i could see it moving toward us filled with officers and men the cruiser lay dead ahead  my i thought what a wonderful targ i stopped even thinking so surprised and shocked was i by the boldness of my imagery the girl was just below me  i looked down on her wistfully  could i trust her  why had she released me at this moment  i must  i must there was no other way i dropped back below  ask olson to step down here please i requested and dont let anyone see you ask him  she looked at me with a puzzled expression on her face for the barest fraction of a second and then she turned and went up the ladder  a moment later olson returned and the girl followed him  quick i whispered to the big irishman and made for the bow compartment where the torpedotubes are built into the boat here too were the torpedoes  the girl accompanied us and when she saw the thing i had in mind she stepped forward and lent a hand to the swinging of the great cylinder of death and destruction into the mouth of its tube with oil and main strength we shoved the torpedo home and shut the tube then i ran back to the conningtower praying in my heart of hearts that the u33 had not swung her bow away from the prey  no thank god  never could aim have been truer  i signaled back to olson let er go  the u33 trembled from stem to stern as the torpedo shot from its tube  i saw the white wake leap from her bow straight toward the enemy cruiser  a chorus of hoarse yells arose from the deck of our own craft  i saw the officers stand suddenly erect in the boat that was approaching us and i heard loud cries and curses from the raider then i turned my attention to my own business  most of the men on the submarines deck were standing in paralyzed fascination staring at the torpedo bradley happened to be looking toward the conningtower and saw me  i sprang on deck and ran toward him  quick i whispered while they are stunned we must overcome them  a german was standing near bradleyjust in front of him the englishman struck the fellow a frantic blow upon the neck and at the same time snatched his pistol from its holster von schoenvorts had recovered from his first surprise quickly and had turned toward the main hatch to investigate  i covered him with my revolver and at the same instant the torpedo struck the raider the terrific explosion drowning the germans command to his men  bradley was now running from one to another of our men and though some of the germans saw and heard him they seemed too stunned for action  olson was below so that there were only nine of us against eight germans for the man bradley had struck still lay upon the deck only two of us were armed but the heart seemed to have gone out of the boches and they put up but halfhearted resistance von schoenvorts was the worsthe was fairly frenzied with rage and chagrin and he came charging for me like a mad bull and as he came he discharged his pistol  if hed stopped long enough to take aim he might have gotten me but his pace made him wild so that not a shot touched me and then we clinched and went to the deck  this left two pistols which two of my own men were quick to appropriate  the baron was no match for me in a handtohand encounter and i soon had him pinned to the deck and the life almost choked out of him  a halfhour later things had quieted down and all was much the same as before the prisoners had revoltedonly we kept a much closer watch on von schoenvorts  the geier had sunk while we were still battling upon our deck and afterward we had drawn away toward the north leaving the survivors to the attention of the single boat which had been making its way toward us when olson launched the torpedo  i suppose the poor devils never reached land and if they did they most probably perished on that cold and unhospitable shore but i couldnt permit them aboard the u33  we had all the germans we could take care of  that evening the girl asked permission to go on deck  she said that she felt the effects of long confinement below and i readily granted her request  i could not understand her and i craved an opportunity to talk with her again in an effort to fathom her and her intentions and so i made it a point to follow her up the ladder  it was a clear cold beautiful night the sea was calm except for the white water at our bows and the two long radiating swells running far off into the distance upon either hand astern forming a great v which our propellers filled with choppy waves  benson was in the tower we were bound for san diego and all looked well  lys stood with a heavy blanket wrapped around her slender figure and as i approached her she half turned toward me to see who it was when she recognized me she immediately turned away  i want to thank you i said for your bravery and loyaltyyou were magnificent  i am sorry that you had reason before to think that i doubted you  you did doubt me she replied in a level voice  you practically accused me of aiding baron von schoenvorts  i can never forgive you  there was a great deal of finality in both her words and tone  i could not believe it i said and yet two of my men reported having seen you in conversation with von schoenvorts late at night upon two separate occasionsafter each of which some great damage was found done us in the morning  i didnt want to doubt you but i carried all the responsibility of the lives of these men of the safety of the ship of your life and mine  i had to watch you and i had to put you on your guard against a repetition of your madness  she was looking at me now with those great eyes of hers very wide and round  who told you that i spoke with baron von schoenvorts at night or any other time she asked  i cannot tell you lys i replied but it came to me from two different sources  then two men have lied she asserted without heat  i have not spoken to baron von schoenvorts other than in your presence when first we came aboard the u33  and please when you address me remember that to others than my intimates i am miss la rue  did you ever get slapped in the face when you least expected it no well then you do not know how i felt at that moment i could feel the hot red flush surging up my neck across my cheeks over my ears clear to my scalp  and it made me love her all the more it made me swear inwardly a thousand solemn oaths that i would win her   1  late in july 1916 an item in the shipping news mentioned a swedish sailing vessel balmen rio de janeiro to barcelona sunk by a german raider sometime in june  a single survivor in an open boat was picked up off the cape verde islands in a dying condition he expired without giving any details    chapter 4  for several days things went along in about the same course i took our position every morning with my crude sextant but the results were always most unsatisfactory  they always showed a considerable westing when i knew that we had been sailing due north i blamed my crude instrument and kept on  then one afternoon the girl came to me  pardon me she said but were i you i should watch this man bensonespecially when he is in charge  i asked her what she meant thinking i could see the influence of von schoenvorts raising a suspicion against one of my most trusted men  if you will note the boats course a halfhour after benson goes on duty she said you will know what i mean and you will understand why he prefers a night watch  possibly too you will understand some other things that have taken place aboard  then she went back to her room thus ending the conversation i waited until half an hour after benson had gone on duty and then i went on deck passing through the conningtower where benson sat and looking at the compass  it showed that our course was north by westthat is one point west of north which was for our assumed position about right  i was greatly relieved to find that nothing was wrong for the girls words had caused me considerable apprehension  i was about to return to my room when a thought occurred to me that again caused me to change my mindand incidentally came near proving my deathwarrant  when i had left the conningtower little more than a halfhour since the sea had been breaking over the port bow and it seemed to me quite improbable that in so short a time an equally heavy sea could be deluging us from the opposite side of the shipwinds may change quickly but not a long heavy sea  there was only one other solutionsince i left the tower our course had been altered some eight points  turning quickly i climbed out upon the conningtower a single glance at the heavens confirmed my suspicions the constellations which should have been dead ahead were directly starboard  we were sailing due west  just for an instant longer i stood there to check up my calculationsi wanted to be quite sure before i accused benson of perfidy and about the only thing i came near making quite sure of was death  i cannot see even now how i escaped it i was standing on the edge of the conningtower when a heavy palm suddenly struck me between the shoulders and hurled me forward into space  the drop to the triangular deck forward of the conningtower might easily have broken a leg for me or i might have slipped off onto the deck and rolled overboard but fate was upon my side as i was only slightly bruised  as i came to my feet i heard the conningtower cover slam  there is a ladder which leads from the deck to the top of the tower up this i scrambled as fast as i could go but benson had the cover tight before i reached it  i stood there a moment in dumb consternation  what did the fellow intend  what was going on below  if benson was a traitor how could i know that there were not other traitors among us i cursed myself for my folly in going out upon the deck and then this thought suggested anothera hideous one who was it that had really been responsible for my being here  thinking to attract attention from inside the craft i again ran down the ladder and onto the small deck only to find that the steel covers of the conningtower windows were shut and then i leaned with my back against the tower and cursed myself for a gullible idiot  i glanced at the bow  the sea seemed to be getting heavier for every wave now washed completely over the lower deck  i watched them for a moment and then a sudden chill pervaded my entire being it was not the chill of wet clothing or the dashing spray which drenched my face no it was the chill of the hand of death upon my heart  in an instant i had turned the last corner of lifes highway and was looking god almighty in the facethe u33 was being slowly submerged  it would be difficult even impossible to set down in writing my sensations at that moment  all i can particularly recall is that i laughed though neither from a spirit of bravado nor from hysteria and i wanted to smoke  lord how i did want to smoke but that was out of the question  i watched the water rise until the little deck i stood on was awash and then i clambered once more to the top of the conningtower from the very slow submergence of the boat i knew that benson was doing the entire trick alonethat he was merely permitting the divingtanks to fill and that the divingrudders were not in use the throbbing of the engines ceased and in its stead came the steady vibration of the electric motors  the water was halfway up the conningtower  i had perhaps five minutes longer on the deck i tried to decide what i should do after i was washed away  should i swim until exhaustion claimed me or should i give up and end the agony at the first plunge  from below came two muffled reports  they sounded not unlike shots was benson meeting with resistance  personally it could mean little to me for even though my men might overcome the enemy none would know of my predicament until long after it was too late to succor me the top of the conningtower was now awash  i clung to the wireless mast while the great waves surged sometimes completely over me  i knew the end was near and almost involuntarily i did that which i had not done since childhoodi prayed  after that i felt better  i clung and waited but the water rose no higher  instead it receded  now the top of the conningtower received only the crests of the higher waves now the little triangular deck below became visible  what had occurred within  did benson believe me already gone and was he emerging because of that belief or had he and his forces been vanquished  the suspense was more wearing than that which i had endured while waiting for dissolution  presently the main deck came into view and then the conningtower opened behind me and i turned to look into the anxious face of bradley  an expression of relief overspread his features  thank god man was all he said as he reached forth and dragged me into the tower  i was cold and numb and rather all in another few minutes would have done for me i am sure but the warmth of the interior helped to revive me aided and abetted by some brandy which bradley poured down my throat from which it nearly removed the membrane  that brandy would have revived a corpse  when i got down into the centrale i saw the germans lined up on one side with a couple of my men with pistols standing over them von schoenvorts was among them  on the floor lay benson moaning and beyond him stood the girl a revolver in one hand i looked about bewildered  what has happened down here i asked  tell me  bradley replied  you see the result sir he said  it might have been a very different result but for miss la rue  we were all asleep benson had relieved the guard early in the evening there was no one to watch himno one but miss la rue  she felt the submergence of the boat and came out of her room to investigate she was just in time to see benson at the diving rudders  when he saw her he raised his pistol and fired pointblank at her but he missed and she firedand didnt miss  the two shots awakened everyone and as our men were armed the result was inevitable as you see it but it would have been very different had it not been for miss la rue  it was she who closed the divingtank seacocks and roused olson and me and had the pumps started to empty them  and there i had been thinking that through her machinations i had been lured to the deck and to my death  i could have gone on my knees to her and begged her forgivenessor at least i could have had i not been anglosaxon  as it was i could only remove my soggy cap and bow and mumble my appreciation  she made no replyonly turned and walked very rapidly toward her room could i have heard aright  was it really a sob that came floating back to me through the narrow aisle of the u33  benson died that night  he remained defiant almost to the last but just before he went out he motioned to me and i leaned over to catch the faintly whispered words  i did it alone he said  i did it because i hate youi hate all your kind  i was kicked out of your shipyard at santa monica i was locked out of california  i am an i w w i became a german agentnot because i love them for i hate them toobut because i wanted to injure americans whom i hated more  i threw the wireless apparatus overboard  i destroyed the chronometer and the sextant  i devised a scheme for varying the compass to suit my wishes  i told wilson that i had seen the girl talking with von schoenvorts and i made the poor egg think he had seen her doing the same thing  i am sorrysorry that my plans failed i hate you  he didnt die for a halfhour after that nor did he speak againaloud but just a few seconds before he went to meet his maker his lips moved in a faint whisper and as i leaned closer to catch his words what do you suppose i heard  nowilay medowntosleep that was all benson was dead  we threw his body overboard  the wind of that night brought on some pretty rough weather with a lot of black clouds which persisted for several days  we didnt know what course we had been holding and there was no way of finding out as we could no longer trust the compass not knowing what benson had done to it  the long and the short of it was that we cruised about aimlessly until the sun came out again  ill never forget that day or its surprises  we reckoned or rather guessed that we were somewhere off the coast of peru  the wind which had been blowing fitfully from the east suddenly veered around into the south and presently we felt a sudden chill  peru snorted olson  when were yez after smellin iceberrgs off peru  icebergs  icebergs nothin exclaimed one of the englishmen why man they dont come north of fourteen here in these waters  then replied olson yere sout of fourteen me by  we thought he was crazy but he wasnt for that afternoon we sighted a great berg south of us and wed been running north we thought for days  i can tell you we were a discouraged lot but we got a faint thrill of hope early the next morning when the lookout bawled down the open hatch  land  land northwest by west  i think we were all sick for the sight of land  i know that i was but my interest was quickly dissipated by the sudden illness of three of the germans  almost simultaneously they commenced vomiting they couldnt suggest any explanation for it  i asked them what they had eaten and found they had eaten nothing other than the food cooked for all of us  have you drunk anything  i asked for i knew that there was liquor aboard and medicines in the same locker  only water moaned one of them  we all drank water together this morning  we opened a new tank  maybe it was the water  i started an investigation which revealed a terrifying conditionsome one probably benson had poisoned all the running water on the ship it would have been worse though had land not been in sight  the sight of land filled us with renewed hope  our course had been altered and we were rapidly approaching what appeared to be a precipitous headland  cliffs seemingly rising perpendicularly out of the sea faded away into the mist upon either hand as we approached  the land before us might have been a continent so mighty appeared the shoreline yet we knew that we must be thousands of miles from the nearest western landmassnew zealand or australia  we took our bearings with our crude and inaccurate instruments we searched the chart we cudgeled our brains and at last it was bradley who suggested a solution  he was in the tower and watching the compass to which he called my attention  the needle was pointing straight toward the land  bradley swung the helm hard to starboard  i could feel the u33 respond and yet the arrow still clung straight and sure toward the distant cliffs  what do you make of it i asked him  did you ever hear of caproni he asked  an early italian navigator i returned  yes he followed cook about 1721  he is scarcely mentioned even by contemporaneous historiansprobably because he got into political difficulties on his return to italy  it was the fashion to scoff at his claims but i recall reading one of his workshis only one i believein which he described a new continent in the south seas a continent made up of some strange metal which attracted the compass a rockbound inhospitable coast without beach or harbor which extended for hundreds of miles he could make no landing nor in the several days he cruised about it did he see sign of life  he called it caprona and sailed away i believe sir that we are looking upon the coast of caprona uncharted and forgotten for two hundred years  if you are right it might account for much of the deviation of the compass during the past two days i suggested  caprona has been luring us upon her deadly rocks  well well accept her challenge well land upon caprona  along that long front there must be a vulnerable spot  we will find it bradley for we must find it  we must find water on caprona or we must die  and so we approached the coast upon which no living eyes had ever rested  straight from the oceans depths rose towering cliffs shot with brown and blues and greenswithered moss and lichen and the verdigris of copper and everywhere the rusty ocher of iron pyrites the clifftops though ragged were of such uniform height as to suggest the boundaries of a great plateau and now and again we caught glimpses of verdure topping the rocky escarpment as though bush or jungleland had pushed outward from a lush vegetation farther inland to signal to an unseeing world that caprona lived and joyed in life beyond her austere and repellent coast  but metaphor however poetic never slaked a dry throat to enjoy capronas romantic suggestions we must have water and so we came in close always sounding and skirted the shore as close in as we dared cruise we found fathomless depths and always the same undented coastline of bald cliffs  as darkness threatened we drew away and lay well off the coast all night we had not as yet really commenced to suffer for lack of water but i knew that it would not be long before we did and so at the first streak of dawn i moved in again and once more took up the hopeless survey of the forbidding coast  toward noon we discovered a beach the first we had seen  it was a narrow strip of sand at the base of a part of the cliff that seemed lower than any we had before scanned  at its foot half buried in the sand lay great boulders mute evidence that in a bygone age some mighty natural force had crumpled capronas barrier at this point  it was bradley who first called our attention to a strange object lying among the boulders above the surf  looks like a man he said and passed his glasses to me  i looked long and carefully and could have sworn that the thing i saw was the sprawled figure of a human being  miss la rue was on deck with us  i turned and asked her to go below  without a word she did as i bade  then i stripped and as i did so nobs looked questioningly at me  he had been wont at home to enter the surf with me and evidently he had not forgotten it  what are you going to do sir asked olson  im going to see what that thing is on shore i replied if its a man it may mean that caprona is inhabited or it may merely mean that some poor devils were shipwrecked here i ought to be able to tell from the clothing which is more near the truth  how about sharks queried olson  sure you ought to carry a knoife  here you are sir cried one of the men  it was a long slim blade he offeredone that i could carry between my teethand so i accepted it gladly  keep close in i directed bradley and then i dived over the side and struck out for the narrow beach  there was another splash directly behind me and turning my head i saw faithful old nobs swimming valiantly in my wake  the surf was not heavy and there was no undertow so we made shore easily effecting an equally easy landing  the beach was composed largely of small stones worn smooth by the action of water  there was little sand though from the deck of the u33 the beach had appeared to be all sand and i saw no evidences of mollusca or crustacea such as are common to all beaches i have previously seen  i attribute this to the fact of the smallness of the beach the enormous depth of surrounding water and the great distance at which caprona lies from her nearest neighbor  as nobs and i approached the recumbent figure farther up the beach i was appraised by my nose that whether or not the thing had once been organic and alive but that for some time it had been dead  nobs halted sniffed and growled  a little later he sat down upon his haunches raised his muzzle to the heavens and bayed forth a most dismal howl  i shied a small stone at him and bade him shut uphis uncanny noise made me nervous  when i had come quite close to the thing i still could not say whether it had been man or beast  the carcass was badly swollen and partly decomposed  there was no sign of clothing upon or about it  a fine brownish hair covered the chest and abdomen and the face the palms of the hands the feet the shoulders and back were practically hairless  the creature must have been about the height of a fair sized man its features were similar to those of a man yet had it been a man  i could not say for it resembled an ape no more than it did a man its large toes protruded laterally as do those of the semiarboreal peoples of borneo the philippines and other remote regions where low types still persist  the countenance might have been that of a cross between pithecanthropus the java apeman and a daughter of the piltdown race of prehistoric sussex a wooden cudgel lay beside the corpse  now this fact set me thinking  there was no wood of any description in sight  there was nothing about the beach to suggest a wrecked mariner there was absolutely nothing about the body to suggest that it might possibly in life have known a maritime experience  it was the body of a low type of man or a high type of beast  in neither instance would it have been of a seafaring race  therefore i deduced that it was native to capronathat it lived inland and that it had fallen or been hurled from the cliffs above  such being the case caprona was inhabitable if not inhabited by man but how to reach the inhabitable interior  that was the question  a closer view of the cliffs than had been afforded me from the deck of the u33 only confirmed my conviction that no mortal man could scale those perpendicular heights there was not a fingerhold not a toehold upon them  i turned away baffled  nobs and i met with no sharks upon our return journey to the submarine my report filled everyone with theories and speculations and with renewed hope and determination  they all reasoned along the same lines that i had reasonedthe conclusions were obvious but not the water we were now thirstier than ever  the balance of that day we spent in continuing a minute and fruitless exploration of the monotonous coast  there was not another break in the frowning cliffsnot even another minute patch of pebbly beach  as the sun fell so did our spirits i had tried to make advances to the girl again but she would have none of me and so i was not only thirsty but otherwise sad and downhearted  i was glad when the new day broke the hideous spell of a sleepless night  the mornings search brought us no shred of hope  caprona was impregnablethat was the decision of all yet we kept on  it must have been about two bells of the afternoon watch that bradley called my attention to the branch of a tree with leaves upon it floating on the sea  it may have been carried down to the ocean by a river he suggested  yes i replied it may have it may have tumbled or been thrown off the top of one of these cliffs  bradleys face fell  i thought of that too he replied but i wanted to believe the other  right you are i cried  we must believe the other until we prove it false  we cant afford to give up heart now when we need heart most the branch was carried down by a river and we are going to find that river i smote my open palm with a clenched fist to emphasize a determination unsupported by hope there i cried suddenly  see that bradley  and i pointed at a spot closer to shore  see that man  some flowers and grasses and another leafy branch floated toward us  we both scanned the water and the coastline  bradley evidently discovered something or at least thought that he had  he called down for a bucket and a rope and when they were passed up to him he lowered the former into the sea and drew it in filled with water  of this he took a taste and straightening up looked into my eyes with an expression of elationas much as to say i told you so  this water is warm he announced and fresh  i grabbed the bucket and tasted its contents  the water was very warm and it was fresh but there was a most unpleasant taste to it  did you ever taste water from a stagnant pool full of tadpoles bradley asked  thats it i exclaimed thats just the taste exactly though i havent experienced it since boyhood but how can water from a flowing stream taste thus and what the dickens makes it so warm  it must be at least 70 or 80 fahrenheit possibly higher  yes agreed bradley i should say higher but where does it come from  that is easily discovered now that we have found it i answered it cant come from the ocean so it must come from the land all that we have to do is follow it and sooner or later we shall come upon its source  we were already rather close in but i ordered the u33s prow turned inshore and we crept slowly along constantly dipping up the water and tasting it to assure ourselves that we didnt get outside the freshwater current  there was a very light offshore wind and scarcely any breakers so that the approach to the shore was continued without finding bottom yet though we were already quite close we saw no indication of any indention in the coast from which even a tiny brooklet might issue and certainly no mouth of a large river such as this must necessarily be to freshen the ocean even two hundred yards from shore  the tide was running out and this together with the strong flow of the freshwater current would have prevented our going against the cliffs even had we not been under power as it was we had to buck the combined forces in order to hold our position at all  we came up to within twentyfive feet of the sheer wall which loomed high above us there was no break in its forbidding face  as we watched the face of the waters and searched the cliffs high face olson suggested that the fresh water might come from a submarine geyser  this he said would account for its heat but even as he spoke a bush covered thickly with leaves and flowers bubbled to the surface and floated off astern  flowering shrubs dont thrive in the subterranean caverns from which geysers spring suggested bradley  olson shook his head  it beats me he said  ive got it i exclaimed suddenly  look there  and i pointed at the base of the cliff ahead of us which the receding tide was gradually exposing to our view  they all looked and all saw what i had seenthe top of a dark opening in the rock through which water was pouring out into the sea  its the subterranean channel of an inland river i cried  it flows through a land covered with vegetationand therefore a land upon which the sun shines  no subterranean caverns produce any order of plant life even remotely resembling what we have seen disgorged by this river  beyond those cliffs lie fertile lands and fresh waterperhaps game  yis sir said olson behoind the cliffs  ye spoke a true word sirbehoind  bradley laugheda rather sorry laugh though  you might as well call our attention to the fact sir he said that science has indicated that there is fresh water and vegetation on mars  not at all i rejoined  a uboat isnt constructed to navigate space but it is designed to travel below the surface of the water  youd be after sailin into that blank pocket asked olson  i would olson i replied  we havent one chance for life in a hundred thousand if we dont find food and water upon caprona this water coming out of the cliff is not salt but neither is it fit to drink though each of us has drunk  it is fair to assume that inland the river is fed by pure streams that there are fruits and herbs and game  shall we lie out here and die of thirst and starvation with a land of plenty possibly only a few hundred yards away  we have the means for navigating a subterranean river  are we too cowardly to utilize this means  be afther goin to it said olson  im willing to see it through agreed bradley  then under the bottom wi the best o luck an give em hell cried a young fellow who had been in the trenches  to the divingstations  i commanded and in less than a minute the deck was deserted the conningtower covers had slammed to and the u33 was submergingpossibly for the last time  i know that i had this feeling and i think that most of the others did  as we went down i sat in the tower with the searchlight projecting its seemingly feeble rays ahead  we submerged very slowly and without headway more than sufficient to keep her nose in the right direction and as we went down i saw outlined ahead of us the black opening in the great cliff  it was an opening that would have admitted a halfdozen uboats at one and the same time roughly cylindrical in contourand dark as the pit of perdition  as i gave the command which sent the u33 slowly ahead i could not but feel a certain uncanny presentiment of evil  where were we going what lay at the end of this great sewer  had we bidden farewell forever to the sunlight and life or were there before us dangers even greater than those which we now faced  i tried to keep my mind from vain imagining by calling everything which i observed to the eager ears below  i was the eyes of the whole company and i did my best not to fail them  we had advanced a hundred yards perhaps when our first danger confronted us just ahead was a sharp rightangle turn in the tunnel  i could see the rivers flotsam hurtling against the rocky wall upon the left as it was driven on by the mighty current and i feared for the safety of the u33 in making so sharp a turn under such adverse conditions but there was nothing for it but to try i didnt warn my fellows of the dangerit could have but caused them useless apprehension for if we were to be smashed against the rocky wall no power on earth could avert the quick end that would come to us i gave the command full speed ahead and went charging toward the menace  i was forced to approach the dangerous lefthand wall in order to make the turn and i depended upon the power of the motors to carry us through the surging waters in safety  well we made it but it was a narrow squeak  as we swung around the full force of the current caught us and drove the stern against the rocks there was a thud which sent a tremor through the whole craft and then a moment of nasty grinding as the steel hull scraped the rock wall  i expected momentarily the inrush of waters that would seal our doom but presently from below came the welcome word that all was well  in another fifty yards there was a second turn this time toward the left but it was more of a gentle curve and we took it without trouble  after that it was plain sailing though as far as i could know there might be most anything ahead of us and my nerves strained to the snappingpoint every instant  after the second turn the channel ran comparatively straight for between one hundred and fifty and two hundred yards  the waters grew suddenly lighter and my spirits rose accordingly  i shouted down to those below that i saw daylight ahead and a great shout of thanksgiving reverberated through the ship  a moment later we emerged into sunlit water and immediately i raised the periscope and looked about me upon the strangest landscape i had ever seen  we were in the middle of a broad and now sluggish river the banks of which were lined by giant arboraceous ferns raising their mighty fronds fifty one hundred two hundred feet into the quiet air  close by us something rose to the surface of the river and dashed at the periscope  i had a vision of wide distended jaws and then all was blotted out  a shiver ran down into the tower as the thing closed upon the periscope  a moment later it was gone and i could see again above the trees there soared into my vision a huge thing on batlike wingsa creature large as a large whale but fashioned more after the order of a lizard  then again something charged the periscope and blotted out the mirror  i will confess that i was almost gasping for breath as i gave the commands to emerge  into what sort of strange land had fate guided us  the instant the deck was awash i opened the conningtower hatch and stepped out  in another minute the deckhatch lifted and those who were not on duty below streamed up the ladder olson bringing nobs under one arm  for several minutes no one spoke i think they must each have been as overcome by awe as was i all about us was a flora and fauna as strange and wonderful to us as might have been those upon a distant planet had we suddenly been miraculously transported through ether to an unknown world even the grass upon the nearer bank was unearthlylush and high it grew and each blade bore upon its tip a brilliant flowerviolet or yellow or carmine or bluemaking as gorgeous a sward as human imagination might conceive  but the life it teemed the tall fernlike trees were alive with monkeys snakes and lizards huge insects hummed and buzzed hither and thither  mighty forms could be seen moving upon the ground in the thick forest while the bosom of the river wriggled with living things and above flapped the wings of gigantic creatures such as we are taught have been extinct throughout countless ages  look cried olson  would you look at the giraffe comin up out o the bottom of the say  we looked in the direction he pointed and saw a long glossy neck surmounted by a small head rising above the surface of the river  presently the back of the creature was exposed brown and glossy as the water dripped from it it turned its eyes upon us opened its lizardlike mouth emitted a shrill hiss and came for us the thing must have been sixteen or eighteen feet in length and closely resembled pictures i had seen of restored plesiosaurs of the lower jurassic  it charged us as savagely as a mad bull and one would have thought it intended to destroy and devour the mighty uboat as i verily believe it did intend  we were moving slowly up the river as the creature bore down upon us with distended jaws  the long neck was far outstretched and the four flippers with which it swam were working with powerful strokes carrying it forward at a rapid pace  when it reached the crafts side the jaws closed upon one of the stanchions of the deck rail and tore it from its socket as though it had been a toothpick stuck in putty  at this exhibition of titanic strength i think we all simultaneously stepped backward and bradley drew his revolver and fired  the bullet struck the thing in the neck just above its body but instead of disabling it merely increased its rage  its hissing rose to a shrill scream as it raised half its body out of water onto the sloping sides of the hull of the u33 and endeavored to scramble upon the deck to devour us  a dozen shots rang out as we who were armed drew our pistols and fired at the thing but though struck several times it showed no signs of succumbing and only floundered farther aboard the submarine  i had noticed that the girl had come on deck and was standing not far behind me and when i saw the danger to which we were all exposed i turned and forced her toward the hatch  we had not spoken for some days and we did not speak now but she gave me a disdainful look which was quite as eloquent as words and broke loose from my grasp  i saw i could do nothing with her unless i exerted force and so i turned with my back toward her that i might be in a position to shield her from the strange reptile should it really succeed in reaching the deck and as i did so i saw the thing raise one flipper over the rail dart its head forward and with the quickness of lightning seize upon one of the boches  i ran forward discharging my pistol into the creatures body in an effort to force it to relinquish its prey but i might as profitably have shot at the sun  shrieking and screaming the german was dragged from the deck and the moment the reptile was clear of the boat it dived beneath the surface of the water with its terrified prey i think we were all more or less shaken by the frightfulness of the tragedyuntil olson remarked that the balance of power now rested where it belonged  following the death of benson we had been nine and ninenine germans and nine allies as we called ourselves now there were but eight germans  we never counted the girl on either side i suppose because she was a girl though we knew well enough now that she was ours  and so olsons remark helped to clear the atmosphere for the allies at least and then our attention was once more directed toward the river for around us there had sprung up a perfect bedlam of screams and hisses and a seething caldron of hideous reptiles devoid of fear and filled only with hunger and with rage they clambered squirmed and wriggled to the deck forcing us steadily backward though we emptied our pistols into them there were all sorts and conditions of horrible thingshuge hideous grotesque monstrousa veritable mesozoic nightmare i saw that the girl was gotten below as quickly as possible and she took nobs with herpoor nobs had nearly barked his head off and i think too that for the first time since his littlest puppyhood he had known fear nor can i blame him  after the girl i sent bradley and most of the allies and then the germans who were on deckvon schoenvorts being still in irons below  the creatures were approaching perilously close before i dropped through the hatchway and slammed down the cover  then i went into the tower and ordered full speed ahead hoping to distance the fearsome things but it was useless  not only could any of them easily outdistance the u33 but the further upstream we progressed the greater the number of our besiegers until fearful of navigating a strange river at high speed i gave orders to reduce and moved slowly and majestically through the plunging hissing mass  i was mighty glad that our entrance into the interior of caprona had been inside a submarine rather than in any other form of vessel  i could readily understand how it might have been that caprona had been invaded in the past by venturesome navigators without word of it ever reaching the outside world for i can assure you that only by submarine could man pass up that great sluggish river alive  we proceeded up the river for some forty miles before darkness overtook us  i was afraid to submerge and lie on the bottom overnight for fear that the mud might be deep enough to hold us and as we could not hold with the anchor i ran in close to shore and in a brief interim of attack from the reptiles we made fast to a large tree  we also dipped up some of the river water and found it though quite warm a little sweeter than before we had food enough and with the water we were all quite refreshed but we missed fresh meat  it had been weeks now since we had tasted it and the sight of the reptiles gave me an ideathat a steak or two from one of them might not be bad eating  so i went on deck with a rifle twenty of which were aboard the u33  at sight of me a huge thing charged and climbed to the deck  i retreated to the top of the conningtower and when it had raised its mighty bulk to the level of the little deck on which i stood i let it have a bullet right between the eyes  the thing stopped then and looked at me a moment as much as to say why this thing has a stinger  i must be careful and then it reached out its long neck and opened its mighty jaws and grabbed for me but i wasnt there  i had tumbled backward into the tower and i mighty near killed myself doing it  when i glanced up that little head on the end of its long neck was coming straight down on top of me and once more i tumbled into greater safety sprawling upon the floor of the centrale  olson was looking up and seeing what was poking about in the tower ran for an ax nor did he hesitate a moment when he returned with one but sprang up the ladder and commenced chopping away at that hideous face  the thing didnt have sufficient brainpan to entertain more than a single idea at once though chopped and hacked and with a bullethole between its eyes it still persisted madly in its attempt to get inside the tower and devour olson though its body was many times the diameter of the hatch nor did it cease its efforts until after olson had succeeded in decapitating it  then the two men went on deck through the main hatch and while one kept watch the other cut a hind quarter off plesiosaurus olsoni as bradley dubbed the thing  meantime olson cut off the long neck saying that it would make fine soup  by the time we had cleared away the blood and refuse in the tower the cook had juicy steaks and a steaming broth upon the electric stove and the aroma arising from p olsoni filled us an with a hitherto unfelt admiration for him and all his kind    chapter 5  the steaks we had that night and they were fine and the following morning we tasted the broth  it seemed odd to be eating a creature that should by all the laws of paleontology have been extinct for several million years  it gave one a feeling of newness that was almost embarrassing although it didnt seem to embarrass our appetites  olson ate until i thought he would burst  the girl ate with us that night at the little officers mess just back of the torpedo compartment  the narrow table was unfolded the four stools were set out and for the first time in days we sat down to eat and for the first time in weeks we had something to eat other than the monotony of the short rations of an impoverished uboat  nobs sat between the girl and me and was fed with morsels of the plesiosaurus steak at the risk of forever contaminating his manners  he looked at me sheepishly all the time for he knew that no wellbred dog should eat at table but the poor fellow was so wasted from improper food that i couldnt enjoy my own meal had he been denied an immediate share in it and anyway lys wanted to feed him  so there you are  lys was coldly polite to me and sweetly gracious to bradley and olson she wasnt of the gushing type i knew so i didnt expect much from her and was duly grateful for the few morsels of attention she threw upon the floor to me  we had a pleasant meal with only one unfortunate occurrencewhen olson suggested that possibly the creature we were eating was the same one that ate the german  it was some time before we could persuade the girl to continue her meal but at last bradley prevailed upon her pointing out that we had come upstream nearly forty miles since the boche had been seized and that during that time we had seen literally thousands of these denizens of the river indicating that the chances were very remote that this was the same plesiosaur  and anyway he concluded it was only a scheme of mr olsons to get all the steaks for himself  we discussed the future and ventured opinions as to what lay before us but we could only theorize at best for none of us knew  if the whole land was infested by these and similar horrid monsters life would be impossible upon it and we decided that we would only search long enough to find and take aboard fresh water and such meat and fruits as might be safely procurable and then retrace our way beneath the cliffs to the open sea  and so at last we turned into our narrow bunks hopeful happy and at peace with ourselves our lives and our god to awaken the following morning refreshed and still optimistic  we had an easy time getting awayas we learned later because the saurians do not commence to feed until late in the morning  from noon to midnight their curve of activity is at its height while from dawn to about nine oclock it is lowest  as a matter of fact we didnt see one of them all the time we were getting under way though i had the cannon raised to the deck and manned against an assault  i hoped but i was none too sure that shells might discourage them  the trees were full of monkeys of all sizes and shades and once we thought we saw a manlike creature watching us from the depth of the forest  shortly after we resumed our course upstream we saw the mouth of another and smaller river emptying into the main channel from the souththat is upon our right and almost immediately after we came upon a large island five or six miles in length and at fifty miles there was a still larger river than the last coming in from the northwest the course of the main stream having now changed to northeast by southwest  the water was quite free from reptiles and the vegetation upon the banks of the river had altered to more open and parklike forest with eucalyptus and acacia mingled with a scattering of tree ferns as though two distinct periods of geologic time had overlapped and merged the grass too was less flowering though there were still gorgeous patches mottling the greensward and lastly the fauna was less multitudinous  six or seven miles farther and the river widened considerably before us opened an expanse of water to the farther horizon and then we sailed out upon an inland sea so large that only a shoreline upon our side was visible to us  the waters all about us were alive with life there were still a few reptiles but there were fish by the thousands by the millions  the water of the inland sea was very warm almost hot and the atmosphere was hot and heavy above it  it seemed strange that beyond the buttressed walls of caprona icebergs floated and the south wind was biting for only a gentle breeze moved across the face of these living waters and that was damp and warm gradually we commenced to divest ourselves of our clothing retaining only sufficient for modesty but the sun was not hot it was more the heat of a steamroom than of an oven  we coasted up the shore of the lake in a northwesterly direction sounding all the time  we found the lake deep and the bottom rocky and steeply shelving toward the center and once when i moved straight out from shore to take other soundings we could find no bottom whatsoever in open spaces along the shore we caught occasional glimpses of the distant cliffs and here they appeared only a trifle less precipitous than those which bound caprona on the seaward side  my theory is that in a far distant era caprona was a mighty mountainperhaps the worlds mightiest volcanic action blew off the entire crest blew thousands of feet of the mountain upward and outward and onto the surrounding continent leaving a great crater and then possibly the continent sank as ancient continents have been known to do leaving only the summit of caprona above the sea the encircling walls the central lake the hot springs which feed the lake all point to a conclusion and the fauna and the flora bear indisputable evidence that caprona was once part of some great landmass  as we cruised up along the coast the landscape continued a more or less open forest with here and there a small plain where we saw animals grazing  with my glass i could make out a species of large red deer some antelope and what appeared to be a species of horse and once i saw the shaggy form of what might have been a monstrous bison here was game a plenty  there seemed little danger of starving upon caprona  the game however seemed wary for the instant the animals discovered us they threw up their heads and tails and went cavorting off those farther inland following the example of the others until all were lost in the mazes of the distant forest  only the great shaggy ox stood his ground  with lowered head he watched us until we had passed and then continued feeding  about twenty miles up the coast from the mouth of the river we encountered low cliffs of sandstone broken and tortured evidence of the great upheaval which had torn caprona asunder in the past intermingling upon a common level the rock formations of widely separated eras fusing some and leaving others untouched  we ran along beside them for a matter of ten miles arriving off a broad cleft which led into what appeared to be another lake as we were in search of pure water we did not wish to overlook any portion of the coast and so after sounding and finding that we had ample depth i ran the u33 between headlands into as pretty a landlocked harbor as sailormen could care to see with good water right up to within a few yards of the shore  as we cruised slowly along two of the boches again saw what they believed to be a man or manlike creature watching us from a fringe of trees a hundred yards inland and shortly after we discovered the mouth of a small stream emptying into the bay it was the first stream we had found since leaving the river and i at once made preparations to test its water  to land it would be necessary to run the u33 close in to the shore at least as close as we could for even these waters were infested though not so thickly by savage reptiles  i ordered sufficient water let into the divingtanks to lower us about a foot and then i ran the bow slowly toward the shore confident that should we run aground we still had sufficient lifting force to free us when the water should be pumped out of the tanks but the bow nosed its way gently into the reeds and touched the shore with the keel still clear  my men were all armed now with both rifles and pistols each having plenty of ammunition  i ordered one of the germans ashore with a line and sent two of my own men to guard him for from what little we had seen of caprona or caspak as we learned later to call the interior we realized that any instant some new and terrible danger might confront us  the line was made fast to a small tree and at the same time i had the stern anchor dropped  as soon as the boche and his guard were aboard again i called all hands on deck including von schoenvorts and there i explained to them that the time had come for us to enter into some sort of an agreement among ourselves that would relieve us of the annoyance and embarrassment of being divided into two antagonistic partsprisoners and captors  i told them that it was obvious our very existence depended upon our unity of action that we were to all intent and purpose entering a new world as far from the seat and causes of our own worldwar as if millions of miles of space and eons of time separated us from our past lives and habitations  there is no reason why we should carry our racial and political hatreds into caprona i insisted  the germans among us might kill all the english or the english might kill the last german without affecting in the slightest degree either the outcome of even the smallest skirmish upon the western front or the opinion of a single individual in any belligerent or neutral country i therefore put the issue squarely to you all shall we bury our animosities and work together with and for one another while we remain upon caprona or must we continue thus divided and but half armed possibly until death has claimed the last of us  and let me tell you if you have not already realized it the chances are a thousand to one that not one of us ever will see the outside world again  we are safe now in the matter of food and water we could provision the u33 for a long cruise but we are practically out of fuel and without fuel we cannot hope to reach the ocean as only a submarine can pass through the barrier cliffs what is your answer i turned toward von schoenvorts  he eyed me in that disagreeable way of his and demanded to know in case they accepted my suggestion what their status would be in event of our finding a way to escape with the u33  i replied that i felt that if we had all worked loyally together we should leave caprona upon a common footing and to that end i suggested that should the remote possibility of our escape in the submarine develop into reality we should then immediately make for the nearest neutral port and give ourselves into the hands of the authorities when we should all probably be interned for the duration of the war  to my surprise he agreed that this was fair and told me that they would accept my conditions and that i could depend upon their loyalty to the common cause  i thanked him and then addressed each one of his men individually and each gave me his word that he would abide by all that i had outlined it was further understood that we were to act as a military organization under military rules and disciplinei as commander with bradley as my first lieutenant and olson as my second in command of the englishmen while von schoenvorts was to act as an additional second lieutenant and have charge of his own men  the four of us were to constitute a military court under which men might be tried and sentenced to punishment for infraction of military rules and discipline even to the passing of the deathsentence  i then had arms and ammunition issued to the germans and leaving bradley and five men to guard the u33 the balance of us went ashore the first thing we did was to taste the water of the little streamwhich to our delight we found sweet pure and cold  this stream was entirely free from dangerous reptiles because as i later discovered they became immediately dormant when subjected to a much lower temperature than 70 degrees fahrenheit  they dislike cold water and keep as far away from it as possible  there were countless brooktrout here and deep holes that invited us to bathe and along the bank of the stream were trees bearing a close resemblance to ash and beech and oak their characteristics evidently induced by the lower temperature of the air above the cold water and by the fact that their roots were watered by the water from the stream rather than from the warm springs which we afterward found in such abundance elsewhere  our first concern was to fill the water tanks of the u33 with fresh water and that having been accomplished we set out to hunt for game and explore inland for a short distance  olson von schoenvorts two englishmen and two germans accompanied me leaving ten to guard the ship and the girl  i had intended leaving nobs behind but he got away and joined me and was so happy over it that i hadnt the heart to send him back  we followed the stream upward through a beautiful country for about five miles and then came upon its source in a little boulderstrewn clearing from among the rocks bubbled fully twenty icecold springs north of the clearing rose sandstone cliffs to a height of some fifty to seventyfive feet with tall trees growing at their base and almost concealing them from our view  to the west the country was flat and sparsely wooded and here it was that we saw our first gamea large red deer  it was grazing away from us and had not seen us when one of my men called my attention to it  motioning for silence and having the rest of the party lie down i crept toward the quarry accompanied only by whitely  we got within a hundred yards of the deer when he suddenly raised his antlered head and pricked up his great ears  we both fired at once and had the satisfaction of seeing the buck drop then we ran forward to finish him with our knives  the deer lay in a small open space close to a clump of acacias and we had advanced to within several yards of our kill when we both halted suddenly and simultaneously whitely looked at me and i looked at whitely and then we both looked back in the direction of the deer  blime he said  wot is hit sir  it looks to me whitely like an error i said some assistant god who had been creating elephants must have been temporarily transferred to the lizarddepartment  hi wouldnt sy that sir said whitely it sounds blasphemous  it is more blasphemous than that thing which is swiping our meat i replied for whatever the thing was it had leaped upon our deer and was devouring it in great mouthfuls which it swallowed without mastication  the creature appeared to be a great lizard at least ten feet high with a huge powerful tail as long as its torso mighty hind legs and short forelegs  when it had advanced from the wood it hopped much after the fashion of a kangaroo using its hind feet and tail to propel it and when it stood erect it sat upon its tail  its head was long and thick with a blunt muzzle and the opening of the jaws ran back to a point behind the eyes and the jaws were armed with long sharp teeth the scaly body was covered with black and yellow spots about a foot in diameter and irregular in contour  these spots were outlined in red with edgings about an inch wide  the underside of the chest body and tail were a greenish white  wot sy we pot the bloomin bird sir suggested whitely  i told him to wait until i gave the word then we would fire simultaneously he at the heart and i at the spine  hat the eart siryes sir he replied and raised his piece to his shoulder  our shots rang out together  the thing raised its head and looked about until its eyes rested upon us then it gave vent to a most appalling hiss that rose to the crescendo of a terrific shriek and came for us  beat it whitely i cried as i turned to run  we were about a quarter of a mile from the rest of our party and in full sight of them as they lay in the tall grass watching us that they saw all that had happened was evidenced by the fact that they now rose and ran toward us and at their head leaped nobs the creature in our rear was gaining on us rapidly when nobs flew past me like a meteor and rushed straight for the frightful reptile i tried to recall him but he would pay no attention to me and as i couldnt see him sacrificed i too stopped and faced the monster the creature appeared to be more impressed with nobs than by us and our firearms for it stopped as the airedale dashed at it growling and struck at him viciously with its powerful jaws  nobs though was lightning by comparison with the slow thinking beast and dodged his opponents thrust with ease  then he raced to the rear of the tremendous thing and seized it by the tail there nobs made the error of his life  within that mottled organ were the muscles of a titan the force of a dozen mighty catapults and the owner of the tail was fully aware of the possibilities which it contained  with a single flip of the tip it sent poor nobs sailing through the air a hundred feet above the ground straight back into the clump of acacias from which the beast had leaped upon our killand then the grotesque thing sank lifeless to the ground  olson and von schoenvorts came up a minute later with their men then we all cautiously approached the still form upon the ground the creature was quite dead and an examination resulted in disclosing the fact that whitelys bullet had pierced its heart and mine had severed the spinal cord  but why didnt it die instantly i exclaimed  because said von schoenvorts in his disagreeable way the beast is so large and its nervous organization of so low a caliber that it took all this time for the intelligence of death to reach and be impressed upon the minute brain  the thing was dead when your bullets struck it but it did not know it for several secondspossibly a minute  if i am not mistaken it is an allosaurus of the upper jurassic remains of which have been found in central wyoming in the suburbs of new york  an irishman by the name of brady grinned  i afterward learned that he had served three years on the trafficsquad of the chicago police force  i had been calling nobs in the meantime and was about to set out in search of him fearing to tell the truth to do so lest i find him mangled and dead among the trees of the acacia grove when he suddenly emerged from among the boles his ears flattened his tail between his legs and his body screwed into a suppliant s he was unharmed except for minor bruises but he was the most chastened dog i have ever seen  we gathered up what was left of the red deer after skinning and cleaning it and set out upon our return journey toward the uboat on the way olson von schoenvorts and i discussed the needs of our immediate future and we were unanimous in placing foremost the necessity of a permanent camp on shore  the interior of a uboat is about as impossible and uncomfortable an abidingplace as one can well imagine and in this warm climate and in warm water it was almost unendurable  so we decided to construct a palisaded camp    chapter 6  as we strolled slowly back toward the boat planning and discussing this we were suddenly startled by a loud and unmistakable detonation  a shell from the u33 exclaimed von schoenvorts  what can be after signifyin queried olson  they are in trouble i answered for all and its up to us to get back to them  drop that carcass i directed the men carrying the meat and follow me  i set off at a rapid run in the direction of the harbor  we ran for the better part of a mile without hearing anything more from the direction of the harbor and then i reduced the speed to a walk for the exercise was telling on us who had been cooped up for so long in the confined interior of the u33 puffing and panting we plodded on until within about a mile of the harbor we came upon a sight that brought us all up standing we had been passing through a little heavier timber than was usual to this part of the country when we suddenly emerged into an open space in the center of which was such a band as might have caused the most courageous to pause  it consisted of upward of five hundred individuals representing several species closely allied to man  there were anthropoid apes and gorillasthese i had no difficulty in recognizing but there were other forms which i had never before seen and i was hard put to it to say whether they were ape or man  some of them resembled the corpse we had found upon the narrow beach against capronas seawall while others were of a still lower type more nearly resembling the apes and yet others were uncannily manlike standing there erect being less hairy and possessing better shaped heads  there was one among the lot evidently the leader of them who bore a close resemblance to the socalled neanderthal man of la chapelleauxsaints  there was the same short stocky trunk upon which rested an enormous head habitually bent forward into the same curvature as the back the arms shorter than the legs and the lower leg considerably shorter than that of modern man the knees bent forward and never straightened  this creature and one or two others who appeared to be of a lower order than he yet higher than that of the apes carried heavy clubs the others were armed only with giant muscles and fighting fangsnatures weapons all were males and all were entirely naked nor was there upon even the highest among them a sign of ornamentation  at sight of us they turned with bared fangs and low growls to confront us  i did not wish to fire among them unless it became absolutely necessary and so i started to lead my party around them but the instant that the neanderthal man guessed my intention he evidently attributed it to cowardice upon our part and with a wild cry he leaped toward us waving his cudgel above his head  the others followed him and in a minute we should have been overwhelmed  i gave the order to fire and at the first volley six of them went down including the neanderthal man the others hesitated a moment and then broke for the trees some running nimbly among the branches while others lost themselves to us between the boles  both von schoenvorts and i noticed that at least two of the higher manlike types took to the trees quite as nimbly as the apes while others that more nearly approached man in carriage and appearance sought safety upon the ground with the gorillas  an examination disclosed that five of our erstwhile opponents were dead and the sixth the neanderthal man was but slightly wounded a bullet having glanced from his thick skull stunning him we decided to take him with us to camp and by means of belts we managed to secure his hands behind his back and place a leash around his neck before he regained consciousness  we then retraced our steps for our meat being convinced by our own experience that those aboard the u33 had been able to frighten off this party with a single shellbut when we came to where we had left the deer it had disappeared  on the return journey whitely and i preceded the rest of the party by about a hundred yards in the hope of getting another shot at something edible for we were all greatly disgusted and disappointed by the loss of our venison  whitely and i advanced very cautiously and not having the whole party with us we fared better than on the journey out bagging two large antelope not a halfmile from the harbor so with our game and our prisoner we made a cheerful return to the boat where we found that all were safe  on the shore a little north of where we lay there were the corpses of twenty of the wild creatures who had attacked bradley and his party in our absence and the rest of whom we had met and scattered a few minutes later  we felt that we had taught these wild apemen a lesson and that because of it we would be safer in the futureat least safer from them but we decided not to abate our carefulness one whit feeling that this new world was filled with terrors still unknown to us nor were we wrong  the following morning we commenced work upon our camp bradley olson von schoenvorts miss la rue and i having sat up half the night discussing the matter and drawing plans  we set the men at work felling trees selecting for the purpose jarrah a hard weatherresisting timber which grew in profusion near by  half the men labored while the other half stood guard alternating each hour with an hour off at noon  olson directed this work  bradley von schoenvorts and i with miss la rues help staked out the various buildings and the outer wall  when the day was done we had quite an array of logs nicely notched and ready for our building operations on the morrow and we were all tired for after the buildings had been staked out we all fell in and helped with the loggingall but von schoenvorts  he being a prussian and a gentleman couldnt stoop to such menial labor in the presence of his men and i didnt see fit to ask it of him as the work was purely voluntary upon our part  he spent the afternoon shaping a swaggerstick from the branch of jarrah and talking with miss la rue who had sufficiently unbent toward him to notice his existence  we saw nothing of the wild men of the previous day and only once were we menaced by any of the strange denizens of caprona when some frightful nightmare of the sky swooped down upon us only to be driven off by a fusillade of bullets  the thing appeared to be some variety of pterodactyl and what with its enormous size and ferocious aspect was most aweinspiring  there was another incident too which to me at least was far more unpleasant than the sudden onslaught of the prehistoric reptile  two of the men both germans were stripping a felled tree of its branches von schoenvorts had completed his swaggerstick and he and i were passing close to where the two worked  one of them threw to his rear a small branch that he had just chopped off and as misfortune would have it it struck von schoenvorts across the face  it couldnt have hurt him for it didnt leave a mark but he flew into a terrific rage shouting attention in a loud voice the sailor immediately straightened up faced his officer clicked his heels together and saluted  pig roared the baron and struck the fellow across the face breaking his nose  i grabbed von schoenvorts arm and jerked him away before he could strike again if such had been his intention and then he raised his little stick to strike me but before it descended the muzzle of my pistol was against his belly and he must have seen in my eyes that nothing would suit me better than an excuse to pull the trigger  like all his kind and all other bullies von schoenvorts was a coward at heart and so he dropped his hand to his side and started to turn away but i pulled him back and there before his men i told him that such a thing must never again occurthat no man was to be struck or otherwise punished other than in due process of the laws that we had made and the court that we had established all the time the sailor stood rigidly at attention nor could i tell from his expression whether he most resented the blow his officer had struck him or my interference in the gospel of the kaiserbreed  nor did he move until i said to him  plesser you may return to your quarters and dress your wound  then he saluted and marched stiffly off toward the u33  just before dusk we moved out into the bay a hundred yards from shore and dropped anchor for i felt that we should be safer there than elsewhere  i also detailed men to stand watch during the night and appointed olson officer of the watch for the entire night telling him to bring his blankets on deck and get what rest he could  at dinner we tasted our first roast caprona antelope and we had a mess of greens that the cook had found growing along the stream  all during the meal von schoenvorts was silent and surly  after dinner we all went on deck and watched the unfamiliar scenes of a capronian nightthat is all but von schoenvorts there was less to see than to hear  from the great inland lake behind us came the hissing and the screaming of countless saurians above us we heard the flap of giant wings while from the shore rose the multitudinous voices of a tropical jungleof a warm damp atmosphere such as must have enveloped the entire earth during the palezoic and mesozoic eras  but here were intermingled the voices of later erasthe scream of the panther the roar of the lion the baying of wolves and a thunderous growling which we could attribute to nothing earthly but which one day we were to connect with the most fearsome of ancient creatures  one by one the others went to their rooms until the girl and i were left alone together for i had permitted the watch to go below for a few minutes knowing that i would be on deck miss la rue was very quiet though she replied graciously enough to whatever i had to say that required reply  i asked her if she did not feel well  yes she said but i am depressed by the awfulness of it all i feel of so little consequenceso small and helpless in the face of all these myriad manifestations of life stripped to the bone of its savagery and brutality  i realize as never before how cheap and valueless a thing is life  life seems a joke a cruel grim joke  you are a laughable incident or a terrifying one as you happen to be less powerful or more powerful than some other form of life which crosses your path but as a rule you are of no moment whatsoever to anything but yourself  you are a comic little figure hopping from the cradle to the grave  yes that is our troublewe take ourselves too seriously but caprona should be a sure cure for that  she paused and laughed  you have evolved a beautiful philosophy i said  it fills such a longing in the human breast  it is full it is satisfying it is ennobling  what wonderous strides toward perfection the human race might have made if the first man had evolved it and it had persisted until now as the creed of humanity  i dont like irony she said it indicates a small soul  what other sort of soul then would you expect from a comic little figure hopping from the cradle to the grave i inquired and what difference does it make anyway what you like and what you dont like you are here for but an instant and you mustnt take yourself too seriously  she looked up at me with a smile  i imagine that i am frightened and blue she said and i know that i am very very homesick and lonely there was almost a sob in her voice as she concluded  it was the first time that she had spoken thus to me  involuntarily i laid my hand upon hers where it rested on the rail  i know how difficult your position is i said but dont feel that you are alone  there isis one here whowho would do anything in the world for you i ended lamely  she did not withdraw her hand and she looked up into my face with tears on her cheeks and i read in her eyes the thanks her lips could not voice then she looked away across the weird moonlit landscape and sighed evidently her newfound philosophy had tumbled about her ears for she was seemingly taking herself seriously  i wanted to take her in my arms and tell her how i loved her and had taken her hand from the rail and started to draw her toward me when olson came blundering up on deck with his bedding  the following morning we started building operations in earnest and things progressed finely  the neanderthal man was something of a care for we had to keep him in irons all the time and he was mighty savage when approached but after a time he became more docile and then we tried to discover if he had a language lys spent a great deal of time talking to him and trying to draw him out but for a long while she was unsuccessful  it took us three weeks to build all the houses which we constructed close by a cold spring some two miles from the harbor  we changed our plans a trifle when it came to building the palisade for we found a rotted cliff near by where we could get all the flat buildingstone we needed and so we constructed a stone wall entirely around the buildings  it was in the form of a square with bastions and towers at each corner which would permit an enfilading fire along any side of the fort and was about one hundred and thirtyfive feet square on the outside with walls three feet thick at the bottom and about a foot and a half wide at the top and fifteen feet high  it took a long time to build that wall and we all turned in and helped except von schoenvorts who by the way had not spoken to me except in the line of official business since our encountera condition of armed neutrality which suited me to a t  we have just finished it the last touches being put on today  i quit about a week ago and commenced working on this chronicle for our strange adventures which will account for any minor errors in chronology which may have crept in there was so much material that i may have made some mistakes but i think they are but minor and few  i see in reading over the last few pages that i neglected to state that lys finally discovered that the neanderthal man possessed a language she had learned to speak it and so have i to some extent  it was hehis name he says is am or ahmwho told us that this country is called caspak  when we asked him how far it extended he waved both arms about his head in an allincluding gesture which took in apparently the entire universe he is more tractable now and we are going to release him for he has assured us that he will not permit his fellows to harm us he calls us galus and says that in a short time he will be a galu it is not quite clear to us what he means  he says that there are many galus north of us and that as soon as he becomes one he will go and live with them  ahm went out to hunt with us yesterday and was much impressed by the ease with which our rifles brought down antelopes and deer we have been living upon the fat of the land ahm having shown us the edible fruits tubers and herbs and twice a week we go out after fresh meat a certain proportion of this we dry and store away for we do not know what may come  our drying process is really smoking  we have also dried a large quantity of two varieties of cereal which grow wild a few miles south of us one of these is a giant indian maizea lofty perennial often fifty and sixty feet in height with ears the size off a mans body and kernels as large as your fist  we have had to construct a second store house for the great quantity of this that we have gathered  september 3 1916  three months ago today the torpedo from the u33 started me from the peaceful deck of the american liner upon the strange voyage which has ended here in caspak  we have settled down to an acceptance of our fate for all are convinced that none of us will ever see the outer world again  ahms repeated assertions that there are human beings like ourselves in caspak have roused the men to a keen desire for exploration  i sent out one party last week under bradley ahm who is now free to go and come as he wishes accompanied them they marched about twentyfive miles due west encountering many terrible beasts and reptiles and not a few manlike creatures whom ahm sent away  here is bradleys report of the expedition  marched fifteen miles the first day camping on the bank of a large stream which runs southward  game was plentiful and we saw several varieties which we had not before encountered in caspak just before making camp we were charged by an enormous woolly rhinoceros which plesser dropped with a perfect shot  we had rhinocerossteaks for supper  ahm called the thing atis  it was almost a continuous battle from the time we left the fort until we arrived at camp  the mind of man can scarce conceive the plethora of carnivorous life in this lost world and their prey of course is even more abundant  the second day we marched about ten miles to the foot of the cliffs passed through dense forests close to the base of the cliffs saw manlike creatures and a low order of ape in one band and some of the men swore that there was a white man among them they were inclined to attack us at first but a volley from our rifles caused them to change their minds  we scaled the cliffs as far as we could but near the top they are absolutely perpendicular without any sufficient cleft or protuberance to give hand or foothold  all were disappointed for we hungered for a view of the ocean and the outside world  we even had a hope that we might see and attract the attention of a passing ship our exploration has determined one thing which will probably be of little value to us and never heard of beyond capronas wallsthis crater was once entirely filled with water indisputable evidence of this is on the face of the cliffs  our return journey occupied two days and was as filled with adventure as usual  we are all becoming accustomed to adventure it is beginning to pall on us  we suffered no casualties and there was no illness   i had to smile as i read bradleys report  in those four days he had doubtless passed through more adventures than an african biggame hunter experiences in a lifetime and yet he covered it all in a few lines  yes we are becoming accustomed to adventure not a day passes that one or more of us does not face death at least once  ahm taught us a few things that have proved profitable and saved us much ammunition which it is useless to expend except for food or in the last recourse of selfpreservation now when we are attacked by large flying reptiles we run beneath spreading trees when land carnivora threaten us we climb into trees and we have learned not to fire at any of the dinosaurs unless we can keep out of their reach for at least two minutes after hitting them in the brain or spine or five minutes after puncturing their heartsit takes them so long to die to hit them elsewhere is worse than useless for they do not seem to notice it and we had discovered that such shots do not kill or even disable them  september 7 1916  much has happened since i last wrote  bradley is away again on another exploration expedition to the cliffs  he expects to be gone several weeks and to follow along their base in search of a point where they may be scaled  he took sinclair brady james and tippet with him  ahm has disappeared  he has been gone about three days but the most startling thing i have on record is that von schoenvorts and olson while out hunting the other day discovered oil about fifteen miles north of us beyond the sandstone cliffs olson says there is a geyser of oil there and von schoenvorts is making preparations to refine it  if he succeeds we shall have the means for leaving caspak and returning to our own world i can scarce believe the truth of it  we are all elated to the seventh heaven of bliss  pray god we shall not be disappointed  i have tried on several occasions to broach the subject of my love to lys but she will not listen    chapter 7  october 8 1916  this is the last entry i shall make upon my manuscript  when this is done i shall be through  though i may pray that it reaches the haunts of civilized man my better judgment tells me that it will never be perused by other eyes than mine and that even though it should it would be too late to avail me  i am alone upon the summit of the great cliff overlooking the broad pacific  a chill south wind bites at my marrow while far below me i can see the tropic foliage of caspak on the one hand and huge icebergs from the near antarctic upon the other  presently i shall stuff my folded manuscript into the thermos bottle i have carried with me for the purpose since i left the fortfort dinosaur we named itand hurl it far outward over the clifftop into the pacific  what current washes the shore of caprona i know not whither my bottle will be borne i cannot even guess but i have done all that mortal man may do to notify the world of my whereabouts and the dangers that threaten those of us who remain alive in caspakif there be any other than myself  about the 8th of september i accompanied olson and von schoenvorts to the oilgeyser  lys came with us and we took a number of things which von schoenvorts wanted for the purpose of erecting a crude refinery we went up the coast some ten or twelve miles in the u33 tying up to shore near the mouth of a small stream which emptied great volumes of crude oil into the seai find it difficult to call this great lake by any other name then we disembarked and went inland about five miles where we came upon a small lake entirely filled with oil from the center of which a geyser of oil spouted  on the edge of the lake we helped von schoenvorts build his primitive refinery  we worked with him for two days until he got things fairly well started and then we returned to fort dinosaur as i feared that bradley might return and be worried by our absence the u33 merely landed those of us that were to return to the fort and then retraced its course toward the oilwell  olson whitely wilson miss la rue and myself disembarked while von schoenvorts and his german crew returned to refine the oil  the next day plesser and two other germans came down overland for ammunition plesser said they had been attacked by wild men and had exhausted a great deal of ammunition  he also asked permission to get some dried meat and maize saying that they were so busy with the work of refining that they had no time to hunt i let him have everything he asked for and never once did a suspicion of their intentions enter my mind  they returned to the oilwell the same day while we continued with the multitudinous duties of camp life  for three days nothing of moment occurred  bradley did not return nor did we have any word from von schoenvorts  in the evening lys and i went up into one of the bastion towers and listened to the grim and terrible nightlife of the frightful ages of the past  once a sabertooth screamed almost beneath us and the girl shrank close against me  as i felt her body against mine all the pent love of these three long months shattered the bonds of timidity and conviction and i swept her up into my arms and covered her face and lips with kisses  she did not struggle to free herself but instead her dear arms crept up about my neck and drew my own face even closer to hers  you love me lys i cried  i felt her head nod an affirmative against my breast  tell me lys i begged tell me in words how much you love me  low and sweet and tender came the answer  i love you beyond all conception  my heart filled with rapture then and it fills now as it has each of the countless times i have recalled those dear words as it shall fill always until death has claimed me  i may never see her again she may not know how i love hershe may question she may doubt but always true and steady and warm with the fires of love my heart beats for the girl who said that night  i love you beyond all conception  for a long time we sat there upon the little bench constructed for the sentry that we had not as yet thought it necessary to post in more than one of the four towers  we learned to know one another better in those two brief hours than we had in all the months that had intervened since we had been thrown together  she told me that she had loved me from the first and that she never had loved von schoenvorts their engagement having been arranged by her aunt for social reasons  that was the happiest evening of my life nor ever do i expect to experience its like but at last as is the way of happiness it terminated  we descended to the compound and i walked with lys to the door of her quarters  there again she kissed me and bade me good night and then she went in and closed the door  i went to my own room and there i sat by the light of one of the crude candles we had made from the tallow of the beasts we had killed and lived over the events of the evening  at last i turned in and fell asleep dreaming happy dreams and planning for the future for even in savage caspak i was bound to make my girl safe and happy  it was daylight when i awoke  wilson who was acting as cook was up and astir at his duties in the cookhouse the others slept but i arose and followed by nobs went down to the stream for a plunge  as was our custom i went armed with both rifle and revolver but i stripped and had my swim without further disturbance than the approach of a large hyena a number of which occupied caves in the sandstone cliffs north of the camp these brutes are enormous and exceedingly ferocious  i imagine they correspond with the cavehyena of prehistoric times this fellow charged nobs whose capronian experiences had taught him that discretion is the better part of valorwith the result that he dived head foremost into the stream beside me after giving vent to a series of ferocious growls which had no more effect upon hyaena spelaeus than might a sweet smile upon an enraged tusker afterward i shot the beast and nobs had a feast while i dressed for he had become quite a rawmeat eater during our numerous hunting expeditions upon which we always gave him a portion of the kill  whitely and olson were up and dressed when we returned and we all sat down to a good breakfast  i could not but wonder at lys absence from the table for she had always been one of the earliest risers in camp so about nine oclock becoming apprehensive lest she might be indisposed i went to the door of her room and knocked  i received no response though i finally pounded with all my strength then i turned the knob and entered only to find that she was not there  her bed had been occupied and her clothing lay where she had placed it the previous night upon retiring but lys was gone  to say that i was distracted with terror would be to put it mildly  though i knew she could not be in camp i searched every square inch of the compound and all the buildings yet without avail  it was whitely who discovered the first cluea huge humanlike footprint in the soft earth beside the spring and indications of a struggle in the mud  then i found a tiny handkerchief close to the outer wall lys  had been stolen  it was all too plain  some hideous member of the apeman tribe had entered the fort and carried her off while i stood stunned and horrified at the frightful evidence before me there came from the direction of the great lake an increasing sound that rose to the volume of a shriek  we all looked up as the noise approached apparently just above us and a moment later there followed a terrific explosion which hurled us to the ground  when we clambered to our feet we saw a large section of the west wall torn and shattered  it was olson who first recovered from his daze sufficiently to guess the explanation of the phenomenon  a shell he cried  and there aint no shells in caspak besides whats on the u33  the dirty boches are shellin the fort  come on and he grasped his rifle and started on a run toward the lake  it was over two miles but we did not pause until the harbor was in view and still we could not see the lake because of the sandstone cliffs which intervened  we ran as fast as we could around the lower end of the harbor scrambled up the cliffs and at last stood upon their summit in full view of the lake far away down the coast toward the river through which we had come to reach the lake we saw upon the surface the outline of the u33 black smoke vomiting from her funnel  von schoenvorts had succeeded in refining the oil  the cur had broken his every pledge and was leaving us there to our fates he had even shelled the fort as a parting compliment nor could anything have been more truly prussian than this leavetaking of the baron friedrich von schoenvorts  olson whitely wilson and i stood for a moment looking at one another  it seemed incredible that man could be so perfidiousthat we had really seen with our own eyes the thing that we had seen but when we returned to the fort the shattered wall gave us ample evidence that there was no mistake  then we began to speculate as to whether it had been an apeman or a prussian that had abducted lys  from what we knew of von schoenvorts we would not have been surprised at anything from him but the footprints by the spring seemed indisputable evidence that one of capronas undeveloped men had borne off the girl i loved  as soon as i had assured myself that such was the case i made my preparations to follow and rescue her  olson whitely and wilson each wished to accompany me but i told them that they were needed here since with bradleys party still absent and the germans gone it was necessary that we conserve our force as far as might be possible    chapter 8  it was a sad leavetaking as in silence i shook hands with each of the three remaining men  even poor nobs appeared dejected as we quit the compound and set out upon the wellmarked spoor of the abductor  not once did i turn my eyes backward toward fort dinosaur  i have not looked upon it sincenor in all likelihood shall i ever look upon it again  the trail led northwest until it reached the western end of the sandstone cliffs to the north of the fort there it ran into a welldefined path which wound northward into a country we had not as yet explored it was a beautiful gently rolling country broken by occasional outcroppings of sandstone and by patches of dense forest relieved by open parklike stretches and broad meadows whereon grazed countless herbivorous animalsred deer aurochs and infinite variety of antelope and at least three distinct species of horse the latter ranging in size from a creature about as large as nobs to a magnificent animal fourteen to sixteen hands high these creatures fed together in perfect amity nor did they show any great indications of terror when nobs and i approached they moved out of our way and kept their eyes upon us until we had passed then they resumed their feeding  the path led straight across the clearing into another forest lying upon the verge of which i saw a bit of white  it appeared to stand out in marked contrast and incongruity to all its surroundings and when i stopped to examine it i found that it was a small strip of muslinpart of the hem of a garment at once i was all excitement for i knew that it was a sign left by lys that she had been carried this way it was a tiny bit torn from the hem of the undergarment that she wore in lieu of the nightrobes she had lost with the sinking of the liner crushing the bit of fabric to my lips i pressed on even more rapidly than before because i now knew that i was upon the right trail and that up to this point at least lys still had lived  i made over twenty miles that day for i was now hardened to fatigue and accustomed to long hikes having spent considerable time hunting and exploring in the immediate vicinity of camp a dozen times that day was my life threatened by fearsome creatures of the earth or sky though i could not but note that the farther north i traveled the fewer were the great dinosaurs though they still persisted in lesser numbers  on the other hand the quantity of ruminants and the variety and frequency of carnivorous animals increased  each square mile of caspak harbored its terrors  at intervals along the way i found bits of muslin and often they reassured me when otherwise i should have been doubtful of the trail to take where two crossed or where there were forks as occurred at several points  and so as night was drawing on i came to the southern end of a line of cliffs loftier than any i had seen before and as i approached them there was wafted to my nostrils the pungent aroma of woodsmoke  what could it mean there could to my mind be but a single solution man abided close by a higher order of man than we had as yet seen other than ahm the neanderthal man i wondered again as i had so many times that day if it had not been ahm who stole lys  cautiously i approached the flank of the cliffs where they terminated in an abrupt escarpment as though some all powerful hand had broken off a great section of rock and set it upon the surface of the earth  it was now quite dark and as i crept around the edge of the cliff i saw at a little distance a great fire around which were many figuresapparently human figures cautioning nobs to silence and he had learned many lessons in the value of obedience since we had entered caspak i slunk forward taking advantage of whatever cover i could find until from behind a bush i could distinctly see the creatures assembled by the fire  they were human and yet not human  i should say that they were a little higher in the scale of evolution than ahm possibly occupying a place of evolution between that of the neanderthal man and what is known as the grimaldi race  their features were distinctly negroid though their skins were white  a considerable portion of both torso and limbs were covered with short hair and their physical proportions were in many aspects apelike though not so much so as were ahms  they carried themselves in a more erect position although their arms were considerably longer than those of the neanderthal man  as i watched them i saw that they possessed a language that they had knowledge of fire and that they carried besides the wooden club of ahm a thing which resembled a crude stone hatchet evidently they were very low in the scale of humanity but they were a step upward from those i had previously seen in caspak  but what interested me most was the slender figure of a dainty girl clad only in a thin bit of muslin which scarce covered her kneesa bit of muslin torn and ragged about the lower hem  it was lys and she was alive and so far as i could see unharmed  a huge brute with thick lips and prognathous jaw stood at her shoulder he was talking loudly and gesticulating wildly  i was close enough to hear his words which were similar to the language of ahm though much fuller for there were many words i could not understand however i caught the gist of what he was sayingwhich in effect was that he had found and captured this galu that she was his and that he defied anyone to question his right of possession it appeared to me as i afterward learned was the fact that i was witnessing the most primitive of marriage ceremonies  the assembled members of the tribe looked on and listened in a sort of dull and perfunctory apathy for the speaker was by far the mightiest of the clan  there seemed no one to dispute his claims when he said or rather shouted in stentorian tones  i am tsa  this is my she who wishes her more than tsa  i do i said in the language of ahm and i stepped out into the firelight before them  lys gave a little cry of joy and started toward me but tsa grasped her arm and dragged her back  who are you shrieked tsa  i kill  i kill  i kill  the she is mine i replied and i have come to claim her i kill if you do not let her come to me  and i raised my pistol to a level with his heart  of course the creature had no conception of the purpose of the strange little implement which i was poking toward him  with a sound that was half human and half the growl of a wild beast he sprang toward me  i aimed at his heart and fired and as he sprawled headlong to the ground the others of his tribe overcome by fright at the report of the pistol scattered toward the cliffswhile lys with outstretched arms ran toward me  as i crushed her to me there rose from the black night behind us and then to our right and to our left a series of frightful screams and shrieks bellowings roars and growls  it was the nightlife of this jungle world coming into its ownthe huge carnivorous nocturnal beasts which make the nights of caspak hideous a shuddering sob ran through lys figure  o god she cried give me the strength to endure for his sake  i saw that she was upon the verge of a breakdown after all that she must have passed through of fear and horror that day and i tried to quiet and reassure her as best i might but even to me the future looked most unpromising for what chance of life had we against the frightful hunters of the night who even now were prowling closer to us  now i turned to see what had become of the tribe and in the fitful glare of the fire i perceived that the face of the cliff was pitted with large holes into which the manthings were clambering  come i said to lys we must follow them we cannot last a halfhour out here we must find a cave already we could see the blazing green eyes of the hungry carnivora i seized a brand from the fire and hurled it out into the night and there came back an answering chorus of savage and rageful protest but the eyes vanished for a short time  selecting a burning branch for each of us we advanced toward the cliffs where we were met by angry threats  they will kill us said lys  we may as well keep on in search of another refuge  they will not kill us so surely as will those others out there i replied  i am going to seek shelter in one of these caves nor will the manthings prevent  and i kept on in the direction of the cliffs base  a huge creature stood upon a ledge and brandished his stone hatchet  come and i will kill you and take the she he boasted  you saw how tsa fared when he would have kept my she i replied in his own tongue  thus will you fare and all your fellows if you do not permit us to come in peace among you out of the dangers of the night  go north he screamed  go north among the galus and we will not harm you  some day will we be galus but now we are not you do not belong among us  go away or we will kill you  the she may remain if she is afraid and we will keep her but the he must depart  the he wont depart i replied and approached still nearer rough and narrow ledges formed by nature gave access to the upper caves  a man might scale them if unhampered and unhindered but to clamber upward in the face of a belligerent tribe of halfmen and with a girl to assist was beyond my capability  i do not fear you screamed the creature  you were close to tsa but i am far above you  you cannot harm me as you harmed tsa go away  i placed a foot upon the lowest ledge and clambered upward reaching down and pulling lys to my side  already i felt safer soon we would be out of danger of the beasts again closing in upon us the man above us raised his stone hatchet above his head and leaped lightly down to meet us  his position above me gave him a great advantage or at least so he probably thought for he came with every show of confidence  i hated to do it but there seemed no other way and so i shot him down as i had shot down tsa  you see i cried to his fellows that i can kill you wherever you may be  a long way off i can kill you as well as i can kill you near by  let us come among you in peace  i will not harm you if you do not harm us  we will take a cave high up  speak  come then said one  if you will not harm us you may come take tsas hole which lies above you  the creature showed us the mouth of a black cave but he kept at a distance while he did it and lys followed me as i crawled in to explore  i had matches with me and in the light of one i found a small cavern with a flat roof and floor which followed the cleavage of the strata  pieces of the roof had fallen at some longdistant date as was evidenced by the depth of the filth and rubble in which they were embedded  even a superficial examination revealed the fact that nothing had ever been attempted that might have improved the livability of the cavern nor should i judge had it ever been cleaned out  with considerable difficulty i loosened some of the larger pieces of broken rock which littered the floor and placed them as a barrier before the doorway it was too dark to do more than this  i then gave lys a piece of dried meat and sitting inside the entrance we dined as must have some of our ancient forbears at the dawning of the age of man while far below the open diapason of the savage night rose weird and horrifying to our ears  in the light of the great fire still burning we could see huge skulking forms and in the blacker background countless flaming eyes  lys shuddered and i put my arm around her and drew her to me and thus we sat throughout the hot night  she told me of her abduction and of the fright she had undergone and together we thanked god that she had come through unharmed because the great brute had dared not pause along the dangerinfested way  she said that they had but just reached the cliffs when i arrived for on several occasions her captor had been forced to take to the trees with her to escape the clutches of some hungry cavelion or sabertoothed tiger and that twice they had been obliged to remain for considerable periods before the beasts had retired  nobs by dint of much scrambling and one or two narrow escapes from death had managed to follow us up the cliff and was now curled between me and the doorway having devoured a piece of the dried meat which he seemed to relish immensely  he was the first to fall asleep but i imagine we must have followed suit soon for we were both tired  i had laid aside my ammunitionbelt and rifle though both were close beside me but my pistol i kept in my lap beneath my hand  however we were not disturbed during the night and when i awoke the sun was shining on the treetops in the distance  lys head had drooped to my breast and my arm was still about her  shortly afterward lys awoke and for a moment she could not seem to comprehend her situation  she looked at me and then turned and glanced at my arm about her and then she seemed quite suddenly to realize the scantiness of her apparel and drew away covering her face with her palms and blushing furiously  i drew her back toward me and kissed her and then she threw her arms about my neck and wept softly in mute surrender to the inevitable  it was an hour later before the tribe began to stir about we watched them from our apartment as lys called it neither men nor women wore any sort of clothing or ornaments and they all seemed to be about of an age nor were there any babies or children among them  this was to us the strangest and most inexplicable of facts but it recalled to us that though we had seen many of the lesser developed wild people of caspak we had never yet seen a child or an old man or woman  after a while they became less suspicious of us and then quite friendly in their brutish way  they picked at the fabric of our clothing which seemed to interest them and examined my rifle and pistol and the ammunition in the belt around my waist i showed them the thermosbottle and when i poured a little water from it they were delighted thinking that it was a spring which i carried about with mea neverfailing source of water supply  one thing we both noticed among their other characteristics they never laughed nor smiled and then we remembered that ahm had never done so either  i asked them if they knew ahm but they said they did not  one of them said  back there we may have known him  and he jerked his head to the south  you came from back there  i asked  he looked at me in surprise  we all come from there he said  after a while we go there and this time he jerked his head toward the north  be galus he concluded  many times now had we heard this reference to becoming galus ahm had spoken of it many times  lys and i decided that it was a sort of original religious conviction as much a part of them as their instinct for selfpreservationa primal acceptance of a hereafter and a holier state  it was a brilliant theory but it was all wrong  i know it now and how far we were from guessing the wonderful the miraculous the gigantic truth which even yet i may only guess atthe thing that sets caspak apart from all the rest of the world far more definitely than her isolated geographical position or her impregnable barrier of giant cliffs  if i could live to return to civilization i should have meat for the clergy and the layman to chew upon for yearsand for the evolutionists too  after breakfast the men set out to hunt while the women went to a large pool of warm water covered with a green scum and filled with billions of tadpoles  they waded in to where the water was about a foot deep and lay down in the mud  they remained there from one to two hours and then returned to the cliff  while we were with them we saw this same thing repeated every morning but though we asked them why they did it we could get no reply which was intelligible to us  all they vouchsafed in way of explanation was the single word ata  they tried to get lys to go in with them and could not understand why she refused  after the first day i went hunting with the men leaving my pistol and nobs with lys but she never had to use them for no reptile or beast ever approached the pool while the women were therenor so far as we know at other times  there was no spoor of wild beast in the soft mud along the banks and the water certainly didnt look fit to drink  this tribe lived largely upon the smaller animals which they bowled over with their stone hatchets after making a wide circle about their quarry and driving it so that it had to pass close to one of their number  the little horses and the smaller antelope they secured in sufficient numbers to support life and they also ate numerous varieties of fruits and vegetables  they never brought in more than sufficient food for their immediate needs but why bother  the food problem of caspak is not one to cause worry to her inhabitants  the fourth day lys told me that she thought she felt equal to attempting the return journey on the morrow and so i set out for the hunt in high spirits for i was anxious to return to the fort and learn if bradley and his party had returned and what had been the result of his expedition  i also wanted to relieve their minds as to lys and myself as i knew that they must have already given us up for dead  it was a cloudy day though warm as it always is in caspak  it seemed odd to realize that just a few miles away winter lay upon the stormtossed ocean and that snow might be falling all about caprona but no snow could ever penetrate the damp hot atmosphere of the great crater  we had to go quite a bit farther than usual before we could surround a little bunch of antelope and as i was helping drive them i saw a fine red deer a couple of hundred yards behind me he must have been asleep in the long grass for i saw him rise and look about him in a bewildered way and then i raised my gun and let him have it  he dropped and i ran forward to finish him with the long thin knife which one of the men had given me but just as i reached him he staggered to his feet and ran on for another two hundred yardswhen i dropped him again  once more was this repeated before i was able to reach him and cut his throat then i looked around for my companions as i wanted them to come and carry the meat home but i could see nothing of them i called a few times and waited but there was no response and no one came  at last i became disgusted and cutting off all the meat that i could conveniently carry i set off in the direction of the cliffs  i must have gone about a mile before the truth dawn upon mei was lost hopelessly lost  the entire sky was still completely blotted out by dense clouds nor was there any landmark visible by which i might have taken my bearings i went on in the direction i thought was south but which i now imagine must have been about due north without detecting a single familiar object  in a dense wood i suddenly stumbled upon a thing which at first filled me with hope and later with the most utter despair and dejection  it was a little mound of newturned earth sprinkled with flowers long since withered and at one end was a flat slab of sandstone stuck in the ground it was a grave and it meant for me that i had at last stumbled into a country inhabited by human beings  i would find them they would direct me to the cliffs perhaps they would accompany me and take us back with them to their abodesto the abodes of men and women like ourselves  my hopes and my imagination ran riot in the few yards i had to cover to reach that lonely grave and stoop that i might read the rude characters scratched upon the simple headstone  this is what i read    here lies john tippet englishman killed by tyrannosaurus   10 sept ad 1916   r i p   tippet it seemed incredible  tippet lying here in this gloomy wood tippet dead  he had been a good man but the personal loss was not what affected me  it was the fact that this silent grave gave evidence that bradley had come this far upon his expedition and that he too probably was lost for it was not our intention that he should be long gone  if i had stumbled upon the grave of one of the party was it not within reason to believe that the bones of the others lay scattered somewhere near    chapter 9  as i stood looking down upon that sad and lonely mound wrapped in the most dismal of reflections and premonitions i was suddenly seized from behind and thrown to earth  as i fell a warm body fell on top of me and hands grasped my arms and legs when i could look up i saw a number of giant fingers pinioning me down while others stood about surveying me  here again was a new type of mana higher type than the primitive tribe i had just quitted  they were a taller people too with bettershaped skulls and more intelligent faces  there were less of the ape characteristics about their features and less of the negroid too they carried weapons stoneshod spears stone knives and hatchetsand they wore ornaments and breechclothsthe former of feathers worn in their hair and the latter made of a single snakeskin cured with the head on the head depending to their knees  of course i did not take in all these details upon the instant of my capture for i was busy with other matters  three of the warriors were sitting upon me trying to hold me down by main strength and awkwardness and they were having their hands full in the doing i can tell you  i dont like to appear conceited but i may as well admit that i am proud of my strength and the science that i have acquired and developed in the directing of itthat and my horsemanship i always have been proud of  and now that day all the long hours that i had put into careful study practice and training brought me in two or three minutes a full return upon my investment  californians as a rule are familiar with jujutsu and i especially had made a study of it for several years both at school and in the gym of the los angeles athletic club while recently i had had in my employ a jap who was a wonder at the art  it took me just about thirty seconds to break the elbow of one of my assailants trip another and send him stumbling backward among his fellows and throw the third completely over my head in such a way that when he fell his neck was broken  in the instant that the others of the party stood in mute and inactive surprise i unslung my riflewhich carelessly i had been carrying across my back and when they charged as i felt they would i put a bullet in the forehead of one of them  this stopped them all temporarilynot the death of their fellow but the report of the rifle the first they had ever heard before they were ready to attack me again one of them spoke in a commanding tone to his fellows and in a language similar but still more comprehensive than that of the tribe to the south as theirs was more complete than ahms  he commanded them to stand back and then he advanced and addressed me  he asked me who i was from whence i came and what my intentions were i replied that i was a stranger in caspak that i was lost and that my only desire was to find my way back to my companions  he asked where they were and i told him toward the south somewhere using the caspakian phrase which literally translated means toward the beginning  his surprise showed upon his face before he voiced it in words  there are no galus there he said  i tell you i said angrily that i am from another country far from caspak far beyond the high cliffs  i do not know who the galus may be i have never seen them  this is the farthest north i have been look at melook at my clothing and my weapons have you ever seen a galu or any other creature in caspak who possessed such things  he had to admit that he had not and also that he was much interested in me my rifle and the way i had handled his three warriors  finally he became half convinced that i was telling him the truth and offered to aid me if i would show him how i had thrown the man over my head and also make him a present of the bangspear as he called it  i refused to give him my rifle but promised to show him the trick he wished to learn if he would guide me in the right direction  he told me that he would do so tomorrow that it was too late today and that i might come to their village and spend the night with them  i was loath to lose so much time but the fellow was obdurate and so i accompanied them  the two dead men they left where they had fallen nor gave them a second glancethus cheap is life upon caspak  these people also were cavedwellers but their caves showed the result of a higher intelligence that brought them a step nearer to civilized man than the tribe next toward the beginning the interiors of their caverns were cleared of rubbish though still far from clean and they had pallets of dried grasses covered with the skins of leopard lynx and bear while before the entrances were barriers of stone and small rudely circular stone ovens  the walls of the cavern to which i was conducted were covered with drawings scratched upon the sandstone there were the outlines of the giant reddeer of mammoths of tigers and other beasts  here as in the last tribe there were no children or any old people  the men of this tribe had two names or rather names of two syllables and their language contained words of two syllables whereas in the tribe of tsa the words were all of a single syllable with the exception of a very few like atis and galus  the chiefs name was tojo and his household consisted of seven females and himself  these women were much more comely or rather less hideous than those of tsas people one of them even was almost pretty being less hairy and having a rather nice skin with high coloring  they were all much interested in me and examined my clothing and equipment carefully handling and feeling and smelling of each article i learned from them that their people were known as bandlu or spearmen tsas race was called stoluhatchetmen  below these in the scale of evolution came the bolu or clubmen and then the alus who had no weapons and no language  in that word i recognized what to me seemed the most remarkable discovery i had made upon caprona for unless it were mere coincidence i had come upon a word that had been handed down from the beginning of spoken language upon earth been handed down for millions of years perhaps with little change  it was the sole remaining thread of the ancient woof of a dawning culture which had been woven when caprona was a fiery mount upon a great landmass teeming with life  it linked the unfathomable then to the eternal now  and yet it may have been pure coincidence my better judgment tells me that it is coincidence that in caspak the term for speechless man is alus and in the outer world of our own day it is alalus  the comely woman of whom i spoke was called sota and she took such a lively interest in me that tojo finally objected to her attentions emphasizing his displeasure by knocking her down and kicking her into a corner of the cavern  i leaped between them while he was still kicking her and obtaining a quick hold upon him dragged him screaming with pain from the cave  then i made him promise not to hurt the she again upon pain of worse punishment sota gave me a grateful look but tojo and the balance of his women were sullen and ominous  later in the evening sota confided to me that she was soon to leave the tribe  sota soon to be krolu she confided in a low whisper  i asked her what a krolu might be and she tried to explain but i do not yet know if i understood her  from her gestures i deduced that the krolus were a people who were armed with bows and arrows had vessels in which to cook their food and huts of some sort in which they lived and were accompanied by animals  it was all very fragmentary and vague but the idea seemed to be that the krolus were a more advanced people than the bandlus  i pondered a long time upon all that i had heard before sleep came to me  i tried to find some connection between these various races that would explain the universal hope which each of them harbored that some day they would become galus  sota had given me a suggestion but the resulting idea was so weird that i could scarce even entertain it yet it coincided with ahms expressed hope with the various steps in evolution i had noted in the several tribes i had encountered and with the range of type represented in each tribe  for example among the bandlu were such types as sota who seemed to me to be the highest in the scale of evolution and tojo who was just a shade nearer the ape while there were others who had flatter noses more prognathous faces and hairier bodies  the question puzzled me possibly in the outer world the answer to it is locked in the bosom of the sphinx  who knows  i do not  thinking the thoughts of a lunatic or a dopefiend i fell asleep and when i awoke my hands and feet were securely tied and my weapons had been taken from me  how they did it without awakening me i cannot tell you  it was humiliating but it was true tojo stood above me  the early light of morning was dimly filtering into the cave  tell me he demanded how to throw a man over my head and break his neck for i am going to kill you and i wish to know this thing before you die  of all the ingenuous declarations i have ever heard this one copped the proverbial bun  it struck me as so funny that even in the face of death i laughed  death i may remark here had however lost much of his terror for me  i had become a disciple of lys fleeting philosophy of the valuelessness of human life i realized that she was quite rightthat we were but comic figures hopping from the cradle to the grave of interest to practically no other created thing than ourselves and our few intimates  behind tojo stood sota  she raised one hand with the palm toward methe caspakian equivalent of a negative shake of the head  let me think about it i parried and tojo said that he would wait until night  he would give me a day to think it over then he left and the women leftthe men for the hunt and the women as i later learned from sota for the warm pool where they immersed their bodies as did the shes of the stolu  ata explained sota when i questioned her as to the purpose of this matutinal rite but that was later  i must have lain there bound and uncomfortable for two or three hours when at last sota entered the cave  she carried a sharp knifemine in fact and with it she cut my bonds  come she said  sota will go with you back to the galus it is time that sota left the bandlu  together we will go to the krolu and after that the galus  tojo will kill you tonight he will kill sota if he knows that sota aided you  we will go together  i will go with you to the krolu i replied but then i must return to my own people toward the beginning  you cannot go back she said  it is forbidden  they would kill you  thus far have you comethere is no returning  but i must return i insisted  my people are there  i must return and lead them in this direction  she insisted and i insisted but at last we compromised  i was to escort her as far as the country of the krolu and then i was to go back after my own people and lead them north into a land where the dangers were fewer and the people less murderous she brought me all my belongings that had been filched from merifle ammunition knife and thermos bottle and then hand in hand we descended the cliff and set off toward the north  for three days we continued upon our way until we arrived outside a village of thatched huts just at dusk  sota said that she would enter alone i must not be seen if i did not intend to remain as it was forbidden that one should return and live after having advanced this far  so she left me she was a dear girl and a stanch and true comrademore like a man than a woman  in her simple barbaric way she was both refined and chaste  she had been the wife of tojo  among the krolu she would find another mate after the manner of the strange caspakian world but she told me very frankly that whenever i returned she would leave her mate and come to me as she preferred me above all others  i was becoming a ladies man after a lifetime of bashfulness  at the outskirts of the village i left her without even seeing the sort of people who inhabited it and set off through the growing darkness toward the south  on the third day i made a detour westward to avoid the country of the bandlu as i did not care to be detained by a meeting with tojo  on the sixth day i came to the cliffs of the stolu and my heart beat fast as i approached them for here was lys soon i would hold her tight in my arms again soon her warm lips would merge with mine i felt sure that she was still safe among the hatchet people and i was already picturing the joy and the lovelight in her eyes when she should see me once more as i emerged from the last clump of trees and almost ran toward the cliffs  it was late in the morning  the women must have returned from the pool yet as i drew near i saw no sign of life whatever they have remained longer i thought but when i was quite close to the base of the cliffs i saw that which dashed my hopes and my happiness to earth strewn along the ground were a score of mute and horrible suggestions of what had taken place during my absencebones picked clean of flesh the bones of manlike creatures the bones of many of the tribe of stolu nor in any cave was there sign of life  closely i examined the ghastly remains fearful each instant that i should find the dainty skull that would shatter my happiness for life but though i searched diligently picking up every one of the twentyodd skulls i found none that was the skull of a creature but slightly removed from the ape  hope then still lived  for another three days i searched north and south east and west for the hatchetmen of caspak but never a trace of them did i find  it was raining most of the time now and the weather was as near cold as it ever seems to get on caprona  at last i gave up the search and set off toward fort dinosaur for a weeka week filled with the terrors and dangers of a primeval worldi pushed on in the direction i thought was south the sun never shone the rain scarcely ever ceased falling the beasts i met with were fewer in number but infinitely more terrible in temper yet i lived on until there came to me the realization that i was hopelessly lost that a year of sunshine would not again give me my bearings and while i was cast down by this terrifying knowledge the knowledge that i never again could find lys i stumbled upon another gravethe grave of william james with its little crude headstone and its scrawled characters recording that he had died upon the 13th of septemberkilled by a sabertooth tiger  i think that i almost gave up then  never in my life have i felt more hopeless or helpless or alone  i was lost  i could not find my friends  i did not even know that they still lived in fact i could not bring myself to believe that they did  i was sure that lys was dead  i wanted myself to die and yet i clung to lifeuseless and hopeless and harrowing a thing as it had become i clung to life because some ancient reptilian forbear had clung to life and transmitted to me through the ages the most powerful motive that guided his minute brainthe motive of selfpreservation  at last i came to the great barriercliffs and after three days of mad effortof maniacal efforti scaled them  i built crude ladders i wedged sticks in narrow fissures i chopped toeholds and fingerholds with my long knife but at last i scaled them near the summit i came upon a huge cavern  it is the abode of some mighty winged creature of the triassicor rather it was now it is mine  i slew the thing and took its abode  i reached the summit and looked out upon the broad gray terrible pacific of the farsouthern winter  it was cold up there  it is cold here today yet here i sit watching watching watching for the thing i know will never comefor a sail    chapter 10  once a day i descend to the base of the cliff and hunt and fill my stomach with water from a clear cold spring  i have three gourds which i fill with water and take back to my cave against the long nights  i have fashioned a spear and a bow and arrow that i may conserve my ammunition which is running low  my clothes are worn to shreds tomorrow i shall discard them for leopardskins which i have tanned and sewn into a garment strong and warm  it is cold up here  i have a fire burning and i sit bent over it while i write but i am safe here no other living creature ventures to the chill summit of the barrier cliffs  i am safe and i am alone with my sorrows and my remembered joysbut without hope it is said that hope springs eternal in the human breast but there is none in mine  i am about done  presently i shall fold these pages and push them into my thermos bottle  i shall cork it and screw the cap tight and then i shall hurl it as far out into the sea as my strength will permit  the wind is offshore the tide is running out perhaps it will be carried into one of those numerous oceancurrents which sweep perpetually from pole to pole and from continent to continent to be deposited at last upon some inhabited shore  if fate is kind and this does happen then for gods sake come and get me  it was a week ago that i wrote the preceding paragraph which i thought would end the written record of my life upon caprona i had paused to put a new point on my quill and stir the crude ink which i made by crushing a black variety of berry and mixing it with water before attaching my signature when faintly from the valley far below came an unmistakable sound which brought me to my feet trembling with excitement to peer eagerly downward from my dizzy ledge  how full of meaning that sound was to me you may guess when i tell you that it was the report of a firearm  for a moment my gaze traversed the landscape beneath until it was caught and held by four figures near the base of the cliffa human figure held at bay by three hyaenodons those ferocious and bloodthirsty wild dogs of the eocene  a fourth beast lay dead or dying near by  i couldnt be sure looking down from above as i was but yet i trembled like a leaf in the intuitive belief that it was lys and my judgment served to confirm my wild desire for whoever it was carried only a pistol and thus had lys been armed  the first wave of sudden joy which surged through me was shortlived in the face of the swiftfollowing conviction that the one who fought below was already doomed  luck and only luck it must have been which had permitted that first shot to lay low one of the savage creatures for even such a heavy weapon as my pistol is entirely inadequate against even the lesser carnivora of caspak in a moment the three would charge a futile shot would but tend more greatly to enrage the one it chanced to hit and then the three would drag down the little human figure and tear it to pieces  and maybe it was lys  my heart stood still at the thought but mind and muscle responded to the quick decision i was forced to make there was but a single hopea single chanceand i took it i raised my rifle to my shoulder and took careful aim  it was a long shot a dangerous shot for unless one is accustomed to it shooting from a considerable altitude is most deceptive work there is though something about marksmanship which is quite beyond all scientific laws  upon no other theory can i explain my marksmanship of that moment three times my rifle spokethree quick short syllables of death i did not take conscious aim and yet at each report a beast crumpled in its tracks  from my ledge to the base of the cliff is a matter of several thousand feet of dangerous climbing yet i venture to say that the first ape from whose loins my line has descended never could have equaled the speed with which i literally dropped down the face of that rugged escarpment  the last two hundred feet is over a steep incline of loose rubble to the valley bottom and i had just reached the top of this when there arose to my ears an agonized crybowen  bowen  quick my love quick  i had been too much occupied with the dangers of the descent to glance down toward the valley but that cry which told me that it was indeed lys and that she was again in danger brought my eyes quickly upon her in time to see a hairy burly brute seize her and start off at a run toward the nearby wood  from rock to rock chamoislike i leaped downward toward the valley in pursuit of lys and her hideous abductor  he was heavier than i by many pounds and so weighted by the burden he carried that i easily overtook him and at last he turned snarling to face me  it was kho of the tribe of tsa the hatchetmen  he recognized me and with a low growl he threw lys aside and came for me the she is mine he cried i kill  i kill  i had had to discard my rifle before i commenced the rapid descent of the cliff so that now i was armed only with a hunting knife and this i whipped from its scabbard as kho leaped toward me he was a mighty beast mightily muscled and the urge that has made males fight since the dawn of life on earth filled him with the bloodlust and the thirst to slay but not one whit less did it fill me with the same primal passions  two abysmal beasts sprang at each others throats that day beneath the shadow of earths oldest cliffsthe man of now and the manthing of the earliest forgotten then imbued by the same deathless passion that has come down unchanged through all the epochs periods and eras of time from the beginning and which shall continue to the incalculable endwoman the imperishable alpha and omega of life  kho closed and sought my jugular with his teeth  he seemed to forget the hatchet dangling by its aurochshide thong at his hip as i forgot for the moment the dagger in my hand  and i doubt not but that kho would easily have bested me in an encounter of that sort had not lys voice awakened within my momentarily reverted brain the skill and cunning of reasoning man  bowen she cried  your knife  your knife  it was enough  it recalled me from the forgotten eon to which my brain had flown and left me once again a modern man battling with a clumsy unskilled brute  no longer did my jaws snap at the hairy throat before me but instead my knife sought and found a space between two ribs over the savage heart  kho voiced a single horrid scream stiffened spasmodically and sank to the earth and lys threw herself into my arms  all the fears and sorrows of the past were wiped away and once again i was the happiest of men  with some misgivings i shortly afterward cast my eyes upward toward the precarious ledge which ran before my cave for it seemed to me quite beyond all reason to expect a dainty modern belle to essay the perils of that frightful climb  i asked her if she thought she could brave the ascent and she laughed gayly in my face  watch she cried and ran eagerly toward the base of the cliff like a squirrel she clambered swiftly aloft so that i was forced to exert myself to keep pace with her  at first she frightened me but presently i was aware that she was quite as safe here as was i when we finally came to my ledge and i again held her in my arms she recalled to my mind that for several weeks she had been living the life of a cavegirl with the tribe of hatchetmen  they had been driven from their former caves by another tribe which had slain many and carried off quite half the females and the new cliffs to which they had flown had proven far higher and more precipitous so that she had become through necessity a most practiced climber  she told me of khos desire for her since all his females had been stolen and of how her life had been a constant nightmare of terror as she sought by night and by day to elude the great brute for a time nobs had been all the protection she required but one day he disappearednor has she seen him since  she believes that he was deliberately made away with and so do i for we both are sure that he never would have deserted her  with her means of protection gone lys was now at the mercy of the hatchetman nor was it many hours before he had caught her at the base of the cliff and seized her but as he bore her triumphantly aloft toward his cave she had managed to break loose and escape him  for three days he has pursued me she said through this horrible world  how i have passed through in safety i cannot guess nor how i have always managed to outdistance him yet i have done it until just as you discovered me  fate was kind to us bowen  i nodded my head in assent and crushed her to me and then we talked and planned as i cooked antelopesteaks over my fire and we came to the conclusion that there was no hope of rescue that she and i were doomed to live and die upon caprona  well it might be worse  i would rather live here always with lys than to live elsewhere without her and she dear girl says the same of me but i am afraid of this life for her  it is a hard fierce dangerous life and i shall pray always that we shall be rescued from itfor her sake  that night the clouds broke and the moon shone down upon our little ledge and there hand in hand we turned our faces toward heaven and plighted our troth beneath the eyes of god  no human agency could have married us more sacredly than we are wed  we are man and wife and we are content  if god wills it we shall live out our lives here  if he wills otherwise then this manuscript which i shall now consign to the inscrutable forces of the sea shall fall into friendly hands  however we are each without hope and so we say goodbye in this our last message to the world beyond the barrier cliffs  signed bowen j tyler jr lys la r tyler
