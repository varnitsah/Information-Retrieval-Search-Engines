26995705	twice told tales                            snowflakes                       by nathaniel hawthorne    there is snow in yonder cold gray sky of the  morningand through the partially frosted  windowpanes i love to watch the gradual beginning of the storm  a few feathery flakes are scattered widely through the air and hover downward with uncertain flight now almost alighting on the earth now whirled again aloft into remote regions of the atmosphere  these are not the big flakes heavy with moisture which melt as they touch the ground and are portentous of a  soaking rain  it is to be in good earnest a wintry storm  the two or three people visible on the sidewalks have an aspect of endurance a bluenosed frosty  fortitude which is evidently assumed in anticipation of a comfortless and blustering day  by nightfall or at least before the sun sheds another glimmering smile upon us  the street and our little garden will be heaped with  mountain snowdrifts the soil already frozen for weeks  past is prepared to sustain whatever burden may be laid  upon it and to a northern eye the landscape will lose  its melancholy bleakness and acquire a beauty of its own  when mother earth like her children shall have put on the fleecy garb of her winters wear  the cloudspirits  are slowly weaving her white mantle as yet indeed  there is barely a rime like hoarfrost over the brown surface of the street the withered green of the grassplat is still discernible and the slated roofs of the houses do but begin to look gray instead of black  all the snow that has yet fallen within the circumference of my view were it heaped up together would hardly equal the hillock of a grave  thus gradually by silent and stealthy influences are great changes wrought  these little snowparticles which the stormspirit flings by handfuls through the air will bury the great earth under their accumulated mass nor permit her to behold her sister sky again for dreary months we likewise shall lose sight of our mothers familiar visage and must content ourselves with looking heavenward the oftener  now leaving the storm to do his appointed office let us sit down pen in hand by our fireside  gloomy as it may seem there is an influence productive of cheerfulness and favorable to imaginative thought in the atmosphere of a snowy day  the native of a southern clime may woo the muse beneath the heavy shade of summer foliage reclining on banks of turf while the sound of singing birds and warbling rivulets chimes in with the music of his soul  in our brief summer i do not think but only exist in the vague enjoyment of a dream  my hour of inspirationif that hour ever comesis when the green log hisses upon the hearth and the bright flame brighter for the gloom of the chamber rustles high up the chimney and the coals drop tinkling down among the growing heaps of ashes  when the casement rattles in the gust and the snowflakes or the sleety raindrops pelt hard against the windowpanes then i spread out my sheet of paper with the certainty that thoughts and fancies will gleam forth upon it like stars at twilight or like violets in mayperhaps to fade as soon  however transitory their glow they at least shine amid the darksome shadow which the clouds of the outward sky fling through the room  blessed therefore and reverently welcomed by me her trueborn son be new englands winter which makes us one and all the nurslings of the storm and sings a familiar lullaby even in the wildest shriek of the december blast  now look we forth again and see how much of his task the stormspirit has done  slow and sure  he has the day perchance the week before him and may take his own time to accomplish natures burial in snow a smooth mantle is scarcely yet thrown over the withered grassplat and the dry stalks of annuals still thrust themselves through the white surface in all parts of the garden  the leafless rosebushes stand shivering in a shallow snowdrift looking poor things as disconsolate as if they possessed a human consciousness of the dreary scene  this is a sad time for the shrubs that do not perish with the summer they neither live nor die what they retain of life seems but the chilling sense of death  very sad are the flower shrubs in midwinter  the roofs of the houses are now all white save where the eddying wind has kept them bare at the bleak corners  to discern the real intensity of the storm we must fix upon some distant objectas yonder spireand observe how the riotous gust fights with the descending snow throughout the intervening space  sometimes the entire prospect is obscured then again we have a distinct but transient glimpse of the tall steeple like a giants ghost and now the dense wreaths sweep between as if demons were flinging snowdrifts at each other in midair  look next into the street where we have seen an amusing parallel to the combat of those fancied demons in the upper regions  it is a snowbattle of schoolboys  what a pretty satire on war and military glory might be written in the form of a childs story by describing the snowballfights of two rival schools the alternate defeats and victories of each and the final triumph of one party or perhaps of neither  what pitched battles worthy to be chanted in homeric strains  what storming of fortresses built all of massive snowblocks  what feats of individual prowess and embodied onsets of martial enthusiasm  and when some wellcontested and decisive victory had put a period to the war both armies should unite to build a lofty monument of snow upon the battlefield and crown it with the victors statue hewn of the same frozen marble  in a few days or weeks thereafter the passerby would observe a shapeless mound upon the level common and unmindful of the famous victory would ask  how came it there  who reared it  and what means it the shattered pedestal of many a battle monument has provoked these questions when none could answer  turn we again to the fireside and sit musing there lending our ears to the wind till perhaps it shall seem like an articulate voice and dictate wild and airy matter for the pen  would it might inspire me to sketch out the personification of a new england winter  and that idea if i can seize the snowwreathed figures that flit before my fancy shall be the theme of the next page  how does winter herald his approach  by the shrieking blast of latter autumn which is natures cry of lamentation as the destroyer rushes among the shivering groves where she has lingered and scatters the sear leaves upon the tempest  when that cry is heard the people wrap themselves in cloaks and shake their heads disconsolately saying winter is at hand then the axe of the woodcutter echoes sharp and diligently in the forest then the coalmerchants rejoice because each shriek of nature in her agony adds something to the price of coal per ton then the peatsmoke spreads its aromatic fragrance through the atmosphere  a few days more and at eventide the children look out of the window and dimly perceive the flaunting of a snowy mantle in the air  it is stern winters vesture  they crowd around the hearth and cling to their mothers gown or press between their fathers knees affrighted by the hollow roaring voice that bellows adown the wide flue of the chimney  it is the voice of winter and when parents and children bear it they shudder and exclaim winter is come  cold winter has begun his reign already  now throughout new england each hearth becomes an altar sending up the smoke of a continued sacrifice to the immitigable deity who tyrannizes over forest country side and town  wrapped in his white mantle his staff a huge icicle his beard and hair a windtossed snowdrift he travels over the land in the midst of the northern blast and woe to the homeless wanderer whom he finds upon his path  there he lies stark and stiff a human shape of ice on the spot where winter overtook him  on strides the tyrant over the rushing rivers and broad lakes which turn to rock beneath his footsteps  his dreary empire is established all around stretches the desolation of the pole  yet not ungrateful be his new england childrenfor winter is our sire though a stern and rough onenot ungrateful even for the severities which have nourished our unyielding strength of character  and let us thank him too for the sleighrides cheered by the music of merry bells for the crackling and rustling hearth when the ruddy firelight gleams on hardy manhood and the blooming cheek of woman for all the home enjoyments and the kindred virtues which flourish in a frozen soil  not that we grieve when after some seven months of storm and bitter frost spring in the guise of a flowercrowned virgin is seen driving away the hoary despot pelting him with violets by the handful and strewing green grass on the path behind him  often ere he will give up his empire old winter rushes fiercely back and hurls a snowdrift at the shrinking form of spring yet step by step he is compelled to retreat northward and spends the summer months within the arctic circle  such fantasies intermixed among graver toils of mind have made the winters day pass pleasantly  meanwhile the storm has raged without abatement and now as the brief afternoon declines is tossing denser volumes to and fro about the atmosphere  on the windowsill there is a layer of snow reaching halfway up the lowest pane of glass  the garden is one unbroken bed  along the street are two or three spots of uncovered earth where the gust has whirled away the snow heaping it elsewhere to the fencetops or piling huge banks against the doors of houses  a solitary passenger is seen now striding midleg deep across a drift now scudding over the bare ground while his cloak is swollen with the wind  and now the jingling of bells a sluggish sound responsive to the horses toilsome progress through the unbroken drifts announces the passage of a sleigh with a boy clinging behind and ducking his head to escape detection by the driver  next comes a sledge laden with wood for some unthrifty housekeeper whom winter has surprised at a cold hearth  but what dismal equipage now struggles along the uneven street  a sable hearse bestrewn with snow is bearing a dead man through the storm to his frozen bed  o how dreary is a burial in winter when the bosom of mother earth has no warmth for her poor child  eveningthe early eve of decemberbegins to spread its deepening veil over the comfortless scene the firelight gradually brightens and throws my flickering shadow upon the walls and ceiling of the chamber but still the storm rages and rattles against the windows alas i shiver and think it time to be disconsolate  but taking a farewell glance at dead nature in her shroud i perceive a flock of snowbirds skimming lightsomely through the tempest and flitting from drift to drift as sportively as swallows in the delightful prime of summer  whence come they  where do they build their nests and seek their food  why having airy wings do they not follow summer around the earth instead of making themselves the playmates of the storm and fluttering on the dreary verge of the winters eve  i know not whence they come nor why yet my spirit has been cheered by that wandering flock of snowbirds
