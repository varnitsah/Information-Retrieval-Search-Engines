frontispiece i was waiting here for you he explained the eyes of every one were turned toward the wall for myself he declared i remain where is this man he demanded mrs weatherley and the cashier looked over his shoulder     chapter i  an invitation to dinner   mr samuel weatherley sole proprietor of the firm of samuel weatherley  co wholesale provision merchants of tooley street london paused suddenly on his way from his private office to the street there was something which until that second had entirely slipped his memory it was not his umbrella for that neatly tucked up was already under his arm nor was it the times for that together with the supplement was sticking out of his overcoat pocket the shape of which it completely ruined as a matter of fact it was more important than either of theseit was a commission from his wife  very slowly he retraced his steps until he stood outside the glassenclosed cage where twelve of the hardestworked clerks in london bent over their ledgers and invoicing with his forefingera fat pudgy forefingerhe tapped upon a pane of glass and an anxious errand boy bolted through the doorway  tell mr jarvis to step this way his employer ordered  mr jarvis heard the message and came hurrying out he was an undersized man with somewhat prominent eyes concealed by goldrimmed spectacles he was possessed of extraordinary talents with regard to the details of the business and was withal an expert and careful financier hence his hold upon the confidence of his employer  the latter addressed him with a curious and altogether unusual hesitation in his manner  mr jarvis he began there is a mattera little matterupon which ierwish to consult you  those american invoices  nothing to do with business at all mr weatherley interrupted ruthlessly a little private matter  indeed sir mr jarvis interjected  the fact is mr weatherley blundered on with considerable awkwardness for he hated the whole affair my wifemrs weatherley you knowis giving a party this eveninghaving some friends to dinner first and then some other people coming to bridge we are a man short for dinner mrs weatherley told me to get some one at the clubtelephoned down here just an hour ago  mr weatherley paused mr jarvis did his best to grasp the situation but failed all that he could do was to maintain his attitude of intelligent interest  i dont know any one at the club continued his employer irritably i feel like a fish out of water there and thats the truth mr jarvis its a good club i got elected therewell never mind howbut its one thing to be a member of a club and quite another to get to know the men there you understand that mr jarvis  mr jarvis however did not understand it he could conceive of no spot in the city of london or its immediate neighborhood where mr samuel weatherley head of the firm of messrs weatherley  co could find himself among his social superiors he knew the capital of the firm and its status he was ignorant of the other things which countedas ignorant as his master had been until he had paid a business visit a few years ago in search of certain edibles to an island in the mediterranean sea he was to have returned in triumph to tooley street and launched upon the provisionbuying world a new cheese of astounding quality and infinitesimal priceinstead of which he brought home a wife  anything i can do sir began mr jarvis a little vaguely  my idea was mr weatherley proceeded that one of my own young menthere are twelve of them in there arent there he added jerking his head in the direction of the officemight do what do you think  mr jarvis nodded thoughtfully  it would be a great honor sir he declared a very great honor indeed  mr weatherley did not contradict him as a matter of fact he was of the same opinion  the question is which he continued  mr jarvis began to understand why he had been consulted his fingers involuntarily straightened his tie  if i could be of any use personally sir  his employer shook his head  my wife would expect me to bring a single man jarvis he said and besides i dont suppose you play bridge  cards are not much in my line mr jarvis admitted not having as a rule the time to spare but i can take a hand at loo if desired  my wifes friends all play bridge mr weatherley declared a little brusquely theres only one young man in the office jarvis who from his appearance struck me as being likely  mr stephen tidey of course sir the confidential clerk agreed most suitable thing sir and im sure his father would accept it as a high compliment mr stephen tidey senior sir as you may be aware is next on the list for the shrievalty shall i call him out sir  mr weatherley looked through the glass and met the glance instantly lowered of the young man in question mr stephen tidey junior was short and stout reflecting in his physique his aldermanic father his complexion was poor however his neck thick and he wore a necktie of red silk drawn through a diamond ring there was nothing in his appearance which grated particularly upon mr weatherleys sense of seemliness nevertheless he shook his head he was beginning to recognize his wifes point of view even though it still seemed strange to him  i wasnt thinking of young tidey at all he declared bluntly i was thinking of that young fellow at the end of the desk therechap with a queer namechetwode i think you call him  mr jarvis human automaton though he was permitted himself an exclamation of surprise  young chetwode surely youre not in earnest sir  why not mr weatherley demanded theres nothing against him is there  nothing against him precisely mr jarvis confessed but hes at the lowest desk in the office bar smithers his salary is only twentyeight shillings a week and we know nothing whatever about him except that his references were satisfactory it isnt to be supposed that he would feel at home in your house sir now with mr tidey sir its quite different they live in a very beautiful house at sydenham nowquite a small palace in its way ive been told  mr weatherley was getting a little impatient  send chetwode out for a moment anyway he directed ill speak to him here  mr jarvis obeyed in silence he entered the office and touched the young man in question upon the shoulder  mr weatherley wishes to speak to you outside chetwode he announced make haste please  arnold chetwode put down his pen and rose to his feet there was nothing flurried about his manner nothing whatever to indicate on his part any knowledge of the fact that this was the voice of fate beating upon his ear he did not even show the ordinary interest of a youthful employee summoned for the first time to an audience with his chief standing for a moment by the side of the senior clerk in the middle of the office tall and straight with deep brown hair excellent features and the remnants of a healthy tan still visible on his forehead and neck he looked curiously out of place in this unwholesome gaslit building with its atmosphere of cheese and bacon he would have been noticeably goodlooking upon the cricket field or in any gathering of people belonging to the other side of life here he seemed almost a curiously incongruous figure he passed through the glasspaned door and stood respectfully before his employer mr weatherleyit was absurd but he scarcely knew how to make his suggestionfidgetted for a moment and coughed the young man who among many other quite unusual qualities was possessed of a considerable amount of tact looked down upon his employer with a little wellassumed anxiety as a matter of fact he really was exceedingly anxious not to lose his place  i understood from mr jarvis that you wished to speak to me sir he remarked i hope that my work has given satisfaction i know that i am quite inexperienced but i dont think that i have made any mistakes  mr weatherley was to tell the truth thankful for the opening  i have had no complaints chetwode he admitted struggling for that note of condescension which he felt to be in order no complaints at all i was wondering if youyou happened to play bridge  once more this extraordinary young man showed himself to be possessed of gifts quite unusual at his age not by the flicker of an eyelid did he show the least surprise or amusement  bridge sir he repeated yes i have played ati have played occasionally  my wife is giving a small dinnerparty this evening mr weatherley continued moving his umbrella from one hand to the other and speaking very rapidly bridge afterwards we happen to be a man short i was to have called at the club to try and pick up some onefind i shant have timemeeting at the cannon street hotel to attend would youerfill the vacant place save me the trouble of looking about  it was out at last and mr weatherley felt unaccountably relieved he felt at the same time a certain measure of annoyance with his junior clerk for his unaltered composure  i shall be very much pleased sir he answered without hesitation about eight i suppose  again mr weatherleys relief was tempered with a certain amount of annoyance this young mans savoir faire was out of place he should have imagined a sort of hightea supper at seven oclock and been gently corrected by his courteous employer as it was mr weatherley felt dimly confident that this junior clerk of his was more accustomed to eight oclock dinners than he was himself  a quarter to tonight he replied people coming for bridge afterwards you see i live up hampstead waypelham lodgequite close to the tube station  mr weatherley omitted the directions he had been about to give respecting toilet and turned away his youthful employees manners to the last were all that could be desired  i am much obliged to you sir he said i will take care to be punctual  mr weatherley grunted and walked out into the street here his behavior was a little singular he walked up toward london bridge exchanging greetings with a good many acquaintances on the way opposite the london  westminster bank he paused for a moment and looked searchingly around satisfied that he was unobserved he stepped quickly into a very handsome motor car which was drawn up close to the curb and with a sigh of relief sat as far back among the cushions as possible and held the tube to his mouth  get along home he ordered tersely                                       arnold chetwode after his interview with his employer returned unruffled to his place mr jarvis bustled in after him he was annoyed but he wished to conceal the fact besides he still had an arrow in his quiver he came and stood over his subordinate  congratulate you im sure chetwode he said smoothly first time any one except myself has been to the house since mr weatherleys marriage  mr jarvis had taken the letters there one morning when his employer had been unwell and had waited in the hall he did not however mention that fact  indeed chetwode murmured with his eye upon his work  you understand of course mr jarvis continued that it will be an eveningdress affair mrs weatherley has the name of being very particular  he glanced covertly at the young man who was already immersed in his work  evening dress chetwode remarked with a becoming show of interest well i dare say i can manage something if i wear a black coat and a white silk bow and stick a red handkerchief in underneath my waistcoat i dare say i shall be all right mr weatherley cant expect much from me in that way can he  the senior clerk was secretly delighted it was not for him to acquaint this young countryman with the necessities of london life he turned away and took up a bundle of letters  cant say im sure what the governor expects he replied falsely youll have to do the best you can i suppose better get on with those invoices now  once more the office resounded to the hum of its varied labors mr jarvis dictating letters to a typist smiled occasionally as he pictured the arrival of this overfavored young man in the drawingroom of mrs weatherley attired in the nondescript fashion which his words had suggested one or two of the clerks ventured upon a chaffing remark to all appearance the person most absorbed in his work was the young man who had been singled out for such especial favor     chapter ii  ruth   in the topmost chamber of the last of a row of somber gray stone houses in adam street a girl with a thin but beautiful face and large expectant eyes sat close to the bare uncurtained window from which it was possible to command a view of the street below a book which she had apparently been reading had fallen neglected onto the floor steadfastly she watched the passersby her delicate expressive features were more than once illuminated with joy only to be clouded a moment later with disappointment the color came and went in her cheeks as though indeed she were more sensitive than her years occasionally she glanced around at the clock time dragged so slowly in that great bare room with its obvious touch of poverty  at last a tall figure came striding along the pavement below this time no mistake was possible there was a fluttering handkerchief from above an answering wave of the hand the girl drew a sigh of inexpressible content moved away from the window and faced the door with lifted head waiting for the sound of footsteps upon the stairs they arrived at last the door was thrown open arnold chetwode came hastily across the room and gripped the two hands which were held out to him then he bent down and kissed her forehead  dear little ruth he exclaimed i hope you were careful crossing the landing  the girl leaned back in her chair her eyes were fixed anxiously upon his face she completely ignored his question  the news at once she insisted tell me arnold  he was a little taken aback  how did you know that i had any  she smiled delightfully  know indeed i knew it directly i saw you i knew it every time your foot touched the stairs what is it arnold the cheeses didnt smell so bad today or youve had a rise quick i must hear all about it  you shall arnold replied it is a wonderful story listen have you ever heard the fable of dick whittington  married his employers daughter of course whats she like arnold have you seen her did you save her life when are you going to see her again  chetwode was already on his knees dragging out an old trunk from underneath the faded cupboard suddenly he paused with a gesture of despair  alas he exclaimed my dream fades away old weatherley was married only last year consequently his daughter  he cant have one she interrupted ruthlessly tell me the news at once  i am going to dine with old weatherley he announced  the girl smiled a little wistfully  how funny but you will get a good dinner wont you arnold eat ever so much dear yesterday i fancied that you were getting thin i do wish i could see what you have in the middle of the day  little mother he laughed today i gorged myself on poached eggs what did isaac give you  mutton stew and heaps of it the girl replied quickly tonight i shall have a bowl of milk as soon as you are gone have you everything you ought to have to wear arnold  everything he declared rising to his feet with a sigh of relief its so long since i looked at my clothes that to tell you the truth i was a little bit anxious they may be oldfashioned but they came from a good man to start with  what made mr weatherley ask you she demanded  wanted one of his clerks to fill up and found that i played bridge arnold answered its rather a bore isnt it but after all he is my employer  of course you must go and behave your very nicest tell me when have you to start  i ought to be changing in a quarter of an hour what shall we do till then  whatever you like she murmured  i am coming to sit at the window with you he said well look down at the river and you shall tell me stories about the ships  she laughed and took his hand as he dragged a chair over to her side he put his arm around her and her head fell naturally back upon his shoulder her eyes sought his he was leaning forward gazing down between the curving line of lampposts across the belt of black river with its flecks of yellow light but ruth watched him only  arnie she whispered in his ear there are no fairy ships upon the river tonight  he smiled  why not little one you have only to close your eyes  slowly she shook her head  dont think that i am foolish dear she begged tonight i cannot look upon the river at all i feel that there is something new herehere in this room the great things are here arnold i can feel life hammering and throbbing in the air we arent in a garret any longer dear its a fairy palace listen cant you hear the people shout and the music and the fountains playing cant you see the dusky walls fall back the marble pillars the lights in the ceiling  he turned his head he found himself indeed listening found himself almost disappointed to hear nothing but the faroff eternal roar of the city and the melancholy grinding of a hurdygurdy below always she carried him away by her intense earnestness the bewitching softness of her voice even when it was galleons full of treasure that she saw with bloodred sails coming up the river full of treasure for them tonight her voice had more than its share of inspiration her fancies clung to her feverishly  be careful arnold she murmured tonight means a change there is something new coming i can feel it coming in my heart  her face was drawn and pale he laughed down into her eyes  little lady he reminded her mockingly i am going to dine with my cheesemonger employer  she shook her head dreamily she refused to be dragged down  theres something beating in the air she continued it came into the room with you dont you feel it cant you feel that you are going to a tragedy life is going to be different arnold to be different always  he drew himself up a flicker of passion flamed in his own deep gray eyes  different child of course its going to be different if there werent something else in front do you think one could live do you think one could be content to struggle through this miserable quagmire if one didnt believe that there was something else on the other side of the hill  she sighed and her fingers touched his  i forgot she said simply you see there was a time when i hadnt you you lifted me out of my quagmire  not high enough dear he answered caressingly some day ill take you over to berlin or vienna or one of those wonderful places well leave isaac to grub along and sow red fire in hyde park well find the doctors we shall teach you to walk again without that stick no more gloominess please  she pressed his hand tightly  dear arnold she whispered softly  turn around and watch the river with me little one he begged see the lights on the barges how slowly they move what is there behind that one i wonder  her eyes followed his finger without enthusiasm  i cant look out of the room tonight arnold she said the fancies wont come promise me one thing  i promise he agreed  tell me everythingdont keep anything back  on my honor he declared smiling i will bring the menu of the dinner if there is one and a photograph of mrs cheesemonger if i can steal it now i am going to help you back into your room  dont bother she begged open the door and i can get there quite easily  he set the door open and crossing the bare stone landing opened the door of another room similar to his they were somber apartments at the top of the deserted house which had once been a noblemans residence the doors were still heavy though blistered with time and lack of varnish there were the remains of paneling upon the wall and frescoes upon the ceiling  come and see me before you go she pleaded i am all alone isaac has gone to a meeting somewhere  he promised and returned to his own apartment with the help of a candle which he stuck upon the mantelpiece and a cracked mirror he first of all shaved then disappeared for a few minutes behind a piece of faded curtain and washed vigorously afterwards he changed his clothes putting on a dress suit produced from the trunk when he had finished he stepped back and laughed softly to himself his clothes were well cut his studs which had very many times been on the point of visiting the pawnbrokers were correct and good he was indeed an incongruous figure as he stood there and with a candle carefully held away from him in his hand looked at his own reflection for some reason or other he was feeling elated ruths words had lingered in his brain one could never tell which way fortune might come  he found her waiting in the darkness her long arms were wound for a moment around his neck a sudden passion shook her  arnolddear arnold she sobbed you are going into the stormand i want to go i want to go too my hands are cold and my heart take me with you dear  he was a little startled it was not often that she was hysterical he looked down into her convulsed face she choked for a moment and then although it was not altogether a successful effort she laughed  dont mind me she begged i am a little mad tonight i think that the twilight here has got upon my nerves light the lamp please light the lamp and leave me alone for a moment while you do it  he obeyed fetching some matches from his own room and setting the lamp when it was lit on the table by her side there were no tears left in her eyes now her lips were tremulous but an unusual spot of color was burning in her cheeks while he had been dressing he saw that she had tied a piece of deep blue ribbon the color he liked best around her hair  see i am myself now good night and good luck to you arnold eat a good dinner mind and remember your promise  there is nothing more that i can do for you he asked  nothing she replied besides i can hear uncle isaac coming  the door was suddenly opened a thin undersized man in worn black clothes and with a somber hat of soft black felt still upon his head came into the room his dark hair was tinged with gray he walked with a pronounced stoop in his shabby clothes fitting loosely upon his diminutive body he should have been an insignificant figure but somehow or other he was nothing of the sort his thin lips curved into a discontented droop his cheeks were hollow and his eyes shone with the brightness of the fanatic arnold greeted him familiarly  hullo isaac he exclaimed you are just in time to save ruth from being left all alone  the newcomer came to a standstill he looked the speaker over from head to foot with an expression of growing disgust and he spat upon the floor  what liverys that he demanded  arnold laughed goodnaturedly  come isaac he protested i dont often inflict it upon you do i its something that belongs to the world on the other side you know we all of us have to look over the fence now and then i have to cross the borderland tonight for an hour or so  isaac threw open the door by which he had entered  get out of here he ordered if you were one of us id call you a traitor for wearing the rags as it is i say that no one is welcomed under my roof who looks as you look now why dn it i believe youre a gentleman  arnold laughed softly  my dear isaac he retorted i am as i was born and made you cant blame me for that can you besides  he broke off suddenly a little murmur from the girl behind reminded him of her presence he passed on to the door  good night isaac he said look after ruth shes lonely tonight  ill look after her was the grim reply as for you get you gone there was one of your sort came to the meeting of jamesons moulders this afternoon he had a question to ask and i answered him he wanted to know wherein wealth was a sin and i told him  arnold chetwode was young and his sense of humor triumphant he turned on the threshold and looked into the shadowy room dimly lit with its cheap lamp he kissed his hands to ruth  my dear isaac he declared lightly you are talking like an ass i have two shillings and a penny hapenny in my pocket which has to last me till saturday and i earn my twentyeight shillings a week in old weatherleys countinghouse as honestly as you earn your wage by thundering from labor platforms and articles in the clarion my clothes are part of the livery of civilization the journalist who reports a lord mayors dinner has to wear them some day when youve got your seat in parliament youll wear them yourself good night  he paused before closing the door ruths kiss came wafted to him from the shadows where her great eyes were burning like stars her uncle had turned his back upon him the word he muttered sounded like a malediction but arnold chetwode went down the stone steps blithely it was an untrodden land this into which he was to pass     chapter iii  arnold scents mystery   from the first nothing about that evening was as arnold had expected he took the tube to hampstead station and the night being dry he walked to pelham lodge without detriment to his carefully polished patent shoes the neighborhood was entirely strange to him and he was surprised to find that the house which was pointed out to him by a policeman was situated in grounds of not inconsiderable extent and approached by a short drive directly he rang the bell he was admitted not by a flamboyant parlormaid but by a quiet sadfaced butler in plain dark livery who might have been majordomo to a duke the house was even larger than he had expected and was handsomely furnished in an extremely subdued style it was dimly almost insufficiently lit and there was a faint but not unpleasant odor in the drawingroom which reminded him of incense the room itself almost took his breath away it was entirely french the hangings carpet and upholstery were all of a subdued rose color and white arnold who was for a young man exceedingly susceptible to impressions looked around him with an air almost of wonder it was fortunate perhaps that the room was empty  mr and mrs weatherley will be downstairs in one moment sir the man announced mr weatherley was a little late home from the city  arnold nodded and stood upon the hearthrug looking around him he was quite content to spend a few moments alone to admire the drooping clusters of roses the elegance with which every article of furniture and appointment of the room seemed to fit into its place somehow or other too nothing appeared new everything seemed subdued by time into its proper tone he began to wonder what sort of woman the presiding genius over such perfection could be then with a quaint transition of thought he remembered the little countinghouse in tooley street the smell of cheeses and mr weatherleys halfnervous invitation his lips twitched and he began to smile these things seemed to belong to a world so far away  presently he heard footsteps outside and voices the door was opened but the person outside did not immediately enter apparently she had turned round to listen to the man who was still some distance behind arnold recognized his employers voice  i am sorry that you are displeased my dear fenella but i assure you that i did the best i could it is true that the young man is in my office but i am convinced that you will find him presentable  a peal of the softest and most musical laughter that arnold had ever heard in his life effectually stopped mr weatherleys protestations yet for all its softness and for all its music there was a different note underneath something a little bitter unutterably scornful  my dear samuel it is true without doubt that you did your best i do not blame you at all it was i who was foolish to leave such a matter in your hands it was not likely that among your acquaintances there was one whom i would have cared to welcome to my house but that you should have gone to your employeesthat indeed is funny you do amuse me very much come  the door was pushed fully open now and a woman entered at the sight of whom arnold forgot all his feelings of mingled annoyance and amusement she was of little over the medium height exceedingly slima slimness which was accentuated by the fashion of the gown she wore her face was absolutely devoid of color but her features were almost cameolike in their sensitive perfection her eyes were large and soft and brown her hair a titian red worn low and without ornament her dress was of pale blue satin which somehow had the effect of being made in a single piece without seam or joining her neck and throat exquisitely white were bare except for a single necklace of pearls which reached almost to her knees the look in arnolds face as she came slowly into the room was one of frank and boyish admiration the woman came towards him with a soft smile about her lips but she was evidently puzzled it was mr weatherley who spoke there was something almost triumphant in his manner  this is mr chetwode dear of whom i was speaking to you he said glad to see you chetwode he added with ponderous condescension  the woman laughed softly as she held out her hand  are you going to pretend that you were deaf to forgive me and be friends mr chetwode she asked looking up at him one foggy day my husband took me to tooley street and i did not believe that anything good could come out of the yellow fog and the mud and the smells it was my ignorance you heard but you do not mind i am sure that you do not mind  not a bit in the world arnold answered still holding the hand which she seemed to have forgotten to draw away and smiling down into her upturned face i was awfully sorry to overhear but you see i couldnt very well help it could i  of course you could not help it she replied i am so glad that you came and i hope that we can make it pleasant for you i will try and send you in to dinner with some one very charming  she laughed at him understandingly as his lips parted and closed again without speech then she turned away to welcome some other guests who were at that moment announced arnold stood in the background for a few minutes presently she came back to him  do you know any one here she asked  no one he answered  she dropped her voice almost to a whisper arnold bent his head and listened with a curious pleasure to her little stream of words  it is a strange mixture of people whom you see here she said a mixture perhaps of the most prosaic and the most romantic the count sabatini whom you see talking to my husband is my brother he is a person who lives in the flood of adventures he has taken part in five wars he has been tried more than once for political offenses he has been banished from what is really our native country portugal with a price set upon his head he has an estate upon which nothing grows and a castle with holes in the roof in which no one could dwell yet he livesoh yes he lives  arnold looked across at the man of whom she was speakinggaunt and oliveskinned with deepset eyes and worn face he had still some share of his sisters good looks and he held himself as a man of his race should  i think i should like your brother arnold declared will he talk about his campaigns  perhaps she murmured although there is one about which you would not care to hear he fought with the boers but we will not speak of that mr and mrs horsman there i shall say nothing about imagine for yourself where they belong  they are your husbands friends he decided unhesitatingly  you are a young man of great perceptions she replied i am going to like you i am sure come there is mr starling standing by the door what do you think of him  arnold glanced across the room mr starling was apparently a middleaged mancleanshaven with pale cheeks and somewhat narrow eyes  an american without a doubt arnold remarked  quite right now the lady in the gray satin with the wonderful coiffureshe has looked at you already more than once her name is lady blennington and she is always trying to discover new young men  arnold glanced at her deliberately and back again at his hostess  there is nothing for me to say about her he declared  you are wonderful she murmured that is so exactly what one feels about lady blennington then there is lady templetonthat fluffy little thing behind my husband she looks rather as though she had come out of a toy shop does she not  she looks nice arnold admitted i knew  she glanced up at him and waited arnold however had stopped short  you have not yet told me he said the name of the man who stands alone near the doorthe one with the little piece of red ribbon in his coat  it seemed to him that for some reason the presence of that particular person affected her he was a plump little man sleek and welldressed with black hair very large pearl studs black moustache and imperial mrs weatherley stood quite still for a moment perhaps he thought she was listening to the conversation around them  the mans name is rosario she replied he is a financier and a man of fashion another time you must tell me what you think of him but i warn you that it will not be so easy as with those others for he is also a man of schemes i am sorry but i must send you in now with mrs horsman who is much too amiable to be anything else but dull you shall come with me and i will introduce you  dinner was announced almost at that moment arnold keen to enjoy with all the love of new places and the enthusiasm of youth in his veins found every moment of the meal delightful they took their places at a round table with shaded lights artistically arranged so that they seemed to be seated before a little oasis of flowers and perfumes in the midst of a land of shadows he found his companion pleasant and sympathetic she had a son about his age who was going soon into the city and about whom she talked incessantly on his left lady blennington made frank attempts to engage him in conversation whenever an opportunity arose arnold felt his spirits rise with every moment he laughed and talked the whole of the time devoting himself with very little intermission to one or the other of his two neighbors mr weatherley who was exceedingly uncomfortable and found it difficult even to remember his few staple openings looked across the table more than once in absolute wonder that this young man who earning a wage of twentyeight shillings a week and occupying almost the bottom stool in his office could yet be entirely and completely at his ease in this exalted company more than once arnold caught his hostesss eye and each time he felt for some unknown reason a little thrill of pleasure at the faint relaxing of her lips the glance of sympathy which shone across the roses life was a good place he thought to himself for these few hours at any rate and then as he leaned back in his place for a moment ruths words seemed suddenly traced with a finger of fire upon the dim wall tonight was to be a night of mysteries tonight the great adventure was to be born he glanced around the table there was indeed an air of mystery about some of these guests something curiously aloof something which it was impossible to put into words the man starling for instance seemed queerly placed here count sabatini was another of the guests who seemed somehow to be outside the little circle for minutes together he sat sometimes in grim silence about him too there was always a curious air of detachment rosario was making the small conversation with his neighbor which the occasion seemed to demand but he too appeared to talk as one who had more weighty matters troubling his brain it was a fancy of arnolds perhaps but it was a fancy of which he could not rid himself he glanced towards his employer and a curious feeling of sympathy stirred him the man was unhappy and ill at ease he had lost his air of slight pomposity the air with which he entered his offices in the morning strutted about the warehouse went out to lunch with a customer and which he somehow seemed to lose as the time came for returning to his home once or twice he glanced towards his wife half nervously half admiringly once she nodded back to him but it was the nod of one who gathers up her skirts as she throws alms to a beggar then arnold realized that his little fit of thoughtfulness had made a material difference to the hum of conversation he remembered his duty and leaned over toward lady blennington  you promised to tell me more about some of these people he reminded her i am driven to make guesses all the time why does mr starling look so much like an unwilling and impatient guest and where is the castle of the count sabatini which has no roof  lady blennington sighed  this table is much too small for us to indulge in scandal she replied it really is such a pity one so seldom meets any one worth talking to who doesnt know everything there is that shouldnt be known about everybody about count sabatini for instance i could tell you some most amusing things  his castle perhaps is in the air arnold inquired  by no means lady blennington assured him  on the contrary it is very much upon the rocks some little island near minorca i believe they say that mr weatherley was wrecked there and sabatini locked him up in a dungeon and refused to let him go until he promised to marry his sister  there are a good many men in the world i should think arnold murmured who would like to be locked up on similar conditions  she looked at him with a queer little smile  i suppose it is inevitable she declared you will have to go through it too she certainly is one of the loveliest women i ever saw i suppose you are already convinced that she is entirely adorable  she has been very kind to me arnold replied  she would be lady blennington remarked dryly look at her husband the poor man ought to have known better than to have married her of course but do you think that he looks even reasonably happy  arnold was beginning to feel rather uncomfortable he was conscious of a strong desire not to discuss his hostess yet his curiosity was immense he asked one question  tell me he said if she came from this little island in the mediterranean why does she speak english so perfectly  she was educated in england lady blennington told him afterwards her brother took her to south america she had some small fortune i believe but when she came back they were penniless they were really living as small market gardeners when mr weatherley found them  you dont like her he remarked i wonder why  lady blennington shook her head  one never knows she replied i admire her if that is anything  but you do not like her he persisted  she shrugged her shoulders slightly  i am afraid it is true she agreed  you admit that and yet you are willing to be her guest  she smiled at him approvingly  if there is one masculine quality which i do appreciate she said it is directness i come because i love bridge and because i love my fellowcreatures and because my own friends are none too numerous with the exception of those worthy friends of our host and his wife who are seated upon your rightmr and mrs horsman i believe they are calledwe are all of the same ilk mr starling no one knows anything about count sabatinis record is something awful  but there is rosario arnold protested  rosario goes into all the odd corners of the world she replied sometimes the corners are respectable and sometimes they are not it really doesnt matter so far as he is concerned supposing in return for all this information you tell me something about yourself  there isnt anything to tell arnold assured her i was asked here to fill up i am an employee of mr weatherleys  she turned in her chair to look at him her surprise was obvious  do you mean that you are his secretary or something of that sort she demanded  i am a clerk in his office arnold told her  she was evidently puzzled but she asked him no more questions at that moment mrs weatherley rose from her place as she passed arnold she paused for a moment  you are all coming in five minutes she said before we play bridge come straight to me i have something to say to you  he bowed and resumed his seat from which he had risen quickly at her coming mr weatherley motioned to him to move up to his side his face now was a little flushed but his nervousness had not disappeared he was certainly not the same man whom one met at tooley street  glad to see youve made friends with the wife chetwode he said she seems to have taken quite a fancy to you  mrs weatherley has been very kind arnold answered  enjoying yourself i hope mr weatherley asked  very much indeed arnold declared it has been quite a treat for me  sabatini and starling were talking earnestly together at the other side of the table rosario bringing his wine down came and sat at his hosts other side  beautiful vintage this mr weatherley he said excellent condition too  mr weatherley obviously pleased pursued the subject in a way it was almost pathetic to see his pleasure in being addressed by one of his own guests arnold drew a little away and looked across the banks of roses there was something fascinating to him in the unheard conversation of sabatini and starling on the opposite side of the table everything they said was in an undertone and the inexpressive faces of the two men gave no indication as to the nature of their conversation yet the sense of something mysterious in this house and among these guests was growing all the time with arnold     chapter iv  the face at the window   mr weatherley laid his hand upon his young companions arm as they crossed the hall on their way from the diningroom  we are going to play bridge in the musicroom he announced things are different nowadays than when i was a boy the men and the women too have to smoke cigarettes all the time while they play cards a bad habit chetwode a very bad habit indeed ive nothing to say against a good havana cigar in the diningroom or the smokingroom but this constant cigarette smoking sickens me i cant bear the smell of the things here we are i dont know what table my wife has put you at im sure she arranges all these things herself  several guests who had arrived during the last few minutes were already playing at various tables mrs weatherley was moving about directing the proceedings she came across to them as soon as they entered and laying her hand upon arnolds arm drew him on one side there was a smile still upon her lips but trouble in her eyes she looked over her shoulder a little nervously and arnold half unconsciously followed the direction of her gaze rosario was standing apart from the others talking earnestly with starling  i want you to stay with me if you please she said i am not sure where you will play but there is no hurry i myself shall not sit down at present there are others to arrive  her brother who had been talking languidly to lady blennington came slowly up to them  you andrea will wait for the baccarat of course she said i know that this sort of bridge does not amuse you  he answered her with a little shrug of the shoulders and leaning towards her spoke a few words in some tongue which arnold did not at once recognize she looked again over her shoulder at rosario and her face clouded she replied in the same tongue arnold would have moved away but she detained him  you must not mind she said softly that my brother and i talk sometimes in our native language you do not by chance know portuguese mr chetwode  not a word he replied  i am going to leave all these people to amuse themselves she continued dropping her voice slightly i want you to come with me for a moment mr chetwode you must take care that you do not slip these wooden floors are almost dangerous i did give a dance here once she continued as they made their way across the room talking a little vaguely and with an obvious effort i did not enjoy it at all to me the style of dancing in this country seems ungraceful look behind mr chetwode tell me is mr rosario following us  arnold glanced over his shoulder rosario was still standing in the same place but he was watching them intently  he is looking after us but he has not moved arnold announced  it is better for him that he stays there mrs weatherley said softly please come  at the further end of the apartment there was a bend to the left mrs weatherley led the way around the corner into a small recess out of sight of the remainder of the people here she paused and holding up her finger looked around her head was thrown back the trouble still gleamed in her eyes she listened intently to the hum of voices as though trying to distinguish those she knew satisfied apparently that their disappearance had not occasioned any comment she moved forward again motioned arnold to open a door and led him down a long passage to the front of the house here she opened the door of an apartment on the lefthand side of the hall and almost pushed him in she closed the door quickly behind them then she held up her finger  listen she said  they could hear nothing save the distant murmur of voices in the musicroom the room which they had entered was in complete darkness through which the ivory pallor of her arms and face and the soft fire of her eyes seemed to be the only things visible she was standing quite close to him he could hear her breathing he could almost fancy that he heard her heart beat a strand of hair even touched his cheek as she moved  i do not wish to turn the light up for a moment she whispered you do not mind  i mind nothing arnold answered bewildered are you afraid of anything is there anything i can do  a sense of excitement was stirring him  just do as i ask that is all she murmured i want to look outside a moment just do as i ask and keep quiet  she stole from him to the window and moving the curtain a few inches knelt down peering out she remained there motionless for a full minute then she rose to her feet and came back his eyes were becoming more accustomed to the gloom now and he could see the outline of her figure as she moved towards him  take my place there she whispered look down the drive tell me whether you can see any one watching the house  he went down on his knees at the place she indicated and peered through the parted curtain for a few seconds he could see nothing then as his eyes grew accustomed to the gloom he discerned two motionless figures standing on the lefthand side of the drive partly concealed by a tall laurel bush  i believe he declared hoarsely that there are two men standing there  tell me are they moving she demanded  they seem to be simply watching the house he replied  she was silent he could hear her breath come and go  they still do not move she asked after a few seconds  he shook his head and she turned away listening to some footsteps in the hall  remember she whispered i am standing where i can turn on the light in a moment if any one comes you are here to see my south american curios this is my own sittingroom you understand  i understand he assented whatever you tell me to say i will say  she seemed to be gathering courage she laughed very softly as though amused at his earnestness there was little enough of mirth in her laughter yet somehow it gave him heart  what do these men want he asked would you like me to go out and send them away  no she replied i do not wish you to leave me  but they are terrifying you he protested what right have they in your garden they are here perhaps as thieves  hush  she sprang away from him the room was suddenly flooded with light she was leaning with her arm upon the mantelpiece a statuette of black ivory in her hand  if you are really fond of this sort of thing she began you should come with me to the south kensington museum one daywho is that  the door had opened it was mr weatherley who appeared mr weatherley was distinctly fussy and there was some return of his pompous manner  my dear fenella he exclaimed what on earth are you doing in here with half your bridge tables as yet unarranged your guests are wondering what has become of you  has any one fresh turned up she asked setting down the statuette  a lady raynham has just arrived mr weatherley replied and is making herself very disagreeable because there is no one to tell her at which table she is to play i heard a young man who came with her too asking parkins what time supper was i do not wish to criticize the manners of your guests but really my dear fenella some of them do seem to have strange ideas  lady raynham she remarked coldly is a person who should be glad to find herself under any respectable roof without making complaints mr chetwode she continued turning to him it is my wish to finish showing you my treasures therefore will you wait here please for a short time while i go and start another bridge table i shall return quite soon come samuel  mr weatherley coughed he seemed unwilling to leave arnold behind  i dare say young chetwode would like a hand at bridge himself my dear he protested  mr chetwode shall have one later on she promised i think that very likely he will play at my table come  they left the room together she looked back for a moment before they disappeared and arnold felt his heart give a little jump she was certainly the most beautiful creature he had ever seen and there was something in her treatment of him the subtle flattery of her half appealing confidence which went to his head like wine the door closed and he was left alone he listened to their departing footsteps then he looked around him for the first time forming some idea of his surroundings he was in a very charming comfortablelooking apartment with deep easychairs a divan covered with luxurious cushions numbers of little tables covered with photographs and flowers a great bowl of hothouse roses and an oak cabinet with an oak background in the further corner of the room which was packed with curios after his first brief inspection however he felt scarcely any curiosity as to the contents of the room it was the window which drew him always towards it once more he peered through the chink of the curtains he had not cared to turn out the lights however and for several moments everything was indistinguishable then he saw that the two figures still remained in very nearly the same position except that they had drawn if anything a little closer to the house  a tiny clock upon the mantelpiece was ticking away the seconds arnold had no idea how long he remained there watching suddenly however he received a shock for some time he had fancied that one of the two figures had disappeared altogether and now outside on the windowsill scarcely a couple of feet from the glass through which he was looking a mans hand appeared and gripped the windowsill he stared at it fascinated it was so close to him that he could see the thin yellow fingers on one of which was a signet ring with a bloodred stone the misshapen knuckles the broken nails he was on the point of throwing up the window when a mans face shot up from underneath and peered into the room there was only the thickness of the glass between them and the light from the gas lamp which stood at the corner of the drive fell full upon the white strained features and the glittering black eyes which stared into the room the chink of the curtain through which arnold was gazing was barely an inch wide but it was sufficient for a moment he stared at the man then he threw the curtains open and stooped to unfasten the window it was the affair of a few seconds only to throw it up to his surprise the man did not move their faces almost touched  what the devil do you want arnold exclaimed gripping him by the arm  the man did not flinch he inclined his head towards the interior of the room  rosario the jew he answered thickly he is in the house there will you take him a message  ring at the door and bring it yourself arnold retorted  the man laughed contemptuously he stared at arnold for a moment and seemed to realize for the first time that he was a stranger  you are a fool to meddle in things you know nothing of he muttered  i know youve no right where you are said arnold and i shall keep you until some one comes  the intruder made a sudden dive freeing himself with an extraordinary turn of the wrist arnold caught a glimpse of his face as he slunk away while he hesitated whether to follow him he heard the door open and the soft rustle of a womans skirts  what are you doing out there mr chetwode  he turned around mrs weatherley was standing just behind him leaning also out of the window with a little halo of light about her head for a moment he was powerless to answer her head was thrown back her lips parted she seemed to be listening as well as watching there was fear in her eyes as she looked at him yet she made the most beautiful picture he had ever seen he pulled himself together  well she asked breathlessly  i was waiting here for you he explained i looked through the curtains then i saw a mans hand upon the sill     illustration i was waiting here for you he explained    page 39  her hand shot to her side  go on she whispered  i saw his face arnold continued it was pressed close to the window it was as though he meant to enter i threw the curtains back opened the window and gripped him by the arm i asked him what he wanted  she sat down in a chair and began to tremble  he said he wanted rosario the jew arnold went on then when he found that i was a stranger he got away i dont know how he managed it for my fingers are strong enough but he wrenched himself free somehow  look out once more she implored see if he is anywhere around i will speak to him  he stood at the window and looked in every direction  there is no one in sight he declared i will go to the corner of the street if you like  she shook her head  close the window and bolt it please she begged draw the curtains tight now come and sit down here for a moment  he did as he was bidden with some reluctance  the man was a villainouslooking creature he persisted i dont think that he was up to any good look theres a policeman almost opposite shall i go and tell him  she put out her hand and clasped his drawing him down to her side then she looked steadfastly into his face  mr chetwode she said slowly women have many disadvantages in life but they have had one gift bestowed upon them in which they trust always it is the gift of instinct you are very young and i know very little about you but i know that you are to be trusted  if i could serve you he murmured  you can she interrupted  then for a time she was silent some new emotion seemed to move her her face was softer than he had ever seen it her beautiful eyes dimmer his mind was filled with new thoughts of her  mrs weatherley he pleaded please do believe in me do trust me i mean absolutely what i say when i tell you there is nothing in the world i would not do to save you from trouble or alarm  her moment of weakness was over she flashed one wonderful smile at him and rose to her feet  it is agreed she declared when i need helpand it may be at any momenti shall call upon you  i shall be honored he assured her gravely in the meantime please tell meare we to speak of this to rosario  leave it to me she begged i cannot explain to you what all this means but i think that mr rosario can take care of himself we must go back now to the bridgeroom my husband is annoyed with me for coming away again  mr weatherley met them in the passage he was distinctly irritable  my dear fenella he exclaimed your guests do not understand your absence mr rosario is most annoyed and i cannot imagine what is the matter with starling i am afraid that he and rosario have had words  she turned her head as she passed and smiled very slightly  i have no concern she said in the quarrel between mr starling and mr rosario as for the othersmr chetwode and i are quite ready for bridge now we are going in to do our duty     chapter v  an unusual errand   arnold arrived at the office the next morning punctually at five minutes to nine and was already at work when mr jarvis appeared ten minutes later  gayetys not upset you then eh the latter remarked divesting himself of his hat and overcoat  not at all thanks arnold answered  nice house the governors isnt it  very nice indeed  good dinners he gives too continued mr jarvis slapup wines and the right sort of company must have been an eyeopener for you  arnold nodded he was not in the least anxious to discuss the events of the previous evening with mr jarvis the latter however came a little nearer to him he took off his goldrimmed spectacles and wiped them carefully  now i should like to know he said exactly how mrs weatherley struck you  she appeared to me to be a singularly charming and very beautiful lady arnold replied writing quickly  mr jarvis was disappointed  shes goodlooking enough he admitted i cant say that ive seen much of her mind you but she gave me the impression of a woman who wasnt above using the powderpuff she drove down here with the governor one day and to look at her youd have thought she was a princess come among the slums  she was born abroad arnold remarked i dare say this atmosphere would seem a little strange to her  sort of half a foreigner ive understood mr jarvis continued speaks english all right though i cant help thinking he went on that the governor would have done better to have married into one of our old city families nothing like them you know chetwode some fine women too theres godson the former lord mayor he had four daughters and the governor might have had his pick  here he comes arnold remarked quietly  mr jarvis took the hint and went off to his work a moment or two later mr weatherley arrived he passed through the office and bestowed upon every one his customary salutation at arnolds desk he paused for a moment  feeling all right this morning young man he inquired striving after a note of patronage which somehow or other eluded him  quite well thank you sir  you found the evening pleasant i hope didnt lose any money at bridge eh  mrs weatherley was good enough to take on the stakes sir arnold replied as a matter of fact i believe that we won i enjoyed the evening very much thank you  mr weatherley passed on to his office jarvis waited until his door was closed  so you played bridge with mrs weatherley eh he remarked  i did arnold admitted have you noticed the shrinkage of weight in these last invoices  mr jarvis accepted the papers which his junior passed him and departed into the warehouse arnold was left untroubled with any more questions at halfpast twelve however he was sent for into mr weatherleys private office mr weatherley was leaning back in his chair and he had the air of a man who has come to a resolution  shut the door chetwode he ordered  arnold did as he was bidden  come up to the desk here he was further instructed now listen to me mr weatherley continued after a moments pause you are a young man of discretion i am sure my wife i may say chetwode thought quite highly of you last night  arnold looked his employer in the face and felt a sudden pang of sympathy mr weatherley was certainly not looking as hale and prosperous as a few months ago his cheeks were flabby and there was a worried look about him which the head of the firm of weatherley  co should certainly not have worn  mrs weatherley is very kind sir he remarked as to my discretion i may say that i believe i am to be trusted i should try of course to justify any confidence you might place in me  i believe so too chetwode mr weatherley declared i am going to trust you now with a somewhat peculiar commission you may have noticed that i have been asked to speak privately upon the telephone several times this morning  certainly sir arnold replied it was i who put you through  i am not even sure mr weatherley continued who it was speaking but i received some communications which i think i ought to take notice of i want you accordingly to go to a certain restaurant in the westend the name and address of which i will give you order your lunch thereyou can have whatever you likeand wait until you see mr rosario i dare say you remember meeting mr rosario last night eh  certainly sir i remember him quite well  he will not be expecting you so you will have to sit near the door and watch for him directly you see him you must go to him and say that this message is from a friend tell him that whatever engagement he may have formed for luncheon he is to go at once to the princes grill room and remain there until two oclock he is not to lunch at the milanthat is the name of the place where you will be do you understand  i understand perfectly arnold assented but supposing he only laughs at me  you will have done your duty mr weatherley said there need be no mystery about the affair you can say at once that you are there as the result of certain telephone messages addressed to me this morning and that i should have come myself if it had been possible if he chooses to disregard them it is his affair entirelynot mine at the same time i think that he will go  it seems an odd sort of a thing to tell a perfect stranger sir arnold remarked  mr weatherley produced a fivepound note  you cant go into those sort of places without money in your pocket he continued you can account to me for the change later but dont spare yourself have as good a lunch as you can eat the restaurant is the milan grill room on the strandthe café mind not the main restaurant you know where it is  quite well sir thank you  mr weatherley looked at his employee curiously  have you ever been there then he inquired  once or twice sir arnold admitted  not on the twentyeight shillings a week you get from me  quite true sir arnold assented my circumstances were slightly different at the time  mr weatherley hesitated this young mans manner did not invite confidences on the other hand he was genuinely curious about him  what made you come into the city chetwode he inquired you dont seem altogether cut out for itnot that you dont do your work and all that sort of thing he went on hastily i havent a word of complaint to make mind all the same you certainly seem as though you might have done a little better for yourself  it is the fault of circumstances sir arnold replied i am hoping that before long you will find that i do my work well enough to give me a better position  you are ambitious then  the face of the young man was suddenly grim  i mean to get on he declared there were several years of my life when i used to imagine things i have quite finished with that i realize that there is only one way by means of which a man can count  mr weatherley nodded ponderously  well he said let me see that your work is well done and you may find promotion is almost as quick in the city as anywhere else you had better be off now  i trust arnold ventured as he turned toward the door that mrs weatherley is quite well this morning  so far as i know she is mr weatherley replied my wife isnt usually visible before luncheon time continental habits you know i shall expect you back by three oclock you must come and report to me then  arnold brushed his hat and coat with extra care as he took them down from the peg  going to lunch early arent you mr jarvis remarked looking at the clock not sure that we can spare you yet smithers isnt back  i am going out for the governor arnold replied  what to the bank mr jarvis asked  arnold affected not to hear he walked out into the street lit a cigarette and had his boots carefully polished at london bridge station then as he had plenty of time he took the train to charing cross and walked blithely down the strand freed from the routine of his office work he found his mind once more full of the events of last night there was so much that he could not understand yet there was so much that seemed to be leading him on towards the land of adventures he found himself watching the faces in the strand with a new interest and he laughed to himself as he realized what it was he was looking all the time for the man whose face he had seen pressed to the windowpane     chapter vi  the gleam of steel   at the milan arnold found himself early for luncheon he chose a table quite close to the entrance ordered his luncheon with some care and commenced his watch a thin stream of people was all the time arriving but for the first halfhour there was no one whom he could associate in any way with his commission it was not until he had actually commenced his lunch that anything happened then through the halfopen door he heard what he recognized instantly as a familiar voice the manager of the restaurant hurried toward the entrance and he heard the question repeated  is mr rosario here  we have a table for him madame but he has not yet arrived the maître dhôtel replied if madame will allow me to show her the way  arnold rose to his feet with a little start notwithstanding her fashionable outdoor clothes and thick veil he recognized mrs weatherley at once as she swept into the room following the maître dhôtel she came up to him with slightly upraised eyebrows it was clear that his presence there was a surprise to her  i scarcely expected to see you again so soon she remarked giving him her fingers are you lunching alone  quite alone arnold answered  she glanced half carelessly around as though to see whether she recognized any acquaintances arnold however was convinced that she was simply anxious not to be overheard  tell me she inquired has my husband sent you here  arnold admitted the fact  i have a message he replied  for mr rosario  for mr rosario  you have not seen anything of him yet then she asked quickly  he has not been here arnold assured her i have kept my eyes glued upon the door  tell me the message quickly she begged  arnold did not hesitate mr weatherley was his employer but this woman was his employers wife if there were secrets between them it was not his concern it seemed natural enough that she should ask it was certainly not his place to refuse to answer her question  i was to tell him that on no account was he to lunch here today arnold said he was to go instead to the grill room at princes in piccadilly and remain there until two oclock  mrs weatherley made no remark her face was emotionless closely though he was watching her arnold could not himself have declared at that moment whether indeed this message had any import to her or not  i find my husbands behavior exceedingly mysterious she said thoughtfully i cannot imagine how he became concerned in the matter at all  i believe arnold told her that some one telephoned mr weatherley this morning he was asked for privately several times and he seemed very much disturbed by some message he received  some one telephoned him she repeated frowning now i wonder who that person could be  she sat quite still for a moment or two looking through the glasspaneled door then she shrugged her shoulders  in any case she declared i am here to lunch and i am hungry i will not wait for mr rosario may i sit here  he called a waiter and the extra place was very soon prepared  if mr rosario comes she said we can see him from here you can then give him your message and he can please himself i should like some omelette aux champignons please and some red winenothing more perhaps i will take some fruit later and now please mr arnold chetwode will you listen to me  she undid her ermine cloak and laid aside her muff the collection of costly trifles which she had been carrying she threw carelessly upon the table  last night she continued softly we agreed did we not to be friends it is possible you may find our friendship one of deeds not words alone  there is nothing i ask for more sincerely he declared  to begin with then she went on i do not wish that you call me mrs weatherley the name annoys me it reminds me of things which at times it is a joy to me to forget you shall call me fenella and i shall call you arnold  fenella he repeated half to himself  she nodded  well then that is arranged now for the first thing i have to ask of you if mr rosario comes i do not wish that message from my husband to be delivered  arnold frowned slightly  isnt that a little difficult he protested mr weatherley has sent me up here for no other reason he has given me an exact commission has told me even the words i am to use what excuse can i possibly make  she smiled  you shall be relieved of all responsibility she declared if i tell my husband that i do not wish you to obey his bidding that will be sufficient it is a matter of which my husband understands little there are people whose interest it is to protect rosario it is they who have spoken without a doubt this morning through the telephone but my husband does not understand rosario must take care of himself he runs his own risks he is a man and he knows very well what he is doing  arnold looked at her thoughtfully  do you seriously suppose then he asked that the object of my message is to bid mr rosario keep away from here because of some actual danger  why not mr rosario has chosen to interfere in a very difficult and dangerous matter he runs his own risks and he asks for a big reward it is not our place to protect him  she raised her veil and he looked at her closely she was still as beautiful as he had thought her last night but her complexion was pallid almost to fragility and there were faint violet lines under her eyes  you have not slept he said it was the fear of last night  i slept badly she admitted but that passes this afternoon i shall rest  i cannot help thinking he went on about those men who watched the house last night they could have been after no good i wish you would let me go to the policestation or would you like me to come and watch myself tonight or tomorrow night to see if they come again  she shook her head firmly  no she decided it wouldnt do any good just now at any rate it is rosario they want  their conversation was interrupted for several moments while she exchanged greetings with friends passing in and out of the restaurant then she turned again to her companion  tell me she asked a little abruptly why are you a clerk in the city you do not come of that order of people  necessity he assured her promptly i hadnt a sovereign in the world when your husband engaged me  you were not brought up for such a life  not altogether he admitted it suits me very well though  poor boy she murmured you too have had evil fortune perhaps the black hand has shadowed us both  a man makes his own life he answered impulsively but youyou were made for happiness it is your right  she glanced for a moment at the rings upon her fingers then she looked into his eyes  i married mr weatherley she reminded him do you think that if i had been happy i should have done that do you think that having done it i deserve to know or could know what happiness really means  it was very hard to answer her arnold found himself divided between his loyalty towards the man who in his way had been kind to him and the woman who seemed to be stepping with such fascinating ease into the empty places of his life  mr weatherley is very much devoted to you he remarked  a shadow of derision parted her lips  mr weatherley is a very worthy man she said but it would have been better for him as well as for me if he had kept away from the island of sabatini tell me what did lady blennington say about us last night  his eyes twinkled  she told me that mr weatherley was wrecked upon the island of sabatini and that your brother kept him in a dungeon till he promised to marry you  she laughed  and you what did you think of that  i thought he replied that if adventures of that sort were to be found in those seas i would like to beg or borrow the money to sail there myself and steer for the rocks  for a boy she declared you say very charming things tell me how old are you  twentyfour  you would not look so old if it were not for that line you know i read characters and fortunes all the women of my race have done so i can tell you that you had a youth of ease and happiness and one year of terrible life then you started again it is true is it not  very nearly he admitted  i wonder  she never finished her sentence from their table which was nearest to the door they were suddenly aware of a commotion of some sort going on just outside through the glass door rosario was plainly visible his sleekness ruffled his white face distorted with terror the hand of some unseen person was gripping him by the throat bearing him backwards there was a shout and they both saw the cloakroom attendant spring over his counter something glittered in the dim lighta flash of blue polished steel there was a gleam in the air a horrible cry and rosario collapsed upon the floor arnold who was already on his feet and halfway to the door caught one glimpse of the upstretched hand and all his senses were thrilled with what he saw upon the little finger was a signet ring with a scarlet stone  the whole affair was a matter of seconds yet arnold dashed through the door to find rosario a crumpledup heap the cloakroom attendant bending over him and no one else in the vestibule then the people began to stream inthe hall porter the lift man some loiterers from the outer hall the cloakroom attendant sprang to his feet he seemed dazed  stop him he shouted stop him  the little group in the doorway looked at one another  he went that way the cloakroom attendant cried out again he passed through that door  some of them rushed into the street one man hurried to the telephone the others pressed forward to where rosario lay on his back with a thin stream of blood finding its way through his waistcoat arnold was suddenly conscious of a womans arm upon his and a hoarse whisper in his ear  come back take me away somewhere quickly this is no affair of ours i want to think take me away please i cant look at him  did you see the mans hand arnold gasped  what of it  it was the hand i saw upon your windowsill last night it was the same ringa scarlet signet ring i could swear to it  she gave a little moan and her whole weight lay upon his arm in the rush of people and the clamor of voices around they were almost unobserved he passed his arm around her and even in that moment of wild excitement he was conscious of a nameless joy which seemed to set his heart leaping he led her back through the restaurant and into one of the smaller rooms of the hotel he found her an easychair and stood over her  you wont leave me she begged  he held her hand tightly  not until you send me away     chapter vii  rosario is dead   fenella never became absolutely unconscious she was for some time in a state apparently of intense nervous prostration her breath was coming quickly her eyes and her fingers seemed to be clinging to his as though for support her touch her intimate presence her reliance upon him seemed to arnold to infect the very atmosphere of the place with a thrill of the strangest excitement  you think that he is dead she faltered once  of course not he replied reassuringly i saw no weapon at all it was just a quarrel  she half closed her eyes  there was blood upon his waistcoat she declared and i saw something flash through the window  i will go and see if you like arnold suggested  her fingers gripped his  not yet dont leave me yet why did you say that you recognized the handthat it was the same hand you saw upon the windowsill last night  because of the signet ring arnold answered promptly it was a crudelooking affair but the stone was bright scarlet it was impossible to mistake it  it was only the ring then  only the ring of course he admitted i did not see the hand close enough it was foolish of me perhaps to say anything about it and yetand yet the man last nighthe was looking for rosario why should it not be the same  he heard the breath come through her teeth in a little sob  dont say anything at present to any one else indeed there are others who might have worn such a ring  arnold hesitated but only for a second he chanced to look into her face and her whisper became his command  very well he promised  a few moments later she sat up she was evidently becoming stronger  now go she begged and seehow he is find out exactly what has happened and come back i shall wait for you here  he stood up eagerly  you are sure that you will be all right  of course she replied indeed i shall be better when i know what really has happened you must go quickly please and come back quickly stop  arnold who had already started turned back again they were in a ladies small reception room at the head of the stairs leading down into the restaurant quite alone for every one had streamed across the courtyard to see what the disturbance was the side of the room adjoining the stairs and the broad passage leading to the restaurant was entirely of glass a man on his way up the stairs had paused and was looking intently at them  tell me who is that demanded fenella  arnold recognized him at once  it is your friend starlingthe man from south america  starling she murmured  i think that he is coming in arnold continued he has seen you do you mind  she shook her head  no he will stay with me while you are away perhaps he knows something  arnold hurried off and met starling upon the threshold of the room  isnt that mrs weatherley with you the latter inquired  yes arnold told him she was lunching with me in the grill room i believe that she was really waiting for rosariowhen the affair happened  what affair  arnold stared at him it seemed impossible that there was any one ignorant of the tragedy  havent you heard arnold exclaimed rosario was stabbed outside the grill room a few moments ago  starlings pallid complexion seemed suddenly to become ghastly  rosariorosario stabbed he faltered  i thought that every one in the place must have heard of it arnold continued he was stabbed just as he was entering the café not more than ten minutes ago  by whom  starlings words came with the swift crispness of a pistol shot arnold shook his head  i didnt see i am just going to ask for particulars will you stay with mrs weatherley  starling looked searchingly along the vestibule the news seemed to have affected him strangely his head was thrown a little back his nostrils distended he reminded arnold for a moment of a watchdog listening  of course he muttered of course come back as soon as you can and let us know what has happened  arnold made his way through the reception hall and across the courtyard already the crowd of people was melting away a policeman stood on guard at the opposite door and two more at the entrance of the café the whole of the vestibule where the affair had happened was closed and the only information which it was possible to collect arnold gathered from the excited conversations of the little knots of people standing around in a few minutes he returned to the small reception room fenella and starling looked eagerly up as he entered they both showed signs of an intense emotion starling was even gripping the back of a chair as he spoke  what of rosario he demanded  arnold hesitated but only for a moment the truth perhaps was best  rosario is dead he replied gravely he was stabbed to the heart and died within a few seconds  there was a queer silence arnold felt inclined to rub his eyes gone was at least part of the horror from their white faces fenella sank back in her chair with a little sob which might almost have been of relief starling as though suddenly mindful of the conventions assumed a grimly dolorous aspect  poor fellow he muttered and the murderer  hes gotten clean off for the present at any rate arnold told them they seem to think that he reached the strand and had a motor car waiting  again there was silence then mrs weatherley rose to her feet glanced for a moment in the lookingglass and turning round held out both her hands to arnold  you have been so kind to me she said softly i shall not forget itindeed i shall not mr starling is going to take me home in his car goodbye  arnold held her hands steadfastly and looked into her eyes they were more beautiful than ever now with their mist of risen tears but there were other things in her face things less easy to understand he turned away regretfully  i am sorry that you should have had such a shock he said is there any message for mr weatherley  she exchanged a quick glance with her companion then for the first time arnold realized the significance of the errand on which he had come  some one must have warned mr weatherley of what was likely to happen he exclaimed it was for that reason i was sent here  again no one spoke for several seconds  it was not your fault she said gently you were told to wait inside the restaurant you could not have done more  arnold turned away with a little shiver his mission had been to save a mans life and he had failed     chapter viii  the duties of a secretary   it was twenty minutes to four before arnold reached the office mr jarvis looked at him curiously as he took off his hat and hung it up  i dont know what youve been up to young man he remarked but youll find the governor in a queer state of mind for the last hour hes been ringing his bell every five minutes asking for you  i was detained arnold answered shortly is he alone now  mr jarvis nodded  i think that you had better go in at once he advised there he is stamping about inside i hope youve got some good excuse or therell be the dickens to pay  the door of the inner office was suddenly opened mr weatherley appeared upon the threshold he recognized arnold with an expression partly of anger partly of relief  so here you are at last young man he exclaimed where the dickens have you been to all this while come income in at once do you see the time  i am very sorry indeed sir arnold replied i can assure you that i have not wasted a moment that i know of  then what in the name of goodness did you find to keep you occupied all this time mr weatherley demanded pushing him through into the office and closing the door behind them did you see mr rosario did you give him the message  i had no opportunity sir arnold answered gravely  no opportunity what do you mean didnt he come to the milan didnt you see him at all  he came sir arnold admitted but i was not able to see him in time i thought perhaps he added that you might have heard what happened  mr weatherley had reached the limits of his patience he struck the table with his clenched fist for a moment anger triumphed over his state of nervous excitability  heard he cried heard what what the devil should i hear down here if youve anything to tell why dont you tell it me why do you stand there looking like a  mr weatherley was suddenly frightened he understood from arnolds expression that something serious had happened  my god he exclaimed mrs weatherleymy wife  mrs weatherley is quite well arnold assured him quickly it is mr rosario  what of him what about rosario  he is dead arnold announced you will read all about it in the evening papers he was murderedjust as he was on the point of entering the milan grill room  mr weatherley began to shake he looked like a man on the verge of a collapse he was still however able to ask a question  by whom  the murderer was not caught arnold told him no one seems to have seen him clearly it all took place so quickly he stole out of some corner where he must have been hiding and he was gone before anyone had time to realize what was happening  mr weatherley had been standing up all this time clutching nervously at his desk he suddenly collapsed into his easychair his face was gray his mouth twitched as though he were about to have a stroke  my god he murmured rosario dead they had him after all theykilled him  it was a great shock to every one arnold went on mrs weatherley arrived about a quarter of an hour before it occurred i understood that she was expecting to lunch with him but when i told her why i was there she came and sat at my table she was sitting there when it happened she was very much upset indeed i was detained looking after her  mr weatherley looked at him narrowly  i am sorry that she was there he said she is not strong she ought not to be subjected to such shocks  i left her with mr starling arnold continued he was going to take her home  was starling lunching there mr weatherley asked  we saw him afterwards coming up from the restaurant arnold replied he did not seem to have been in the grill room at all  mr weatherley sat back in his chair and for several minutes he remained silent his eyes were fixed upon vacancy his lips moved once or twice but he said nothing he seemed indeed to have lost the power of speech  it is extraordinary how the affair could have happened almost unnoticed in such a crowded place arnold went on feeling somehow that it was best for him to talk there is nearly always a little stream of people coming in or a telephone boy or some one passing but it happened that mr rosario came in alone he had just handed his silk hat to the cloakroom attendant who had turned away with it when the man who killed him slipped out from somewhere caught him by the throat and it was all over in a few seconds the murderer seems to have kept his face entirely hidden they do not appear to have found a single person who could identify him i had a table quite close to the door as you told me and i really saw the blow struck we rushed outside but though i dont believe we were more than a few seconds there wasnt a soul in sight  the police will find out something mr weatherley muttered they are sure to find out something  some people think arnold continued that the man never left the hotel or if he did that he was taken away in a motor car the whole hotel was being searched very carefully when i left  there was a knock at the door mr jarvis who had been unable to restrain his curiosity any longer brought some letters in for signature  if you can spare a moment sir he began apologetically there is this little matter of bland  companys order i have brought the reports with me  mr weatherley felt his feet upon the ground again he turned to the papers which his clerk laid before him and gave them his close attention when arnold would have left the room however he signed impatiently to him to remain as soon as he had given his instructions and mr jarvis had left the room he turned once more to arnold  chetwode he said looking at him critically you appear to me to be a young man of athletic build  arnold was quite speechless  i mean that you could hold your own in a tussle eh you look strong enough to knock any one down who attempted to take liberties with you  arnold smiled  i dare say i might manage that sir he admitted  very wellvery well then mr weatherley repeated have your desk moved in here at once chetwode you can have it placed just where you like youll get the light from that window if you have the easychair moved and put in the corner there against the wall understand that from now on you are my private secretary and you do not leave this room whoever may come in to see me except by my special instructions you understand that eh  perfectly sir  your business is to protect me in case of anything happeningof any disagreeable visitors or anything of that sort mr weatherley declared this affair of mr rosario has made me nervous there is a very dangerous gang of people about who try to get money from rich men and if they dont succeed use violence i have already come into contact with something of the sort myself your salarywhat do you get at present  twentyeight shillings a week sir  double it mr weatherley ordered promptly three pounds a week i will make it for three pounds a week i may rely upon your constant and zealous service  you may rely absolutely on that arnold replied not quite sure whether he was on his head or his feet  very well then go and tell some of the porters to bring in your desk have it brought in this very moment understand if you please that it is my wish not to be left alone under any circumstancesthat is quite clear isnt itnot under any circumstances i have heard some most disquieting stories about blackmailers and that sort of people  i dont think you need fear anything of the sort here arnold assured him  i trust not mr weatherley asserted but i prefer to be on the right side as regards firearms he continued i have never carried them nor am i accustomed to handling them at the same time  i wouldnt bother about firearms if i were you sir arnold interrupted i can promise you that while i am in this office no one will touch you or harm you in any way i would rather rely upon my fists any day  mr weatherley nodded  i am glad to hear you say so a strong young man like you need have no fear of course you understand chetwode not a word in the outer office  certainly not sir arnold promised you can rely entirely upon my discretion you will perhaps tell mr jarvis that i am to do my work in here fortunately i know a little shorthand so if you like i can take the letters down it will make my presence seem more reasonable  mr weatherley leaned back in his chair and lit a cigar he was recovering slowly  a very good idea chetwode he said i will certainly inform mr jarvis poor rosario he went on thoughtfully and to think that he might have been warned if only i had told you to wait outside the restaurant  do you know who it was who telephoned to you sir arnold asked  no ideano idea at all mr weatherley declared some one rang up and told me that mr rosario was engaged to lunch in the grill room with my wife i dont know who it wasdidnt recognize the voice from adambut the person went on to say that it would be a very great service indeed to mr rosario if some one could stop him from lunching there today cant think why they telephoned to me  if mr rosario were lunching with your wife arnold pointed out it would be perfectly easy for her to get him to go somewhere else if she knew of the message whereas he might have refused an ordinary warning  you havent heard the motive even hinted at i suppose mr weatherley asked  not as yet arnold replied that may all come out at the inquest  to be sure mr weatherley admitted at the inquestyes yes poor rosario  he watched the smoke from his cigar curl up to the ceiling then he turned to some papers on his table  get your desk in chetwode he ordered and then take down some letters the american mail goes early this afternoon     chapter ix  a strained conversation   arnold swung around the corner of the terrace that evening with footsteps still eager notwithstanding his long walk the splendid egoism of youth had already triumphed the tragedy of the day had become a dim thing he himself was moving forward and onward he glanced up at the familiar window feeling a slight impulse of disappointment when he received no welcoming wave of the hand it was the first time for weeks that ruth had not been there he climbed the five flights of stone stairs still buoyant and lighthearted glancing into his own room he found it empty then crossed at once the passageway and knocked at ruths door she was lying back in her chair with her back toward the window  why ruth he exclaimed how dare you desert your post  he felt at once that there was something strange in her reception of him she stopped him as he came across the room holding out both her hands her wan face was strained as she gazed and gazed something of the beautiful softness of her features had passed for the moment she was so anxious so terrified lest she should misread what was written in his face  arnold she murmured oh arnold  he was a little startled it was as though tragedy had been let loose in the room  why do you look at me like that dear he cried is there anything so terrible to tell me what have i done  god knows she answered dont come any nearer for a moment i want to look at you  she was leaning out from her chair it was true indeed that at that moment some sort of fear had drained all the beauty from her face though her eyes shone still like fierce stars  you have gone arnold she moaned you have slipped away you are lost to me  you foolish person he exclaimed stepping towards her never in my life never  she laid her hand upon the stick which leaned against her chair  not yet she implored dont come to me yet stay there where i can see your face now tell metell me everything  he laughed not altogether easily with a note half of resentment half of protest  dear ruth he pleaded what have i done to deserve this nothing has happened to me that i will not tell you about you have been sitting here alone fancying things and i have newsgreat news wait till you hear it  go on she said simply tell me everything begin at last night  he drew a little breath it was after all a hard task this that lay before him last night in his mind lay far enough back now a tangled web of disconnected episodes linked together by a strangely sweet emotional thread of sentiment and the girl was watching his face with every sense strained to catch his words and the meaning of them vaguely he felt his danger even from the first  well i got there in plenty of time he began it was a beautiful house beautifully furnished and arranged the people were queer not at all the sort i expected most of them seemed half foreign they were all very hard to place for such a respectable household as mr weatherleys should be  they were not really then mr weatherleys friends she asked quietly  as a matter of fact they were not he admitted that may have had something to do with it mrs weatherley was a foreigner she came from a little island somewhere in the mediterranean and is half portuguese most of the people were there apparently by her invitation after dinnersuch a dinner ruthwe played bridge more people came then i think there were eight tables altogether after i left most of them stayed on to play baccarat  her eyes still held his her expression was unchanged  tell me about mrs weatherley she murmured  she is the most beautiful woman i have ever seen she is pale and she has strange brown eyes not really brown but lighter i couldnt tell you the color for ive never seen anything else like it and she has real redbrown hair and she is slim and she walks like one of these women one reads about they say that she is a comtesse in her own right but that she never uses the title  and was she kind asked ruth  very kind indeed she talked to me quite a good deal and i played bridge at her table it seems the most amazing thing in the world that she should ever have married a man like samuel weatherley  now tell me the rest she persisted something else has happenedi am sure of it  he dropped his voice a little the terror was coming into the room  there was a man there named rosarioa portuguese jew and a very wealthy financier one reads about him always in the papers i have heard of him many times he negotiates loans for foreign governments and has a bank of his own i left him there last night playing baccarat this morning mr weatherley called me into his office and sent me up to the milan restaurant with a strange message i was to find mr rosario and to see that he did not lunch thereto send him away somewhere else in fact i didnt understand it but of course i went  and what happened she demanded  he held his breath for a moment  i was to take a table just inside the restaurant he explained and to tell him directly he entered i did exactly as i was told but it was too late rosario was stabbed as he was on the point of entering the restaurant within a few yards of where i was sitting  she shivered a little although her general expression was still unchanged  you mean that he was murdered  he was killed upon the spot arnold declared  by whom  he shook his head  no one knows the man got away i bought an evening paper as i came along and i see they havent arrested any one yet  was there a quarrel she asked  nothing of the sort he replied the other man seemed simply to have run out from somewhere and stabbed him with one thrust i saw it all but i was powerless to interfere  you saw the man who did it she asked  only his arm arnold answered he kept his body twisted around somehow it was a blackguardly thing to do  it was horrible she murmured  there was an interruption the piece of tattered curtain which concealed the portion of the room given over to isaac and which led beyond to his sleeping chamber was flung on one side isaac himself stood there his black eyes alight with anger  liar he exclaimed liars both of you  they looked at him without speech his interruption was so sudden so unexpected the girl had forgotten his presence in the room arnold had never been conscious of it  i tell you that rosario was a robber of mankind isaac cried he was one of those who feed upon the bones of the poor his place was in hell and into hell he has gone honor to the hand which started him on his journey  you go too far isaac arnold protested i never heard any particular harm of the man except that he was immensely wealthy  isaac stretched out his thin hand his bony forefinger pointed menacingly towards arnold  you fool he cried you brainless creature of brawn and muscle you have heard no harm of him save that he was immensely wealthy listen bear that sentence in your mind and listen to me listen while i tell you a story a party of travelers was crossing the desert they lost their way one man only had water heaps of water there was enough in his possession for all enough and to spare the sun beat upon their heads their throats were parched their lips were black they foamed at the mouth on their knees they begged and prayed for water he took not even the trouble to reply he kept himself cool and refreshed with his endless supply he poured it upon his head he bathed his lips and drank so he passed on and the people around died cursing him last of all one who had seen his wife sob out her last breath in his arms more terrible still had heard his little child shriek with agony clutch at him and pray for waterhe saw the truth and what power there is above so guided his arm that he struck the man paid the just price for his colossal greed the vultures plucked his heart out in the desert so died rosario  arnold shook his head  the cases are not similar isaac he declared  you lie isaac shrieked there is not a hairsbreadth of difference rosario earned his wealth in an office hung with costly pictures he earned it lounging in ease in a padded chair earned it by the monkey tricks of a dishonest brain never an honest days work did he perform in his life never a day did he stand in the marketplace where the weaker were falling day by day in fat comfort he lived and he died fittingly on the portals of a restaurant the cost of one meal at which would have fed a dozen starving children pity rosario pity his soul if you will but not his dirty body  the man is dead arnold muttered  dead and let him rot isaac cried fiercely there may be others  he caught up his cloth cap and without another word left the room arnold looked after him curiously more than a little impressed by the mans passionate earnestness ruth on the other hand was unmoved  isaac is isaac she murmured he sees life like that he would wear the flesh off his bones preaching against wealth it is as though there were some fire inside which consumed him all the time when he comes back he will be calmer  but arnold remained uneasy isaacs words and his attitude of pentup fury had made a singular impression upon him for those few moments the hyde park demagogue with his frothy vaporings existed no longer it seemed to arnold as though a flash of the real fire had suddenly blazed into the room  if isaac goes about the world like that trouble will come of it he said thoughtfully have you ever heard him speak of rosario before  never she answered i have heard him talk like that though often to me it sounds like the waves beating upon the shores they may rage as furiously or ripple as softly as the tides can bring themit makes no difference  i want you to go on please i want you to finish telling meyour news  arnold looked away from the closed door he looked back again into the girls face there was still that appearance of strained attention about her mouth and eyes  you are right he admitted these things after all are terrible enough but they are like the edge of a storm from which one has found shelter isaac ought to realize it  tell me what this is which has happened to you she begged  he shook himself free from that cloud of memories he gave himself up instead to the joy of telling her his good news  listen then he said mr weatherley in consideration not altogether i am afraid of my clerklike abilities but of my shoulders and muscle has appointed me his private secretary with a seat in his office and a salary of three pounds a week think of it ruth three pounds a week  a smile lightened her face for a moment as she squeezed his fingers  but why she asked what do you mean about your shoulders and your muscle  it is all very mysterious he declared but do you know i believe mr weatherley is afraid he shook like a leaf when i told him of the murder of rosario i believe he thinks that there was some sort of blackmailing plot and he is afraid that something of the kind might happen to him my instructions are never to leave his office especially if he is visited by any strangers  it sounds absurd she remarked i should have thought that of all the commonplace unimaginative people you have ever described to me mr weatherley was supreme  and i arnold agreed and so in a way he is it is his marriage which seems to have transformed himi feel sure of that he is mixing now with people whose manners and ways of thinking are entirely strange to him he has had the world he knew of kicked from beneath his feet and is hanging on instead to the fringe of another of which he knows very little  ruth was silent all the time arnold was conscious that she was watching him he turned his head her mouth was once more set and strained a delicate streak of scarlet upon the pallor of her face but from the fierce questioning of her eyes there was no escape  what is it you want to know that i have not told you ruth he asked  tell me what happened to you last night  he laughed boisterously but with a flagrant note of insincerity  havent i been telling you all the time  youve kept something back she panted gripping his fingers frantically the greatest thing speak about it anything is better than this silence dont you remember your promise before you wentyou would tell me everythingeverything well  her words pierced the armor of his own selfdeceit the bare room seemed suddenly full of glowing images of fenella his face was transfigured  i havent told you very much about mrs weatherley he said simply she is very wonderful and very beautiful she was very kind to me too  ruth leaned forward in her chair her eyes read what she strove yet hated to see she threw herself suddenly back covering her face with her hands the strain was over she began to weep     chapter x  an unexpected visitor   mr weatherley laid down his newspaper with a grunt he was alone in his private office with his newly appointed secretary  two whole days gone already and theyve never caught that fellow he exclaimed they dont seem to have a clue even  arnold looked up from some papers upon which he was engaged  we cant be absolutely sure of that sir he reminded his employer they wouldnt give everything away to the press  mr weatherley threw the newspaper which he had been reading onto the floor and struck the table with his fist  the whole affair he declared is scandalousperfectly scandalous the police system of this country is ridiculously inadequate scotland yard ought to be thoroughly overhauled some one should take the matter upone of the hapenny papers on the lookout for a sensation might manage it just see here what happens he went on earnestly a man is murdered in cold blood in a fashionable restaurant the murderer simply walks out of the place into the street and no one hears of him again he cant have been swallowed up can he you were there chetwode what do you think of it  arnold who had been thinking of little else for the last few days shook his head  i dont know what to think sir he admitted except that the murderer up till now has been extraordinarily lucky  either that or he was fiendishly clever mr weatherley agreed pulling nervously at his little patch of gray sidewhiskers i wonder nowyouve read the case chetwode  every word of it arnold admitted  have you formed any idea yourself as to the motive mr weatherley asked nervously  arnold shook his head  at present there seems nothing to go on sir he remarked i did hear it said that some one was trying to blackmail him and mr rosario wasnt having any  mr weatherley pushed his scant hair back with his hand he appeared to feel the heat of the office  youve heard that too eh he muttered it occurred to me from the first chetwode it certainly did occur to me you will remember that i mentioned it  what did your brotherinlaw think of it sir arnold asked he and mr rosario seemed to be very great friends they were talking together for a long time that night at your house  mr weatherley jumped to his feet and threw open the window the air which entered the office from the murky street was none of the best but he seemed to find it welcome arnold was shocked to see his face when he turned around  the count sabatini is a very extraordinary man mr weatherley confessed he and his friends come to my house but to tell you the truth i dont know much about them mrs weatherley wishes to have them there and that is quite enough for me all the same i dont feel that theyre exactly the sort of people ive been used to chetwode and thats a fact  mr weatherley had resumed his seat he was leaning back in his chair now his hands drooping to his side looking precisely what he wasan ungraceful commonplace little person without taste or culture upon whom even a good tailor seemed to have wasted his efforts a certain pomposity which in a way became the manproclaimed his prosperity and redeemed him from complete insignificancehad for a moment departed he was like a pricked bladder arnold could scarcely help feeling sorry for him  i shouldnt allow these things to worry me if i were you sir arnold suggested respectfully if there is anything which you dont understand i should ask for an explanation mrs weatherley is much too kind and generous to wish you to be worried i am sure  then the side of the man with which arnold wholly sympathized showed itself suddenly at the mention of his wifes name an expression partly fatuous partly beatific transformed his homely features he was looking at her picture which stood always opposite him he had the air of an adoring devotee before some sacred shrine  you are quite right chetwode he declared quite right but i am always very careful not to let my wife know how i feel you see the count sabatini is her only relative and before our marriage they were inseparable he was an exile from portugal and it seems to me these foreigners hang on together more than we do i am only too glad for her to be with him as much as she chooses it is just a little unfortunate that his friends should sometimes bewell a trifle distasteful butone must put up with it one must put up with it eh after all rosario was a man very well spoken of there was no reason why he shouldnt have come to my house plenty of other men in my position would have been glad to have entertained him  certainly sir agreed arnold i believe he went a great deal into society  and no doubt mr weatherley continued eagerly he had many enemies in the course of his commercial career which i believe was an eventful one he would naturally make enemies by the bye chetwode speaking of blackmailthat blackmail rumor eh you dont happen to have heard any particulars  none at all sir replied arnold i dont suppose anything is really known it seems a probable solution of the affair though  mr weatherley nodded thoughtfully  it does he admitted i can quite imagine any one trying it on and rosario defying him just the course which would commend itself to such a man  the proper course no doubt arnold remarked although it scarcely turned out the best for poor mr rosario  mr weatherley distinctly shivered  well well he declared you had better take out those invoices and ask jarvis to see me at once about budden  williams account god bless my soul alive why heres mrs weatherley  a car had stopped outside and both men had caught a vision of a furclad feminine figure crossing the pavement mr weatherleys fingers busy already with his tie were trembling with excitement his whole appearance was transformed  hurry out and meet her chetwode he exclaimed show her the way in this is the first time in her life she has been here of her own accord just as we were speaking about her too  fenella entered the office as a princess shod in satin might enter a pigsty her erminetrimmed gown was raised with both her hands her delightful nose had a distinct tilt and her lips a curl but when she saw arnold a wonderful smile transformed her face she was in the middle of the clerks office the cynosure of twentyfour staring eyes but she dropped her gown and held out both her delicately gloved hands the fall of her skirts seemed to shake out strange perfumes into the stuffy room  ah you are really here then in this odious gloom you will show me where i can find my husband  arnold stepped back and threw open the door of the inner office she laughed into his face  do not go away she ordered come in with me i want to thank you for looking after me the other day  arnold murmured a few words of excuse and turned away mr tidey junior carefully arranged his necktie and slipped down from his stool  jarvis he exclaimed a free lunch and my lifetimes gratitude if youll send me into the governors office on any pretext whatever  mr jarvis who was answering the telephone took off his goldrimmed spectacles and wiped them  some one must go in and say that mr burland of harris  burland wishes to know at what time he can see the governor i think you had better let chetwode go though  the young man turned away humming a tune  not i he replied dont be surprised you fellows if i am not out just yet the governors certain to introduce me  he knocked at the door confidently and disappeared in a very few seconds he was out again his appearance was not altogether indicative of conquest  governor says burland can go to the devil or words to that effect he announced illnaturedly chetwode youre to take in the private cheque book i tell you what jarvis he added slowly resuming his stool the governors not himself these days the least he could have done would have been to introduce me especially as hes been up at our place so often rotten form i call it anyway shes not nearly so goodlooking close to  mr jarvis proceeded to inform the inquirer through the telephone that mr weatherley was unfortunately not to be found at the moment arnold with mr weatherleys cheque book in his hand knocked at the door of the private office and closed the door carefully behind him as he stood upon the threshold his heart gave a sudden leap mr weatherley was sitting in his accustomed chair but his attitude and expression were alike unusual he was like a man shrinking under the whip and fenellahe was quick enough to catch the look in her face the curl of her lips the almost wicked flash of her eyes yet in a moment she was laughing  your cheque book mr weatherley he remarked laying it down upon the desk  mr weatherley barely thanked himbarely indeed seemed to realize arnolds presence the latter turned to go fenella however intervened  dont go away if you please mr chetwode she begged my husband is angry with me and i am a little frightened and all because i have asked him to help a very good friend of mine who is in need of money to help forward a splendid cause  arnold was embarrassed he glanced doubtfully at mr weatherley who was fingering his cheque book  it is scarcely a matter for discussion his employer began but fenella threw out her hands  oh la la she interrupted dont bore me so my dear samuel or i will come to this miserable place no more mr starling must have this five hundred pounds because i have promised him and because i have promised my brother that he shall have it it is most important and if all goes well it will come back to you some day or other if not you must make up your mind to lose it please write out the cheque and afterwards mr chetwode is to take me out to lunch andrea asked me especially to bring him and if we do not go soon she added consulting a little jeweled watch upon her wrist we shall be late andrea does not like to be kept waiting  i was hoping mr weatherley remarked with an unwieldy attempt at jocularity that i might be asked out to luncheon myself  another day my dear husband she promised carelessly you know that you and andrea do not agree very well you bore him so much and then he is irritable i do not like andrea when he is irritable give me my cheque dear and let me go  mr weatherley dipped his pen in the ink solemnly wrote out a cheque and tore it from the book fenella who had risen to her feet and was standing over him with her hand upon his shoulder stuffed it carelessly into the gold purse which she was carrying then she patted him on the cheek with her gloved hand  dont overwork she said and come home punctually are you quite ready mr chetwode  arnold who was finding the position more than ever embarrassing turned to his employer  can you spare me sir he asked  mr weatherley nodded  if my wife desires you to go certainly he replied but fenella he added i am not very busy myself is it absolutely necessary that you lunch with your brother perhaps even if it is he can put up with my society for once  she threw a kiss to him from the door  unreasonable person she exclaimed today it is absolutely necessary that i lunch with andrea you must go to your club if you are not busy and play billiards or something come mr chetwode she added turning towards the door we have barely a quarter of an hour to get to the carlton i dare not be late the only person she went on as they passed through the outer office and arnold paused for a moment to take down his hat and coat whom i really fear in this world is andrea  mr weatherley remained for a moment in the chair where she had left him gazing idly at the counterfoil of the cheque then he rose and from a safe point of vantage watched the car drive off with slow leaden footsteps he returned to his seat it was past his own regular luncheon hour but he made no movement to leave the place     chapter xi  an interrupted luncheon   the great car swung to the right out of tooley street and joined the stream of traffic making its slow way across london bridge fenella took the tube from its place by her side and spoke in italian to the chauffeur when she replaced it she turned to arnold  do you understand what i said she asked  only a word or two he replied you told him to go somewhere else instead of to the carlton didnt you  she nodded and lay back for a moment silent among the luxurious cushions her mood seemed suddenly to have changed she was no longer gay she watched the faces of the passersby pensively presently she pointed out of the window to a graybearded old man tottering along in the gutter with a trayful of matches a cold wind was blowing through his rags  look she exclaimed look at that in my own country yes but here i do not understand they tell me that this is the richest city in the world and the most charitable  there must be poor everywhere arnold replied a little puzzled  she stared at him  it is not your laws i would complain of she said it is your individuals look at hima poor shivering starved creature watching a constant stream of wellfed wellclothed smug men of business passing always within a few feet of him why does he not help himself to what he wants  how can he arnold asked there is a policeman within a few yards of him the law stands always in the way  the law she repeated scornfully it is a pleasant word that which you use the law is the artificial bogey made by the men who possess to keep those others in the gutter and they tell me that there are half a million of them in londonand they sufferlike that could your courts of justice hold half a million lawbreakers who took an overcoat from a better clad man or the price of a meal from a sleek passerby or bread from the shop which taunted their hunger they do not know their strength those who suffer  arnold looked at her in sheer amazement it was surely a strange woman who spoke there was no sympathy in her face or tone the idea of giving alms to the man seemed never to have occurred to her she spoke with clouded face as one in anger  dont you believe he asked in the universal principle the survival of the fittest where there is wealth there must be poverty  she laughed  change your terms she suggested where there are robbers there must be victims but one may despise the victims all the same one may find their content or rather their inaction ignoble  generally speaking it is the industrious who prosper he affirmed  she shook her head  if that were so all would be well she declared as a matter of fact it is entirely an affair of opportunity and temperament  why you are a socialist he said you should come and talk to my friend isaac  i am not a socialist because i do not care one fig about others she objected it is only myself i think of  if you do not sympathize with laws you at least recognize morals  she laughed gayly leaning back against the dark green upholstery and showing her flawless teeth her long narrow eyes with their seductive gleam flashed into his a lighter spirit possessed her  not other peoples she declared i have my own code and i live by it as for you  she paused her sudden fit of gayety seemed to pass  as for me he murmured  i am a little consciencestricken she said slowly i think i ought to have left you where you were i am not at all sure that you would not have been happier you are a very nice boy mr arnold chetwode much too good for that stuffy little office in tooley street but i do not know whether it is really for your good if one is inclined to try and help you to escape if you saw another man holding a position you wanted yourself would you throw him out if you could by sheer force or would you think of your laws and your morals  it depends a little upon how much i wanted it he confessed  she laughed  ah i see then that there are hopes of you she admitted you should read the reign of queen elizabeth if you would know what englishmen should be like you know i had an english mother and she was descended from francis drake ah we are arrived  they had lost themselves somewhere between oxford street and regent street the car pulled up in front of a restaurant which arnold had certainly never seen or heard of before it was quite small and it bore the name café andré painted upon the wall the lower windows were all concealed by white curtains the entrance hall was small and there was no commissionnaire fenella who led the way in did not turn into the restaurant but at once ascended the stairs arnold followed her his sense of curiosity growing stronger at every moment on the first landing there were two doors with glass tops she opened one and motioned him to enter  will you wait for me for a few moments she said i am going to telephone  he entered at once she turned and passed into the room on the other side of the landing arnold glanced around him with some curiosity the room was well appointed and a luncheon table was laid for four people there were flowers upon the table and the glass and cutlery were superior to anything one might have expected from a restaurant in this vicinity the window looked down into the street arnold stood before it for a moment or two the traffic below was insignificant but the roar of oxford street only a few yards distant came to his ears even through the closed window he listened thoughtfully and then before he realized the course his thoughts were taking he found himself thinking of ruth in a certain sense he was superstitious about ruth and her forebodings he found himself wondering what she would have said if she could have seen him there and known that it was fenella who had brought him and he himselfwhat did he think of it a week ago his life had been so commonplace that his head and his heart had ached with the monotony of it and now fenella had come and had shown him already strange things he seemed to have passed into a world where mysterious happenings were an everyday occurrence into a world peopled by strange men and women who always carried secrets about with them and in a sense no one was more mysterious than fenella herself he asked himself as he stood there whether her vagaries were merely temperamental the air of mystery which seemed to surround her simply accidental he thought of that night at her house the curious intimacy which from the first moment she had seemed to take for granted the confidence with which she had treated him he remembered those few breathless moments in her room the mans hand upon the windowsill with the strange colored ring worn with almost flagrant ostentation and then with a lightninglike transition of thought the gleam of the hand with that selfsame ring raised to strike a murderous blow which he had seen for a moment through the doors of the milan the red seal ring upon the fingerwhat did it mean a doubt chilled him for a moment he told himself with passionate insistence that it was not possible that she could know of these things her words were idle her theories a jest he turned away from the window and caught up a morning paper resolved to escape from his thoughts the first headline stared up at him                   the rosario murder              sensational arrest expected           rumored extraordinary disclosures  he threw the paper down again then the door was suddenly opened and fenella appeared she rang a bell  i am going to order luncheon she announced my brother will be here directly  arnold bowed a little absently against his will he was listening to voices on the landing outside one he knew to be starlings the other was count sabatinis he closed his ears to their speech but there was no doubt whatever that the voice of starling shook with fear a moment or two later the two men entered the room count sabatini came forward with outstretched hand a rare smile parted his lips he looked a very distinguished and very polished gentleman  i am pleased to meet you again mr chetwode he said the more pleased because i understand from my sister that we are to have the pleasure of your company for luncheon  you are very kind arnold murmured  mr starlingi believe that you met the other night count sabatini continued  arnold held out his hand but could scarcely repress a start starling seemed to have lost weight his cheeks were almost cadaverous his eyes hollow his slight arrogance of bearing had gone he gave one a most unpleasant impression  i remember mr starling quite well arnold said we met also i think at the milan hotel a few minutes after the murder of mr rosario  starling shook hands limply sabatini smiled  a memorable occasion he remarked let us take luncheon now gustave he added turning to the waiter who had just entered the room serve the luncheon at once it is a queer little place this mr chetwode he went on turning to arnold but i can promise you that the omelette at least is as served in my own country  they took their places at the table and arnold at any rate found it a very pleasant party sabatini was no longer gloomy and taciturn his manner still retained a little of its deliberation but towards arnold especially he was more than courteous he seemed indeed to have the desire to attract fenella was almost bewitching she had recovered her spirits and she talked to him often in a half audible undertone the familiarity of which gave him a curious pleasure starling alone was silent and depressed he drank a good deal but ate scarcely anything every passing footstep upon the stairs outside alarmed him every time voices were heard he stopped to listen sabatini glanced towards him once with a scornful flash in his black eyes  one would imagine my dear starling that you had committed a crime he exclaimed  starling raised his glass to his lips with shaking fingers and drained its contents  i had too much champagne last night he muttered  there was a moments silence every one felt his statement to be a lie for some reason or other the man was afraid arnold was conscious of a sense of apprehension stealing over him the touch of fenellas fingers upon his arm left him for a moment cold sabatini turned his head slowly towards the speaker and his face had become like the face of an inquisitor stern and merciless with the flavor of death in the cold mirthless parting of the lips  then you drank a very bad brand my friend he declared still even then the worst champagne in the world should not give you those ugly lines under the eyes the scared appearance of a hunted rabbit one would imagine  starling struck the table a blow with his fist which set the glasses jingling  dn it stop sabatini he exclaimed do you want to  he broke off abruptly he looked towards arnold he was breathing heavily his sudden fit of passion had brought an unwholesome flush of color to his cheeks  why should i stop sabatini proceeded mercilessly let me remind you of my sisters presence your lack of selfcontrol is inexcusable one would imagine that you had committed some evil deed that you were indeed an offender against the law  again there was that tense silence starling looked around him with the helpless air of a trapped animal arnold sat there listening and watching completely fascinated there was something which made him shiver about the imperturbability not only of sabatini himself but of the woman who sat by his side  sabatini poured himself out a glass of wine deliberately  who in the world he demanded save a few unwholesome sentimentalists would consider the killing of rosario a crime  starling staggered to his feet his cheeks now were ashen  you are mad he cried pointing to arnold  not in the least sabatini proceeded calmly i am not accusing you of having killed rosario in any case it would have been a perfectly reasonable and even commendable deed one can scarcely understand your agitation if you are really accused of having been concerned in that little contretemps why here is our friend mr arnold chetwode who was present no doubt he will be able to give evidence in your favor  arnold was speechless for a moment sabatinis manner was incomprehensible he spoke as one who alludes to some trivial happening yet even his light words could not keep the shadow of tragedy from the room even at that instant arnold seemed suddenly to see the flash of a hand through the glasstopped door to hear the hoarse cry of the stricken man  i saw nothing but the mans hand he muttered in a voice which he would scarcely have recognized as his own i saw his hand and his arm only he wore a red signet ring  sabatini inclined his head in an interested manner  a singular coincidence he remarked pleasantly my sister has already told me of your observation it certainly is a point in favor of our friend starling it sounds like the badge of some secret society and not even the most ardent romanticist would suspect our friend starling here of belonging to anything of the sort  starling had resumed his luncheon and was making a great effort at a show of indifference nevertheless he watched arnold uneasily  say theres no sense in talking like this he muttered mr chetwode here will think youre in earnest  there is on the contrary a very great deal of sound common sense sabatini asserted gently in all that i have said i want our young friend mr chetwode to be a valued witness for the defense when the misguided gentlemen from scotland yard choose to lay a hand upon your shoulder one should always be prepared my friend for possibilities you great  he stopped short starling with a smothered oath had sprung to his feet the eyes of every one were turned toward the wall a small electric bell was ringing violently for the next few moments events marched swiftly starling with incredible speed had left the room by the inner door a waiter had suddenly appeared as though by magic and of the fourth place at table there seemed to be left no visible signs all the time sabatini unmoved continued to roll his cigarette then there came a tapping at the door     illustration the eyes of every one were turned toward the wall    page 97  see who is there sabatini instructed the waiter  gustave his napkin in his hand threw open the door a young man presented himselfa person of ordinary appearance with a notebook sticking out of his pocket his eyes seemed to take in at once the little party he advanced a few steps into the room  you are perhaps not aware sir sabatini said gently that this is a private apartment  the young man bowed  i must apologize for my intrusion sir and madame he declared looking towards fenella i am a reporter on the staff of the daily unit and i am exceedingly anxious to interviewyou will pardon me  with a sudden swift movement he crossed the room passed into the inner apartment and disappeared sabatini rose to his feet  i propose he said that we complain to the proprietor of this excitable young journalist and take our coffee in the palm court at the carlton  fenella also rose and stepped in front of the lookingglass  it is good she declared i stay with you for one half hour afterwards i have a bridge party you will come with us mr chetwode  arnold did not at once reply he was gazing at the inner door every moment he expected to hearwhat it seemed to him that tragedy was there the greatest tragedy of allthe hunting of man sabatini yawned  those others he declared must settle their own little differences after all it is not our affair     chapter xii  jarvis is justly disturbed   it was fully halfpast three before arnold found himself back in tooley street he hung up his coat and hat and was preparing to enter mr weatherleys room when the chief clerk saw him mr jarvis had been standing outside superintending the unloading of several dray loads of american bacon he laid his hand upon arnolds shoulder  one moment chetwode he said i want to speak to you out here  arnold followed him to a retired part of the warehouse mr jarvis leaned against an old desk belonging to one of the porters  you are very late chetwode he remarked  i am sorry but i was detained arnold answered i will explain it to mr weatherley directly i go in  mr jarvis coughed  of course he said as you went out with mrs weatherley i suppose its none of my business as to your hours but you must know that to come back from lunch at halfpast three is most irregular especially as you are practically junior in the place  i quite agree with you arnold assented but you see i really couldnt help myself today i dont suppose it is likely to happen again is that all that you wanted to speak to me about  not altogether mr jarvis admitted to tell you the truth he went on confidentially i wanted to ask you a question or two  well look sharp then arnold said goodhumoredly i dare say mr weatherley will be getting impatient and he probably saw me come in  i want to ask you mr jarvis began impressively whether you noticed anything peculiar about the governors manner this morning  i dont think sonot especially arnold replied  mr jarvis took off his goldrimmed spectacles and wiped them carefully  mr weatherley he proceeded has always been a gentleman of very regular habitshe and his father before him i have been in the service of the firm for thirtyfive years mr chetwode so you can understand that my interest is not merely a business one  quite so arnold agreed glancing at the man by his side with a momentary curiosity he had been in tooley street for four months and even now he was still unused to the close atmosphere the pungent smells the yellow fog which seemed always more or less to hang about in the streets the dark cavernouslooking warehouse with its gloomy gasjets always burning from where they were standing at that moment the figures of the draymen and warehousemen moving backwards and forwards seemed like phantoms in some subterranean world it was odd to think of thirtyfive years spent amid such surroundings  it is a long time he remarked  mr jarvis nodded  i mention it he said so that you may understand that my remarks to you are not dictated by curiosity or impertinence mr weatherleys behavior and mode of life has been entirely changed chetwode since his marriage  i can understand that arnold replied with a faint smile what indeed had so beautiful a creature as fenella to do with samuel weatherley of tooley street  mrs weatherley mr jarvis continued is no doubt a very beautiful and accomplished lady whether she is a suitable wife for mr weatherley i am not in a position to judge never having had the opportunity of speech with her but as regards the effect of his marriage upon mr weatherley i should like you to understand chetwode at once that it is my opinion and the opinion of all of us and of all his business friends that a marked change for the worse in mr weatherley has set in during the last few months  i am sorry to hear it arnold interposed  you of course mr jarvis went on could scarcely have noticed it as you have been here so short a time but i can assure you that a year or so ago the governor was a different person altogether he was out in the warehouse half the morning watching the stuff being unloaded sampling it and suggesting customers he took a live interest in the business chetwode he was here there and everywhere todayfor the last few weeks indeedhe has scarcely left his office he sits there signs a few letters listens to what i have to say and goodness knows how he spends the rest of his time where the business would be mr jarvis continued rubbing his chin thoughtfully if it were not for us who know the running of it so well i cant say but a fact it is that mr weatherley seems to have lost all interest in it  i wonder he doesnt retire arnold suggested  mr jarvis looked at him in amazement  retire he exclaimed why should he retire what would he do isnt it as comfortable for him to read his newspaper over the fire in the office here as at home isnt it better for him to have his friends all around him as he has here than to sit up in his drawingroom in business hours with never a soul to speak to such men as mr weatherley chetwode or as mr weatherleys father was dont retire if they do it means the end  well im sorry to hear what you tell me arnold said i havent seen much of mr weatherley of course but he seems devoted to his wife  infatuated sir infatuated is the word mr jarvis declared  she is very charming arnold remarked thoughtfully  mr jarvis looked as though there were many things which he could have said but refrained from saying  you will not suggest chetwode he asked that she married mr weatherley for any other reason than because he was a rich man  arnold was silent for a moment somehow or other he had accepted the fact of her being mrs weatherley without thinking much as to its significance  i suppose he admitted that mr weatherleys money was an inducement  there is never anything but evil mr jarvis declared comes from a man or a woman marrying out of their own circle of friends now mr weatherley might have married a dozen ladies from his own circle here one i know of a very handsome lady too whose father has been lord mayor and then theres young tideys sisters in the office there any one of them would have been most suitable but no some unlucky chance seems to have sent mr weatherley on that continental journey and when you once get away from england why of course anything may happen i dont wish to say anything against mrs weatherley mind mr jarvis continued but she comes from the wrong class of people to make a city man a good wife and i cant help associating her and her friends and her manner of living with the change thats come over mr weatherley  arnold swung himself up on to the top of a barrel and sat looking down at his companion  mr jarvis he said you and i see this matter naturally from very different standpoints you have known mr weatherley for thirtyfive years i have known him for four months and he never spoke a word to me until a few days ago practically therefore i have known mr and mrs weatherley the same length of time under the circumstances i must tell you frankly that my sympathies are with mrs weatherley not only have i found her a very charming woman but she has been most unnecessarily kind to me  mr jarvis was silent for a moment  i had forgotten he admitted that that might be your point of view it isnt of course possible to look for any feeling of loyalty for the chief from any one who has only been here a matter of a few months perhaps i was wrong to have spoken to you at all chetwode  if there is anything i can do arnold began  its in this way mr jarvis interrupted owing i dare say to mrs weatherley you have certainly been put in a unique position here you see more of mr weatherley now than any one of us for that reason i was anxious to make a confidant of you i tell you that i am worried about mr weatherley he is a rich man and a prosperous man there is no reason why he should sit in his office and gaze into the fire and look out of the window as though the place were full of shadows and he hated the sight of them yet that is what he does nowadays chetwode what does it mean i ask you frankly havent you noticed yourself that his behavior is peculiar  now you mention it arnold replied i certainly have noticed that he was very strange in his manner this morning he seemed very upset about that rosario murder mr rosario was at his house the other night you know were they great friends do you think  mr jarvis shook his head  not at all he said he was simply i believe one of mrs weatherleys society acquaintances but that theres something gone wrong with mr weatherley no one would deny who sees him as he is now and knows him as he was a year or so ago theres johnson the foreman packer whos been here as long as i have and elwick the carter and hümmel in the export departmentweve all been talking together about this  he doesnt speculate i suppose arnold enquired  not a hapenny mr jarvis replied fervently he has spent large sums of money since his marriage but he can afford it it isnt money thats worrying him  perhaps he doesnt hit it off with his wife arnold remarked  mr jarvis drew a little breath for a moment he was speechless to him it seemed something like profanity that this young man should make so casual a suggestion  mrs weatherley sir he declared was i believe without any means whatever when mr weatherley made her his wife mr weatherley as you know is at the head of this house the house of samuel weatherley  co bankers lloyds it should be the business of the lady sir to see that she hits it off as you put it with a husband who has done her so much honor  arnold smiled  that is all very well mr jarvis he said but you must remember that mrs weatherley had compensations for her lack of wealth she is very beautiful and she is too of a different social rank  mr jarvis was frankly scornful  why she was a foreigner he declared i should like to know of what account any foreign family is against our good city firms such as i have been speaking of no chetwode my opinion is that shes brought a lot of her miserable foreign hangerson over here and that somehow or other they are worrying mr weatherley i should like if i could to interest you in the chief you cant be expected to feel as i do towards him at the same time he is the head of the firm and you are bound therefore to feel a certain respect due to him and i thought that if i talked to you and put these matters before you which have occurred not only to me but to those others who have been with mr weatherley for so many years you might be able to help us by watching and if you can find any clue as to what is bothering him why id be glad to hear of it for there isnt one of us who wouldnt do anything that lay in his power to have the master back once more as he used to be a few years ago why the business seems to have lost all its spring nowadays mr jarvis went on mournfully we do well of course because we couldnt help doing well but we plod along more like a machine it was different altogether in the days when mr weatherley used to bring out the morning orders himself and chaff us about selling for no profit you follow me chetwode  ill do what i can arnold agreed of course i see your point of view and i must admit that the governor does seem depressed about something or other  if anything turns up mr jarvis asked eagerly anything tangible i mean youll tell me of it wont you theres a good fellow of course i suppose your future is outside my control now but i engaged you first you know chetwode there arent many things done here that i havent a say in  you may rely upon me arnold promised slipping down from the barrel hes really quite a decent old chap and if i can find out whats worrying him and can help ill do it  mr jarvis went back to his labors and arnold made his way to mr weatherleys room his first knock remained unanswered the come in which procured for him admittance at his second attempt sounded both flurried and startled mr weatherley had the air of one who has been engaged in some criminal task he drew the blottingpaper over the letter which he had been writing as arnold entered  oh its you is it chetwode he remarked with an air of relief so youre back eh pleasant luncheon  very pleasant indeed thank you sir arnold replied  mrs weatherley send any message her husband asked with illassumed indifference  none at all sir  mr weatherley sighed he seemed a little disappointed  did you lunch at the carlton  we took our coffee there afterwards arnold said we lunched at a small foreign restaurant near oxford street  the count sabatini was there  yes sir arnold told him also mr starling  mr weatherley nodded slowly  how do you get on with count sabatini he inquired rather a gloomy person eh  i found him very pleasant sir arnold said he was good enough to ask me to dine with him tonight  mr weatherley looked up a little startled  invited you to dine with him he repeated  arnold nodded  i thought it was very kind of him sir  mr weatherley sat quite still in his chair he had obviously forgotten his secretarys presence in the room and arnold who had seated himself at his desk and was engaged in sorting out some papers took the opportunity now and then to glance up and scrutinize with some attention his employers features there were certainly traces there of the change at which mr jarvis had hinted mr weatherley had the appearance of a man who had once been florid and prosperous and comfortablelooking but who had been visited by illness or some sort of anxiety his cheeks were still fat but they hung down toward the jaw and his eyes were marked with crowsfeet his color was unhealthy he certainly had no longer the look of a prosperous and contented man  chetwode he said slowly after a long pause i am not sure that i did you a kindness when i asked you to come to my house the other night  i thought so at any rate sir arnold replied it has been a great pleasure to me to make mrs weatherleys acquaintance  i am glad that my wife has been kind to you mr weatherley continued but i hope you will not misunderstand me chetwode when i say that i am not sure that such kindness is for your good mrs weatherleys antecedents are romantic and she has many friends whose position in life is curiously different from my own and whose ideas and methods of life are not such as i should like a son of my own to adopt the count sabatini for instance mr weatherley went on is a nobleman who has had i believe a brilliant career in some respects but who a great many people would tell you is a man without principles or morals as we understand them down here he is just the sort of man to attract youth because he is brave and i believe him to be incapable of a really despicable action but notwithstanding this and although he is my wifes brother if i were you i would not choose him for a companion  i am very much obliged to you sir arnold answered a little awkwardly i shall bear in mind all that you have said you do not object i presume to my dining with him tonight  i have no objection to anything you may do outside this building mr weatherley replied but as you are only a youngster and you met the count sabatini at my house i feel it only right to give you a word of warning i may be wrong one gets fancies sometimes and there are some strange doingsnot that they concern you however he added hurriedly only you are a young man with your way to make in the world and every chance of making it i should think but it wont do for you to get too many of count sabatinis ideas into your head if you are going to do any good at a wholesome honest business like this  i quite understand sir arnold assented i dont suppose that count sabatini will ask me to dine with him again i think it was just kindness that made him think of it in any case i am not in a position to associate with these people regularly at present and that alone would preclude me from accepting invitations  youre young and strong mr weatherley said thoughtfully you must fight your own battle you start somehow differently than i did you see he went on with the air of one indulging in reminiscences my father was in this business and i was brought up to it we lived only a stones throw away then in bermondsey and i went to the city of london school at fourteen i was in the office here and a partner at twentyone i never went out of england till i was over forty i had plenty of friends but they were all of one class they wouldnt suit mrs weatherley or the count sabatini i have lost a good many of them you werent brought up to business chetwode he asked suddenly  i was not sir arnold admitted  what made you come into it  poverty sir arnold answered i had only a few shillings in the world when i walked in and asked mr jarvis for a situation  mr weatherley sighed  your people are gentlefolk i expect he said you have the look of it  arnold did not reply mr weatherley shrugged his shoulders  well he concluded you must look after yourself only remember what i have said by the bye chetwode i am going to repose a certain amount of confidence in you  arnold looked up from his desk  i think you may safely do so sir he declared  mr weatherley slowly opened a drawer at his right hand and produced two letters he carefully folded up the sheet upon which he had been writing and also addressed that  i cannot enter into explanations with you about this matter chetwode he said but i require your promise that what i say to you now is not mentioned in the warehouse or to any one until the time comes which i am about to indicate you are my confidential secretary and i have a right i suppose to demand your silence  certainly sir arnold assured him  there is just a possibility mr weatherley declared speaking thoughtfully and looking out of the window that i may be compelled to take a sudden and quite unexpected journey if this be so i should have to leave without a word to any oneto any one you understand  arnold was puzzled but he murmured a word of assent  in case this should happen mr weatherley went on and i have not time to communicate with any of you i am leaving in your possession these two letters one is addressed jointly to you and mr jarvis and the other to messrs turnbull  james solicitors bishopsgate street within now i give these letters into your charge we shall lock them up together in this small safe which i told you you could have for your own papers mr weatherley continued rising to his feet and crossing the room there you are you see the safe is empty at present so you will not need to go to it i am locking them up he added taking a key from his pocket and there is the key now you understand  but surely sir arnold began  the matter is quite simple mr weatherley interrupted sharply to put it plainly if i am missing at any time if anything should happen to me or if i should disappear go to that safe take out the letters open your own and deliver the other that is all you have to do  quite so sir arnold replied i understand perfectly i see that there is none for mrs weatherley would you wish any message to be sent to her  mr weatherley was silent for a moment a boy passed along the pavement with a bundle of evening papers mr weatherley tapped at the window  hurry out and get me a star chetwode he ordered  arnold obeyed him and returned a few moments later with a paper in his hand mr weatherley spread out the damp sheet under the electric light he studied it for a few moments intently and then folded it up  it will not be necessary for you chetwode he said to communicate with my wife specially  the accidental arrangement of his employers coat and hat upon the rack suddenly struck arnold  why i dont believe that you have been out to lunch sir he exclaimed  mr weatherley looked as though the idea were a new one to him  to tell you the truth he said i completely forgot help me on with my coat chetwode there is nothing more to be done today i will call and get some tea somewhere on my way home  he rose to his feet a little heavily  tell them to get me a taxicab he directed i dont feel much like walking today and they are not sending for me  arnold sent the errandboy off to london bridge mr weatherley stood before the window looking out into the murky atmosphere  i hope chetwode he said that i havent said anything to make you believe that there is anything wrong with me or to give you cause for uneasiness this journey of which i spoke may never become necessary in that case after a certain time has elapsed we will destroy those letters  i trust that it never may become necessary to open them sir arnold remarked  as regards what i said to you about the count mr weatherley continued after a moments hesitation remember who i am that give you the advice and who you are that receive it your bringingup i should imagine has been different still a young man of your age has to make up his mind what sort of a life he means to lead i suppose to a good many people he went on reflectively my life would seem a common dull plodding affair somehow or other i didnt seem to find it so untiluntil lately still there it is i suppose i have lived in a little corner of the world and what seems strange and wild to me might after all seem not so much out of the way to a young man with different ideas like you only this much i do believe at any rate he went on buttoning up his coat and watching the taxicab which was coming along the street if you want a quiet honest life doing your duty to yourself and others and living according to the oldfashioned standards of honesty and upright living then when you have had that dinner with the count sabatini tonight forget him forget where he lives come back to your work here and if the things of which the count has been talking to you seem to have more glamor forget them all the more zealously the best sort of life is always the grayest the life which attracts is generally the one to be avoided we dont do our duty mr weatherley added brushing his hat upon his sleeve reflectively by always looking out upon the pleasurable side of life good evening chetwode  he turned away so abruptly that arnold had scarcely time to return his greeting it seemed so strange to him to be talked to at such length by a man whom he had scarcely heard utter half a dozen words in his life that he was left speechless he was still standing before the window when mr weatherley crossed the pavement to the waiting taxicab in his walk and attitude the signs of the mans deterioration were obvious the little swagger of his younger days was gone the bumptiousness of his bearing forgotten he cast no glance up and down the pavement to hail an acquaintance he muttered an address to the driver and stepped heavily into the taxicab     chapter xiii  castles in spain   ruth welcomed him with her usual smileonce he had thought it the most beautiful thing in the world in the twilight of the april evening her face gleamed almost marble white he dragged a footstool up to her side  little woman you are looking pale he declared give me your hands to hold cant you see that i have come just at the right time even the coal barges look like phantom boats see there is the first light  she shook her head slowly  tonight she murmured there will be no ships arnold i have looked and looked and i am sure light the lamp please  why he asked obeying her as a matter of course  she turned in her chair  do you think that i cannot tell she continued didnt i see you turn the corner there didnt i hear your step three flights down sometimes i have heard it come and it sounds like something leaden beating time to the music of despair and tonight you tripped up like a boy home for the holidays you are going out tonight arnold  he nodded  a man whom i met the other night has asked me to dine with him he announced  a man you are not going to see her then  he laughed gayly and placed his hand upon the fingers which had drawn him towards her  silly girl he declared no i am going to dine alone with her brother the count sabatini you see i am private secretary now to a merchant prince no longer a clerk in a wholesale provision merchants office we climb my dear ruth soon i am going to ask for a holiday and then well make isaac leave his beastly lecturing and scurrilous articles and come away with us somewhere for a day or two you would like a few days in the country ruth  her eyes met his gratefully  you know that i should love it dear she said but arnie do you think that when the time for the holiday comes you will want to take us  he sat on the arm of her chair and held her hand  foolish little woman he exclaimed do you think that i am likely to forget why i must have shared your supper nearly every night for a month while i was walking about trying to find something to do people dont forget who have lived through that sort of times ruth  she sighed strangely enough her tone had in it something of vague regret  for your sake dear i am glad that they are over  things too will improve with you he declared they shall improve if only isaac would turn sensible he has brains and he is clever enough if he werent stuffed full with that foolish socialism  she looked around the room and drew him a little closer to her  arnold she whispered now that you have spoken of it let me tell you this sometimes i am afraid isaac is so mysterious do you know that he is away often for the whole day and comes back white and exhausted worn to a shadow and sleeps for many hours sometimes he is in his room all right but awake i can hear him moving backwards and forwards and hammering tap tap tap for hours  what does he do arnold asked quickly  he has some sort of a little printing press in his room she answered he prints some awful sheet there which the police have stopped the night before last he had a message and everything was hidden he spent hours with his face to the window watching i am so afraid that sometimes he goes outside the law arnold i am afraid of what might happen to him there are terrible things in his face if i ask him questions and he moves about and mutters like a man in a dreamno like a man in a nightmare  arnold frowned and looked up at the skysigns upon the other side of the river  i too wish he were different dear he said he certainly is a dangerous protector for you  he is the only one i have the girl replied with a sigh and sometimes when he remembers he is so kind but that is not often now  what do you do when he is away for all this time arnold asked quickly are you properly looked after you ought to have some one here  mrs sands comes twice a day always she declared it is not myself i trouble about really isaac is good in that way he pays mrs sands always in advance he tries even to buy wine for me and he often brings me home fruit when he has money i am sure that he gives it to me it isnt that so much arnold but i get frightened of his getting into trouble now that room of his has got on my nerves when i hear that tap tap in the night i am terrified  will you let me speak to him about it ruth  her face was suddenly full of terror  arnie you mustnt think of it she begged he would never forgive menever the first time i asked him what was going on there i thought that he would have struck me  would you like me to go in and see next time he is out  she shivered  not for the world she replied besides you couldnt he has fixed on a yale lock himself no one could open the door  you have never seen what he prints  never she replied he knows that i hate the sight of those pamphlets he never shows them to me he had a man to see him the other nightthe strangestlooking man i ever sawand they talked in whispers for hours i saw the mans face when he went out it was white and evil and arnold it was the face of a man steeped in sin to the lips i wish i hadnt seen it she went on drearily it haunts me  he did his best to reassure her  little ruth he said you have been up here too long without a holiday wait till saturday afternoon when i draw my new salary for the first time i shall hire a taxicab we will have it open and drive out into the country  her face lit up for a moment her beautiful eyes were soft although a few seconds later they were swimming with tears  do you think you will want to go when saturday afternoon comes she asked dont you think perhaps that your new friends may invite you to go and see them i am so jealous of your new friends arnold  he drew her a little closer to him there was something very pathetic in her complete dependence upon him a few months ago a stranger they had both been waifs brought together by a wave of common adversity her intense weakness had made the same appeal to him as his youth and strength to her there was almost a lump in his throat as he answered her  you arent really feeling like that ruth he begged dont my new friends are part of the new life you wouldnt have me cling to the old any longer than i can help why you and i together have sat here hour after hour and prayed for a change prayed for the mystic treasure that might come to us from those ships of chance dear if mine comes first it brings good for you too you cant believe that i should forget  for the first time in his life he bent over and kissed her upon the lips she suffered his caress not only without resistance but for a single moment her arms clasped his neck passionately then she drew away abruptly  i dont know what im doing she panted you mustnt kiss me like that you mustnt arnold  she began to cry but before he could attempt to console her she dashed the tears away  oh were impossible both of us she declared but then a poor creature like me must always be impossible it isnt quite kind of fate is it to give any one a womans heart and a womans loneliness and the poor frame of a hopeless invalid  youre not a hopeless invalid he assured her earnestly no one would ever know to look at you as you sit there that there was anything whatever the matter dont you remember our moneybox for the doctor even that will come ruth the day will come i am sure when we shall carry you off to vienna or one of those great cities and the cure will be quite easy i believe in it really  she sighed  i used to love to hear you talk about it she said but somehow now it seems so far off i dont even know that i want to be like other women there is only one thing i do want and that is to keep you  that he declared fervently you are sure of remember ruth that awful black month and what we suffered together and you knew nothing about me i just found you sitting on the stairs with your broken stick waiting for some one to come and help you  she nodded  and you picked me up and carried me into your room she reminded him you didnt have to stop and take breath as isaac has to  why no he admitted i couldnt say you were heavy dear some day or other though he added you will be dont lose your faith ruth dont let either of us leave off looking for the ships  she smiled  very well she said letting her hand fall once more softly into his i think that i am very foolish i think that yours has come already dear and i am worse than foolish i am selfish because i once hoped that they might come together that you and i might sit here arnold hand in hand and watch them with great red sails and piles and piles of gold and beautiful things with our names written on so big that we could read them even here from the window  she burst into a peal of laughter  oh those childrens days what an escape they were for us in the black times do you know that we once actually told one another fairy stories  not only that but we believed in them he insisted i am perfectly certain that the night you found my star and it seemed to us to keep on getting bigger and bigger while we looked at it that from that night things have been getting better with me  at least she declared abruptly i am not going to spoil your dinner by keeping you here talking nonsense carry me back please arnold you must hurry up now and change your clothes and dear you had better not come in and wish me goodnight isaac went out this morning in one of his savage tempers and he may be back at any moment carry me back now and have a beautiful evening tomorrow you must tell me all about it  he obeyed her she was really only a trifle to lift as light as air she clung to him longingly even to the last minute  and now please you are to kiss my forehead she said and run away  your forehead only he asked bending over her  my forehead only please she begged gravely the other doesnt go with our fairy stories dear i want to go on believing in the fairy stories  arnold had little enough time to dress and he descended the stone steps towards the street at something like a run halfway down however he pulled up abruptly to avoid running into two men one was isaac his worn white face with hooked nose and jetblack eyes made him a noticeable figure even in the twilight the other man was so muffled up as to be unrecognizable arnold stopped short  glad youre home isaac he said pleasantly i have just been talking to ruth i thought she seemed rather queer  isaac looked at him coldly from head to foot arnold was wearing his only and ordinary overcoat but his varnished shoes and white tie betrayed him  so youre wearing your cursed livery again he sneered youre going to beg your bone from the rich mans plate  arnold laughed at him  always the same isaac he declared never mind about me you look after your niece and take her out if you can somewhere i am going to give her a drive on saturday  are you isaac said calmly i doubt it drives and carriages are not for the like of us poor scum  his companion nudged him impatiently isaac moved away arnold turned after him  you wont deny the right of a man to spend what he earns in the way he likes best he asked ive had a rise in my salary and i am going to spend a part of it taking ruth out  isaac laughed scornfully  a rise in your salary he muttered you poor slave did you go and kiss your masters foot when he gave it to you  i didnt arnold declared to tell you the truth i believe it would have annoyed him he hasnt any sense of humor you see good night isaac if youre writing one of those shattering articles tonight remember that ruth can hear you and dont keep her awake too late  arnold walked on suddenly his attention was arrested isaac was leaning over the banister of the landing above  stop  arnold paused for a moment  what is it he asked  isaac came swiftly down he brushed his cloth hat further back on his head as though it obscured his vision with both hands he gripped arnolds arm  tell me he said what do you mean by that  what i said arnold answered but for heavens sake dont visit it on poor ruth she told me that you had some printingpress in your room to set up your pamphlets and that the tap tap at night had kept her awake its no concern of mine i dont care what you do or what rubbish you print but i cant bear to see the little woman getting frailer and frailer isaac  she told you that isaac muttered  she told me that arnold assented what is there in it  isaac looked at him for a moment with an intentness which was indescribable his black eyes seemed on fire with suspicion with searchfulness at last he let go the arm which he was clutching and turned away  all right he said ruth shouldnt talk thats all i dont want every one to know that i am reduced to printing my little sheet in my bedroom good night  arnold looked after him in surprise it was very seldom that isaac vouchsafed any form of greeting or farewell and then the shock came isaacs companion who had been leaning over the banisters waiting for him had loosened the muffler about his neck and opened his overcoat his features were now recognizablea pale face with deepset eyes and prominent forehead a narrow chin and a mouth which seemed set in a perpetual snarl arnold stood gazing up at him in rapt amazement he had seen that face but once before yet there was no possibility of any mistake it seemed indeed as though the recognition were mutual for the man above with an angry cry turned suddenly away buttoning up his overcoat with feverish fingers he called out to isaaca hurried sentence in a language which was strange to arnold there was a brief exchange of breathless words arnold moved slowly away but before he had reached the street isaacs hand was upon his shoulder  one moment isaac panted my friend would like to know why you looked at him like that  arnold did not hesitate  isaac he said gravely no doubt i seemed surprised i have seen that man before only a night or two ago  where when isaac demanded  i saw him hanging around the house of my employer arnold said firmly under very suspicious circumstances he was inquiring then for mr rosario it was the night before rosario was murdered  what do you mean by that isaac asked hoarsely  you had better ask yourself what it means arnold replied for ruths sake isaac dont have anything to do with that man i dont know anything about himi dont want to know anything about him i simply beg you for ruths sake to keep out of trouble  isaac laughed harshly  you talk like a young fool he declared turning on his heel     chapter xiv  sabatinis doctrines   the apartments of count sabatini were situated in the somewhat unfamiliar quarter of queen annes gate arnold found his way there on foot crossing parliament square in a slight drizzling rain through which the figures of the passersby assumed a somewhat phantasmal appearance around him was a glowing arc of lights and dimly visible beyond shadowy glimpses of the river he rang the bell with some hesitation at the house indicated by his directionsa large gray stone building oldfashioned and without any external signs of habitation his summons however was answered almost immediately by a manservant who took his hat and coat  if you will step into the library for a moment sir he said with a slight foreign accent his excellency will be there  arnold was immensely impressed by the room into which he was shown he stood looking around him for several minutes the whole atmosphere seemed to indicate a cultivated and luxurious taste kept in bounds by a certain not unpleasing masculine severity the coloring of the room was dark green and the walls were everywhere covered with prints and etchings and trophies of the chase and war a huge easychair was drawn up to the fire and by its side was a table covered with books and illustrated papers a black oak writing desk stood open and a huge bowl of violets set upon it was guarded by an ivory statuette of the venus of milo the furniture was comfortably worn there was a faint atmosphere of cigarette smokethe whole apartment was impregnated by an intensely liveable atmosphere the glowing face of a celebrated parisian danseuse laughed at him from over the mantelpiece arnold was engaged in examining it when sabatini entered  a thousand apologies my dear mr chetwode he said softly i see you pass your time pleasantly you admire the divine fatime  the face is beautiful arnold admitted i am afraid i was a few minutes early it began to rain and i walked fast  sabatini smiled a butler had followed him into the room bearing on a tray two wineglasses full of clear yellow liquid  vermouth and one tiny cigarette sabatini suggestedthe best apéretif in the world permit me mr chetwodeto our better acquaintance  i never need an apéretif arnold answered raising the wineglass to his lips but i will drink to your toast with pleasure  sabatini lit his cigarette and leaning slightly against the back of a chair stood with folded arms looking at the picture over the fireplace  your remark about fatime suggested reservations he remarked i wonder why i have a good many curios in the room and some rather wonderful prints but it was fatime who held you while you waited yet you are not one of those i should imagine he added blowing out a cloud of cigarette smoke to whom the call of sex is irresistible  arnold shook his head  no i dont think so he admitted simply to tell you the truth i think that it was the actual presence of the picture here rather than its suggestions which interested me most your room is so masculine arnold added glancing around it breathes of war and sport and the collector and then in the middle of it all this girl with her barely veiled limbs and lascivious eyes there is something a little brutal about the treatment dont you think  sabatini shrugged his shoulders  the lady is too well known remarked sabatini shrugging his shoulders a single touch of the ideal and the greatness of that picture would be lost grève was too great an artist to try for it  nevertheless arnold persisted she disturbs the serenity of your room  sabatini threw away his cigarette and passed his arm through his companions  it is as well always to be reminded that life is manysided he murmured you will not mind a têteàtête dinner  some curtains of dark green brocaded material had been silently drawn aside and they passed into a smaller apartment of which the coloring and style of decoration was the same a round table before which stood two highbacked black oak chairs and which was lit with softlyshaded candles stood in the middle of the room it was very simply set out but the two wineglasses were richly cut in quaint fashion and the bowl of violets was of old yellow sèvres arnold sat opposite his host and realized how completely the man seemed to fit in with his surroundings in mrs weatherleys drawingroom there had been a note of incongruity here he seemed so thoroughly in accord with the air of masculine and cultivated refinement which dominated the atmosphere he carried himself with the ease and dignity to which his race entitled him but apart from that his manner had qualities which arnold found particularly attractive his manicured nails his spotless linen his links and waistcoat buttonscut from some quaint stonethe slight affectations of his dress the unusual manner of brushing back his hair and arranging his tie gave him only a note of individuality every word he spokeand he talked softly but continually during the service of the mealconfirmed arnolds first impressions of him he was a man at least who had lived a mans life without fear or weakness and whatever his standards might be he would adhere to them  dinner was noiselessly and perfectly served by the butler who had first appeared and a slighter and smaller edition of himself who brought him the dishes there was no champagne but other wines were served in their due order the quality of which arnold appreciated although more than one was strange to him with the removal of the last course fruit was placed upon the table with a decanter of chateau yquem on a small table near was a brass pot of coffee and a flask of green liqueur sabatini pushed the cigarettes towards his companion  i have a fancy to talk to you seriously he said without any preamble  arnold looked at him in some surprise  i am not a philanthropist continued sabatini when i move out of my regular course of life it is usually for my own advantage i warn you of that before we start  arnold nodded and lit his cigarette fearlessly there was no safety in life he reflected thinking for the moment of the warning which he had received like the safety of poverty  i am a man of fortyone sabatini said you i believe are twentyfour there can therefore be no impertinences in the truth from me to you  there could be none in any case arnold assured him  sabatini gazed thoughtfully across the table into his guests face  i do not know your history or your parentage he went on such knowledge is unnecessary it is obvious that your position at the present moment is the result of an accident  it is the outcome of actual poverty arnold told him softly  sabatini assented  ah well he said it is a poverty then which you have accepted tell me then of your ambition you are young and the world lies before you you have the gifts which belong to those who are born are you doing what is right to yourself in working at a degrading employment for a pittance  i must live arnold protested simply  precisely replied sabatini we all must live we all however are too apt to accept the rulings of circumstance i maintain that we all have a right to live in the manner to which we are born  and how asked arnold does one enforce that right  sabatini leaned over and helped himself to the liqueur  you possess the gift he remarked which i admire mostthe gift of directness now i would speak to you of myself when i was young i was penniless with no inheritance save a grim castle a barren island and a great name the titular head of my family was a cardinal of rome my fathers own brother i went to him and i demanded the means of support he answered me with an epigram which i will not repeat besides which it is untranslatable i will only tell you that he gave me a sum equivalent to a few hundred pounds and bade me seek my fortune  arnold was intensely interested  tell me how you started he begged  a few hundred pounds were insufficient sabatini answered coolly and my uncle was a coward i waited my opportunity and although three times i was denied an audience on the fourth i found him alone he would have driven me out but i used the means which i have never known to fail i left him with a small but sufficient fortune  arnold looked at him with glowing eyes  you forced him to give it you he exclaimed  without a doubt sabatini answered coolly he was wealthy and he was my uncle i was strong and he was weak it was as necessary for me to live as for him so i took him by the throat and gave him thirty seconds to reflect he decided that the life of a cardinal of rome was far too pleasant to be abandoned precipitately  there was a short silence sabatini glanced twice at his companion and smiled  i will read your thoughts my young friend he continued your brain is a little confused you are wondering whether indeed i have robbed my elderly relative expunge that word and all that it means to you from your vocabulary if you can i took that to which i had a right by means of the weapons which have been given to mestrength and opportunity these are the weapons which i have used through life  supposing the cardinal had refused arnold asked  one need not suppose sabatini replied it is not worth while i should probably have done what the impulse of the moment demanded so far however i have found most people reasonable  there have been others then arnold demanded  there have been others sabatini agreed calmly always people however upon whom i have had a certain claim life to different people means different things life to a person of my tastes and descent meant thisit meant playing a part in the affairs of the country which gave me my birthright it meant the carrying forward of a great enmity which has burned within the family of sabatini for the house which now rules my country for hundreds of years if i were a person who sought for excuses i might say that i have robbed my relatives for the cause of the patriot life to a sawer of wood means bread the two states themselves are identical the man who is denied bread breaks into riot and gains his ends i when i have been denied what amounts to me as bread have also helped myself  i am not sure arnold protested frankly whether you are not amusing yourself with me  then let me put that doubt to rest once and for all sabatini replied it does not amuse me to trifle with the truth  why do you make me your confidant arnold asked  because it is my intention to make a convert of you sabatini said calmly  arnold shook his head  i am afraid that that is quite hopeless he answered i have not the excuse of a country which needs my help although i have more than one relative he added with a smile whom i should not mind taking by the throat  one needs no excuse sabatini murmured  when one  he hesitated  i have no scruples sabatini interrupted in using the word which seems to trouble you perhaps i am a robber what however you do not appreciate is that ninetenths of the people in the world are in the same position  i cannot admit that either arnold protested  it is then because you have not considered the matter sabatini declared you live in a very small corner of the world and you have accepted a moral code as ridiculously out of date as calvinism in religion the whole of life is a system of robbery the strong help themselves the weak go down did you call your splendid seamen of queen elizabeths time robbers because they nailed the english flag to their mast and swept the seas for plunder we are strong they cried to the country they robbed and you are weak stand and deliver i spare you a hundred instances take your commercial life of today the capitalist stretches out his hand and swallows up the weaker man he does it ten or fifty times a day and there is no one to stop him it is the strong taking from the weak you cannot walk from here to charing cross without seeing it some forms of plunder come under the law some do not your idea as to which are right and which are wrong is simply the laws idea the man who is strong enough is the law  your doctrines are farreaching arnold said what about the man who sweeps the crossings the beggars who ask for alms  they sweep crossings and they beg for alms sabatini replied because they are weak or foolish and because i am strong you work for twentyeight shillings a week because you are foolish you can do it if you like if it affords you any satisfaction to make a martyr of yourself for the sake of bolstering up a conventional system either that or you have not the spirit for adventure  the spirit for adventure arnold repeated quietly well there have been times when i thought i had that but it certainly never occurred to me to go out and rob  that sabatini declared is because you are an englishman and extraordinarily susceptible to conventions now i speak with many experiences behind me i had ancestors who enriched themselves with fire and sword i would much prefer to do the same thing as a matter of fact when the conditions admit of it i do i have fought in whatever war has raged since the days when i was eighteen if another war should break out tomorrow i should weigh the causes choose the side i preferred and fight for it but when there is no war i must yet live i cannot drill troops all day or sit in the cafés i must use my courage and my brains in whatever way seems most beneficial to the cause which lies nearest to my heart  i cannot imagine arnold said frankly what that cause is  some day and before long sabatini replied you may know at any rate we have talked enough of this for the present think over what i have said if at any time i should have an enterprise to propose to you you will at least recognize my point of view  he touched the bell a servant entered almost at once carrying his overcoat and silk hat  i have taken a box at a musichall he announced i believe that my sister may join us there i hope it will amuse you  arnold rose eagerly to his feet his eyes were bright already with anticipation  and as for our conversation sabatini continued as they stepped into his little electric brougham dismiss it for the present from your memory try and look out upon life with larger eyes from a broader point of view forget the laws that have been made by other men try and frame for yourself a more rational code of living and judge not with the readymade judgment of laws but from your own consciousness of right and wrong you are at an impressionable age and the effort should help to make a man of you  they glided softly along the crowded streets and up into leicester square where the blaze of lights seemed somehow comforting after the cold darkness of the night they stopped outside the empire and arnold followed his guide with beating heart as they were shown to their box the door was thrown open fenella was there alone she was sitting a little way back in the box so as to escape observation from the house at the sound of their entrance she turned eagerly toward them arnold who was in advance stopped short in the act of greeting her she was looking past him at her brother she was absolutely colorless her lips were parted her eyes distended as though with terror she had all the appearance of a woman who has looked upon some terrible thing     chapter xv  the red signet ring   the few minutes which followed inspired arnold with an admiration for his companion which he never wholly lost sabatini recognized in a moment his sisters state but he did no more than shrug his shoulders  my dear fenella he said in a tone of gentle reproof  you havent heard she gasped  sabatini drew out a chair and seated himself he glanced around at the house and then began slowly to unbutton his white kid gloves  i did not buy an evening paper he remarked your face tells me the news of course i gather that starling has been arrested  he was arrested at five oclock she exclaimed he will be charged before the magistrates tomorrow  then tomorrow sabatini continued calmly will be quite time enough for you to begin to worry  she looked at him for a moment steadfastly she had ceased to tremble now and her own appearance was becoming more natural  if one had but a mans nerve she murmured dear andrea you make me very much ashamed yet this is serioussurely it is very serious  arnold had withdrawn as far as possible out of hearing but sabatini beckoned him forward  you are missing the ballet he said you must take the front chair there you too will be interested in this news which my sister has been telling me our friend starling has been arrested after all i was afraid he was giving himself away  for the murder of mr rosario arnold asked  precisely sabatini replied a very unfortunate circumstance let us hope that he will be able to prove his innocence  i dont see how he could have done it arnold said slowly we saw him only about ten minutes or a quarter of an hour later coming up from the restaurant on the other side of the hotel  oh he will come very near proving an alibi without a doubt sabatini declared he is quite clever when it comes to the point i wonder what sort of evidence they have against him  is there any reason arnold asked why he should kill mr rosario  sabatini studied his program earnestly  well he admitted that is rather a difficult question to answer mr rosario was a very obstinate man and he was certainly persisting in a course of action against which i and many others had warned him a course of action which was certain to make him exceedingly unpopular with a good many of us i am not sure however whether the facts were sufficiently well known  fenella interrupted she rose hurriedly to her feet  i am afraid after all that you will have to excuse me she declared moving to a seat at the back of the box i do not think that i can stay here  sabatini nodded gravely  perhaps you are right he said for my own part i too wish i had more faith in starling as a matter of fact i have none when they caught crampton one could sleep in ones bed one knew but this man starling is a nervous wreck who knows what story he may tellconsciously or unconsciouslyin his desperate attempts to clear himself you see he continued looking at arnold there are a great many of us to whom mr rosario was personally just at this moment obnoxious  fenella swayed in her chair  i am going home she murmured  as you will sabatini agreed perhaps mr chetwode will be so kind as to take you back i have asked a friend to call here this evening  she turned to arnold  do she pleaded i am fit for nothing else you will come with me  arnold was already standing with his coat upon his arm  of course he replied  her brother helped her on with her cloak  for myself he declared i shall remain i should not like to miss my friend if he comes and they tell me that the second ballet is excellent     illustration for myself he declared i remain page 139  she took his hands  you have courage dear one she murmured  he smiled  it is not courage he replied it is philosophy if tomorrow were to be the end would you not enjoy today the true reasonableness of life is to live as though every day might be ones last we shall meet again very soon mr chetwode  arnold held out his hands the whole affair was intensely mysterious and there were many things which he did not understand in the least but he knew that he was in the presence of a brave man  good night count sabatini he said thank you very much for our dinner i am afraid i am an unconverted philistine and doomed to the narrow ways but nevertheless i have enjoyed my evening very much  sabatini smiled charmingly  you are very british he declared but never mind even a briton has been known to see the truth by gazing long enough take care of my little sister and au revoir  her fingers clutched his arm as they passed along the promenade and down the corridor into the street the car was waiting and in a moment or two they were on their way to hampstead she was beginning to look a little more natural but she still clung to him arnold felt his head dizzy as though with strong wine  fenella he said using her name boldly your brother has been talking to me tonight all that he said i can understand from his point of view but what may be well for him is not well for others who are weaker if you have been foolish if the love of adventure has led you into any folly think now and ask yourself whether it is worth while give it up before it is too late  it is because i have so little courage she murmured looking at him with swimming eyes and one must do something i must live or the tugging of the chain is there all the time  there are many things in life which are worth while he declared you are young and rich and you have a husband who would do anything in the world for you it isnt worth while to get mixed up in these dangerous schemes  what do you know of them she asked curiously  not much he admitted your brother was talking tonight a little recklessly one gathered  andrea sometimes talks wildly because it amuses him to deceive people to make them think that he is worse than he really is she interrupted he loves danger but it is because he is a brave man  i am sure of it arnold replied but it does not follow that he is a wise one  she shrugged her shoulders  tell me one of those many ways of living which are worth while she whispered point out one of them only remember that i too have the spirit of restlessness in my veins i must have excitement at any cost  he sighed she was indeed in a strange place  it seems so hopeless he said to try and interest you in the ordinary things of life  no one could do it she admitted i was not made for domesticity sometimes i think that i was not made to be wife to any man i am a gambler at heart i love the fierce draughts of life without them i should die  yet you married samuel weatherley arnold exclaimed  she laughed bitterly  yes i was in a prison house she answered and i should have welcomed any jailer who had come to set me free i married him and sometimes i try to do my duty then the other longings come and hampstead and my house and my husband and my parties and my silly friends seem like part of a dream mr chetwodearnold  fenella  we were to be friends we were to help one another tonight i am afraid and i think that i am a little remorseful it was my doing that you dined tonight with andrea i have wanted to bring you too into the life that my brother lives into the life where i also make sometimes excursions it is not a wicked life but i do not know that it is a wise one i was foolish it was wrong of me to disturb you after all you are good and solid and british you were meant for the other ways forget everything it is less than a week since you came first to dine with us blot out those few days can you  not while i live arnold replied you forget that it was during those few days that i met you  but you are foolish she declared laying her hand upon his and smiling into his face so that the madness came back and burned in his blood there is no need for you to be a gambler there is no need for you to stake everything upon these single coups you havent felt the call dont listen for it  fenella he whispered hoarsely what was i doing when samuel weatherley was shipwrecked on your island  she laughed  oh you foolish boy she cried what difference would it have made  you cant tell he answered has no one ever moved you fenella have you never known what it is to care for any one  never she replied i only hope that i never shall  why not  because i am a gambler she declared because to me it would mean risking everything and i have seen no man in the whole world strong enough and big enough for that you are my very dear friend arnold and you are feeling very sentimental and your head is turned just a little but after all you are only a boy the taste of life is not yet between your teeth  he leaned closer towards her she put his arm gently away shaking her head all the time  do not think that i am a prude she said you can kiss me if you like and yet i would very much rather that you did not i do not know why i like you well enough and certainly it is not from any sense of right or wrong i am like andrea in that way i make my own laws tonight i do not wish you to kiss me  she was looking up at him her eyes filled with a curious light her lips slightly parted she was so close that the perfume in which her clothes had lain faint though it was almost maddened him  i dont think that you have a heart at all he exclaimed hoarsely  it is the old selfish cry that she answered please do not be foolish arnold do not be like those silly boys who only plague one with you and me things are more serious  the car came to a standstill before the portals of pelham lodge arnold held her fingers for a moment or two after he had rung the bell then he turned away she called him back  come in with me for a moment she murmured tonight i am afraid mr weatherley will be in bed come in and sit with me for a little time until my courage returns  he followed her into the house there seemed to arnold to be a curious silence everywhere she looked in at several rooms and nodded  mr weatherley has gone to bed she announced come into my sittingroom we will stay there for five minutes at least  she led the way across the hall towards the little room into which she had taken arnold on his first visit she tried the door and came to a sudden standstill shook the handle and looked up at arnold in amazement  it seems as though it were locked she remarked its my own sittingroom no one else is allowed to enter it groves  she turned round the butler had hastened to her side  what is the meaning of this she asked my sittingroom is locked on the inside  the man tried the handle incredulously he too was dumbfounded  where is your master mrs weatherley asked  he retired an hour ago madam the man replied it is most extraordinary this  she began to shiver groves leaned down and tried to peer through the keyhole he rose to his feet hastily  the lights are burning in the room madam he exclaimed and the key is not in the door on the other side it looks very much as though burglars were at work there if you will allow me i will go round to the window outside there is no one else up  i will go with you arnold said  if you please sir the man replied  they hurried out of the front door and around to the side of the house the lights were certainly burning in the room and the blind was half drawn up arnold reached the windowsill with a spring and peered in  i can see nothing he said to groves there doesnt seem to be any one in the room  can you get in sir the man asked from below the sash seems to be unfastened  arnold tried it and found it yielded to his touch he pushed it up and vaulted lightly into the room then he saw that a table was overturned and a key was lying on the floor he picked it up and fitted it into the door fenella was waiting outside  i can see nothing here he announced but a table has been upset  she pointed to the sofa and gripped his arm  look she cried what is that  arnold felt a thrill of horror and for a moment the room swam before his eyes then he saw clearly again from underneath the upholstery of the sofa a mans hand was visible stretching into the room almost as far as his elbow they both stared arnold stupefied with horror on the little finger of the hand was a ring with a bloodred seal     chapter xvi  an adventure   arnold for a moment or two felt himself incapable of speech or movement fenella was hanging a dead weight upon his arm the eyes of both of them were riveted upon the hand which stretched into the room  there is some one under the couch fenella faltered at last  he took a step forward  wait he begged or perhaps you had better go away i will see who it is  he moved toward the couch she strove to hold him back  arnold she cried hoarsely this is no business of yours you had better leave me groves is here and the servants slip away now while you have the chance  he looked at her in amazement  why fenella he exclaimed how can you suggest such a thing besides he added groves saw me climb in at the window he was with me outside  she wrung her hands  i forgot she moaned dont move the sofa while i am looking  there was a knock at the door they both turned round it was groves voice speaking he had returned to the house and was waiting outside  can i come in madam  fenella moved slowly towards the door and admitted him then arnold setting his teeth rolled back the couch a man was lying there stretched at full length his face was colorless except for a great blue bruise near his temple arnold stared at him for a moment with horrified eyes  my god he muttered  there was a brief silence fenella looked across at arnold  you know him  arnolds first attempt at speech failed when the words came they sounded choked there was a horrible dry feeling in his throat  it is the man who looked in at the window that night he whispered i saw himonly a few hours ago it is the same man  fenella came slowly to his side she leaned over his shoulder  is he dead she asked  her tone was cold and unnatural her paroxysm of fear seemed to have passed  i dont know arnold answered let groves telephone for a doctor  the man half turned away yet hesitated fenella fell on her knees and bent over the prostrate body  he is not dead she declared groves tell me exactly who is in the house  there is no one here at all madam the man answered except the servants and they are all in the other wing we have had no callers whatever this evening  and mr weatherley  mr weatherley arrived home about seven oclock groves replied dined early and went to bed immediately afterwards he complained of a headache and looked very unwell  fenella rose slowly to her feet she looked from arnold to the prostrate figure upon the carpet  who has done this she asked pointing downwards  it may have been an accident arnold suggested  an accident she repeated what was he doing in my sittingroom besides he could not have crept underneath the couch of his own accord  do you know who it is arnold asked  why should i know she demanded  he hesitated  you remember the night of my first visit herethe face at the window  she nodded he pointed downward to the outstretched hand  that is the man he declared he is wearing the same ringthe red signet ring i saw it upon his hand the night you and i were in this room alone together and he was watching the house i saw it again through the window of the swingdoors on the hand of the man who killed rosario what does it mean fenella  i do not know she faltered  you must have some idea he persisted as to who he is you seemed to expect his coming that night you would not let me give an alarm or send for the police it was the same man who killed rosario  she shook her head  i do not believe that she declared  if it were not the same man arnold continued it was at least some one who was wearing the same ring tell me the truth fenella  she turned her head groves had come once more within hearing  i know nothing she replied hardly groves go and knock at the door of your masters room she added ask him to put on his dressinggown and come down at once mr chetwode come with me into the library while i telephone for the doctor  arnold hesitated for a moment  dont you think that i had better stay by him he suggested  she shook her head  i will not be left alone she replied i told you on the way here that i was afraid all the evening i knew that something would happen  they made their way to the front of the house and into the library she turned up the electric lights and fetched a telephone book arnold rang up the number she showed him  what about the police station he asked turning towards her with the receiver still in his hand oughtnt i to send for some one  not yet she replied we are not supposed to know the man may have come upon some business let us wait and see what the doctor says  he laid down the receiver she had thrown herself into an easychair and with a little impulsive gesture she held out one hand towards him  poor arnold she murmured i am afraid that this is all very bewildering to you and your life was so peaceful until a week ago  he held her fingers tightly notwithstanding the shadows under her eyes and the gleam of terror which still lingered there she was beautiful  i dont care about that he answered fervently i dont care about anything except that i should like to understand a little more clearly what it all means i hate mysteries i dont see why you cant tell me i am your friend if it is necessary for me to say nothing i shall say nothing but i hate the thoughts that come to me sometimes tell me why should that man have been haunting your house the other evening what did he want and tonightwhat made him break into your room  she sighed  if it were only so simple as all that she answered oh i would tell you so willingly but it is not there is so much which i do not understand myself  he leaned a little closer towards her the silence of the room and the house was unbroken  the man will die he said who do you believe could have struck him that blow in your room  i do not know she answered indeed i do not  you heard what groves said arnold continued there is no one in the house except the servants  that man was here she answered why not others listen  there was the sound of shuffling footsteps in the hall she held up her finger cautiously  be very careful before mr weatherley she begged it is an ordinary burglary thisno more  the door was opened mr weatherley in hasty and most unbecoming deshabille bustled in his scanty gray hair was sticking out in patches all over his head he seemed as yet scarcely awake with one hand he clutched at the dressinggown the girdle of which was trailing behind him  what is the meaning of this fenella he demanded why am i fetched from my room in this manner you chetwode what are you doing here  i have brought mrs weatherley home sir arnold answered we noticed a light in her room and we made a discovery there it looks as though there has been an attempted burglary within the last hour or so  which room mr weatherley asked which room is anything missing  nothing fortunately arnold replied the man by some means or other seems to have been hurt  where is he mr weatherley demanded  in my boudoir fenella replied we will all go i have telephoned for a doctor  a doctor what for mr weatherley inquired who needs a doctor  the burglar if he is a burglar she explained gently dont you understand that all we found was a man lying in the centre of the room he has had a fall of some sort  god bless my soul mr weatherley said well come along lets have a look at him  they trooped down the passage groves waiting outside for them opened the door mr weatherley who was first looked all around the apartment  where is this man he demanded where is he     illustration where is this man he demanded page 152  arnold who followed was stricken speechless fenella gave a little cry the couch had been wheeled back to its place the body of the man had disappeared  where is the burglar mr weatherley repeated irritably was there ever any one here who in the name of mischief left that window open  the window through which arnold had entered the room was now wide open they hurried towards it outside all was darkness there was no sound of footsteps no sign of any person about mr weatherley was distinctly annoyed  i should have thought you would have had more sense chetwode he said testily you found a burglar here and instead of securing him properly you send up to me and go ringing up for doctors and in the meantime the man calmly slips off through the window  arnold made no reply mr weatherleys words seemed to come from a long way off he was looking at fenella  the man was dead he muttered  she too was white but she shook her head  we thought so she answered we were wrong  mr weatherley led the way to the front door  as the dead man seems to have cleared out he said without taking very much with him i suggest that we go to bed groves had better ring up the doctor and stop him if he can if not he must explain that he was sent for in error good night chetwode he added pointedly  arnold scarcely remembered his farewells he passed out into the street and stood for several moments upon the pavement he looked back at the house  the man was dead or dying he muttered to himself what does it all mean  he walked slowly away there was a policeman on the other side of the road taxicabs and carriages coming and going he passed the gate of pelham lodge and looked back toward the window of the sittingroom within five minutes the man must have left that room by the window that he could have left it unaided even if alive was impossible yet there was not anything in the avenue or thereabouts to denote that anything unusual had occurred he was on the point of turning away when a sudden thought struck him he reentered the gate softly and walked up the drive arrived at within a few feet of the window he paused and turned to the right a narrow path led him into a shrubbery a few more yards and he reached a wire fence stepping across it he found himself in the next garden here he paused for a moment and listened the house before which he stood was smaller than pelham lodge and woefully out of repair the grass on the lawn was long and dankeven the board containing the notice to let had fallen flat and lay among it as in a jungle the paths were choked with weeds the windows were black and curtainless he made his way to the back of the house and suddenly stopped short this was a night of adventures indeed on a level with the ground the windows of one of the back rooms were boarded up through the chinks he could distinctly see gleams of light standing there holding his breath he could even hear the murmur of voices there were men thereseveral of them to judge by the sound he drew nearer and nearer until he found a chink through which he could see then for the first time he hesitated it was not his affair this there were mysteries connected with pelham lodge and its occupants which were surely no concern of his why interfere danger might come of itdanger and other troubles fenella would have told him if she had wished him to know she herself must have some idea as to the reason of this attempt upon her house why not slip away quietly and forget it it was at least the most prudent course then as he hesitated the memory of sabatinis words so recently spoken came into his mind almost he could see him leaning back in his chair with the faint smile upon his lips you have not the spirit for adventure then arnold hesitated no longer choosing every footstep carefully he crept to the window until he could press his face close to the chink through which the light gleamed out into the garden     chapter xvii  the end of an evening   to see into the room at all arnold had been compelled to step down from the grass on to a narrow tiled path about half a yard wide which led to the back door standing on this and peering through the chink in the boards he gained at last a view of the interior of the house from the first he had entered upon this search with a certain presentiment he looked into the room and shivered it was apparently the kitchen and was unfurnished save for half a dozen rickety chairs and a deal table in the middle of the room upon this was stretched the body of a motionless man there were three others in the room one who appeared to have some knowledge of medicine had taken off his coat and was listening with his ear against the senseless mans heart a brandy bottle stood upon the table they had evidently been doing what they could to restore him to consciousness terrible though the sight was arnold found something else in that little room to kindle his emotion two of the men were unknown to himdarkcomplexioned ordinary middleclass people but the third he recognized with a start it was isaac who stood there a little aloof waiting somberly for what his companions verdict might be  apparently after a time they gave up all hope of the still motionless man they talked together glancing now and then towards his body the window was open at the top and arnold could sometimes hear a word with great difficulty he gathered that they were proposing to remove him and that they were taking the back way presently he saw them lift the body down and wrap it in an overcoat then arnold stole away across the lawn toward a gate in the wall it was locked but it was easy for him to climb over he had barely done so when he saw the three men come out of the back of the house carrying their wounded comrade he waited till he was sure they were coming and then looked around for a hidingplace he was now in a sort of lane ending in a cul de sac at the back of mr weatherleys house there were gardens on one side parallel with the one through which he had just passed and opposite were stables motor sheds and tool houses he slipped a little way down the lane and concealed himself behind a load of wood about forty yards away was a street for which he imagined that they would probably make he held his breath and waited  in a few minutes he saw the door in the wall open one of the men slipped out and looked up and down he apparently signaled that the coast was clear and soon the others followed him they came down the lane walking very slowlya weird and uncanny little procession arnold caught a glimpse of them as they passed the two larger men were supporting their fallen companion between them each with an arm under his armpits so that the fact that he was really being carried was barely noticeable isaac came behind his hands thrust deep into his overcoat pocket a cloth cap drawn over his features so they went on to the end of the lane as soon as they had reached it arnold followed them swiftly when he gained the street they were about twenty yards to the right looking around them it was a fairly populous neighborhood with a row of villas on the other side of the road and a few shops lower down they stood there having carefully chosen a place remote from the gas lamps until at last a taxicab came crawling by they hailed it and isaac engaged the drivers attention apparently with some complicated direction while the others lifted their burden into the taxicab one man got in with him isaac and the other with ordinary goodnights strode away the taxicab turned around and headed westward arnold with a long breath watched them all disappear then he too turned homewards  it was almost midnight when arnold was shown once more into the presence of sabatini sabatini in a black velvet smoking jacket was lying upon a sofa in his library with a recently published edition de luxe of alfred de mussets poems upon his knee he looked up with some surprise at arnolds entrance  why it is my strenuous young friend again he declared have you brought me a message from fenella  arnold shook his head  she does not know that i have come  you have brought me some news on your own account then  i have brought you some news arnold admitted  sabatini looked at him critically  you look terrified he remarked what have you been doing help yourself to a drink youll find everything on the sideboard there  arnold laid down his hat and mixed himself a whiskey and soda he drank it off before he spoke  count sabatini he said turning round i suppose you are used to all this excitement a mans life or death is little to you i have never seen a dead man before tonight it has upset me  naturally naturally sabatini said tolerantly i remember the first man i killedit was in a fair fight too but it sickened me but what have you been doing my young friend to see dead men have you too been joining the army of plunderers  arnold shook his head  i took your sister home he announced we found a light in her sittingroom and the door locked i got in through the window  this is most interesting sabatini declared carefully marking the place in his book and laying it aside what did you find there  a dead man arnold answered a murdered man  you are joking sabatini protested  he had been struck on the forehead arnold continued and dragged half under the couch only his arm was visible at first we had to move the couch to discover him  do you know who he was sabatini asked  no one had any idea arnold answered i think that i was the only one who had ever seen him before the night i dined at mr weatherleys for the first time and met you i was with mrs weatherley in her room and i saw that man steal up to the window as though he were going to break in  this is most interesting sabatini declared evidently a dangerous customer but you say that you found him dead who killed him  there was no one there who could say arnold declared there were no servants in that part of the house there had been no visitors and mr weatherley had been in bed since halfpast nine we telephoned for a doctor and we fetched mr weatherley out of bed then a strange thing happened we took mr weatherley to the room which we had left for less than five minutes and there was no one there the man had been carried away  really sabatini protested your story gets more interesting every moment dont tell me that this is the end  it is not arnold replied it seemed then as though there were nothing more to be done evidently he had either been only stunned and had got up and left the room by the window or he had accomplices who had fetched him away mr weatherley was very much annoyed with us and we had to make excuses to the doctor then i left  well sabatini said you left you didnt come straight here  arnold shook his head  when i got into the road i could see that there was a policeman on duty on the other side of the way and quite a number of people moving backwards and forwards all the time it seemed impossible that they could have brought him out there if he had been fetched away something made me remember what i had noticed on the evening i had dined therethat there was a small empty house next door i walked back up the drive of pelham lodge turned into the shrubbery and there i found that there was an easy way into the next garden i made my way to the back of the house i saw lights in the kitchen there were three of his companions there and the dead man they were trying to see if they could revive him i looked through a chink in the boarded window and i saw everything  trying to revive him sabatini remarked evidently there was some doubt as to his being dead then  i think they had come to the conclusion that he was dead arnold replied for after a time they put on his overcoat and dragged him out by the back entrance down some mews into another street i followed them at a distance they hailed a taxi one man got in with him and drove away the others disappeared i came here  sabatini reached out his hand for a cigarette  i have seldom he declared listened to a more interesting episode you didnt happen to hear the direction given to the driver of the taxicab  i did not  you have no idea i suppose sabatini asked with a sudden keen glance as to the identity of the man whom you believe to be dead  none whatever arnold replied except that it was the same man who was watching the house on the night when i dined there he told me then that he wanted rosario there was something evil in his face when he mentioned the name i saw his hand grasping the windowsill he was wearing a ringa signet ring with a bloodred stone  this is most engrossing sabatini murmured a signet ring with a bloodred stone wasnt there a ring answering to that description upon the finger of the man who stabbed rosario  there was arnold answered  sabatini knocked the ash from his cigarette  the coincidence he remarked if it is a coincidence is a little extraordinary by the bye though you have as yet given me no explanation as to your visit here why do you connect me with this adventure of yours  i do not connect you with it at all arnold answered yet for some reason or other i am sure that your sister knew more about this man and his presence in her sittingroom than she cared to confess when i left there everything was in confusion i have come to tell you the final result so far as i know it you will tell her what you choose what she knows i suppose you know i dont ask for your confidence i have had enough of these horrors tooley street is bad enough but i think i would rather sit in my office and add up figures all day long than go through another such night  sabatini smiled  you are young as yet he said life and death seem such terrible things to you such tragedies such enormous happenings in youth one loses ones sense of proportion life seems so vital the universe so empty without ones own personality take a pocketful of cigarettes my dear mr chetwode and make your way homeward we shall meet again in a day or two i dare say and by that time your little nightmare will not seem so terrible  you will let your sister know arnold begged  she shall know all that you have told me sabatini promised i do not say that it will interest herit may or it may not in any case i thank you for coming  arnold was dismissed with a pleasant nod and passed out into the streets now emptying fast he walked slowly back to his rooms already the sense of unwonted excitement was passing sabatinis strong calm personality was like a wonderful antidote after all it was not his affair it was possible after all that the man was an ordinary burglar and yet if so what was isaac doing with him he glanced in front of him to where the lights of the two great hotels flared up to the sky somewhere just short of them before the window of her room ruth would be sitting watching he quickened his steps perhaps he should find her before he went to bed perhaps he might even see isaac come in  big ben was striking the halfhour past midnight as arnold stood on the top landing of the house at the corner of adam street and listened to the right was his own bare apartment on the left the rooms where isaac and ruth lived together he struck a match and looked into his own apartment there was a note twisted up for him on his table scribbled in pencil on a half sheet of paper he opened it and read        if you are not too late will you knock at the door and       wish me good night isaac will be late perhaps he will       not be home at all  he stepped back and knocked softly at the opposite door in a moment or two he heard the sound of her stick she opened the door and came out her eyes shone through the darkness at him but her face was white and strained he shook his head  ruth he said you heard the time and you promised to go to bed at ten oclock  she smiled he passed his arm around her holding her up  tonight i was afraid she whispered i do not know what it was but there seemed to be strange voices about everywhere i was afraid for isaac and afraid for you  my dear girl he laughed what was there to fear for me i had a very good dinner with a very charming man afterwards we went to a musichall for a short time i went back to his rooms and here i am just in time to wish you good night what could the voices have to tell you about that  she shook her head  sometimes she said there is danger in the simplest things one does i dont understand what it is she went on a little wearily but i feel that i am losing you you are slipping away and day by day isaac gets more mysterious and when he comes home sometimes his face is like the face of a wolf there is a new desire born in him and i am afraid i think that if i am left alone here many more nights like this i shall go mad i tried to undress arnie but i couldnt i threw myself down on the bed and i had to bite my handkerchief i have been trembling oh if you could hear those voices if you could understand the fears that are nameless how terrible they are  she was shaking all over he passed his other arm around her and lifted her up  come and sit with me in my room for a little time he said i will carry you back presently  she kissed him on the forehead  dear arnold she whispered for a few minutes thennot too long tonight i am afraid always i feel that something will happen tell me this  what is it dear  why should isaac press me so hard to tell him where you were going tonight you passed him on the stairs didnt you  arnold nodded  he was with another man he said with a little shiver did that man come up to his rooms  they both came in together ruth said they talked in a corner for some time the man who was with isaac seemed terrified about something then isaac came over to me and asked about you  what did you tell him arnold asked  i thought it best to know nothing at all she replied i simply said that you were going to have dinner with some of your new friends  does he know who they are  ruth nodded  yes we have spoken of that together she admitted i had to tell him of your good fortune he knows how well you have been getting on with mr and mrs weatherley listenis that some one coming  he turned around with her still in his arms and started so violently that if her fingers had not been locked behind his neck he must have dropped her within a few feet of them was isaac he had come up those five flights of stone steps without making a sound even in that first second or two of amazement arnold noticed that he was wearing canvas shoes with rubber soles he stood with his long fingers gripping the worn balustrade only two steps below them and his face was like the face of some snarling animal  ruth he demanded hoarsely what are you doing out here at this time of nightwith him  she slipped from arnolds arms and leaned on her stick to all appearance she was the least discomposed of the three  isaac she answered uncle isaac i was lonelylonely and terrified you left me so strangely and it is so silent up here i left a little note and asked arnold when he came home to bid me good night he knocked at my door two minutes ago  isaac threw open the door of their apartments  get in he ordered ill have an end put to it ruth look at him he cried mockingly pointing to arnolds evening clothes what sort of a friend is that do you think for us he wears the fetters of his class he is a hangeron at the tables of our enemies  you can abuse me as much as you like arnold replied calmly and i shall still believe that i am an honest man are you isaac  isaacs eyes flashed venom  honesty what is honesty he snarled what is it i ask you is the millionaire honest who keeps the laws because he has no call to break them is that honesty is he a better man than the father who steals to feed his hungry children is the one honest and the other a thief you smug hypocrite  arnold was silent for a moment it flashed into his mind that here from the other side came very nearly the same doctrine as sabatini had preached to him across his roseshaded dining table  it is too late to argue with you isaac he said pleasantly besides i think that you and i are too far apart but you must leave me ruth for my little friend she would be lonely without me and i can do her no harm  isaac opened his lipslips that were set in an ugly sneerbut he met the steady fire of arnolds eyes and the words he would have spoken remained unsaid  get to your room then he ordered  he passed on as though to enter his own apartments then suddenly he stopped and listened there was the sound of a footstep a heavy marching footstep coming along the terrace below with another look now upon his face he slunk to the window and peered down the footsteps came nearer and nearer and arnold could hear him breathing like a hunted animal then they passed and he stood up wiping the sweat from his forehead  i have been hurrying he muttered half apologetically we had a crowded meeting good night  he turned into his rooms and closed the door arnold looked after him for a moment and then up the street below when he turned into his own rooms he was little enough inclined for sleep he drew up his battered chair to the window threw it open and sat looking out the bridge and the river were alike silent now the sky signs had gone the murky darkness blotted out the whole scene against which the curving arc of lights shone with a fitful ghostly light for a moment his fancy served him an evil trick he saw the barge with the bloodred sails a cargo of evil beings thronged its side he saw their faces leering at him sabatini was there standing at the helm calm and scornful there was the dead man and isaac groves the butler fenella herselfpale as death her hands clasping at her bosom as though in pain arnold turned shivering away his head sank into his hands it seemed to him that poison had crept into those dreams     chapter xviii  discussing the mystery   at precisely halfpast nine the next morning mr weatherley entered his office in tooley street his appearance as he passed through the outer office gave rise to some comment  the governor looks quite himself again young tidey remarked turning round on his stool  mr jarvis who was collecting the letters nodded  its many months since ive heard him come in whistling he declared  arnold in the outer office received his chiefs morning salutation with some surprise mr weatherley was certainly to all appearance in excellent spirits  glad to see your late hours dont make any difference in the morning chetwode he said pleasantly you seem to be seeing quite a good deal of the wife eh  arnold was almost dumbfounded any reference to the events of the preceding evening was for the moment beyond him mr weatherley calmly hung up his silk hat took out the violets from the buttonhole of his overcoat and carried them to his desk  come along jarvis he invited as the latter entered with a rustling heap of correspondence well sort the letters as quickly as possible this morning you come on the other side chetwode and catch hold of those which we keep to deal with together those mr jarvis can handle ill just initial let me seeyoure sure those bills of lading are in order jarvis  mr jarvis plunged into a few particulars to which his chief listened with keen attention for half an hour or so they worked without a pause mr weatherley was quite at his best his instructions were sage and his grasp of every detail referred to in the various letters was lucid and complete when at last mr jarvis left with his pile he did not hesitate to spread the good news mr weatherley had got over his fit of depression from whatever cause it had arisen a misunderstanding with his wife perhaps or a certain amount of weariness entailed by his new manner of living at all events something had happened to set matters right mr jarvis was quite fluent upon the subject and every one started his days work with renewed energy  mr weatherleys energy did not evaporate with the departure of his confidential clerk he motioned arnold to a chair and for another threequarters of an hour he dictated replies to the letters which he had sorted out for personal supervision when at last this was done he leaned back in his seat fetched out a box of cigars carefully selected one and lit it  now you had better get over to your corner and grind that lot out chetwode he said pleasantly how are you getting on with the typing eh  i am getting quicker arnold replied still wondering whether the whole events of last week had not been a dream i think with a little more practice i shall be able to go quite fast enough  just so his employer assented by the bye is it my fancy or werent you reading the newspaper when i came in no time for newspapers you know after nine oclock  arnold rose to his feet this was more than he could bear  i am sorry if i seemed inattentive sir he said under the circumstances i could not help dwelling a little over this paragraph perhaps you will look at it yourself sir  he brought it over to the desk mr weatherley put on his spectacles with great care and drew the paper towards him  hm he ejaculated my eyesight isnt so good as it was chetwode and your beastly hapenny papers have such small print read it out to meread it out to me while i smoke  he leaned back in his padded chair his hands folded in front of him his cigar in the corner of his mouth arnold smoothed the paper out and read                  terrible death of an unknown man                     found dead in a taxicab        early this morning a taxicab driver entered the police       station at finchley road north and alleged that a       passenger whom he had picked up some short time before       was dead inspector challis who was on duty at the time       hastened out to the vehicle and found that the drivers       statement was apparently true the deceased was carried       into the police station and a doctor was sent for the       chauffeurs statement was that about midnight he was       hailed in the grove end road hampstead by four men one       of whom evidently the deceased he imagined to be the       worse for drink two of them entered the taxicab and one       of the others directed him to drive to finchley after       some distance however the driver happened to glance       inside and saw that only one of his passengers was       there he at once stopped the vehicle looked in at the       window and finding that the man was unconscious drove       on to the police station        later information seems to point to foul play and there       is no doubt whatever that an outrage has been committed       there was a wound upon the deceaseds forehead which the       doctor pronounces as the cause of death and which had       evidently been dealt within the last hour or so with some       blunt instrument the taxicab driver has been detained       and a full description of the murdered mans companions       has been issued to the police it is understood that       nothing was found upon the deceased likely to help       towards his identification  arnold looked up as he finished mr weatherley was still smoking he seemed indeed very little disturbed  a sensational story that chetwode he remarked youre not supposing are you that it was the same man who broke into my house last night  i know that it was sir arnold replied  you know that it was mr weatherley repeated slowly come what do you mean by that  i mean that after i left your house last night sir arnold explained i realized the impossibility of that man having been carried down your drive and out into the road with a policeman on duty directly opposite and a cabstand within a few yards i happened to remember that there was an empty house next door and it struck me that it might be worth while examining the premises  mr weatherley withdrew the cigar from his mouth  you did that eh  i did arnold admitted i made my way to the back and i found a light in the room which presumably had been the kitchen from a chink in the boardedup window i saw several men in the room including the man whom we discovered in your wifes boudoir and who had been spirited away he was lying motionless upon the table and one of the others was apparently trying to restore him when they found that it was useless they took him off with them by the back way into grove lane i saw two of them enter a taxicab and the other two make off  and what did you do then mr weatherley asked  i went and told count sabatini what i had seen arnold replied  and after that  i went home  you told no one else but count sabatini mr weatherley persisted  no one arnold answered i bought a paper on my way to business this morning and read what i have just read to you  you havent been rushing about ringing up to give information or anything of that sort  i have done nothing arnold asserted i waited to lay the matter before you  mr weatherley knocked the ash from his cigar and discovering that it was out carefully relit it  chetwode he said i have advanced you from something a little better than an officeboy very rapidly because it seemed to me that you had qualities the time has arrived to test them the secret of success in life is minding your own business i am going to ask you to mind your own business in this matter  you mean arnold asked that you do not wish me to give any information to say anything about last night  i do not wish my name or the name of my wife or the name of my house to be associated with this affair at all mr weatherley replied mrs weatherley would be very much upset and it is besides entirely unnecessary  arnold hesitated for a moment  it is a serious matter sir if you will permit me to say so he said slowly the man was murderedthat seems to be clearand from what you and i know it certainly seems that he was murdered in your house  mr weatherley shook his head  that is not my impression he declared the man was found dead in mrs weatherleys boudoir but there was no one in the house or apparently within reach who was either likely to have committed such a crime or who even could possibly have done so on the other hand there are this mans companions desperate fellows no doubt within fifty yards all the time my own impression is that he was killed first and then placed in the spot where he was found however that may be i dont want my house made the rendezvous of all the interviewers and sightseers in the neighborhood you and i will keep our counsel arnold chetwode  might i ask arnold said if you knew this manif you had ever come into contact with him or seen him before  certainly not mr weatherley replied what business could i possibly have with a person of that description he seems to have been if not an habitual criminal himself at least an associate of criminals and he was without doubt a foreigner between you and me chetwode i havent the least doubt that the fellow was one of a gang of the worst class of burglars wherever he got that blow from it was probably no more than he deserved  but mr weatherley arnold protested dont you think that you ought to have an investigation among your household  my dear young fellow mr weatherley answered testily i keep no menservants at all except old groves whos as meekspirited as a baby and a footman whom my wife has just engaged and who was out for the evening a blow such as the paper describes was certainly never struck by a woman and there was just as certainly no other man in my house there is nothing to inquire about as a matter of fact i am not curious the man is dead and theres an end of it  you will bear in mind sir arnold said that if it comes to light afterwards as it very probably may that the man was first discovered in mrs weatherleys boudoir the scandal and gossip will be a great deal worse than if you came forward and told the whole truth now  i take my risk of that mr weatherley replied coolly there isnt a soul except groves who saw him and groves is my man now be so good as to get on with those letters chetwode and consider the incident closed  arnold withdrew to his typewriter and commenced his task the day had commenced with a new surprise to him the nervous shattered mr weatherley of yesterday was gone after a happening in his house which might well have had a serious effect upon him he seemed not only unmoved but absolutely restored to cheerfulness he was reading the paper for himself now and the room was rapidly becoming full of tobacco smoke arnold spelled out his letters one by one until the last was finished then he took them over to his employer to sign one by one mr weatherley read them through made an alteration here and there then signed them with his large sprawling hand just as he had finished the last the telephone by his side rang he took the receiver and placed it to his ear arnold waited until he had finished mr weatherley himself said little he seemed to be listening towards the end he nodded slightly  yes i quite understand he said quite that was entirely my own opinion no case at all you say good  he replaced the receiver and leaned back in his chair for the first time when he spoke his voice was a little hoarse  chetwode he said ring up my house16 post office hampstead ask groves to tell his mistress that i thought she might be interested to hear that mr starling will be discharged this morning the police are abandoning the case against him at present for lack of evidence  arnold stood for a moment quite still then he took up the receiver and obeyed his orders groves voice was as quiet and respectful as ever he departed with the message and arnold rang off then he turned to mr weatherley  have you any objection to my ringing up some one else and telling him too he asked  mr weatherley looked at him  you are like all of them he remarked i suppose you think hes a sort of demigod i never knew a young man yet that he couldnt twist round his little finger you want to ring up count sabatini i suppose  i should like to arnold admitted  very well go on mr weatherley grumbled let him know perhaps it will be as well  arnold took from his pocket the note which sabatini had written to him and which contained his telephone number then he rang up the call was answered by his valet  in one moment sir he said the telephone rings into his excellencys bedchamber he shall speak to you himself  a minute or two passed then the slow musical voice of sabatini intervened  who is that speaking  it is iarnold chetwode arnold answered i am speaking from the office in the city i heard some news a few minutes ago which i thought might interest you  good sabatini replied stifling what seemed to be a yawn you have awakened me from a long sleep so let your news be good my young friend  mr weatherley hears from a solicitor at bow street that the police have abandoned the charge against mr starling arnold announced he will be set at liberty as soon as the court opens  there was a moments silence it was as though the person at the other end had gone away  did you hear arnold asked  yes i heard sabatini answered i am very much obliged to you for ringing me up my young friend i quite expected to hear your news during the day no one would really suppose that a respectable man like starling would be guilty of such a ridiculous action however it is pleasant to know i thank you i take my coffee and rolls this morning with more appetite  arnold set down the telephone mr weatherley had risen to his feet and walked as far as the window on his way back to his place he looked at the little safe which he had made over to his secretary  youve got my papers there all right chetwode he asked  certainly sir arnold answered i hope however we may never need to use them  mr weatherley smiled he was busy choosing another cigar     chapter xix  in the country   they sat on the edge of the wood and a west wind made music for them overhead among the fir trees from their feet a clover field sloped steeply to a honeysucklewreathed hedge beyond that meadowland riven by the curving stream which stretched like a thread of silver to the blue hazy distance arnold laughed softly with the pleasure of it but the wonder kept ruth tonguetied  i feel she murmured as though i were in a theatre for the first time everything is strange  it is the theatre of nature arnold replied if you close your eyes and listen you can hear the orchestra there is a lark singing above my head and a thrush somewhere back in the wood there  and see in the distance there are houses ruth continued softly just fancy arnold people if they had no work to do could live here could live always out of sight of the hideous smoky city out of hearing of its thousand discords  he smiled  there are a great many who feel like that he said his eyes fixed upon the horizon and then as the days go by they find that there is something missing the city of a thousand discords generally has one clear cry ruth  for you perhaps she answered because you are young and because you are ambitious but for me who lie on my back all day long think of the glory of this  arnold slowly sat up  upon my word he exclaimed why not why shouldnt you stay in the country for the summer i hate london too there are cheap tickets and bicycles and all sorts of things i wonder whether we couldnt manage it  she said nothing his thoughts were busy with the practical side of it there was an opportunity here too to prepare her for what he felt sure was inevitable  you know ruth he said i dont wish to say anything against isaac and i dont want to make you uneasy but you know as well as i do that he has a strange maggot in his brain when i first heard him talk i thought of him as a sort of fanatic it seems to me that he has changed i am not sure that such changes as have taken place in him lately have not been for the worse  tell me what you mean she begged  i mean he continued that isaac who perhaps in himself may be incapable of harm might be an easy prey to those who worked upon his wild ideas hasnt it struck you that for the last few days  she clutched at his hand and stopped him  dont she implored these last few days have been horrible isaac has not left his room except to creep out sometimes into mine he keeps his door locked what he does i dont know but if he hears a step on the stairs he slinks away and his face is like the face of a hunted wolf arnold do you think that he has been getting into trouble  i am afraid arnold said regretfully that it is not impossible tell me ruth you are very fond of him  he was my mothers brotherthe only relative i have in the world she answered what could i do without him  he doesnt seem to want you particularly just now at any rate arnold said i dont see why we shouldnt take rooms out at one of these little villages i could go back and forth quite easily youd like it wouldnt you ruth fancy lying in a low comfortable chair and looking up at the blue sky and listening to the birds and the humming of bees the hours would slip by  i should love it she murmured  then why not he cried ill stop the car at the next village we come to and make inquiries  she laid her hand softly upon his  arnold dear she begged it sounds very delightful and yet cant you see it is impossible i am not quite like other women perhaps but after all i am a woman it is for your sakefor your sake mindthat i think of this  he turned and looked at herlooked at her perhaps with new eyes she was stretched almost at full length upon the grass her head which had been supported by her clasped hands now turned towards him as she lay there with her stick out of sight her lips a little parted her eyes soft with the sunlight a faint touch of color in her cheeks he suddenly realized the significance of her words her bosom was rising and falling quickly her plain black dress simply made though it was showed no defect of figure her throat was soft and white the curve of her body was even graceful the revelation of these things came as a shock to arnold yet it was curious that he found a certain pleasure in it  i had forgotten ruth he said slowly but does it matter you have no one in the world but isaac and i have no one in the world at all dont you think we can afford to do what seems sensible  her eyes never left his face she made no sign either of assent or dissent  arnold she declared it is true that i am an outcast i have scarcely a relative in the world but what you say about yourself is hard to believe i have never asked you questions because it is not my business but there are many little things by which one tells i think that somewhere you have a family belonging to you with a name even if for any reason you do not choose just now to claim them  he made no direct reply he watched for some moments a whitesailed boat come tacking down the narrow strip of river  i am my own master ruth he said i have no one else to please or to consider i understand what you have just told me but if i gave you my word that i would try and be to you what isaac might have been if he had not been led away by these strange ideas wouldnt you trust me ruth  it isnt that she exclaimed trust you why you know that i would it isnt that i mind for myself either what people would sayor anything but i am thinking of your new friends of your future if they knew that you were living down in the country with a girl even though she were an invalid who was no relation at all dont you think that it might make a difference  of course not he replied and in any case what should i care it would be the making of you ruth you would be able to pick up your strength so that when our moneybox is full you would be able to have that operation and never dare to call yourself an invalid again  she half closed her eyes the spell of summer was in the air the spell of life was stirring slowly in her frozen blood  ah arnold she murmured i do not think that you must talk like that it makes me feel so much like yielding somehow the dreams out here seem even more wonderful than the visions which come floating up the river theres more life here dont you feel it something seems to creep into your heart into your pulses and tell you what life is  he made no answer the world of the last few throbbing weeks seemed far enough away with him too he picked a handful of clover and thrust it into the bosom of her gown then he rose reluctantly to his feet and held out his hands  i think he said that the great gates of freedom must be somewhere out here but just now one is forced to remember that we are slaves  he drew her to her feet placed the stick in her hand and supported her other arm they walked for a step or two down the narrow path which led through the clover field to the lane below then with a little laugh he caught her up in his arms  it will be quicker if i carry you ruth he proposed the weeds twine their way all the time around your stick  she linked her arms around his neck her cheek touched his for a moment and he was surprised to find it as hot as fire he stepped out bravely enough but with every step it seemed to him that she was growing heavier her hands were still tightly linked around his neck but her limbs were inert she seemed to be falling away he held her tighter his breath began to grow shorter the perfume of the clover fragrant and delicate grew stronger with every step they took somehow he felt that that walk along the narrow path was carving its way into his life the fingers at the back of his neck were cold yet she too was breathing as though she had been running her eyes were half closed he looked once into her face bent over her until his lips nearly touched hers he set his teeth hard some instinct warned him of the dangers of the moment her stick slipped and a lump arose in his throat the moment had passed he kissed her softly upon the forehead  dear ruth he whispered  she turned very pale and very soon afterward she insisted upon being set down they walked slowly to where the motor car was waiting at the corner of the lane ruth began to talk nervously  it was charming of mrs weatherley she declared to lend you this car tell me how it happened arnie  i simply told her he replied that i was going to take a friend who needed a little fresh air out into the country and she insisted upon sending this car instead of letting me hire a taxicab it was over the telephone and i couldnt refuse besides mr weatherley was in the office and he insisted upon it too they only use this one in london and i know that they are away somewhere for the weekend  it has been so delightful ruth murmured now i am going to lie back among these beautiful cushions and just watch and think  the car glided on along the country lane passing through leafy hamlets across a great breezy moorland from the top of which they could see the thames winding its way into oxfordshire a sinuous belt of silver then they sped down into the lower country and arnold looked at the milestones in some surprise  we dont seem to be getting any nearer to london he remarked  ruth only shook her head  it will come soon enough she said with a little shiver it will pass this like everything else  they had dropped to the level now and suddenly without warning the car swung through a low white gate up along an avenue of shrubs arnold leaned forward  where are you taking us he asked the driver there is some mistake  but there was no mistake a turn of the wheel and the car was slowing down before the front of a long ivycovered house with a lawn as smooth as velvet and beyond the soft murmur of the river ruth clutched at his arm  arnold she exclaimed what does this mean who lives here  i have no idea he answered unless  the windows in front of the house were all of them open and all of them level with the drive through the nearest of them at that moment stepped fenella she stood for a moment framed in the long french window hung with clematisa wonderful picture even for arnold a revelation to ruthin her cool muslin frock open at the throat and held together by a brooch with a great green stone she wore no hat and her wonderful hair seemed to have caught the sunlight in its meshes her eyebrows were a little raised her expression was a little supercilious faintly inquisitive already she had looked past arnold her eyes were fixed upon the girl by his side  i began to think that you were lost she said gayly wont you present me to your friend arnold     chapter xx  womans wiles   arnold sprang to his feet it was significant that after his first surprise he spoke to fenella with his head half turned towards his companion and an encouraging smile upon his lips  i had no idea that we were coming here he said we should not have thought of intruding it was your chauffeur who would not even allow us to ask a question  he obeyed my orders fenella replied i meant it for a little surprise for you i thought that it would be pleasant after your drive to have you call here and rest for a short time you must present me to your friend  arnold murmured a word of introduction ruth moved a little in her seat she lifted herself with her left hand leaning upon her stick fenellas expression changed as though by magic her cool goodhumored but almost impertinent scrutiny suddenly vanished she moved to the side of the motor car and held out both her hands  i am so glad to see you here she declared i hope that you will like some tea after your long ride perhaps you would prefer mr chetwode to help you out  you are very kind ruth murmured i am sorry to be such a trouble to everybody  arnold lifted her bodily out of the car and placed her on the edge of the lawn fenella a long parasol in her hand was looking pleasantly down at her guest  you will find it quite picturesque here i think she said it is not really the river itself which comes to the end of the lawn but a little stream it is so pretty though and so quiet i thought you would like to have tea down there but my poor child she exclaimed your hair is full of dust you must come to my room it is on the ground floor here mr chetwode and i together can help you so far  they turned back toward the house and passed into the cool white hall the air of which was fragrant with the perfume of geraniums and clematis on the threshold of fenellas room they were alone for a moment fenella was summoning her maid ruth clung nervously to arnold the room into which they looked was like a fairy chamber full of laces and perfume and fine linen  arnold she whispered you are sure that you did not know about coming here  i swear that i had no idea he answered i would not have thought of bringing you without telling you first  then fenella returned and he was banished into the garden at the end of the lawn he found mr weatherley half asleep in a wicker chair the latter was apparently maintaining his good spirits  glad to see you chetwode he said sort of plot of my wifes i think your young lady friend in the house  mrs weatherley was kind enough to take her to her room arnold replied we have had a most delightful ride and i suppose it was dusty although we never noticed it  mr weatherley relit his cigar which had gone out while he dozed  thought wed like a little country air ourselves for the weekend he remarked will you smoke  arnold shook his head  not just now thank you sir is that the river through the trees there  mr weatherley nodded  its about a hundred yards down the stream he replied bourne end is the nearest station the cottage belongs to my brotherinlawsabatini i believe hes coming down later on any news at the office yesterday morning  there was nothing whatever requiring your attention sir arnold said there are a few letters which we have kept over for tomorrow but nothing of importance  mr weatherley pursed his lips and nodded he asked a further question or two concerning the business and then turned his head at the sound of approaching footsteps ruth looking very pale and fragile was leaning on the arm of a manservant fenella walked on the other side her lace parasol drooping over her shoulder her head turned towards ruths whose shyness she was doing her best to melt mr weatherley rose hastily from his chair  god bless my soul he declared i didnt knowyou didnt tell me  miss lalonde has been a great sufferer arnold said she has been obliged to spend a good deal of her time lying down for that reason today has been such a pleasure to her  he hurried forward and took the butlers place together they installed her in the most comfortable chair mr weatherley came over and shook hands with her  pretty place this miss lalonde isnt it he remarked its a real nice change for business men like mr chetwode and myself to get down here for an hour or twos quiet  it is wonderfully beautiful she answered it is so long since i was out of london that perhaps i appreciate it more even than either of you  what part of london do you live in fenella asked her  my uncle and i have rooms in the same house as mr chetwode she replied it is in adam street off the strand  not much air there this hot weather i dont suppose mr weatherley remarked  we are on the top floor she replied and it is the end house nearest to the river still one feels the change here  tea was brought out by the butler assisted by a trim parlormaid fenella presided the note of domesticity which her action involved seemed to arnold for some reason or other quaintly incongruous arnold waited upon them and fenella talked all the time to the pale silent girl at her side gradually ruth overcame her shyness it was impossible not to feel grateful to this beautiful gracious woman who tried so hard to make her feel at her ease the time slipped by pleasantly enough then fenella rose to her feet  you must carry miss lalonde and her chair down to the very edge of the lawn where she can see the river she told arnold afterwards i am going to take you to see my little rose garden i say mine but it is really my brothers only it was my idea when he first took the place mr weatherley is going down to the boatbuilders to see some motorlauncheshorrible things they are but necessary if we stay here for the summer would you like some books or magazines miss lalonde or do you think you would care to come with us if we helped you very carefully  ruth shook her head  i should like to sit quite close to the river she said shyly just where you said and close my eyes you dont know how beautiful it is to get the roar of london out of ones ears and be able to hear nothing except these soft summer sounds it is like a wonderful rest  they arranged her comfortably mr weatherley returned to the house fenella led the way through a little iron gate to a queer miniature garden a lawn brilliant with flowerbeds ending in a pergola of roses they passed underneath it and all around them the soft drooping blossoms filled the whole air with fragrance at the end was the river and a wooden seat she motioned to him to sit by her side  you are not angry with me she asked a little timidly  angry why should i be he answered the afternoon has been delightful i cant tell you how grateful i feel  all the same she said i think you know that i laid a plot to bring you here because i was curious about this companion of yours for whose sake you refused my invitation however you see i am penitent poor girl how can one help feeling sorry for her you forgive me  i forgive you he answered  she closed her parasol and leaned back in her corner of the seat she seemed to be studying his expression  there is something different about you this afternoon she said i miss a look from your face something in your tone when you are talking to me  he shook his head  i am not conscious of any difference  she laughed softly but she seemed even then a little annoyed  you are not appreciating me she declared do you know that here in the wilderness i have put on a paquin muslin gown white shoes from paris white silk stockingsof which you can see at least two inches she added glancing downwards i have risked my complexion by wearing no hat so that you can see my hair really at its best i looked in the glass before you came and even my vanity was satisfied now i bring you away with me and find you a seat in a bower of roses and you look up into that elm tree as though you were more anxious to find out where the thrush was singing than to look at me  he laughed through the raillery of her words he could detect a certain halfgirlish earnestness which seemed to him delightful  try and remember he said how wonderful a day like this must seem to any one like myself who has spent day after day for many months in tooley street i have been sitting up on the hills listening to the wind in the trees you cant imagine the difference when youve been used to hearing nothing but the rumble of drays on their way to bermondsey  she looked up at him  you know she declared you are rather a mysterious person i cannot make up my mind that you are forced to live the life you do  you do not suppose he replied that any sane person would choose it it is well enough now thanks to you he added dropping his voice a little a week ago i was earning twentyeight shillings a week checking invoices and copying lettersan errand boys work pure unadulterated drudgery working in a wretched atmosphere without much hope of advancement or anything else  but even then you leave part of my question unanswered she insisted you were not born to this sort of thing  i was not he admitted but what does it matter  you dont care to tell me your history she asked lazily sometimes i am curious about it  if i refuse he answered it may give you a false impression i will tell you a little if i may a few sentences will be enough  i should really like to hear she told him  very well then he replied my father was a clergyman his family was good he and i lived almost alone he had an income and his stipend but he was ambitious for me and by some means or other while i was away he was led to invest all his money with one of these wretched bucketshop companies a telegram fetched me home unexpectedly just as i was entering for my degree i found my father seriously ill and almost brokenhearted i stayed with him and in a fortnight he died there was just enoughbarely enoughto pay what he owed and nothing left of his small fortune his brother my uncle came down to the funeral and i regret to say that even then i quarreled with him he made use of language concerning my father and his folly which i could not tolerate my father was very simple and very credulous and very honorable he was just the sort of man who becomes the prey of these wretched circularmongering sharks what he did he did for my sake my uncle spoke of him with contempt spoke as though he were charged with the care of me through my fathers foolishness i am afraid i made no allowance for my uncles peculiar temperament the moment the funeral was over i turned him out of the house i have no other relatives i came to london sooner than remain down in the country and be found a position out of charity which is i suppose what would have happened i took a room and looked for work naturally i was glad to get anything i used to make about forty calls a day till i called at your husbands office in tooley street and got a situation  she nodded  i thought it was something like that she remarked supposing i had not happened to discover you i wonder how long you would have gone on  not much longer he admitted to tell you the truth i should have enlisted but for that poor little girl whom i brought down with me this afternoon  his tone had softened there was the slightest trace of a frown upon her face as she looked along the riverside  but tell me she asked what is your connection with her  one of sympathy and friendliness only he answered i never saw her till i took the cheapest room i could find at the top of a gaunt house near the strand the rest of the top floor is occupied by this girl and her uncle he is a socialist agitator engaged on one of the trades union papersa nervous unbalanced creature on fire with strange ideasthe worst companion in the world for any one sometimes he is away for days together sometimes when he is at home he talks like a prophet half mad half inspired as though he were tugging at the pillars which support the world the girl and he are alone as i am alone and there is something which brings people very close together when they are in that state i found her fallen upon the landing one day and unable to reach her rooms and i carried her in and talked since then she looks for me every evening and we spend some part of the time together  is she educated  excellently he answered she was brought up in a convent after her parents death she has read a marvellous collection of books and she is very quickwitted and appreciative  but you she said are no longer a waif these things are passing for you you cannot carry with you to the new world the things which belong to the old  no prosperity should ever come to me he declared firmly in which that child would not share to some extent with the first two hundred pounds i possess if ever i do possess such a sum he added with a little laugh i am going to send her to vienna to the great hospital there  she shrugged her shoulders  two hundred pounds is not a large sum she remarked would you like me to lend it to you  he shook his head  she would not hear of it he said in her way she is very proud  it may come of its own accord she whispered softly you may even have an opportunity of earning it  i am doing well enough just now he remarked thanks to mr weatherley but sums of money like that do not fall from the clouds  they were both silent she seemed to be listening to the murmur of the stream his head was lifted to the elm tree from somewhere among whose leafy recesses a bird was singing  one never knows she said softly you yourself have seen and heard of strange things happening within the last few days  he came back to earth with a little start  it is true he confessed  there is life still she continued throbbing sometimes in the dull places adventures which need only the strong arm and the mans courage one might come to you and adventures do not go unrewarded  you talk like your brother he remarked  why not she replied andrea and i have much in common do you know that sometimes you provoke me a little  i  she nodded  you have so much the air of a conqueror she said you look as though you had courage and determination one could see that by your mouth and yet you are so much like the men of your nation so stolid so certain to move along the narrow lines which convention has drawn for you oh if i could she went on leaning towards him and looking intently into his face i would borrow the magic from somewhere and mix a little in your wine so that you should drink and feel the desire for new things so that the world of tooley street should seem to you as though it belonged to a place inhabited only by inferior beings so that you should feel new blood in your veins hot blood crying for adventures a new heart beating to a new music i would like if i could arnold to bring those things into your life  he turned and looked at her her face was within a few inches of his she was in earnest the gleam in her eyes was halfprovocative half a challenge arnold rose uneasily to his feet  i must go back he said a little thickly i forgot that ruth is so shy she will be frightened alone  he walked away down the pergola without even waiting for her it was very rude but she only leaned back in her chair and laughed in a way it was a triumph     chapter xxi  arnold speaks out   ruth was still alone and her welcome was almost pathetic she stretched out her armslong thin arms they seemed in the tight black sleeves of her worn gown she had discarded her carefully mended gloves and her hands were bare  arnold she murmured how long you have been away  he threw himself on the grass by her side  silly little woman he answered dont tell me that you are not enjoying it  it is all wonderful she whispered but cant you see that i am out of place when could we go arnie  are you so anxious to get away he asked lazily  in a way i should be content to stay here for ever she answered if you and i only could be herewhy arnold it is like heaven just close your eyes as i have been doinglike that now listen there isnt any undernote none of that ceaseless awful monotony of sound that seems like the falling of weary mens feet upon the eternal pavement listenthere is a bird singing somewhere in that tree and the water goes lapping and lapping and lapping as though it had something pleasant to say but were too lazy to say it and every now and then if you listen very intently you can hear laughing voices through the trees there from the river laughter from people who are happy who are sailing on somewhere to find their city of pleasure and the perfumes arnold i dont know what the rose garden is like but even from here i can smell it it is wonderful  yet you ask me when we are going he reminded her  she shivered for a moment  it is not my world she declared i am squeezed for a moment into a little corner of it but it is not mine and i have nothing to do with it she is so beautiful that woman and so gracious she talks to me out of pity but when i first came she looked at me and there was a challenge in her eyes what did it mean arnold is she fond of you is she going to be fond of you  he laughed a little impatiently  my dear ruth he said she is my employers wife she has been kind to me because i think that she is naturally kind and because lately she has not found among her friends many people of her own age beyond that there is nothing there is never likely to be anything she mixes in a world where she can have all the admiration she desires and all the friends  yet she looks at you ruth persisted in a troubled tone as though she had some claim as though i even poor i were an interloper for the tiny share i might have of your thoughts or sympathy i do not understand it  he touched her hand lightly with his  you are too sensitive dear he said and a little too imaginative you must remember that she is half a foreigner her moods change every moment and her expression with them she was curious to see you i have tried to explain to her what friends we are i am sure that her interest is a friendly one  a motor horn immediately behind startled them both they turned their heads a very handsome car driven by a man in white livery had swept up the little drive and had come to a standstill in front of the hall door from the side nearest to them count sabatini descended and stood for a moment looking around him the car moved on towards the stables sabatini came slowly across the lawn  who is it she whispered how handsome he is  he is mrs weatherleys brothercount sabatini arnold replied  he came very slowly and recognizing arnold waved his gray homburg hat with a graceful salute he was wearing cool summer clothes of light gray with a black tie boots with white linen gaiters and a flower in his coat even after his ride from london he looked immaculate and spotless he greeted arnold kindly and without any appearance of surprise  i heard that you were to be here he said my sister told me of her little plot i hope that you approve of my bungalow  i think that it is wonderful arnold answered i have never seen anything of the river beforethis part of it at any rate  sabatini turned slightly towards ruth as though expecting an introduction his lips were half parted he had the air of one about to make a remark then suddenly a curious change seemed to come over his manner his natural ease seemed to have entirely departed he stood stiff and rigid and there was something forbidding in his face as he looked down at the girl who had glanced timidly towards him a wordit was inaudible but it sounded like part of a womans nameescaped him he had the appearance during those few seconds of a man who looks through the present into a past world it was all over before even they could appreciate the situation with a little smile he had leaned down towards ruth  you will do me the honor he murmured of presenting me to your companion  arnold spoke a word or two of introduction sabatini pulled up a chair and sat down at once by the girls side he had seen the stick and seemed to have taken in the whole situation in a moment  please be very goodnatured he begged turning to arnold and go and find my sister she will like to know that i am here i am going to talk to miss lalonde for a time if she will let me you dont mind my being personal he went on his voice soft with sympathy i had a very dear cousin once who was unable to walk for many years and since then it has always interested me to find any one suffering in the same way  there was a simple directness about his speech which seemed to open the subject so naturally that ruth found herself talking without effort of her accident and the trouble it had brought they drifted so easily into conversation that arnold left them almost at once he had only a little distance to go before he found fenella returning she was carrying a great handful of roses which she had just gathered and to his relief there was no expression of displeasure in her face perhaps though he reflected with a sinking heart she had understood  your brother has just arrived he announced i think that he has motored down from london he wished me to let you know that he was here  where is he she asked  he is on the lawn talking to miss lalonde arnold replied  i will go to them presently she said in the meantime you are to make yourself useful if you please she added holding out the roses take these into the house will you and give them to one of the women  he took them from her  with pleasure and then if you will excuse us  i excuse no word which is spoken concerning your departure she declared tonight i give a little fête we change our dinner into what you call supper and we will have the dining table moved out under the trees there you and your little friend must stop and afterwards my brother will take you back to london in his car or i will send you up in my own  you are too kind arnold answered i am afraid  you are to be afraid of nothing she interrupted mockingly is that not just what i have been preaching to you you have too many fears for your height my friend  we will put it another way then i was thinking of miss lalonde she is not strong and i think it is time we were leaving if you could send us so far as the railway station  there are no trains that leave here she asserted at least i never heard of them i shall go and talk to her myself we shall see no on second thoughts she is too interested you and i will walk to the house together that is one thing she continued which i envy my brother which makes me admire him so much i think he is the most charmingly sympathetic person i ever met illness of any sort or sickness seems to make a woman of him i never knew a child or a woman whose interest or sympathy he could not win quickly  it is a wonderful thing to say of any man that arnold remarked  wonderful she repeated why yes so far as regards children at any rate you know they sayone of the writers in my mothers country saidthat men are attracted by beauty children by goodness and women by evil it is of some such saying that you are thinking now i shall leave these flowers in the hall and ring the bell tell me would you like me to show you my books  she laid her fingers upon the white door of her little drawingroom and looked at him  if you do not mind he replied i should like to hear what ruth says about going  this time she frowned she stood looking at him for a moment arnolds face was very square and determined but there were still things there which she appreciated  you are very formal today she declared you give too many of your thoughts to your little friend i do not think that you are treating me kindly i should like to sit with you in my room and to talk to you of my books look is it not pretty  she threw open the door it was a tiny little apartment in which all the appointments and the walls were white except for here and there a little french gilded furniture of the best period a great bowl of scarlet geraniums stood in one corner though the windows were open the blinds were closely drawn so that it was almost like twilight  you wont come for five minutes she begged  yes he answered almost savagely come in and shut the door i want to talk to younot about your books yes let us sit downwhere you will that couch is big enough for both of us  the sudden change in his manner was puzzling the two had changed places the struggle was at an end but it was scarcely as a victim that arnold leaned towards her  give me your hands he said  arnold she whispered  he took them both and drew her towards him  what is it you want he asked not mei know that you are beautiful you know that i admire you you know that a day like this is like a day out of some wonderful fairy story for me i am young and foolish i suppose just as easily led away as most young men are do you want to make me believe impossible things you look at me from the corners of your eyes and you laugh do you want to make use of me in any way youre not a flirt you are a wife and a good wife do you know that men less impressionable than i have been made slaves for life by women less beautiful than you without any effort on their part even no i wont be laughed at this is reality what is it you want he leaned towards her do you want me to kiss you do you want me to hold you in my arms i could do it i should like to do it i will if you tell me to only afterwards  afterwards what  i shall do what i should have done if your husband hadnt taken me into his officei should enlist he said i maynt be particularly ambitious but ive no idea of hanging about a penniless adventurer dancing at a womans heels be honest with me at heart i do believe in you fenella what is it you want  she leaned back on the couch and laughed it was no longer the subtle provoking laugh of the woman of the world she laughed frankly and easily with all the lack of restraint to which her twentyfour years entitled her  my dear boy she declared you have conquered i give in you have seen through me i am a fraud i have been trying the old tricks upon you because i am very much a woman because i want you to be my slave and to do the things i want you to do and live in the world i want you to live in and i was jealous of this companion for whose sake you would not accept my invitation now i am sane again i see that you are not to be treated like other and more foolish young men my brother wants you he wants you for a companion he wants you to help him in many ways he has been used to rely upon me in such cases i have my orders to place you there she pointed to her feet alas that i have failed she added laughing once more but arnold we shall be friends  willingly he answered with an immense sense of relief only remember this i may have wisdom enough to see the lure but i may not always have strength enough not to take it i have spoken to you in a moment of sanity butwell you are the most compellingly beautiful person i ever saw and compellingly beautiful women have never made a habit of being kind to me so please  dont do it any more she interrupted is that it  as you like  now i am going to put a piece of scarlet geranium in your buttonhole and i am going to take you out into the garden and hand you over to my brother and tell him that my task is done that you are my slave and that he has only to speak and you will go out into the world with a revolver in one hand and a sword in the other and wear any uniform or fight in any cause he chooses come  you know arnold said as they left the room i dont know any man i admire so much as your brother but i am almost as frightened of him as i am of you  one who talks of fear so glibly she answered seldom knows anything about it  there are as many different sorts of fear as there are different sorts of courage he remarked  how we are improving she murmured we shall begin moralizing soon presently i really think we shall compare notes about the books we have read and the theatres we have been to and before we are grayheaded i think one of us will allude to the weather now isnt my brother a wonderful man look at that flush upon miss lalondes cheeks arent you jealous  miserably  sabatini rose to his feet and greeted his sister after his own fashion holding both her hands and kissing her on both cheeks  if only he sighed our family had possessed morals equal to their looks what a race we should have been but my dear sistera question of taste onlyyou should leave doucet and paquin at home when you come to my bungalow  you men never altogether understand she replied nothing requires a little artificial aid so much as nature it is the piquancy of the contrast you see that is why the decorations of watteau are the most wonderful in the world he knew how to combine the purely exquisitely artificial with the entirely simple now to break the news to miss lalonde  ruth turned a smiling face towards her  it is to say that our fête day is at an end she said looking for her stick  fête days do not end at six oclock in the afternoon fenella replied i want you to be very kind and give us all a great deal of pleasure we want to make a little partyyou and mr chetwode my brother myself and mr weatherleyand dine under that cedar tree just as we are we are going to call it supper then afterwards you will have a ride back to london in the cool air either my brother will take you or we will send a car from here  it is a charming idea sabatini said miss lalonde you will not be unkind  she hesitated only for a moment they saw her glance at her frock the little feminine struggle and the womans conquest  if you really mean it she said why of course i should love it it is no good my pretending that if i had known i should have been better prepared she continued because it really wouldnt have made any difference if you dont mind  then it is settled sabatini exclaimed my young friend arnold is now going to take me out upon the river i trust myself without a tremor to those shoulders  arnold rose to his feet with alacrity  you get into the boathouse down that path sabatini continued there is a comfortable punt in which i think i could rest delightfully or if you prefer to scull i should be less comfortable but resigned  it shall be the punt arnold decided with a glance at the river wont any one else come with us  fenella shook her head  i am going to talk to miss lalonde she said after we have had an opportunity of witnessing your skill mr chetwode we may trust ourselves another time au revoir  they watched the punt glide down the stream a moment or two later sabatini stretched between the red cushions with a cigarette in his mouth arnold handling his pole like a skilled waterman  you like my brother fenella asked  the girl looked at her gratefully  i think that he is the most charming person i ever knew in my life she declared     chapter xxii  the refugees return   sabatinis attitude of indolence lasted only until they had turned from the waterway into the main river then he sat up and pointed a little way down the stream  can you cross over somewhere there he asked  arnold nodded and punted across towards the opposite bank  get in among the rushes sabatini directed now listen to me  arnold came and sat down  you dont mean to tire me he remarked  sabatini smiled  do you seriously think that i asked you to bring me on the river for the pleasure of watching your prowess with that pole my friend he asked not at all i am going to ask you to do me a service  arnold was suddenly conscious that sabatini for the first time since he had known him was in earnest the lines of his marblewhite face seemed to have grown tenser and firmer his manner was the manner of a man who meets a crisis  turn your head and look inland he said you follow the lane there  arnold nodded  quite well he admitted  at the corner sabatini continued just out of sight behind that tall hedge is my motor car i want you to land and make your way there my chauffeur has his instructions he will take you to a village some eight miles up the river a village called heslop wood there is a boatbuilders yard at the end of the main street you will hire a boat and row up the river about three hundred yards up on the left hand side is an old dismantledlooking houseboat i want you to board it and search it thoroughly  sabatini paused and arnold looked at him perplexed  search it he exclaimed but for whom for what  it is my belief sabatini went on that starling is hiding there if he is i want you to bring him to me by any means which occur to you i had sooner he were dead but that is too much to ask of you i want him brought in the motor car to that point in the lane there then if you succeed you will bring him down here and your mission is ended will you undertake it  arnold never hesitated for a moment he was only too thankful to be able to reply in the affirmative he put on his coat and propelled the punt a little further into the rushes  ill do my best he asserted  sabatini said never a word but his silence seemed somehow eloquent arnold sprang onto the bank and turned once around  if he is there ill bring him he promised  sabatini waved his hand and arnold sped across the meadow he found the motor car waiting behind the hedge and he had scarcely stepped in before they were off they swung at a great speed along the narrow lanes through two villages and finally came to a standstill at the end of a long narrow street arnold alighted and found the boatbuilders yard with rows of boats for hire a short distance along the front he chose one and paddled off glancing at his watch as he did so it was barely a quarter of an hour since he had left sabatini  the river at this spot was broad but it narrowed suddenly on rounding a bend about a hundred yards away the houseboat was in sight now moored close to a tiny island arnold pulled up alongside and paused to reconnoiter to all appearance it was a derelict there were no awnings no carpets no baskets of flowers the outside was grievously in need of paint it had an entirely uninhabited and desolate appearance arnold beached his boat upon the little island and swung himself up onto the deck there was still no sign of any human occupancy he descended into the saloon the furniture there was mildewed and musty rain had come in through an open window and the appearance of the little apartment was depressing in the extreme stooping low he next examined the four sleeping apartments there was no bedding in any one of them nor any sign of their having been recently occupied he passed on into the kitchen with the same result it seemed as though his journey had been in vain he made his way back again on deck and descended the stairs leading to the fore part of the boat here were a couple of servants rooms and though there was no bedding one of the bunks gave him the idea that some one had been lying there recently he looked around him and sniffedthere was a distinct smell of tobacco smoke he stepped lightly back into the passageway there was nothing to be heard and no material indication of any ones presence yet he had the uncomfortable feeling that some one was watching himsome one only a few feet away he waited for almost a minute nothing happened yet his sense of apprehension grew deeper for the first time he associated the idea of danger with his enterprise  is any one about here he asked  there was no reply he tried another door which led into a sort of pantry without result the last one was fastened on the inside  is mr starling in there arnold demanded  there was still no reply yet it was certain now that the end of his search was at hand distinctly he could hear the sound of a man breathing  will you tell me if you are there mr starling arnold again demanded i have a message for you  starling if indeed he were there seemed now to be even holding his breath arnold took one step back and charged the door it went crashing in and almost at once there was a loud report the closetit was little morewas filled with smoke and arnold heard distinctly the hiss of a bullet buried in the woodwork over his shoulder he caught the revolver from the shaking fingers of the man who was crouching upon the ground and slipped it into his pocket with his other hand he held his prisoner powerless  what the devil do you mean by that he cried fiercely  starlingfor it was starlingseemed to have no words arnold dragged him out into the light and for a moment found it hard to recognize the man he had lost over a stone in weight his cheeks were hollow and his eyes had the hunted look in them of some wild animal  what do you want with me he muttered cant you see i am hiding here what business is it of yours to interfere  arnold looked at him from head to foot the man was shaking all over the cowards fear was upon him  what on earth are you in this state for he exclaimed whom are you hiding from you have been set free is it the rosario business still you have been set free once  starling moistened his lips rapidly  they set me free he muttered because one of their witnesses failed they had no case they wouldnt bring me up but i am still under surveillance the sergeant as good as told me that theyd have me before long  well at present ive got you arnold said coolly have you any luggage  no why  because you are coming along with me  where  i am taking you to count sabatini arnold informed him he is at his villa about ten miles down the river  starling flopped upon his knees  for the love of god dont take me to him he begged  why not  he is a devil that man starling whispered confidentially he would blow out my brains or yours or his own without a seconds hesitation if it suited him he hasnt any nerves nor any fear nor any pity he will laugh at mehe wont understand he is so reckless  well were going to him anyhow arnold said i dont see how you can be any worse off than hiding in this beastly place upstairs and into the boat please  starling struggled weakly to get away but he was like a child in arnolds hands  you had much better come quietly the latter advised youll have to come anyway and if youre really afraid of being arrested again i should think count sabatini would be the best man to aid your escape  but he wont let me escape starling protested he doesnt understand danger i am not made like him my nerve has gone i came into this too late in life  jump arnold ordered linking his arm into his companions  they landed somehow upon the island arnold pointed to the boat  please be sensible he begged now at any rate there may be people passing at any moment  i was safe in there starling mumbled why the devil couldnt you have left me alone  arnold bent over his oars  safe he repeated contemptuously you were doing the one thing which a guilty man would do people would have known before long that you were there obviously hiding i think that count sabatini will propose something very much better  perhaps so starling muttered perhaps he will help me to get away  they reached the village and arnold paid for the hire of his boat then he hurried starling into the car and a moment or two later they were off  is it far away starling asked nervously  ten minutes ride sabatini has arranged it all very well we get out cross a meadow and find him waiting for us in the punt  you wont leave me alone with him on the river starling begged  no i shall be there arnold promised  theres nothing would suit him so well starling continued as to see me down at the bottom of the thames with a stone around my neck i tell you im frightened of him if i can get out of this mess he went on im off back to new york any job there is better than this what are we stopping for say whats wrong now  its all right arnold answered step out we cross this meadow on foot when we reach the other end we shall find sabatini come along  they turned toward the river starling muttering now and then to himself in a few minutes they came in sight of the punt sabatini was still there with his head reclining among the cushions he looked up and waved his hand  a record my young friend he exclaimed i congratulate you indeed you have been gone exactly fiftyfive minutes and i gave you an hour and a half at the least our friend starling was glad to see you i hope  he showed his pleasure arnold remarked dryly in a most original manner however here he is shall i take you across now  if you please sabatini agreed  he sat up and looked at starling the latter hung his head and shook like a guilty schoolboy  it was so foolish of you sabatini murmured but well talk of that presently they were civil to you at the police court eh  i was never charged starling replied they couldnt get their evidence together  still they asked you questions no doubt sabatini continued  i told them nothing starling replied on my soul and honor i told them nothing  it was very wise of you sabatini said it might have led to disappointmentsto trouble of many sorts so you told them nothing eh that is excellent after we have landed i must hand you over to my valet then we will have a little talk  they were in the backwater now drifting on toward the lawn starling shrank back at the sight of the two women  i cant face it he muttered i tell you i have lost my nerve  you have nothing to fear sabatini said quietly there is no one here likely to do you or wish you any harm  fenella came down to the steps to meet them  so our prodigal has returned she remarked smiling at starling  we have rescued mr starling from a solitary picnic upon his houseboat sabatini explained suavely we cannot have our friends cultivating misanthropy  mr weatherley who had returned from the boatbuilders half rose from his chair and sat down again frowning he watched the two men cross the lawn towards the house then he turned to ruth and shook his head  i have a great regard for count sabatini he declared a great regard but there are some of his friendsvery many of them in factwhose presence here i could dispense with that man is one of them do you know where he was a few nights ago miss lalonde  she shook her head  in prison mr weatherley said impressively arrested on a serious charge  her eyes asked him a question he stooped towards her and lowered his voice  murder he whispered the murder of mr rosario     chapter xxiii  trouble brewing   through the winding lanes between the tall hedges honeysuckle wreathed and starred with wild roses out onto the broad main road sabatinis great car sped noiselessly on its way back to london they seemed to pass in a few moments from the cool perfumed air of the country into the hot dry atmosphere of the london suburbs almost before they realized that they were on their homeward way the fiery glow of the city was staining the clouds above their heads arnold leaned a little forward watching as the car raced on to its goal this ride through the darkness seemed to supply the last thrill of excitement to their wonderful day he glanced towards ruth who lay back among the cushions as though sleeping by his side  you are tired  yes she answered simply  they were in the region now of electric carswonderful vehicles ablaze with light flashing towards them every few minutes laden with sunday evening pleasure seekers their automobile however perfectly controlled by sabatinis italian chauffeur swung from one side of the road to the other and held on its way with scarcely abated speed  you have enjoyed the day he asked  she opened her eyes and looked at him he saw the shadows and wondered  of course she whispered  his momentary wonder at her reticence passed again he was leaning a little forward looking up the broad thoroughfare with its double row of lights its interminable rows of houses growing in importance as they rushed on  it is we ourselves who pass now along the lighted way he exclaimed holding her arm for a moment it is an enchanted journey ours ruth  she laughed bitterly  an enchanted journey which leads to two very dreary attic rooms on the sixth floor of a povertystricken house she reminded him it leads back to the smokestained city to the four walls within which one dreams empty dreams  it isnt so bad as that he protested  her lips trembled for a moment she half closed her eyes an impulse of pain passed like a spasm across her tired features  it is different for you she murmured every day you escape for me there is no escape  he felt a momentary twinge of selfishness yet after all the great truths were incontrovertible he could lighten her lot but little there was very little of himself that he could give herof his youth his strength his vigorous hold upon life through all the tangle of his expanding interests in existence the medley of strange happenings in which he found himself involved one thing alone was clear he was passing on into a life making larger demands upon him a life in which their companionship must naturally become a slighter thing nevertheless he spoke to her reassuringly  you cannot believe ruth he said that i shall ever forget we have been through too much together too many dark days  she sighed  there wasnt much for either of us to look forward to was there when we first looked down on the river together and you began to tell me fairy stories  they kept our courage alive he declared i am not sure that they are not coming true  she half closed her eyes  for you arnold she murmured not all the fancies that were ever spun in the brain of any living person could alter life very much for me  he took her hand and held it tightly yet it was hard to know what to say to her it was the inevitable tragedy this of their sexes and her infirmity he realized in those few minutes something of how she was feelingthe one who is left upon the lonely island while the other is borne homeward into the sunshine and tumult of life there was little indeed which he could say it was not the hour this for protestation  they passed along piccadilly across leicester square and into the strand the wayfarers in the streets of whom there were still plenty seemed to be lingering about in sheer joy of the cooler night after the unexpected heat of the day the women in light clothes the men with their coats thrown open and carrying their hats they passed down the strand and into adam street coming at last to a standstill before the tall gloomy house at the corner of the terrace arnold stepped out onto the pavement and helped his companion to alight the chauffeur lifted his hat and the car glided away as they stood there for a moment upon the pavement and arnold pushed open the heavy shabby door it seemed indeed as though the whole day might have been a dream  ruth moved wearily along the broken tesselated pavement and paused for a moment before the first flight of stairs arnold taking her stick from her caught her up in his arms her fingers closed around his neck and she gave a little sigh of relief  will you really carry me up all the way arnie she whispered i am so tired tonight you are sure that you can manage it  he laughed gayly  i have done it many times before he reminded her tonight i feel as strong as a dozen men  one by one they climbed the flight of stone steps curiously enough notwithstanding the strength of which he had justly boasted as they neared the top of the house he felt his breath coming short and his heart beating faster as though some unusual strain were upon him she had tightened her grasp upon his neck she seemed somehow to have come closer to him yet to hang like a dead weight in his arms her cheek was touching his once toward the end he looked into her face and the fire of her eyes startled him  you are not really tired he muttered  i am resting like this she whispered  he stood at last upon the top landing he set her down with a little thrill assailed by a medley of sensations the significance of which confused him she seemed still to cling to him and she pointed to his door  for five minutes she begged let us sit in our chairs and look down at the river tonight it is too hot to sleep  even while he opened his door he hesitated  what about isaac he asked  she shivered and looked over her shoulder they were in his room now and she closed the door on the threshold she stood quite still for a moment as though listening there was something in her face which alarmed him  do you know i believe that i am afraid to go back she said isaac has been stranger than ever these last few days all the time he is locked up in his room and he shows himself only at night  arnold dragged her chair up to the window and installed her comfortably he himself was thinking of isaacs face under the gaslight as he had seen him stepping away from the taxicab  isaac was always queer he reminded her reassuringly  she drew him down to her side  there has been a difference these last few days she whispered i am afraidi am terribly afraid that he has done something really wrong  arnold felt a little shiver of fear himself  you must remember he said quietly that after all isaac is in a measure outside your life no one can influence him for either good or evil he is not like other men he must go his own way and i too am afraid that it may be a troublous one he chose it for himself and neither you nor i can help i wouldnt think about him at all dear if you can avoid it and for yourself remember always that you have another protector  the faintest of smiles parted her lips in the moonlight which was already stealing into the room through the bare uncurtained window her face seemed like a piece of beautiful marble statuary ghostly yet in a single moment exquisitely human  i have no claim upon you arnold she reminded him and i think that soon you will pass out of my life it is only natural you must go on i must remain and that is the end of it she added with a little quiver of the lips now let us finish talking about ourselves i want to talk about your new friends  tell me what you really think of them he begged count sabatini has been so kind to me that if i try to think about him at all i am already prejudiced  i think she replied slowly that count sabatini is the strangest man whom i ever met do you remember when he stood and looked down upon us i feltbut it was so foolish  you felt what he persisted  she shook her head  i cannot tell as though we were not strangers at all i suppose it is what they call mesmerism he had that soft delightful way of speaking and gentle mannerism there was nothing abrupt or new about him he seemed somehow to become part of the life of any one in whom he chose to interest himself in the slightest and he talked so delightfully arnold i cannot tell you how kind he was to me  arnold laughed  its a clear case of hero worship he declared youre going to be as bad as i have been  and yet she said slowly it is his sister of whom i think all the time fenella she calls herself doesnt she  you like her too arnold asked eagerly  i hate her was the low fierce reply  arnold drew a little away  you cant mean it he exclaimed you cant really mean that you dont like her  ruth clutched at his arm as though jealous of his instinctive disappointment  i know that its brutally ungracious she declared its a sort of madness even but i hate her because she is the most beautiful thing i have ever seen here in life i hate her for that and i hate her for her strength did you see her come across the lawn to us tonight arnold  he nodded enthusiastically  you mean in that smokecolored muslin dress  she has no right to wear clothes like that ruth cried she does it so that men may see how beautiful she is iwell i hate her  there was a silence then ruth rose slowly to her feet her tone was suddenly altered her eyes pleaded with his  dont take any notice of me tonight arnold she implored it has been such a wonderful day and i am not used to so much excitement i am afraid that i am a little hysterical do be kind and help me across to my room  is there any hurry he asked it hasnt struck twelve yet  i want to go please she begged i shall say foolish things if i stay here much longer and i dont want to let me go  he obeyed her without further question once more he supported her with his arms but she kept her face turned away when he had reached her door he would have left her but she still clutched his arm  i am foolish she whispered foolish and wicked tonight and besides i am afraid it is all because i am overtired come in with me for one moment please and let me be sure that isaac is all right feel how i am trembling  of course i will come he answered isaac cant be angry with me tonight anyhow for my clothes are old and dusty enough  he opened the door and they passed across the threshold then they both stopped short and ruth gave a little start the room was lit with several candles there was no sign of isaac but a middleaged man with black beard and moustache had risen to his feet at their entrance he glanced at ruth with keen interest at arnold with a momentary curiosity  what are you doing here ruth demanded what right have you in this room  the man did not answer her question  i shall be glad he said if you will come in and shut the door if you are miss ruth lalonde i have a few questions to ask you     chapter xxiv  isaac at bay   arnold had a swift premonition of what had happened he led ruth to a chair and stood by her side ruth gazed around the room in bewilderment the curtained screen which divided it had been torn down and the door of the inner apartment which isaac kept so zealously locked stood open not only that but the figure of a second man was dimly seen moving about inside and from the light shining out it was obviously in some way illuminated  i dont understand who you are or what you are doing here ruth declared trembling in every limb  my name is inspector grant the man replied my business is with isaac lalonde who i understand is your uncle  what do you want with him she asked  the inspector made no direct reply  there are a few questions he said which it is my duty to put to you  questions she repeated  do you know where your uncle is  ruth shook her head  i left him here this morning she replied he has not been out for several days i expected to find him here when i returned  we have been here since four oclock the man said there was no one here when we arrived nor has any one been since your uncle has no regular hours i suppose  he is very uncertain ruth answered he does newspaper reporting and he sometimes has to work late  can you tell me what newspaper he is engaged upon  the signal for one ruth replied  inspector grant was silent for a moment  the signal newspaper offices were seized by the police some days ago he remarked do you know of any other journal on which your uncle worked  she shook her head  he tells me very little of his affairs she faltered  the inspector pointed backwards into the further corner of the apartment  do you often go into his room there he asked  i have not been for months ruth assured him my uncle keeps it locked up he told me that there had been some trouble at the office and he was printing something there  the inspector rose slowly to his feet on the table by his side was a pile of articles covered over with a tablecloth very deliberately he removed the latter and looked keenly at ruth she shrank back with a little scream there were half a dozen murderouslooking pistols there a mannerlicher rifle and a quantity of ammunition  what does your uncle need with these the inspector asked dryly  how can i tell ruth replied i have never seen one of them before i never knew that they were in the place  nor i arnold echoed i have been a constant visitor here too and i have never seen firearms of any sort before  the inspector turned towards him  are you a friend of isaac lalonde he asked  i am not arnold answered i am a friend of his niece here miss ruth lalonde i know very little of isaac although i see him here sometimes  i should like to know your name if you have no objection the inspector remarked  my name is chetwode arnold told him i occupy a room on the other side of the passage  when did you last see isaac lalonde  arnold did not hesitate for a moment what he had seen at hampstead belonged to himself he deliberately wiped out the memory of it from his thoughts  on thursday evening here  the inspector made a note in his pocketbook then he turned again to ruth  you can give me no explanation then as to your uncles absence tonight  none at all i can only say what i told you beforethat i expected to find him here on my return  was he here when you left this morning  i believe so ruth assured him he very seldom comes out of his room until the middle of the day and he does not like my going to him there as we started very early i did not disturb him  have you any objection the inspector asked to telling me where you have spent the whole of today  not the slightest arnold interposed we have been to bourne end and to a village in the neighborhood  the inspector nodded thoughtfully ruth leaned a little forward in her chair her voice trembled with anxiety  please tell me she begged what is the charge against my uncle  the inspector glanced over his shoulder at that inner room from which fitful gleams of light still came he looked down at the heap of pistols and ammunition by his side  the charge he said slowly is of a somewhat serious nature  ruth was twisting up her glove in her hand  i do not believe she declared that isaac has ever done anything really wrong he is a terrible socialist and he is always railing at the rich but i do not believe that he would hurt any one  the inspector looked grimly at the little pile of firearms  a pretty sort of armory this he remarked for a peaceloving man what do you suppose he keeps them here for in his room what do you suppose  they all three heard it at the same time the inspector broke off in the middle of his sentence ruth shrinking in her chair turned her head fearfully towards the door which still stood half open arnold was looking breathlessly in the same direction faintly but very distinctly they heard the patter of footsteps climbing the stone stairs it sounded as though a man were walking upon tiptoe yet dragging his feet wearily the inspector held up his hand and his subordinate who had been searching the inner room came stealthily out ruth obeying her first impulse opened her lips to shriek the inspector leaned forward and his hand suddenly closed over her mouth he looked towards arnold who was suffering from a moments indecision  if you utter a sound he whispered you will be answerable to the law  nobody spoke or moved it was an odd little tableau grouped together in the dimly lit room the footsteps had reached the last flight of stairs now they came slowly across the landing then paused as though the person who approached could see the light shining through the partly open door they heard a voice a voice almost unrecognizable a voice hoarse and tremulous with fear the voice of a hunted man  are you there ruth  ruth struggled to reply but ineffectually slowly and as though with some foreboding of danger the footsteps came nearer and nearer an unseen hand cautiously pushed the door open isaac stood upon the threshold peering anxiously into the room the inspector turned and faced him  isaac lalonde he said i have a warrant for your arrest i shall want you to come with me to bow street  with the certainty of danger isaacs fear seemed to vanish into thin air he saw the open door of his ransacked inner room and the piledup heap of weapons upon the table face to face with actual danger the courage of a wild animal at bay seemed suddenly vouchsafed to him  come with you to hell he cried i think not mr inspector are these the witnesses against me  he pointed to ruth and arnold ruth clutched her stick and staggered tremblingly to her feet  how can you say that isaac she exclaimed arnold and i have only been home from the country a few minutes we walked into the room and found these men here isaac i am terrified tell me that you have not done anything really wrong  isaac made no reply all the time he watched the inspector stealthily the latter moved forward now as though to make the arrest then isaacs hand shot out from his pocket and a long stream of yellow fire flashed through the room the inspector sprang back isaacs hand with the smoke still curling from the muzzle of his pistol remained extended  that was only a warning isaac declared calmly i aimed at the wall there next time it may be different  there was a breathless silence the inspector stood his ground but he did not advance  let me caution you isaac lalonde he said that the use of firearms by any one in your position is fatal you can shoot me if you like and my assistant but if you do you will certainly be hanged it is my duty to arrest you and i am going to do it  isaacs hand was still extended this time he had lowered the muzzle of his pistol the inspector was only human and he paused for he was looking straight into the mouth of it isaac slowly backed toward the door  remember you are warned he cried if any one pursues me i shoot  his departure was so sudden and so speedy that he was down the first flight of stairs before the inspector started arnold who was nearest the door made a movement as though to follow but ruth threw her arms around him the policeman who had been examining the other room rushed past them both  you shall not go ruth sobbed it is no affair of yours it is between the police and isaac  i want to stop his shooting arnold replied he must be mad to use firearms against the police let me go ruth  you cant she shrieked you cant catch him now  then she suddenly held her ears three times quickly they heard the report of the pistol there was a moments silence then more shots arnold picked ruth up in his arms and running with her across the landing laid her in his own easychair  i must see what has happened he exclaimed breathlessly wait here  she was powerless to resist him he tore himself free from the clutch of her fingers and rushed down the stairs expecting every moment to come across the body of one of the policemen to his immense relief he reached the street without discovering any signs of the tragedy he feared adam street was deserted but in the gardens below the terrace he could hear the sound of voices and a torn piece of clothing hung from the spike of one of the railings isaac had evidently made for the gardens and the river the sound of the chase grew fainter and fainter and there were no more shots arnold after a few minutes hesitation turned round and reclimbed the stairs the place smelt of gunpowder and little puffs of smoke were curling upwards  arrived on the top landing he closed the door of isaacs room and entered his own apartment ruth had dragged herself to the window and was leaning out  he has gone across the gardens she cried breathlessly i saw him running perhaps he will get away after all i saw one of the policemen fall down and he was quite a long way ahead then  at any rate no harm was done by the firing arnold declared i dont think he really shot at them at all  they knelt side by side before the windowsill the gardens were still faintly visible in the dim moonlight but all signs of disturbance had passed away she clung nervously to his arm  arnold she whispered tell me what do you think he has done  i dont suppose he has done anything very much arnold replied cheerfully what i really think is that he has got mixed up with some of these anarchists writing for this wretched paper and they have probably let him in for some of their troubles  they stayed there for a measure of time they were neither of them able to compute at last with a little sigh he rose to his feet for the first time they began to realize what had happened  isaac will not come back he said  she clung to him hysterically  arnold she cried i am nervous i could not sleep in that room i never want to see it again as long as i live  for a moment he was perplexed then he smiled its rather an awkward situation for us attic dwellers he remarked ill bring your couch in here if you like and you can lie before the window where its cool  you dont mind she begged i couldnt even think of going to sleep i should sit up all night anyhow  not a bit he assured her i dont think it would be much use thinking about bed  he made his way back into isaacs apartments brought out her couch and arranged it by the window she lay down with a little sigh of relief then he dragged up his own easy chair to her side and held her hand they heard big ben strike two oclock and soon afterwards arnold began to doze when he awoke with a sudden start her hand was still in his eastward over the city a faint red glow hung in the heavens the world was still silent but in the delicate pearly twilight the trees in the gardens the bridge and the buildings in the distanceeverything seemed to stand out with a peculiar and unfamiliar distinctness she too was sitting up and they looked out of the window together five oclock was striking now  ive been asleep arnold exclaimed something woke me up  she nodded  there is some one knocking at the door outside she whispered that is what woke you i heard it several minutes ago  he jumped up at once  i will go and see what it is he declared  he opened the door and looked out onto the landing the knocking was at the door of isaacs apartment two policemen and a man in plain clothes were standing there  there is no one in those rooms arnold said the door shuts with a spring lock but i have a key here if you wish to enter  the sergeant looked at arnold and approved of him  i have an order to remove some firearms and other articles he announced also can you tell me where the young womanruth lalondeis  she is in my room arnold replied she was too terrified to remain alone over there you dont want her do you he asked anxiously  the man shook his head  i have no definite instructions concerning her he said but we should like to know that she has no intention of going away  arnold threw open the door before them  i am sure that she has not he declared she is quite an invalid and besides she has nowhere else to go  the sergeant gave a few orders respecting the movement of a pile of articles covered over by a tablecloth which had been dragged out of isaacs room before he had finished arnold ventured upon the question which had been all the time trembling upon his lips  this man isaac lalondewas he arrested  the sergeant made no immediate reply  tell me at least was any one hurt arnold begged  no one was shot if you mean that the sergeant admitted  is isaac in custody  he very likely is by this time the sergeant said as a matter of fact he got away a friend of yours is he  certainly not arnold answered i have an attic on the other side of the landing there and i have made friends with the girl my interest in isaac lalonde is simply because she is his niece can you tell me what the charge is against him  we believe him to be one of a very dangerous gang of criminals the sergeant replied i cant tell you more than that if you take my advice sir he continued civilly you will have as little as possible to do with either the man or the girl theres no doubt about the mans character and birds of a feather generally flock together  i am perfectly certain arnold declared vigorously that if there has been anything irregular in her uncles life miss lalonde knew nothing of it we both knew that he talked wildly but for the rest his doings have been as much a mystery to her as to me  the sergeant was summoned by one of his subordinates the two men stood whispering together for a few moments he turned finally toward arnold  i shall have to ask you to leave us now sir he said civilly  theres nothing more you can tell me about this affair i suppose arnold asked  the sergeant shook his head  you will hear all about it later on sir  arnold turned reluctantly back to his own room where ruth was anxiously waiting he closed the door carefully behind him  isaac has escaped he announced and no one was hurt  she drew a little sigh of immense relief  did they tell you what the charge was  not definitely he replied so far as i could make out from what the sergeant said it was keeping bad company as much as anything  the police are in the rooms now she asked  three more of them he assented i dont know what they want but evidently youll have to stay here now im going to light this spiritlamp and make some coffee  he moved cheerfully about the room and she watched him all the time with almost pathetic earnestness presently he brought the breakfast things over to her side and sat at the foot of her couch while the water boiled he took her hand and held it caressingly  i shouldnt worry about isaac he said i dont suppose he is really very much mixed up with these fellows hell have to keep out of the way for a time thats all  there were the pistols she faltered doubtfully  i expect they saddled him with them because he was the least likely to be suspected arnold suggested theres the water boiling already now for it  he cut some bread and butter and made the coffee they ate and drank almost in silence through the open window now the roar of traffic was growing every minute in volume across the bridge the daily stream of men and vehicles had commenced to flow presently he glanced at the clock and putting down his coffee cup rose to his feet  in a few minutes dear i must be off he announced you wont mind being left will you  her lips trembled  why should i she murmured of course you must go to work  he went behind his little screen where he plunged his head into a basin of cold water when he reappeared a few minutes later he was ready to start  i expect those fellows will have cleared out from your rooms by now he said throwing open the door hullo whats this  a trunk and hatbox had been dragged out onto the landing a policeman was sitting on a chair in front of the closed door reading a newspaper  we have collected the young ladys belongings so far as possible sir he remarked if there is anything else belonging to her she may be able to get it later on  do you mean to say that she cant go back to her own rooms arnold demanded  i am sorry sir the man replied but i am here to see that no one enters them under any pretext  arnold looked at him blankly  but what is the young lady to do he protested she has no other home  the policeman remained unmoved  sorry sir he said but her friends will have to find her one for the time being she certainly cant come in here  arnold felt a sudden weight upon his arm ruth had been standing by his side and had heard everything he led her gently back she was trembling violently  dont worry about me arnold she begged you go away by the time you come back ii shall have found a home somewhere  he passed his arm around her a wild flash in her eyes had suddenly revealed her thought  unless you promise me he said firmly that i shall find you on that couch when i return this evening i shall not leave this room  but arnold  the business of samuel weatherley  company he interrupted glancing at the clock will be entirely disorganized unless you promise  i promise she murmured faintly     chapter xxv  mr weatherleys disappearance   arnold arrived at tooley street only a few minutes after his usual time he made his way at once into the private office and commenced his work at ten oclock mr jarvis came in the pile of letters upon mr weatherleys desk was as yet untouched  any idea where the governor is the cashier asked hes nearly half an hour late  arnold glanced at the clock  mr weatherley is spending the weekend down the river he said i dare say the trains up are a little awkward  mr jarvis looked at him curiously  how do you happen to know that  i was there yesterday for a short time arnold told him  mr jarvis whistled softly  seems to me youre getting pretty chummy with the governor he remarked or is it mrs weatherley eh  arnold lifted his head and looked fixedly at mr jarvis the latter suddenly remembered that he had come in to search among the letters for some invoices he busied himself for a moment or two sorting them out  well well he said i hope the governor will soon be here anyway there are a lot of things i want to ask him about this morning  a telephone bell at arnolds desk began to ring arnold lifted the receiver to his ear  is that mr weatherleys office a familiar voice inquired  good morning mrs weatherley he replied this is the office and i am arnold chetwode we were just wondering what had become of mr weatherley  what had become of him the voice repeated but is he not there  no sign of him at present arnold answered  there was a short silence then mrs weatherley spoke again  he left here she said absurdly earlysoon after seven i think it wasto motor up  has the car returned arnold asked  more than an hour ago was the prompt reply  i can assure you that he has not been here arnold declared youre speaking from bourne end i suppose  yes  will you please ask the chauffeur arnold suggested where he left mr weatherley  of course i will she replied that is very sensible you must hold the line until i come back  arnold withdrew the receiver for a few minutes from his ear mr jarvis had been listening to the conversation his mouth open with curiosity  is that about the governor he asked  arnold nodded  it was mrs weatherley speaking he said it seems mr weatherley left bourne end soon after seven oclock this morning  soon after seven oclock mr jarvis repeated  the car has been back there quite a long time arnold continued mrs weatherley has gone to make inquiries of the chauffeur  most extraordinary thing mr jarvis muttered i cant say that ive ever known the governor as late as this unless he was ill  arnold put the receiver once more to his ear in a moment or two mrs weatherley returned her voice was a little graver  i have spoken to the chauffeur she announced he says that they called first up in hampstead to see if there were any letters and that afterwards he drove mr weatherley over london bridge and put him down at the usual spot just opposite to the london  westminster bank for some reason or other as i dare say you know she went on mr weatherley never likes to bring the car into tooley street it was ten minutes past nine when he set him down and left him there  arnold glanced at the clock  it is now he said a quarter to eleven the spot you speak of is only two hundred yards away but i can assure you that mr weatherley has not yet arrived  mrs weatherley began to laugh softly even down the wires that laugh seemed to bring with it some flavor of her own wonderful personality  will there be a paragraph in the evening papers she asked mockingly i think i can see it now upon all the placards mysterious disappearance of a city merchant poor samuel  arnold found it quite impossible to answer her lightly the fingers indeed which held the receiver to his ear were shaking a little  mrs weatherley he said can i see you todayas soon as possible  why of course you can you silly boy she laughed back i am here all alone and i weary myself come by the next train or take a taxicab you can leave word for mr weatherley when he arrives that you have come by my special wish he will not mind then  there is no sign of mr weatherley at present arnold replied and i could not leave here until i had seen him i thought that perhaps you might be coming up to town for something  he could almost hear her yawn  really she declared after a slight pause it is not a bad idea the sun will not shine today there is a gray mist everywhere and it depresses me you will lunch with me if i come up  if you please  i do please she declared i think we will go to our own little placethe café andré and i will be there at halfpast twelve you will be waiting for me  without a doubt arnold promised  she began to laugh again  without a doubt she mocked him you are a very stolid young man arnold  to tell you the truth he admitted i am a little bothered just now we want mr weatherley badly and i dont understand his having been within a few hundred yards of the office nearly two hours ago and not having turned up here  he will arrive she replied confidently have no fear of that there are others to whom accidents and adventures might happen but not i think to mr samuel weatherley i am sorry that you are bothered though mr chetwode i think that to console you i shall wear one of my two new muslin gowns which have just arrived from paris  what is she talking about all this time mr jarvis who was itching with curiosity broke in  i am called away now arnold declared down the telephone i shall be quite punctual goodbye  he heard her laugh again as he hung up the receiver  well well mr jarvis demanded what is it all about have you heard anything  nothing of any importance i am afraid arnold admitted mrs weatherley laughs at the idea of anything having happened to her husband  if nothing has happened to him mr jarvis protested where is he  is there any call he could have paid on the way arnold suggested  i have never known him to do such a thing in his life mr jarvis replied besides there is no business call which could take two hours at this time of the morning  they rang up the few business friends whom mr weatherley had in the vicinity guys hospital the bank and the police station the reply was the same in all cases nobody had seen or heard anything of mr weatherley arnold even took down his hat and walked aimlessly up the street to the spot where mr weatherley had left the motor car the policeman on duty had heard nothing of any accident the shoeblack at the top of the steps leading down to the wharves remembered distinctly mr weatherleys alighting at the usual hour arnold returned to the office and sat down facing the little safe which mr weatherley had made over to him after all it might be true then this thing which he had sometimes dimly suspected beneath his very commonplace exterior mr weatherley had carried with him a secret  at halfpast twelve precisely arnold stood upon the threshold of the passage leading into andrés café already the people were beginning to crowd into the lower room a curious cosmopolitan mixture mostly foreigners and nearly all arriving in twos and threes from the neighboring business houses at twenty minutes to one mr weatherleys beautiful car turned slowly into the narrow street and drove up to the entrance arnold hurried forward to open the door and fenella descended she came to him with radiant face a wonderful vision in her spotless white gown and french hat with its drooping veil arnold notwithstanding his anxieties found it impossible not to be carried away for the moment by a wave of admiration she laughed with pleasure as she looked into his eyes  there she exclaimed i told you that for a moment i would make you forget everything  there is a good deal to forget too he answered  she shrugged her shoulders  you are always so gloomy my young friend she said we will have luncheon together you and i and i will try and teach you how to be gay tell me then she went on as they reached the landing and she waited for arnold to open the door leading into the private room how is the little invalid girl this morning  the little invalid girl is well arnold replied  she was not too tired yesterday i hope fenella asked  not in the least arnold assured her we both of us felt that we did not thank you half enough for our wonderful day  oh la la fenella exclaimed it was a whim of mine that is all i liked having you both there some day you must come again and if you are very good i may let you bring the young lady though im not so sure of that do you know that my brother was asking me questions about her until i thought my head would swim last night she continued curiously  count sabatini was very kind to her arnold remarked poor little girl i am afraid she is going to have rather a rough time she had quite an alarming experience last night after our return  you must tell me all about it presently fenella declared shall we take this little round table near the window it will be delightful that for when we are tired with one another we can watch the people in the street have you ever sat and watched the people in the street arnold  not often he answered giving his hat to a waiter and following her across the little room you see there are not many people to watch from the windows of where i live but there is always the river  a terribly dreary place fenella declared  arnold shook his head  dont believe it he replied only a short time ago the days were very dark indeed ruth and i together did little else except watch the barges come up and the slowly moving vessels and the lights and the swarms of people on blackfriars bridge life was all watching then  one would weary soon she murmured of being a spectator you are scarcely that now  there has been a great change he answered simply in those days i was very near starvation i had no idea how i was going to find work yet even then i found myself longing for adventures of any sortanything to quicken the blood to feel the earth swell beneath my feet  she was watching him with that curious look in her eyes which he never wholly understoodhalf mocking half tender  and after all she murmured you found your way to tooley street and the office of mr samuel weatherley  she threw herself back in her chair and laughed so irresistibly that arnold in a moment or two found himself sharing her merriment  it is all very well he said presently but i am not at all sure that adventures do not sometimes come even to tooley street  she shook her head  i shall never believe it tell me now about mr weatherley was he very sorry when he arrived for having caused you so much anxiety  i have not yet seen mr weatherley arnold replied up till the time when i left the office he had not arrived  she set down the glass which she had been in the act of raising to her lips for the first time she seemed to take this matter seriously  what time was that she asked  ten minutes past twelve  she frowned  it certainly does begin to look a little queer she admitted do you think that he has met with an accident  we have already tried the hospitals and the police station he told her  she looked at him steadfastly  you have an ideayou have some idea of what has happened she said  nothing definite arnold replied gravely i cannot imagine what it all means but i believe that mr weatherley has disappeared     chapter xxvi  arnold becomes inquisitive   for several moments fenella sat quite still she was suddenly an altered woman all the natural gayety and vivacity seemed to have faded from her features there were suggestions of another self zealously kept concealed it was a curious revelation even her tone when she spoke was altered the words seemed to be dragged from her lips  you have some reason for saying this she murmured  i have arnold admitted  just then the waiter entered the room bringing in a portion of the lunch which they had ordered fenella rose and walked to a mirror at the other end of the apartment she stood there powdering her cheeks for a moment with her back turned to arnold when the waiter had gone she returned humming a tune her effort at selfrehabilitation was obvious  you gave me a shock my friend she declared sitting down please do not do it again i am not accustomed to having things put to me quite so plainly  i am sorry arnold said it was hideously clumsy of me  it is of no consequence now she continued please to give me some of that red wine and go on with your story tell me exactly what you mean  it is simply this arnold explained a few days ago i noticed that mr weatherley was busy writing for several hours it was evidently some private matter and nothing whatever to do with the business when he had finished he put some documents into a small safe locked them up and very much to my surprise gave me the key  this was long ago  it was almost immediately after mr rosarios murder he replied when he gave me the key he told me that if anything unexpected should happen to him i was to open the safe and inspect the documents he particularly used the words if anything unexpected should happen to me or if i should disappear  you really believe then she asked that he had some idea in his mind that something was likely to happen to him or that he intended to disappear  his action proves it arnold reminded her so far as we know there is no earthly reason for his not having turned up at the office this morning this afternoon i shall open the safe  you mean that you will open it if you do not find him in the office when you return  he will not be there arnold said decidedly  her eyes were filled with fear he went on hastily  perhaps i ought not to say that i have nothing in the world to go on it is only just an idea of mine it isnt that i am afraid anything has happened to him but i feel convinced somehow that we shall not hear anything more of mr weatherley for some time  you will open the safe then this afternoon  i must arnold replied  for several minutes neither of them spoke a word fenella made a pretense at eating her luncheon arnold ate mechanically his thoughts striving in vain to focus themselves upon the immediate question it was she who ended the silence  what do you think you will find in those documents  i have no idea arnold answered to tell you the truth he went on earnestly i was going to ask you whether you knew of anything in his life or affairs which could explain this  i am not sure that i understand you she said  it seems a strange question arnold continued and yet it presents itself i was going to ask you whether you knew of any reason whatsoever why mr weatherley should voluntarily choose to go into hiding  you have something in your mind when you ask me a question like this she said what should i know about it at all what makes you ask me  then arnold took his courage into both hands her eyes seemed to be compelling him  what i am going to say he began may sound very foolish to you i cannot help it i only hope that you will not be angry with me  her eyes met his steadily  no she murmured i will not be angryi promise you that it is better that i should know exactly what is in your mind at present i do not understand  his manner acquired a new earnestness he forgot his luncheon and leaned across the table towards her  fenella he said try and consider how these things of which i am going to speak must have presented themselves to me try if you can and put yourself in my position for a few minutes before that evening on which mr weatherley asked me to come to your house nothing in the shape of an adventure had ever happened to me i had had my troubles but they were ordinary ones such as the whole world knows of from the day when i went to school to the day when i had to leave college hurriedly lost my father and came up to london a pauper life with me was entirely an obvious affair from the night i crossed the threshold of your house things were different  there was a cloud upon her face she began to drum with her slim forefingers upon the tablecloth  i think that i would rather you did not go on she said  he shook his head  i must he declared fervently these things have been in my mind too long it is not well for our friendship that i should have such thoughts and leave them unuttered on that very first eveningthe first time i ever saw youyou behaved in a way strangely you took me into your little sittingroom and i could see that you were in trouble something was happening or you were afraid that it was going to happen you sent me to the window to look out and see if any one were watching the house you remember all that  yes she murmured i remember  there was some one watching it arnold went on i told you i saw your lips quiver with fear then your husband came in and took you away you left me there in the room alone i was to wait for you while i was there one of the men who had been watching stole up through your garden to the very window i saw his face i saw his hand upon the windowsill with that strange ring upon his finger you have not forgotten  forgotten she repeated as though that were possible  very well arnold continued now let me ask you to remember another evening only last week the night i dined with your brother i brought you home from the empire and we found that your sittingroom had been entered from that same window the door was locked and we all thought that burglars must be there i climbed in at the window from the garden you know what i found  all the time she seemed to have been making an effort to listen to him unconcernedly at this point however she broke down she abandoned her attempt at continuing her luncheon she looked up at him and he could see that she was trembling  dont go on she begged please dont  i must he insisted these things have taken possession of me i cannot sleep or rest for thinking of them  for my sake she implored try and forget  he shook his head  it isnt possible he said simply i am not made like that even if you hate me for it i must go on you know what i found in your sittingroom that night  but this is cruel she murmured  i found a dead man a man who to all appearance had been murdered in there not only that but there must have been people close at hand who were connected with him in some way or who were responsible for the crime we left the room for five minutes and when we came back he had disappeared all that we can judge as to what became of him is that that same night a dead man was left in a taxicab not far away by an unknown man whom as yet the police have failed to find  but this is all too horrible she murmured why do you remind me of it  because i must he went on listen there are other things this man starling for instance whom i met at your house and who is suspected of the murder of rosarioboth your brother and you seem to be trying to shield him i dont understand it i cant understand it your brother talked to me strangely the night i dined with him but half the time i felt that he was not serious i do not for a moment believe that he would stoop to any undignified or criminal action i believe in him as i do in you yet if starling is guilty why do you both protect him  is there anything else she faltered  there is the final thing he reminded her the reason why i have mentioned these matters to you at alli mean the disappearance of mr weatherley supposing he does not come back how am i to keep silent knowing all that i know knowing that he was living in a house surrounded by mysteries i hate my suspicions they are like ugly shadows which follow me about i like and admire your brother and youyou know  he could not finish his sentence she raised her eyes and he saw that they were full of tears  help me he begged you can if you will give me your confidence and i will tell you something which i think that even you do not know  something concerned with these happenings  something concerned with them he assented i will tell you when and by whom the body of that man was removed from your sittingroom  she sat looking at him like a woman turned to stone there was incredulity in her eyes incredulity and horror  you cannot know that she faltered  i do know it he asserted  why have you kept this a secret from me she asked  i do not know he answered somehow or other when i have been with you i have felt more anxious to talk of other things then there was another reason which made me anxious to forget the whole affair if i could i had some knowledge of one of the men who were concerned in taking him away  the waiter was busy now with the removal of their luncheon to arnold the necessary exchange of commonplaces was an immense relief it was several minutes before they were alone again then she leaned across towards him she had lit a cigarette now and although she was very thoughtful she seemed more at her ease  listen she began i do not ask you to tell me anything more about that nighti do not wish to hear anything tell me instead exactly what it is that you want from me  i want nothing more nor less he answered gently than permission to be your friend and to possess a little more of your confidence i want you to end this mystery which surrounds the things of which i have spoken  and supposing she said thoughtfully supposing i find that my obligations to other people forbid me to discuss these matters any more with you  i can only hope he answered that you will not feel like that remember that these things must have some bearing upon the disappearance of mr weatherley  she rose to her feet with a little shrug of the shoulders and walked up and down the room for several moments smoking and humming a light tune to herself arnold watched her struggling all the time against the reluctant admiration with which she always inspired him she seemed to read in his eyes what was passing in his mind for when at last she came to a standstill she stood by his side and laughed at him with faintly upraised eyebrows the cigarette smoke curling from her lips  and it was for a luncheon such as this she protested that i wore my new muslin gown and came all the way from the country i expected compliments at least perhaps i even hoped she whispered leaning a little towards him with a smile upon her lipshalf mirthful half provocativethat i might have turned for a moment that wonderfully hard head of yours  arnold rose abruptly to his feet  you treat men as though they were puppets he muttered  and you speak of puppets she murmured as though theirs was a most undesirable existence have you never tried to be a puppet arnold  he stepped a little further back still and gripped the back of the chair but she kept close to him  i am to have no other answer from you then but this foolery he demanded roughly  why yes she replied graciously i have an answer ready for you you are so abrupt listen to what i propose we will go together to your office and see whether it is true that mr weatherley has not returned if he has really disappeared and i think that anything which i can tell you will help perhaps then i will do as you ask it depends a great deal upon what you find in those papers shall we go now or would you like to stay here a little longer  we will go at once he said firmly  she sighed and passed out of the door which he had thrown open  it is i who am a heroine she declared i am coming down to tooley street with you i am coming to brave the smells and the fog and the heat  he handed her into the car he had sufficiently recovered his selfcontrol to smile  in other words he remarked you mean to be there when i open the safe     chapter xxvii  the letters in the safe   the arrival of arnold accompanied by mrs weatherley created a mild sensation in tooley street mr jarvis fussier than ever and blinking continually behind his goldrimmed spectacles followed them into the private office  you have heard nothing of mr weatherley arnold asked  not a word the cashier answered we have rung up several more places and have tried the hospitals again we were all hoping that mrs weatherley had brought us some news  she shook her head  mr weatherley left home exceedingly early this morning she announced i believe that it was before halfpast seven except that he called at the house in hampstead for the letters i have not heard of him since  it is most mysterious mr jarvis declared the governori beg your pardon mr weatherleyis a gentleman of most punctual habits there are several matters of business which he knew awaited his decision today you will excuse me madam if i ask whether mr weatherley seemed in his usual health when he left this morning  fenella smiled faintly  have i not already told you she said that he left the cottage in the country where we spent the weekend before halfpast seven this morning naturally therefore i did not see him the servants however noticed nothing unusual last night mr chetwode here was with us and he can tell you what was apparent to all of us mr weatherley seemed then in excellent health and spirits  mr jarvis had the air of a man hopelessly bewildered excellent servant though he was nature had not bestowed upon him those gifts which enable a man to meet a crisis firmly  can you suggest anything that we ought to do madam he asked mrs weatherley  i think she replied that mr chetwode has something to tell you  arnold took the key of the safe from his pocket and turned to the cashier  a few days ago mr jarvis he said slowly mr weatherley placed certain documents in that safe and gave me the key my instructions from him were to open and examine them with you if he should be for any unexplained cause absent from business  mr jarvis looked blankly incredulous  goodness gracious he murmured weakly why that looks almost as though he expected something of the sort to happen  i think arnold continued that as it is now past three oclock and mr weatherley is still absent we had better open the safe  he crossed the room as he spoke fitted the key in the lock and swung the door open mrs weatherley and the cashier looked over his shoulder there were only the two letters there one was addressed to messrs turnbull  james solicitors the other jointly to mr jarvis and mr arnold chetwode     illustration mrs weatherley and the cashier looked over his    shoulder page 259  there is nothing there for me mrs weatherley asked incredulously  there is nothing at all arnold replied unless there may be an enclosure mr jarvis will you open this envelope  mr jarvis took it to the desk and broke the seal with trembling fingers he smoothed the letter out switched on the electric reading light and they all read it at the same time it was written in mr weatherleys familiar hand every letter of which was perfectly distinct and legible        to jarvis and chetwode        this is a record of certain instructions which i wish       carried out in the event of my unexplained absence from       business at any time        firstlythe business is to continue exactly as usual       and my absence to be alluded to as little as possible it       can be understood that i am away on the continent or       elsewhere on a business voyage        secondlyi have deposited a power of attorney at my       solicitors made out in the joint names of henry jarvis       and arnold chetwode this will enable you both to make       and receive contracts on behalf of the firm as regards       financial affairs messrs neville the accountants have       already the authority to sign cheques and a       representative from their firm will be in attendance each       day or according to your request my letter to messrs       turnbull  james empowers them to make such payments as       are necessary on the joint application of you two henry       jarvis and arnold chetwode to whom i address this       letter        thirdlyi have the most implicit confidence in henry       jarvis who has been in my employ for so many years and       i beg him to understand that i associate with him one so       much his junior for certain reasons into which i beg       that he will not inquire        fourthlyi repeat that i desire as little publicity as       possible to be given to my absence and that no money be       spent on advertisements or any other form of search if       within two years from the date of the opening of this       letter i have not been heard from further i desire that       the usual steps be taken to presume my decease my will       and all further particulars are with messrs turnbull        james        fifthlyi desire you to pay to my wife the sum of five       hundred pounds monthly all other matters concerning my       private estate etc are embodied in the letter to       messrs turnbull  james  they all finished reading the letter about the same time mr jarvis bewilderment grew deeper and deeper  this is the most extraordinary document i ever read in my life he exclaimed why it seems as though he had gone away somewhere of his own accord after all it cant be an accident or anything of that sort  neither arnold nor mrs weatherley made any immediate reply she pointed to the letter  when did he write this she asked  last thursday arnold replied less than a week ago  she sighed softly  really it is most mysterious she said i wonder whether he can have gone out of his mind suddenly or anything of that sort  i have never mr jarvis declared known mr weatherley to display so much acumen and zest in business as during the last few days some of his transactions have been most profitable every one in the place has remarked upon it  mrs weatherley took up the lace parasol which she had laid upon the office table  it is all most bewildering she pronounced i think that it is no use my staying here any longer i will leave you two to talk of it together you have doubtless much business to arrange  are you going back to bourne end or to hampstead arnold asked  she hesitated  really i am not quite sure she replied meeting his gaze without flinching i am beginning to find the heat in town insufferable i think perhaps that i shall go to bourne end  in that case arnold said will you allow me to see you there tonight  tonight she repeated as though in surprise  without a doubt  she did not answer him for a moment meanwhile the telephone rang and mr jarvis was presently engrossed in a business conversation with a customer arnold lowered his voice a little  our discussion at luncheon was only postponed he reminded her we have seen these documents we know now that mr weatherley had some reason to fear an interruption to his everyday life directly or indirectly that interruption is connected with certain things of which you and i have spoken together i am going to ask you therefore to keep your promise i am going to ask you to tell me everything that you know  are you not afraid she asked that i shall consider you a very inquisitive young man  i am afraid of nothing of the sort arnold replied mr weatherleys disappearance is too serious a matter for me to take such trifles into account  she pointed to the letter which still lay upon the table  is it not his expressed wish that you should make no effort towards solving the reasons for his disappearance  there is no reason arnold answered doggedly why one should not attempt to understand them  mr jarvis had finished his telephoning fenella went up to him with outstretched hand  mr jarvis she said there is nothing more i can do here i am very much upset will you take me out to my car please i know that you will do the very best you can without mr weatherley and i am glad that you have mr chetwode to help you i would come down myself sometimes she added but i am sure that i should only be in the way good afternoon mr chetwode  you have not answered my question he persisted  she looked at him as a great lady would look at a presuming servant  i see no necessity she replied i am too much upset to receive visitors today if you are ready mr jarvis  she left the room without even a backward glance closely followed by the cashier arnold stood looking after the retreating figures for a moment then he turned away with a hard little laugh once more he read and reread mr weatherleys letter before he had finished mr jarvis came bustling back into the room  well he exclaimed dramatically well  arnold looked across at him  its a queer business isnt it he remarked  queer business indeed mr jarvis repeated sitting down and wiping his forehead its the most extraordinary thing i ever heard of in my life one doesnt read about such things even in books mrs weatherley seems to take it quite calmly but the more i think of it the more confused i become what are we to do shall we go to the police or write to the newspapers cant you suggest something  arnold finally laid down the letter which he now knew pretty well by heart  it seems to me mr jarvis he said that the thing for us to do is to obey orders mr weatherley expressly writes that he wishes us to take his absence so far as possible as a matter of course and to look after the business the very fact that he puts it like that makes it quite clear to me that he intends to return my idea is that we should follow the lines of his letter strictly  you are quite right chetwode mr jarvis decided i feel exactly that way about the matter myself well go right ahead with those orders now then and we can have a chat about the matter again after business hours if you dont mind its hard to reconcile oneself to taking this so easily but i suppose its the only thing to do ill get out in the warehouse now you had better send that note round to turnbulls by express messenger and ring up yardleys about the american contracts  mr jarvis bustled away arnold himself found plenty to do the business of messrs weatherley  company must go on whatever happened he set himself sedulously to make his mind a complete blank it was not until the offices were closed and he turned at last westwards that he permitted himself even to realize this strange thing that had happened on that first walk was born an impulse which remained with him for many weeks afterwards he found himself always scanning the faces of the streams of people whom he was continually passing on foot and in vehicles half expecting that somewhere among them he would catch a glimpse of the features of the lost mr weatherley     chapter xxviii  talk of treasure ships   in the twilight of the long spring evening ruth sat waiting in the bare room which had been arnolds habitation during these days of his struggle against poverty she was sitting on the couch drawn up as usual to the window her elbows upon her knees her hands supporting her delicate thoughtful face already the color which the sunshine had brought seemed to have been drained from her cheeks her eyes were unnaturally bright her expression seemed to have borrowed something of that wistful earnestness of one of the earlier madonnas seeking with pathetic strenuousness to discover the germs of a truth which was as yet unborn the clouds which hung low over the other side of the river were tinged with an unusual coloring smokestained as they hovered over the chimneys they grew clearer and more full of amber color as they floated slowly southwards through the open window came the ceaseless roar of the city the undernote of grinding commonplace life seeking always to stifle and enchain the thoughts which would escape before her was spread out a telegram she had read it many times until every word was familiar to her it was from arnold and she had received it several hours ago        please be prepared to go out with me directly i return       this evening all well love arnold  it was past eight oclock before her vigil was at an end she listened to his step upon the stairs and as he entered looked at him with all the eagerness of a wistful child tremulously anxious to read his expression a little wave of tenderness swept in upon him he forgot in a moment the anxieties and worries of the day and greeted her gayly  you got my telegram  you extravagant person she answered yes i have been ready for quite a long time  he laughed  to tell you the truth i didnt even pay for the telegram as i had to stay late i took the liberty of sending it through the firms accounts you see i have become quite an important person in tooley street all of a sudden ill tell you about it presently now hold on tightly to your stick im much too impatient to go down the steps one by one im going to carry you all the way  but where to she asked  leave it to me he laughed there are all sorts of surprises for you the lady with the wand has been busy  he carried her downstairs where to her surprise she found a taxicab waiting  but arnold she exclaimed how could you think of such extravagance you know i can walk quite easily a little distance if i take your arm  ill tell you all about it at dinnertime he replied  dinnertime she cried dinner at this hour  why not its quite the fashionable hour i can assure you and to tell you the truth i am half starved  she resigned herself with a sigh of content after all it was so delightful to drift like this with some one infinitely stronger to take the responsibility for everything they drove to a large and popular restaurant close at hand where arnold ordered the dinner with frequent corrections from ruth who sat with a menucard in her hand a band was playing the music of the moment it was all very commonplace but to ruth it was like a living chapter out of her book of dreams even there though the shadow pursued she could bear the silence no longer she dropped her voice a little the place was crowded and there were people at the next table  before i touch anything arnold tell me this is there any news of isaac  none at all he replied it all seemed very alarming to us but it seems to be fizzling out there is only quite a small paragraph in the evening paper you can read it if you like  he drew the evening news from his pocket and passed it to her the paragraph to which he pointed was headed              escape of an anarchist from adam street        up to the time of going to press the man isaac lalonde       whom the police failed to arrest last night on a charge       not at present precisely stated has not been       apprehended the police are reticent about the matter       but it is believed that the missing man was connected       with a dangerous band of anarchists who have lately come       to this country  poor isaac she murmured with a little shiver do you know i remember him years ago when he was the kindesthearted man breathing he went to russia to visit some of his mothers relatives and when he came back everything was changed he saw injustice everywhere and it seemed almost to unbalance his mind the very sight of the westend the crowds coming out of the theatres the shops in bond street seemed to send him half mad and it all started arnold with real pity for the poor it isnt a personal matter with him at any time  arnold nodded thoughtfully  poor chap he remarked just at first i really used to like talking to him he was so earnest and so many of his arguments were absolutely sound  it is only lately ruth said that he has changed so much  i think it is quite time that you and he were separated arnold declared it is evident nowadays that he isnt responsible for his actions  separated she repeated bitterly you talk as though i had a choice of homes  you have he assured her however we wont say anything about that just now i want to talk about myself  and i want to listen dear she exclaimed you must tell me what has happened arnie has mr weatherley taken you into partnership or has some one of your disagreeable relatives found you out and been pouring money into your pockets  neither he replied as a matter of fact there is no mr weatherley just at present  no mr weatherley she repeated wonderingly i dont understand  the slightly worn look came back to arnolds face young and strong though he was he was beginning to feel the strain of the last few days  a most extraordinary thing has happened ruth he declared mr weatherley has disappeared  she looked at him blankly  disappeared i dont understand  he simply didnt turn up at business this morning arnold continued he left bourne end about seven and no one has set eyes on him since  she was bewildered  but how is it that that makes such a difference to you she asked what can have happened to him  no one knows he explained but in a little safe of which he had given me the keys he left behind some letters with instructions that during his absence from business mr jarvis and i should jointly take charge i cant really imagine why i should have been put in such a position but there it is the solicitors have been down this afternoon and i am drawing six pounds a week and a bonus  she took his hand in hers and patted it gently  i am so very glad arnold she said so very glad that the days of your loneliness are over now you will be able to go and take some comfortable rooms somewhere and make the sort of friends you ought to have didnt i always foretell it she went on i used to try and fancy sometimes that the ships we saw were bringing treasure for me too but i never really believed that it wasnt quite likely  he turned and looked at her the first flush of excitement had left her cheeks she was very pale and her soft gray eyes shone like stars her mouth was tremulous it was the passing of a single impulse of selfpity  foolish little girl he exclaimed under his breath you dont really suppose that the treasure which came for me wasnt yours too but there well talk about our plans later on at present what you have to do is to eat and to drink that glass of burgundy and to listen to me i want to talk about myself  it was the subtlest way to distract her thoughts she listened to him with keen interest while he talked of his days work it was not until she mentioned fenellas name that his face clouded over  curiously enough mrs weatherley is displeased with me i should have thought it entirely through her influence and suggestions that mr weatherley had been so kind to me but today i asked her some questions which i felt that i had a right to ask and have been told to mind my own business she left me at the office without even saying good afternoon  what sort of questions  i dont know that i can tell you exactly what the questions were arnold continued because they concerned some matters in which mrs weatherley and her brother were chiefly concerned to tell you the truth ever since that night when i went to hampstead to dine the oddest things seem to have happened to me i have to pinch myself sometimes to realize that this is london and that i am a clerk in the office of a wholesale provision merchant when i let myself go i seem to have been living in an unreal world full of strange excitementsa veritable arabian nights  there was that terrible murder she murmured you saw that didnt you  he nodded  not only saw it he agreed but i seem somehow to have been mixed up with people who know a great deal about it however i have been told to mind my own business and i am going to i have plenty to occupy my thoughts in tooley street i am going to close in my little world and live there the rest i am going to forget  you are coming back she whispered with a joy in her tone which amazed him  i suppose i am he admitted i like and admire mrs weatherleys brother count sabatini and i have a genuine affection for mrs weatherley but i dont understand them i dont understand these mysterious matters in which they seem mixed up  i do not believe she declared that count sabatini would be mixed up in anything dishonorable women so seldom make a mistake you know she continued and i never met any one in my life who seemed so kind and gentle  arnold sighed  i wish i could tell you everything he said then i think you would really be as bewildered as i am mr weatherleys disappearance coming on the top of it all simply makes my brain reel i cant do anything to help straighten things out therefore i am going to do what i am toldi am going to mind my own business  to think only of tooley street she murmured  i shall find it quite enough he answered i want to understand all the details of the business and it isnt easy at first mr jarvis is very sound and good but hes a very small man moving in a very small way even mr weatherley used to laugh at his methods  she was silent for several moments he studied her expression curiously  you dont believe that i shall be able to immerse myself in business he asked  it isnt exactly that she replied i believe that you mean to try and i believe that to some extent you will succeed but i think arnold that before very long you will hear the voices calling again from the world where these strange things happened you are not made of the clay dear which resists for ever  he moved uneasily in his seat her words sounded ominous he was suddenly conscious that his present state of determination was the result of a battle and that the war was not yet ended  she is so beautiful that mrs weatherley ruth continued clasping her hands together and looking for a moment away from her surroundings no one could be blamed for climbing a little way out of the dull world if she held out her hands i have seen so little of either of them arnold but i do know that they both of them have that curious giftwould you call it charmthe gift of creating affection no one has ever spoken to me more kindly and more graciously than count sabatini did when he sat by my side on the lawn what is that gift arnold do you know that with every word he spoke i felt that he was not in the least a stranger there was something familiar about his voice his mannereverything  i think that they are both quite wonderful people arnold admitted  mrs weatherley too was kind ruth went on but i felt that she did not like me very much she has an interest in you and like all women she was a little jealousnot in the ordinary way i dont mean she corrected herself hastily but no woman likes any one in whom she takes an interest to be very kind to any one else  they had reached the stage of their coffee the band was playing the latest waltz it was all very commonplace but they were both young and uncritical the waltz was one which fenella had played after dinner at bourne end while they had sat out in the garden lingering over their dessert a flood of memories stirred him the soft sensuousness of that warm spring night with its perfumed silence its subtly luxurious setting stole through his senses like a narcotic ruth was right it was not to be so easy he called for his bill and paid it ruth laid her fingers upon his arm  arnold she began timidly there is something more i scarcely know how to say it to you and yet it ought not to be difficult you talk all the time as though you were my brother or as though it were your duty to help me it isnt so dear really is it if you could manage to lend me your room for one week i think that i might be able to help myself a little there is a place the clergyman told us of who came to see me once  arnold interrupted her almost roughly a keen pang of remorse assailed him he knew very well that if she had not been intuitively conscious of some change in him the thought which prompted her words would never have entered her brain  dont let me hear you mention it he exclaimed i have made all the arrangements it wouldnt do for me to live in an attic now that i am holding a responsible position in the city come along lean on my arm and mind the corner  they had purposely chosen a table close to the door so that they had only a few steps to take arnold called a taxi and handed ruth in before he told the man the address  now close your eyes he insisted when they were together in the cab  ruth did as she was told  i feel that it is all wrong she murmured leaning back but it is like little bits out of a fairy book and tonight i feel so weak and you are so strong it isnt any use my saying anything arnold is it  not a bit he answered all that you have to do is to hold my hand and wait  in less than ten minutes the cab stopped he hurried her into the entrance hall of a tall somewhat somber building a man in uniform rang a bell and the lift came down they went up it seemed to her seven or eight flights when they stepped out her knees were trembling he caught her up and carried her down a corridor then he fitted a yale key from his pocket into a lock and threw open the door there was a little hall inside with three doors he pushed open the first it was a small bedroom plainly but not unattractively furnished he carried her a little way further down the corridor and threw open another doora tiny sittingroom with a fire burning  our new quarters he exclaimed cheerfully the room at the other end of the passage is mine a pound a week and a woman to come in and light the fires mr jarvis let me have some money and i paid three months rent in advance what do you think of them  i cant think she whispered i cant  he carried her to the window  this is my real surprise dear he announced in a tone of triumph look  the blind flew up at his touch on the other side of the street was a row of houses over which they looked beyond the river whose dark waters were gleaming in the moonlight on their left were the houses of parliament all illuminated on their right the long double line of lights shining upon the water at which they had gazed so often  the lighted way dear he murmured holding her a little more closely to him while i am down in the city you can sit here and watch and you can see the ships a long way further off than you could ever see them from adam street you can see the bend too its always easier isnt it to fancy that something is coming into sight around the corner  she was not looking her head was buried upon his shoulder arnold was puzzled  look up ruth dear he begged i want you to look nowlook along the lighted way and hold my hand very tightly dont you think that after all one of your ships has come home  she lifted her face wet with tears and looked in the direction where he pointed arnold who felt nothing himself but a thrill of pleasure at his new quarters was puzzled at a certain trouble which he seemed to see in her features a faint hopelessness of expression she looked where he pointed but there was none of the eager expectancy of a few weeks ago  it is beautiful arnold she murmured but i cant talk just now  i am going to leave you to get over it he declared im off now to fetch the luggage you wont be afraid to be left here  she shook her head a certain look of relief flashed across her face  no i shall not be afraid she answered  he wheeled the easychair up to the window which he had flung wide open he placed a cushion at the back of her head and left her with a cheerful word she heard his steps go down the corridor the rattle of the lift as it descended then her lips began to tremble and the sobs to shake her shoulders she held out her hands toward that line of lights at which he had pointed and her fingers were clenched  it is becausei am like this she cried half hysterically i dont count     chapter xxix  count sabatini visits   there was an air of subdued excitement about the offices of messrs samuel weatherley  company from nine until halfpast on the following morning for so many years his clerks had been accustomed to see mr weatherley stroll in somewhere about that time his cigar in his mouth his silk hat always at the same angle that it seemed hard for them to believe that this morning they would not hear the familiar footstep and greeting every time a shadow passed the window heads were eagerly raised the sound of the bell on the outside door brought them all to their feet they were all on tiptoe with expectation the time however came and passed the letters were all opened and mr jarvis and arnold were occupying the private office already invoices were being distributed and orders entered up the disappearance of mr weatherley was a thing established  mr jarvis was starting the day in a pessimistic frame of mind  you may take my word for it chetwode he said solemnly to his companion after he had finished going through the letters that we shall never see the governor again  arnold was startled  have you heard anything he asked  mr jarvis admitted gloomily that he had heard nothing  its my belief that nothing more will be heard he added until his bodys found  rubbish arnold declared mr weatherley wasnt the sort of man to commit suicide  mr jarvis looked around the office as though he almost feared that the ghost of his late employer might be listening  it is my belief he said impressively that we none of us knew the sort of man mr weatherley was or rather the sort of man he has become since his marriage  i dont see what marriage with mrs weatherley could have had to do with his disappearance arnold remarked  mr jarvis looked foolishly wise from behind his goldrimmed spectacles  you havent had the opportunity of watching the governor as i have since his marriage he declared take my advice chetwode you are not married i presume  i am not arnold assured him  nor thinking of it  nor thinking of it arnold repeated  when the time comes mr jarvis said dont you go poking about in any foreign islands or places if only the governor had left those smelly european cheeses to take care of themselves hed be sitting here in his chair at this moment smoking a cigar and handing me out the orders you and i are so to speak in a confidential position now chetwode and i am able to say things to you about which i might have hesitated before do you know how much the governor has spent during the last year  no idea arnold replied does it matter  he has spent mr jarvis announced solemnly close upon ten thousand pounds  it sounds like a good deal arnold admitted but i expect he had saved it  of course he had saved it mr jarvis admitted but what has that to do with it one doesnt save money for the pleasure of spending it never since my connection with the firm has mr weatherley attempted to spend anything like one half of his income  then i should think it was quite time he began arnold declared you are not going to suggest i suppose that financial embarrassments had anything to do with mr weatherleys disappearance  mr jarvis started to him the suggestion sounded sacrilegious  my dear chetwode he said you must indeed be ignorant of the resources of the firm when you make such a suggestion i simply wished to point out that after his marriage mr weatherley completely changed all his habits it is not well for a man of his age to change his habits god bless my soul here is an automobile stopping outside if it should be mr weatherley come back  they both hurried eagerly to the window the automobile however which had drawn up outside was larger and more luxurious than mr weatherleys count sabatini folding up his newspaper made a leisurely descent the cashier looked at him curiously  wonder who it is he remarked looks like some sort of a foreigner  it is mrs weatherleys brother arnold told him  mr jarvis was deeply interested a moment later a card was brought in  gentleman wishes to see mr chetwode  you can show him in arnold directed  sabatini was already upon the threshold he carried his gray homburg hat in his hand he seemed to bring with him a subtle atmosphere of refinement the perfection of his clothes the faint perfume from his handkerchief his unusual yet unnoticeable tiethese things were a cult to himself the little array of clerks through whose ranks he had passed stared after him in wonder  how are you my young friend he asked smiling at arnold immersed in business i suppose  we are very busy naturally arnold answered please come in and sit down  sabatini laid his hat and stick upon the table and commenced leisurely to draw off his gloves  this is mr jarvis who has been mr weatherleys righthand man for a great many years arnold said introducing him count sabatini mr weatherleys brotherinlaw  mr jarvis shook hands solemnly  i am glad to know you sir he declared i have not had the pleasure of seeing much of mrs weatherley but my connection with the firm is a very old one  is there any news asked sabatini of our esteemed friend  mr jarvis shook his head mournfully  there is no news he announced i am afraid sir that it will be a long time before we do hear any news if your business is with mr chetwode count sabatini he added i will ask you to excuse me i have plenty to do in the warehouse if there is any information i can give you on behalf of your sister or yourself i shall be very happy to come back if you will send for me  he bustled out closing the door after him sabatini looked around with a faint smile as though his surroundings amused him he then carefully deposited his gloves with his hat selected the most comfortable chair and seated himself  so this is where the money is coined eh he remarked it is fortunate that i have discovered the place for i need some  arnold smiled  we havent had time to do much coining yet  supposing i want five hundred pounds could i have it sabatini asked  arnold shook his head  certainly not he replied unless you had cheeses to sell us for it or bacon messrs weatherley  company are provision merchants not moneylenders  you have the control of the finances havent you  to a certain extent i have arnold admitted  now how much is there in that safe i wonder sabatini asked  about thirteen hundred poundsperhaps even more than that arnold told him  sabatini withdrew the hand which had been fumbling in his pocket arnold looked suddenly into the muzzle of a small shining revolver  it was very foolish of you to give me that information sabatini said you have not forgotten our long conversation i trust i expounded to you most carefully the creed of my life five hundred pounds if you please he added politely  not one hapenny arnold answered seating himself upon the table and folding his arms  ill give you until i count three sabatini announced in a still cold voice  you can give me as long as you like arnold retorted pleasantly  sabatini very deliberately counted three and pulled the trigger of his revolver there was a slight click he looked down the muzzle of the weapon and with a little sigh thrust it back into his pocket  this appears to be one of my failures he declared lend me five shillings then he added i really came out without any silver and i must keep up my reputation i positively cannot leave this office without loot of some sort  arnold handed his visitor two halfcrowns which the latter put gravely into his pocket  come and lunch with me today at my rooms he invited lady blennington and fenella will be there if you bring with you a sufficient appetite you may get value for your five shillings it is the only way you will ever get it back  then i must resign myself to being robbed arnold answered we havent time nowadays for luncheon parties on the whole i think i should be justified in putting the amount down to petty cash i might even debit mrs weatherleys account with it  sabatini took out his cigarette case  you will forgive me he said in your offices i believe it is not the custom but i must confess that i find your atmosphere abominable last night i saw fenella she told me of your disagreement with her and your baseless suspicions really chetwode i am surprised at you  suspicions seems scarcely the word arnold murmured  sabatini sighed  you are such a hideously matteroffact person he declared fenella should have seen your attitude from the humorous point of view it would have appealed to me very much indeed  i am sorry if your sister misunderstood anything that i said arnold remarked a little awkwardly  my dear fellow sabatini continued there seems to have been very little ground for misunderstanding fenella was positively hurt she says that you seem to look upon us as a sort of adventurer and adventuresspeople who live by their wits you understand from hour to hour without character or reputation she is quite sure in her own mind that you believe mr weatherleys absence to be due to our secret and criminal machinations  i am sorry arnold replied if anything i said to your sister has given her that impression the fact remains however that mrs weatherley has declined to give me any explanation of various incidents which were certainly more than bewildering one cannot help feeling he went on after a moments hesitation that if my friendship were of any account to your sisterwhich of course it isntshe would look at the matter differently  my dear chetwode sabatini declared my sympathies are entirely with you the trouble of it is of course that the explanations which you demand will probably leave you only the more bewildered when i came to london he continued watching the smoke from his cigarette i said to myself in this great black city all hopes of adventure must be buried fenella will become a model wife of the bourgeoisie i myself if i stay shall probably become director of some city company where they pay fees give up baccarat for bridge imbibe whiskey and soda instead of the wine of my country perhaps evenwho knowsi may take to myself a wife and live in a villa on the contrary other things have happened even here the earth has trembled a little under our feet even now we listen for the storm  you talk to me always in parables arnold protested how am i to understand what you mean  you have reason my young friend sabatini admitted calmly ask your questions  first of all then you know where mr weatherley is  sabatini made a wry face  let us leave this respectable weatherley out of the case for a moment he said to tell you the truth i am weary of him i would speak of ourselvesof my sister and myself and those others you cannot deny that however wicked you may think us we are at least interesting  have you come here to make fun of me arnold asked quietly  not in the least sabatini assured him on the contrary i have come to make friends my sister is penitent we have decided to take your discretion for granted i am here to explain you want to understand all these things which seem to you so mysterious well ask your questions what is it that you wish to know  nothing arnold replied i have come to the conclusion that i was wrong to speak to your sister as i did i have a great responsibility here which will occupy all my thoughts i am going to devote myself to work the other things do not interest me any longer  sabatini smiled  my young friend he murmured you may say that to yourself but it is not true it is not life for you to buy these articles of food at one price and sell them for another to hold the profit in your hand and smile that is what life means in tooley street you could do it for a little time perhaps but not for very long  it may seem absurd to you arnold protested but its my duty for the present anyhow and i am going to do it i shall have to work ten hours a day and i shall have no time for dreams i am going to stay in the atmosphere i have to live in  sabatini shook his head  you must have relaxation  i can find it arnold replied i can find it without going so far afield  sabatini was silent for a moment he was a man of few expressions but he seemed a little disappointed  will you do your duty any the less zealously do you think he asked because you have friends who take an interest in you  arnold was suddenly conscious of the ungraciousness of his attitude  you dont understand he exclaimed a little desperately your world wasnt made for me i havent any place in it my work is here i cant allow myself always to be distracted your sister is the most wonderful person i ever met and it is one of the greatest pleasures i have ever known to talk to her even for a few minutes but i am more at peace with myself and with the world when i am away from her  there was a gleam of approval in sabatinis dark eyes he nodded thoughtfully  it is well spoken my sister chose to marry samuel weatherley and the women of our race have been famous throughout history for their constancy must you my dear young friend go and hide your head in the sand because a woman is beautiful and chooses to be kind to you fenella values your friendship you have done her a service and you have done me a service a few nights ago it amused me to feed your suspicions this morning i feel otherwise we do not choose either of us that you should think of us quite in the way you are thinking now  arnold hesitated no longer then he came and stood by his visitor  since you insist then he declared i will ask you the questions which i should have asked your sister that is what you desire  assuredly sabatini assented  first then who killed rosario  there is a certain directness about your methods sabatini said suavely which commends itself to me no one could mistake you for anything but an englishman  tell me who killed rosario arnold repeated  as you will sabatini replied rosario was murdered by a portuguese jewa man of the name of isaac lalonde     chapter xxx  some questions answered   arnold stood quite still for several moments the shock seemed to have deprived him even of the power of speech sabatini watched him curiously  is it my fancy he inquired or is the name familiar to you  the name is familiar arnold confessed  sabatini for a moment appeared to be puzzled  lalonde he repeated to himself why lalonde he added looking up quickly was the name of the young lady whom you brought with you to bourne end an uncommon name too  her uncle arnold declared the same man beyond a doubt the police tried to arrest him two days ago and he escaped you might have read of it in the paper it was spoken of as an attempt to capture an anarchist lalonde fired at them when he made his escape  sabatini sighed  it is a small world he admitted i know all about isaac lalonde but i am very sorry indeed to hear that the young lady is connected with him she seemedi hope you will forgive meto speak as though she lived in straitened circumstances do you mind telling me whether this event is likely to prove of inconvenience to her  arnold shook his head  i am making arrangements to find her another apartment he said we have been through some very dark times together i feel that i have the right to do everything that is necessary i have no one else to support  sabatini hesitated  if one might be permitted he began with what was for him a considerable amount of diffidence  arnold interposed a little brusquely  the care of ruth lalonde is upon my shoulders he insisted there can be no question about that from me it is not charity for she shared her meals with me when i was practically starving i am going to ask you more questions  proceed by all means sabatini invited  was starling concerned at all in this rosario affair  not directly sabatini admitted  then why arnold demanded does he hide and behave like a frightened child  a pertinent question sabatini agreed you have to take into account the mans constitutional cowardice it is a fact however that he was perfectly well aware of what was going to happen and there are circumstances connected with the affaira document for instance that we know to be in the hands of the policewhich account for their suspicions and would certainly tend to implicate our friend starling it would be quite easy to make out a very strong case against him  i do not understand arnold said after a moments silence what interest lalonde could have had in killing rosario  sabatini contemplated for a few moments the tip of his patent shoe then he sighed gently and lit a cigarette  for a young man he remarked it is certain that you have a great deal of curiosity still you have also i believe discretion listen then there is a certain country in the south of europe which all those who are behind the scenes know to be on the brink of a revolution the capital is already filled with newspaper correspondents the thunder mutters day by day the army is unpaid and full of discontent for that reason it is believed that their spirit is entirely revolutionary every morning we who know expect to read in the papers that the royal palace has been stormed and the king become an exile this was the state of things until about a week ago did you read the papers on thursday morning last  arnold shook his head  perhaps he replied i saw nothing that i can remember  that morning sabatini continued the morning of rosarios death one read that the government of that country which had vainly applied for a loan to all the bankers of europe with a view to satisfying the claims of the army and navy had at last succeeded in arranging one through the intervention of rosario the paragraph was probably inspired but it spoke plainly going so far even as to say that the loan had probably averted a revolution the man who had saved the monarchy of an ancient nation was rosario one of his rewards i think was to have been a title and a distinguished order it was understood among us that this was the real bait rosarios actual reward you know of  but where does isaac lalonde come in demanded arnold  isaac lalonde is the london secretary of the revolutionary party of the country of which i have been speaking i think he concluded that your intelligence will make the rest clear  arnold struck the table on the edge of which he was sitting with the palm of his hand  look here he asked hoarsely if you knew all these things if you knew that isaac lalonde had committed this murder why do you go about with your lips closed why havent you told the truth an innocent man might be arrested at any time  sabatini smiled tolerantly  my dear fellow he said why should i be reasonable when you reach my age you will find that silence is often best as a matter of fact in this ease my sympathies are very much involved it is in the mind of many of those who hold the strings that when that revolution does take place it will be i who shall lead it  arnold was again bewildered  but you he protested are of the ancient nobility of europe what place have you among a crowd of anarchists and revolutionaries  you jump at conclusions my young friend remarked sabatini the country of which we have spoken is my country the country from which by an unjust decree i am exiled there are among those who desire a change of government many aristocrats it is not only the democracy whose hatred has been aroused by the selfish and brutal methods of the reigning house  arnold got down from his table and walked to the window the telephone rang with some insignificant inquiry from a customer the incident somehow relieved him it brought him back to the world of everyday events the reality of life once more obtruded itself upon his conscience all the time sabatini lounged at his ease and watched him always with the faint beginning of a smile upon his lips  what i have told you the latter continued after a few moments pause must not during these days pass beyond the four walls of this singularly uninvitinglooking apartment i have nothing to add or to take from what i have said the subject is closed if you have more questions on any other subject i have still a few minutes  very well then arnold said coming back to his place let us consider the rosario matter disposed of let us go back for a moment to starling tell me why you and your sister saw danger to yourselves in starlings nervous breakdown tell me why when i returned to pelham lodge with her that night she found a dead man in her room a man whose body was afterwards mysteriously removed  quite a spirited number of questions sabatini remarked well to begin with then rosario signed his deathwarrant the moment he wrote his name across the parchment which guaranteed the loan on the night when you first visited pelham lodge we heard the news i believe that lalonde and his friends would have killed him that night if they could have got at him lalonde however was a person of strange and inaccessible habits he hated all aristocrats and he refused even to communicate with me speaking for myself i was just as determined as isaac lalonde that rosario should never conclude that loan i told him so that nightstarling and i together it was thought necessary by those whose word i am content to accept that what i had to say to rosario should come through starling it was starling therefore who told him what his position would be if he proceeded further i must admit that the fellow showed courage he took a note of starlings words which he declared at the time should be deposited in his safe so that if anything should happen to him some evidence might be forthcoming the police without a doubt have been in possession of this document and curiously enough starling was at the milan that day you will perceive therefore that in the absence even of a reasonable alibi it might be difficult to prove his innocence to our surprise however for we had some faith in the fellow instead of taking this matter with the indifference of a brave man he has chosen to behave like a child in his present half maudlin state he would i am afraid if in serious danger of conviction make statements likely to cause a good deal of inconvenience to myself my sisters friends and others  does he know himself who committed the murder arnold asked  sabatini smiled  perfectly well he admitted but the fact helps him very little isaac lalonde is rather a notable figure among european criminals he belongs to a company of anarchists wellmeaning but bloodthirsty who hold by one another to the death if starling to save himself were to disclose the name of the real murderer he would simply make his exit from this life with a knife through his heart instead of the hangmans rope about his neck these fellows i believe seldom commit crimes but they are very much in earnest and very dangerous if you ever happen to meet one of them with a red signetring upon his fourth finger you can look out for trouble  arnold shivered for a moment  i have seen that ring he murmured  you were a spectator of the tragedy i remember sabatini agreed pleasantly now are you quite satisfied about starling  i have heard all i want to about that arnold admitted  we come then to your last question sabatini said you demand to know the meaning of the unfortunate incident which occurred in my sisters boudoir here i think that i am really going to surprise you  nothing arnold declared fervently could surprise me however go on  neither fenella nor myself sabatini asserted have the slightest idea as to how that man met with his death  but you know who he was arnold asked you know why he was watching your house why he seems to have broken into it  i can assure you sabatini repeated that not only am i ignorant as to how the man met with his death but i have no idea what he was doing in the house at all the night rosario was there it was different they were on his track then without a doubt and they meant mischief since then however there has been a pronounced difference of opinion between the two branches of the revolutionary partythe one which i represent and the one which includes lalonde and his friends the consequence is that although we may be said to be working for the same ends we have drawn a little apart we have had no communications whatever with lalonde and his friends since the murder of rosario therefore i can only repeat that i am entirely in the dark as to what that man was doing in my sisters rooms or how he met with his death you must remember that these fellows are all more or less criminals lalonde i believe is something of an exception but the rest of them are at war with society to the extent of enriching themselves at the expense of their wealthier neighbors on every possible occasion it is quite likely that the night they were watching rosario it may have occurred to them that my sisters room contained a good many valuable trifles and was easily entered especially as they seem to have had a meeting place close at hand that however is pure surmise you follow me  arnold sighed  in a way i suppose i do he admitted butit isnt easy is it  these matters are not easy sabatini agreed there are motives and countermotives to be taken note of with which at present i do not weary you i give you the clue it is enough  but the mystery of the mans body being removed arnold began  sabatini shrugged his shoulders  our knowledge ends with what i have told you he said we have no idea who killed the man and what we know about his removal we know only from what you saw  arnold sat thinking for several moments the telephone rang and some one inquired for mr weatherley when he had answered it he turned once more to his visitor  do you know he remarked that nothing that you have yet told me throws the slightest light upon the disappearance of mr weatherley  sabatini smiled  ah well he said i am afraid that as yet i have not fully appreciated that incident in france it is by no means unusual that a man should take a hurried journey from his family i perhaps have not sufficiently taken into account mr weatherleys exactness and probity of life his disappearance may indeed have a more alarming significance than either my sister or i have been inclined to give it but let me assure you of this my dear chetwode that even if mr weatherley has come to serious grief neither fenella nor i can suggest the slightest explanation for it she knows of no reason for his absence neither do i she is however just as convinced as i am that he will turn up again and before very long  sabatini pushed away his chair and prepared to leave his hand fell carelessly and yet almost affectionately upon the young mans shoulder  perhaps he said quietly i am what you are doubtless thinking mesomething of a poseur perhaps i do like making a tax upon your sober british rectitude i will admit that the spirit of adventure is in my heart i will admit that there is in my blood the desire to take from him who hath and give to him who hath not but on the other hand i have my standards and i seriously do not think that you would be risking very much if you accepted my invitation to lunch today  arnold held out his hand  if i hesitate for a single moment he replied frankly it is because of my work here however as you say that mrs weatherley will be there i will come  we shall look forward to the pleasure then sabatini concluded now i will leave you to go on with your moneycoining au revoir  he strolled gracefully out pausing on his way through the clerks office to offer a courteous farewell to mr jarvis the great automobile glided away arnold came back from the window and sat down in front of his desk before his eyes was a pile of invoices in his brain a strange medley of facts and fancies  mr jarvis came bustling in  about those canadian hams chetwode he began  arnold recognized the voice of his saviour  well go into the matter at once he declared briskly     chapter xxxi  a luncheonparty   it seemed to arnold that he had passed indeed into a different world as he followed count sabatinis austere looking butler across the white stone hall into the cool diningroom where the little party which he had come to join was already at luncheon outside an unexpected heat seemed to have baked the streets and drained the very life from the air here the blinds were closely drawn the great height of the room with its plain faultless decorations its piles of sweetsmelling flowers and the faint breeze that came through the venetian blinds made it like a little oasis of coolness and repose the luncheonparty consisted of four peoplecount sabatini himself lady blennington fenella and a young man whom arnold had seen once before attached to one of the legations fenella held out both her hands  im afraid i am late arnold said  it is my fault for not mentioning the hour sabatini interposed we are continental in our tastes and we like to breakfast early  in any case you would be forgiven fenella declared for this as you know is our party of reconciliation  what have you two been quarreling lady blennington exclaimed you dont deserve to have admirers fenella you always treat them badly how is it youve never been to see me mr chetwode  not because i have forgotten your kind invitation arnold replied taking the chair by fenellas side which the butler was holding for him unfortunately i am at work nearly every afternoon  mr chetwode is my husbands secretary now you must remember fenella remarked and during his absence he naturally finds a great deal to do  well i am sure i am only too glad lady blennington said to hear of a young man who does any work at all nowadays they mostly seem to do nothing but hang about looking for a job when you told me she continued that you were really in the city i wasnt at all sure that you were in earnest  sabatini sighed  i can assure you lady blennington he declared that so far as my sex is represented here today we are very strenuous people indeed signor di marito here carries upon his shoulders a burden just at the present moment which few of the ambassadors would care to have to deal with mr chetwode i have visited in his office and i can assure you that so far as his industry is concerned there is no manner of doubt as for myself  lady blennington interrupted gayly  come she said i believe it of these two others if you insist but you are not going to ask us to believe that you the personification of idleness are also among the toilers  sabatini looked at her reproachfully  one is always misunderstood he murmured this morning as a matter of fact i have been occupied since daybreak  let us hear all about it lady blennington demanded  my energies have been directed into two channels sabatini announced i have been making preparations for a possible journey and i have been trying to find a missing man  arnold looked up quickly fenella paused with her glass raised to her lips  who is the missing man lady blennington asked  mr weatherley sabatini replied we can scarcely call him that perhaps but he has certainly gone off on a little expedition without leaving his address  well you amaze me lady blennington exclaimed i never thought that he was that sort of a husband  did you make any discoveries asked arnold  sabatini shook his head  none he confessed as an investigator i was a failure however i must say that i prosecuted my inquiries in one direction only it may interest you to know that i have come to the conclusion that mr weatherleys disappearance is not connected in any way with the matters of which we spoke this morning  then it remains the more mysterious declared arnold  fenella at any rate is not disposed to wear widows weeds remarked lady blennington cheer up dear hell come back all right husbands always do it is our other intimate friends who desert us  fenella laughed  i am quite sure that you are right she admitted i am not really worried at all it is a very annoying manner however in which to go away thisa desertion most unceremonious and now andrea here tells me that at any moment he may leave me too  they all looked at him he inclined his head gravely  nothing is decided he said i have friends abroad who generally let me know when things are stirring there is a little cloudit may blow over or it may be the presage of a storm in a day or two we shall know  you men are to be envied lady blennington sighed speaking for a moment more seriously you have the power always to roam you follow the music of the world wherever you will the drum beats you pull up your stakes and away you go but for us poor women alas there is never any pulling up of the stakes we too hear the musicperhaps we hear it oftener than youbut we may not follow  you have compensations sabatini remarked  we have compensations of course lady blennington admitted but what do they amount to after all  you have also a different set of instincts signor di marito interposed there are other things in the life of a woman than to listen always to the wandermusic  the question is as old as the hills fenella declared and it bores me i want some more omelette really andrea your chef is a treasure if you get your summons i think that i shall take him over who will come to the theatre with me tonight i have two stalls for the gaiety  i cant lady blennington remarked i am going to a foolish dinnerparty besides which of course you dont want to be bothered with a woman  nor can i sabatini echoed i have appointments all the evening  i alas signor di marito sighed must not leave my post for one single moment these are no days for theatregoing for my poor countrymen  then the duty seems to devolve upon you fenella decided smiling toward arnold  i am sorry he replied but i too seem to be unfortunate i could not possibly get away from the city in time  absurd she answered a little sharply you are like a boy with a new hobby it is i who wish that you leave when you choose  apart from that arnold continued i am sorry but i have an engagement for the evening  she made a little grimace  with your invalid friend  arnold assented  i should not like to leave her alone this evening she has been in a great deal of trouble lately  there was a moments silence a slight frown had gathered on fenellas forehead  i noticed that she was dressed wholly in black she remarked perhaps she is in trouble because she has lost a relative lately  she appears to have no relatives in the world arnold declared except an uncle and he i am afraid is a little worse than useless to her  sabatini who had been listening leaned a little forward  she lives entirely alone with the uncle of whom you have spoken he asked  up till yesterday she has done so arnold answered gravely just at present as you know he has gone away i only wish that i could find him  going away as you put it fenella murmured seems to be rather the fashion just now  arnold glanced up quickly but her expression was entirely innocent he looked across the table however and found that sabatini was watching him pensively fenella leaned towards him she spoke almost in a whisper but her tone was cold almost unfriendly  i think she said that with regard to that young woman you carry chivalry too far  arnold flushed slightly then sabatini with a little murmur of words changed the conversation once more it became entirely general and presently the meal drew towards a pleasant termination fenella and lady blennington left together at the moment of departure the former turned towards arnold  so i cannot induce you to become my escort for tonight she asked  there was appeal half humorous half pathetic in her eyes arnold hesitated but only for a moment  i am sorry he said but indeed i shall not be able to leave the office until after the time for the theatre  you will not obey my orders about the office  i could not in any case leave ruth alone this evening he replied  she turned away from him the little gesture with which she refused to see his hand seemed to be one of dismissal  signor di marito you will take us to the automobile will you not she said perhaps we can drop you somewhere goodbye andrea and thank you very much for your charming luncheon if the message comes you will telephone i know  arnold lingered behind while sabatini showed his guests to the door when he too would have left however his host motioned him to resume his chair  sit down for a few minutes he begged you have probably seen enough of me for today but i may be called away from england at any moment and there is a question i want to ask you before i go  arnold nodded  you are really in earnest then about leaving he asked  assuredly sabatini replied i cannot tell you exactly how things may go in my country but if there is a rising against the reigning house a sabatini will certainly be there i have had some experience in soldiering and i have a following it is true that i am an exile but i feel that my place is somewhere near the frontier  arnold glanced enviously at the man who lounged in the chair opposite him he seemed to carry even about his person a flavor from the faroff land of adventures  what i want to ask you is this sabatini said a few minutes ago you declared that you were anxious to discover the whereabouts of your little friends uncle tell me why  i will tell you with pleasure arnold answered you see she is left absolutely alone in the world i do not grumble at the charge of her for when i was nearly starving she was kind to me and we passed our darkest days together on the other hand i know that she feels it keenly and i think it is only right to try and find out if she has no relatives or friends who could possibly look after her  it is perfectly reasonable sabatini confessed i can tell you where to find isaac lalonde if you wish  arnolds little exclamation was one almost of dismay  you know he cried  naturally sabatini admitted you have a tender conscience my young friend and a very limited knowledge of the great necessities of the world you think that a man like isaac lalonde has no real place in a wholesome state of society you have some reason in what you think but you are not altogether right in any case this is the truth however much it may horrify you to know it and notwithstanding our recent differences of opinion communications have frequently taken place between the committee who are organizing the outbreak in portugal among which you may number me and the extreme anarchists whom isaac represents  you would not really accept aid from such arnold exclaimed  sabatini smiled tolerantly  there are many unworthy materials he said which go to the building of a great structure youth rebels at their use but age and experience recognize their necessity the anarchist of your halfpenny papers and police news is not always the bloodthirsty ruffian that you who read them are led to suppose very often he is a man who strenuously seeks to see the light it is not always his fault if the way which is shown him to freedom must cross the rivers of blood  arnold moved uneasily in his chair his host spoke with such quiet conviction that the stock arguments which rose to his lips seemed somehow curiously ineffective  nevertheless he protested the philosophy of revolutions  we will not discuss it sabatini declared with a smile you and i need not waste our time in academic discussion these things are beside the mark what i had to say to you is this if you really wish to speak with isaac lalonde and will give me your word to keep the knowledge of him to yourself i can tell you where to find him  i do wish to speak to him for the reasons i have told you arnold replied if he were to disappear from the face of the earth as seems extremely probable at the present moment ruth would be left without a friend in the world except myself  sabatini wrote an address upon a slip of paper  you will find him there he announced go slowly for the neighborhood is dangerous can i drop you anywhere  arnold shook his head  thank you he said i must go straight back to the office i will take the tube from the corner  sabatini escorted his guest to the door as they stood there together looking down into the quiet street he laid his hand upon the young mans shoulder  i will not say goodbye he declared because although i am here waiting all the time i do not believe that the hour has come for me to go it will be soon but not just yet when we first met i thought that i should like to take you with me i thought that the life in what will become practically a new country would appeal to you since then i have changed my mind i have thought of my own career and i have seen that it is not the life or career for a young man to follow the adventures of the worker in the cities are a little grayer perhaps than those which come to the man who is born a wanderer but they lead home just as surelyperhaps more safely au revoir  he turned away abruptly the door was softly closed arnold went down the steps and set his face citywards     chapter xxxii  isaac in hiding   arnold as he neared the end of his journey felt indeed that he had found his way into some alien world the streets through which after many directions he had passed had all been strange to him strange not only because of their narrowness their poverty their ill flavor but on account also of the foreign names above the shops the street cries and the dark unfamiliar aspects of the people after losing his way more than once he discovered at last a short street branching out of a narrow but populous thoroughfare there were no visible numbers but counting the houses on the lefthand side and finding the door of the seventh open he made his way inside the place was silent and seemed deserted he climbed the stairs to the second story and knocked at the door of the front room so far although barely a hundred yards away was a street teeming with human beings he had not seen a soul in the place  his first knock remained unanswered he tried again this time he heard a movement inside which he construed as an invitation to enter he threw open the door and stepped in the blind was closely drawn and to his eyes unaccustomed to the gloom there seemed to be no one in the place suddenly the fire of an electric torch flashed into his eyes a familiar voice from a distant corner addressed him  what the devil are you doing here  the light was as suddenly turned off arnold could see now that the man whom he had come to visit had barricaded himself behind an upturned table in a distant corner of the room  i want a word or two with you isaac arnold said  who told you where to find me  count sabatini  have you told any one else  no  are you alone  absolutely  isaac came slowly out into the room his appearance if possible was a little more ghastly even than when arnold had seen him last he was unshaven and his eyes shone with the furtiveness of some hunted animal in his hand he was holding a murderouslooking pistol  say what you wantbe quickand get away isaac muttered i am not here to receive visitorsnot your sort any way you understand that  you seem to be prepared to receive some one in a most unpleasant manner arnold said gravely is that sort of thing worth while isaac  worth while  there was a brief pause arnold having asked his question was looking at his companion half in horror half in pity isaac white with passion seemed unable for the moment to make any intelligible reply then drawing in his breath as though with an effort he walked past arnold and stood for a moment on the threshold of the door listening intently satisfied apparently that there was nothing to be heard save the usual street noises he closed the door softly and came back into the room  you he said to arnold are one of the clods of the earth to whom it is not given to understand you are one of those who would fall before the carriages of the rich and hold out your hands for their alms you are one of those who could weep and weep and watch the children die wringing your hands while the greedy ones of the world stuff themselves at their costly restaurants the world is full of such as you it is full too of many like myself in whose blood the fever burns into whose brain the knowledge of things has entered in whose heart the seared iron burns  thats all right for hyde park arnold declared bluntly but do you imagine you are going to help straighten the world by this sort of thing  in my way i am isaac snarled what do you know of it you smoothfaced healthy young animal comfortably born comfortably bred falling always on your feet in comfortable fashion with the poison of comfort in your veins you look at my pistol as an evil thing because it can spell the difference between life and death i will tell you what it represents to me it represents my rebellion and the rebellion of my class against what you choose to call here law and order law and order are good enough things but they have become the tools with which the smug rich keep themselves in luxury in the fat places of the world while millions of others gripping vainly at the outside of life fall off into the bottomless chasm  its the wrong method isaac arnold insisted earnestly  isaac threw out his handa little gesture half of contempt not altogether without its touch of dignity  this isnt any place for words he said nor is it given to you to be the champion of your class let me alone speak your errand and be gone no one can tell when the end may come it will be better for you when it does that you are not here  i have come on account of your niece whom you left penniless and homeless arnold said sternly with your immense sympathy for others perhaps you can explain this little act of inattention on your part  isaacs start of surprise was genuine enough  i had forgotten her he admitted curtly i saw the red fires that night and since then there has been no moment to breathe or thinknothing to do but get ready for the end i had forgotten her  she is safe for the present arnold told him my circumstances have improved and i have taken a small flat in which there is a room for her this may do for the present but ruth after all is a young woman she is morbidly sensitive however willing i may be and i am willing it is not right that she should remain with me i have always taken it for granted that save for you she has no relatives and no friends is this the truth is there no one whom she has the right to ask for a home  isaac was silent some movements in the street below disturbed him and he walked with catlike tread to the window peering through a hole in the blind for several moments when he was satisfied that nothing unusual was transpiring he came back  listen he said hoarsely i am a dead man already in all but facts i can tell you nothing of ruths relatives better that she starved upon the streets than found them but there is her chance still my mind has been filled with big things and i had forgotten it before we moved into adam street the last doctor who saw ruth suggested an operation he felt sure that it would be successful it was to cost forty guineas i have saved very nearly the whole of that money it stands in her name at the westminster savings bank if she goes there and proves her identity she can get it i saved that moneygod knows how  what is the name of the doctor arnold asked  his name was heskell and he was at the london hospital isaac replied now i have done with you that is ruths chancethere is nothing else i can do be off as quickly as you can if you give information as to my whereabouts you will probably pay for it with your life for there are others besides myself who are hiding in this house now go do you hear  arnolds anger against the man suddenly faded away it seemed to him as he stood there that he was but a product of the times fashioned by the grinding wheel of circumstance a physical wreck a creature without love or life or hope  isaac he said why dont you try and escape get away to some other country out onto the land somewhere leave the wrongs of these others to come right with time work for your daily bread give your brain a rest  isaac made no reply only his long skinny forefinger shot out toward the door arnold knew that he might just as well have been talking to the most hopeless lunatic ever confined in padded room  if this is to be farewell isaac he continued let me at least tell you this before i go you are doing ruth a cruel wrong god knows i am willing enough to take charge of her but its none the less a brutal position for you to put her in you have the chance if you will to set her free think what her life has been up till now have you ever thought of it i wonder have you ever thought of the long days she has spent in that attic when you have been away without books with barely enough to eat without companionship or friends these are the things to which you have doomed her by your cursed selfishness if she has friends who could take her away and you refuse to speak then all i can say is that you deserve any fate that may come to you  isaac remained silent for several moments his face was dark and dogged when he spoke it was with reluctance  young man he said every word which you have spoken has been in my brain while i have lain here waiting for the end a few hours ago i slept and had a dream when i awoke i was weak see here  he drew from his pocket two sheets of closelywritten foolscap  the story of ruths life is here he declared i wrote it with a stump of pencil on the back of this table i wrote it but i have changed my mind and i am going to tear it up  arnold was light on his feet with a great reach and isaac was unprepared in a moment the latter was on his back and the soiled sheets of foolscap were in arnolds pocket isaacs fingers seemed to hover upon the trigger of his pistol as he lay there crouched against the wall  dont be a fool arnold cried roughly youll do no good by killing me the girl has a right to her chance  there were several seconds of breathless silence during which it seemed to arnold that isaac had made up and changed his mind more than once then at last he lowered his pistol  well call it chance he muttered i never meant to write the rubbish since you have got it though it is the truth do with it what you will there is one thing more you know this man sabatini  if you mean the count sabatini it was he who gave me your address arnold reminded him  isaac smiled grimly  citizen sabatini is all we know him by here he knows well that to a man with his aspirations a man who desires to use as his tools such as myself and my comrades a title is an evil recommendation he came to us first as a man and a brotherhe count sabatini marquis de lossa chevalier de st jerome knight of the holy roman empirean aristocrat you perceive and one of the worst yet we have trusted him  i do not believe arnold exclaimed that sabatini would betray any one  i am not accusing him isaac said solemnly i simply hold that he is not the man to lead a great revolutionary movement it is for that reason among others that i have rejected his advances sabatini as president would mean very much the same thing as a king will you give him a message from me  yes arnold answered i will do that  tell him if indeed he has the courage which fame has bestowed upon him to come here and bid me farewell i have certain things to say to him  i will give him your message arnold promised but i shall not advise him to come  a look of anger flashed in isaacs face the pistol which had never left his grip was slowly raised only to be lowered again  do as i say he repeated tell him to come perhaps i may have more to say to him about that other matter than i choose to say to you  about ruth  about ruth isaac repeated sternly  you would trust a stranger arnold exclaimed with information which you deny meher friend  isaac waved him away  be off he said tersely i have queer humors sometimes lying here waiting for the end dont let it be your fate to excite one of them you have had your escape  what do you mean arnold demanded  isaac laughed hoarsely  how many nights ago was it he asked that you threw up a window in the man weatherleys housethe night morris and i were there seeking for rosario  i never saw you arnold exclaimed  no but you saw morris isaac continued what is more you saw him again on the stairs with me that night and it very nearly cost you your life lucky for you young man that you were not at hampstead the night when morris went there to seek for you  arnold was speechless  you mean that he was there that night looking for me he cried  he hated you all isaac muttered you and the woman and sabatini and he was a little madjust a little mad if he had found you all there  well arnold interposed breathlessly  isaac shook his head  never mind  but i do mind arnold insisted i want to know about that night was it in search of us  isaac held out his skinny hand there was a dangerous glitter in his eyes  it is enough he snarled i have no more to say about what is past send me sabatini and he shall hear news from me  arnold retreated slowly towards the threshold  if you will take the advice of a sane man he said you will throw that thing away and escape if i can help  isaac was already creeping to his hidingplace he turned around with a contemptuous gesture  there is no escape for me he declared every day the police draw their circle closer so much the better when they come they will find me prepared if you are still here in sixty seconds he added i will treat you as i shall treat them  arnold closed the door and made his way into the street     chapter xxxiii  sabatinis daughter   sabatini already dressed for the evening his coat upon his arm paused only to light a cigarette and read once more the telegram which he held between his fingers before he left his house to step into the automobile which was waiting outside his servant entered the room with his silk hat  you will remember carefully my instructions pietro he said  assuredly sir the man answered  if there is a telegram any communication from the embassy or telephone message you will bring it to me yourself at once at number 17 grosvenor square if any one should call to see me you know exactly where i am to be found  there is a young gentleman here now sir the man announced he has just arrived  the young gentleman who was here before today sabatini asked  the same excellency  sabatini laid down his coat  you can show him in he directed wait for me outside  arnold who had come straight from the unknown world in which he had found isaac was shown in immediately pietro closed the door and withdrew sabatini looked inquiringly at his visitor  you have seen isaac he asked  i have seen him arnold assented  you bring me news  it is true arnold replied i bring news  sabatini waited patiently arnold remained for a moment gloomily silent it was hard to know how to commence  you will forgive my reminding you sabatini said quietly that i am on the point of starting out to keep an engagement i would not mention it but in one respect london hostesses are exacting there are many liberties which are permitted here but one must not be late for dinner  arnolds memory flashed back to the scene which he had just leftto isaac the outcast crouched beneath his barricade of furniture waiting in the darkness with his loaded pistol and murder in his heart sabatini calm and dignified in his rigidly correct evening dress his grace and goodlooks represented with curious appositeness the other extreme of life  i will not keep you long arnold began but there is something which you must hear from me and hear at once  assuredly sabatini murmured it is something connected with your visit to this poor misguided outcast i am afraid there is nothing we can do for him  there is nothing any one can do for him arnold declared i went to see him because when he fled from his rooms and they were seized by the police his niece was left penniless and homeless fortunately the change in my own circumstances permitted me to offer her a shelterfor the moment at any rate i have told you something of this before but i am obliged to repeat it you will understand presently it is of some importance  sabatini bowed  the young lady is still under your care he asked  she is still with me arnold admitted i took two rooms not very far away from here i did it because it was the only thing to do but i can see now that as a permanent arrangement it will not answer already even a shadow seems to have sprung up between us i am beginning to understand what it is i have always looked upon ruth as being somewhat different from other women because of her infirmity it is dawning upon me now that after all the infirmity counts for little she is a woman with a womans sensibility and all that goes with it it troubles her to be living alone with me  a shadow of perplexity passed across sabatinis face this young man was very much in earnest and spoke as though he had good reasons for these explanations yet the reasons themselves were not obvious and the minutes were passing  she seemed to me he murmured to be a very charming and distinguished young lady  i am glad to hear you say so arnold declared today i went to isaac that he might tell me whether there were not some relatives of hers in the world to whom she could apply for help and shelter i pointed out that he had left ruth alone and penniless that although the charge of her was nothing but a pleasure to me it was not fitting that i should undertake it i insisted upon his telling me the name of at least one of her relatives so that i might let them know of her existence and beg for a home for her  it was a reasonable request sabatini remarked i trust that the fellow recognized the situation  he had already written out ruths history arnold said his voice shaking a little he had written it out in pencil on a couple of sheets of foolscap he gave them to me to bring away with me i read them coming up i am here now to repeat their purport to you  sabatini gave a little nod of interest his glance at the clock was apologetic he had thrown his overcoat once more upon his arm and with his whitegloved hand resting upon the back of a chair stood listening in an attitude of courteous ease  i shall be glad to hear the story he said i must admit that although i only met the young lady for those few minutes at bourne end i found myself most interested in her i feel sure that she is charming in every way please go on  if isaacs story is true arnold continued slowly you should indeed be interested in her  sabatinis eyebrows were slightly raised  i scarcely understand he murmured ipray go on  according to his story arnold said ruth lalonde is your daughter  sabatini stood perfectly motionless the slight expression of tired attention with which he had been listening had faded from his face in the late sunshine which still filled the room there was something almost corpselike in the pallor of his cheeks his unnatural silence when he spoke his words came slowly  is this a jest  isaacs story is that you married her mother who was his sister in paris nineteen and a half years ago her name was cécile ruth leneveu and she was acting at one of the theatres she was really isaacs halfsister his father had brought him from paris when he was only a child and married again almost at once according to his story ruths mother lived with you for two yearsuntil in fact you went to chili to take command of the troops there at the time of the revolution when you returned she was dead you were told that she had given birth to a daughter and that she too had died  that is true sabatini admitted slowly i came back because of her illness but i was too late  the child did not die arnold continued she was brought up by isaac in a small convent near rouen where she remained until two years ago when he was forced to come to england he brought her with him as owing to her accident she was unable to take the post of teacher for which she had been intended and the convent where she was living was unexpectedly broken up since then she has lived a sad life with him in london his has been simply a handtomouth existence  but i do not understand why i was kept in ignorance sabatini declared why did he not appeal to me for help why was my daughters existence kept a secret from me  because isaac is half a fanatic and half a madman arnold replied you represent to him the class he loathes the class he has hated all his life and against which he has waged ceaseless war he hated your marriage to his sister and his feelings were the more embittered because it suited you to keep it private he has nursed a bitter feeling against you all his life for this reason  sabatini turned stiffly away he walked to the window standing for a moment or two with his back to arnold looking out into the quiet street then he came back  i must go to this man at once he said you can take me there  i can take you arnold assented doubtfully and i have even a message from him asking you to visit him but i warn you that he is in a dangerous mood i found him the solitary occupant of a miserable room in the back street of a quarter of london which reminded me more than anything else of some foreign city he has cleared the furniture from the room reared a table up on end and is crouching behind it with a mauser pistol in his hand and a box of cartridges by his side my own belief is that he is insane  it is of no account that sabatini declared one moment  he touched the bell for his servant who entered almost immediately  you will take a cab to 17 grosvenor square pietro he directed present my compliments to the lady of the house and tell her that an occurrence of the deepest importance deprives me of the honor of dining tonight  very good your excellency  sabatini turned to arnold  come he said simply my automobile is waiting will you direct the man  they started off citywards sabatini for a time sat like a man in a dream and arnold respecting his companions mood kept silent there seemed to be something unreal about their progress to arnold with this man by his side the amazing story which he had gathered from those illwritten pages with their abrupt words and brutal cynicism still ringing in his brain their errand seemed like some phantasmal thing the familiar streets bore a different aspect the faces of the people whom they passed struck him always with a curious note of unreality ruth was sabatinis daughter his brain refused to grasp so amazing a fact yet curiously enough as he leaned back among the cushions the likeness was there the turn of the lips the high forehead the flawless delicacy of her oval face in the light of this new knowledge were all startlingly reminiscent of the man who sat by his side now in a grim unbroken silence the wonder of it all remained unabated but his sense of apprehension grew  presently sabatini began to talk rousing himself as though with an effort and asking questions concerning ruth about her accident her tastes he heard of the days of her poverty with a little shiver arnold touched lightly upon these realizing how much his companion was suffering their progress grew slower and slower as they passed into the heart of this strange land down the narrow yet busy thoroughfare which seemed to be the main artery of the neighborhood strange names were above the shopwindows strange articles were displayed behind them stalls were set out in the streets men and women driven by the sulphurous heat to seek air leaned halfdressed from the windows or sat even upon the pavement in front of their houses more than once they were obliged to come to a standstill owing to the throngs of loiterers as they neared the last corner arnold leaned out and his heart sank in front he could see the crowd kept back by a line of police  we are too late he exclaimed they have found him they must be making the arrest even now     chapter xxxiv  close to tragedy   the two men stood up in the automobile sabatinis face had darkened he leaned over and said something to the chauffeur they drove on through the press of people who gave way sullenly a police inspector came to the side of the car  this way is blocked for the present sir he said to sabatini if you want to get past you had better take one of the turnings to the left  my destination is just here sabatini replied tell me what is the cause of this disturbance  some of our men have gone to make an arrest in the street there sir the inspector replied and we are having some trouble  is it the man isaac lalonde whom you are after sabatini asked  that is so sir the inspector admitted a desperate scoundrel he is too hes shot at and wounded all three of the policemen who entered the house and he lies crouching before the window threatening to shoot any one who passes up the street  who is in charge here sabatini inquired  chief inspector raynham the man replied pointing to an officer in plain uniform who was standing a few yards away  take me to him sabatini directed i may be of use in this matter  the crowd opened to let them pass through they were on the corner of the pavement now and the street to their right was empty there was a disposition on the part of the people to hug the wall and peer only round the corner for they were within easy range of the grimy window opposite  mr inspector sabatini said i am count sabatini a nobleman of the country from which that man comes i think perhaps that if you will allow me to make the effort he will listen to me i may be able to save the loss of useful lives  the chief inspector saluted  i shouldnt recommend you to go near him sir he declared they say hes an outandout anarchist the leader of one of the most dangerous gangs in london weve got the back of the house covered and he cant escape but hes shot three of our men who tried to get at him the chief of police is on his way down and we are waiting for instructions from him  sabatinis lips parted in the faintest of smiles one could well have imagined that he would have devised some prompter means to have secured this man if he had been in command  you will not forbid my making the attempt i trust he said courteously i do so at my own risk of course  the inspector hesitated sabatini with a sudden swing of his powerful arm made his way into the front rank arnold clutched at him  dont go he begged it isnt worth while you hear he has shot three policemen already you cant save himyou cant help him  sabatini turned round with an air of gentle superiority  my young friend he said do you not understand that isaac will not be taken alive there is a question i must ask him before he dies  the inspector stepped forwardafterwards he said that it was for the purpose of stopping sabatini he was too late however the crowd thronging the end of the street and the hundreds of people who peered from the windows had a moment of wonderful excitement one could almost hear the thrill which stirred from their throats across the empty street straight towards the window behind which the doomed man lay sabatini walked strangest of figures amidst those sordid surroundings in his evening clothes thin black overcoat and glossy silk hat step by step he approached the door he was about three yards from the curbstone when the window behind which isaac was crouching was suddenly smashed and isaac leaned out the crowd listening intently could hear the crash of falling glass upon the pavement they had their view of isaac tooa wan ghostlike figure with haggard cheeks and staring eyes eyes which blazed out from between the strands of black hair  stand where you are he shouted and the people who watched saw the glitter of the setting sun upon the pistol in his hand sabatini looked up  isaac lalonde he called out you know who i am  i know who you are they heard him growlcount sabatini marquis de lossa chevalier de st jerome knight of the holy roman empire aristocrat bloodsucker of the people  sabatini shrugged his shoulders slightly  as to that he answered firmly one may have opinions my hand at least is free from bloodshed you are there with nothing but death before you i am here to ask a question  ask it then the man at the window muttered cant you see that the time is short  is it true this message which you sent me by that young man is it my daughter the child of cécile whom you have kept from me all these years  isaac leaned further forward out of the window every one in the crowd could see him now there were a few who began to shout every one save sabatini himself seemed conscious of his danger sabatini heedless or unconscious of it stood with one foot upon the curbstone his face upturned to the man with whom he was talking  ay it is true isaac shouted she is your daughter child of the wife whom you hid away ashamed of her because she came from the people and you were an aristocrat she is your child but you will never see her  then those who watched had their fill of tragedy they saw the puff of smoke the sharp discordant report the murderous face of the man who leaned downward they saw sabatini throw up his hands to heaven and fall a crumpled heap into the gutter isaac with the pistol to his own forehead overbalanced himself in the act of pulling the trigger and came crashing down a corpse on to the pavement the crowd broke loose but arnold was the first to raise sabatini a shadow of the old smile parted his whitening lips he opened his eyes  its a rotten death boy he whispered hoarsely a curs bullet that look after her for me id ratherid rather hear the drums beating  arnold gripped him by the shoulders  hold on to yourself man he gasped theres a doctor cominghes here already hold on to yourself for all our sakes we want youruth will want you  sabatini smiled very faintly he was barely conscious  id rather have heard the drums he muttered again     chapter xxxv  mr weatherley returns   it was twenty minutes past nine on a saturday morning when the wonderful thing happened precisely at his accustomed hour in his accustomed suit of gray clothes and with his silk hat a little on the back of his head mr weatherley walked into his office pausing as usual to knock the ash from his cigar before he entered the clerks counting house twelve young men gazed at him in frank and undiluted amazement as though absolutely unconscious of anything unusual mr weatherley grunted his good morning and passed on into the private room arnold and mr jarvis were busy sorting the letters which had arrived by the mornings post mr weatherley regarded them with an expression of mingled annoyance and surprise  what the devil are you doing opening the letters before i get here he exclaimed im punctual am i not twentytwo minutes past nine to

nearly six last evening straightening out the muddle youd got coswells account into  mr jarvis withdrew precipitately closing the door behind him mr weatherley glanced across the room to where arnold was standing  im hanged if i can understand jarvis lately he said the fellow seems off his head see me back indeed talks as though id been away for a holiday  arnold opened his lips and closed them again without speech mr weatherley took up the letters and began to read them at first in silence presently he began to swear  anything wrong sir arnold asked  has every one taken leave of their

to hate the fellow chetwode it was your wife he said for whom rosario wanted that title she could have stopped him then he broke off chetwode but i dont suppose you understand these things he said youd better just understand this though i am here to have a little explanation with mrs weatherley i have a message for her and shes got to hear it from my own lips when ive finished with her i want her brother and when ive finished with him i want the young man who was here the other night its no good saying hes not here now because i saw him start  mr weatherley paused and felt his forehead  all the time chetwode he went on i was watching the fellow and it began to dawn upon me that he was there to do her some mischief i didnt understand what it was all about but i could see it in his face he was an illlooking ruffian i remembered then that fenella had been frightened by some one hanging about the house more than once well there he was opposite to me chetwode and by degrees id been moving a little nearer to him he was after mischiefi was sure of it what should you have done chetwode  i am not quite sure arnold answered what did you do  were coming to that mr weatherley declared leaning a little forward were coming to that now in that open case close to where i was my wife had some south american curios there was a funny wooden club there the end was quite as heavy as any lead i caught hold of it and rushed in upon him you see chetwode i was quite sure that he meant mischief if fenella had come in he might have hurt her  exactly arnold agreed go on sir  well i gripped the club in my right hand mr weatherley explained seizing a ruler from the table like this and i ran in upon him i took him rather by surprisehe hadnt expected anything of the sort he had one shot at me and missed i felt the bullet go scorching past my cheeklike this  mr weatherley struck the side of his face sharply with the flat of his hand  he had another go at me but it was too latei was there upon him he held out his arm but i was too quick i didnt seem to hit very hard the first time but the club was heavy his foot slipped on the marble hearthstone and he went he fell with a thud have you ever killed a man chetwode  never sir arnold answered his voice shaking a little  well i never had before mr weatherley went on it really seems quite amazing that that one blow right on the head should have done it he lay there quite still afterwards and it made me sick to look at him all the time though i kept on telling myself that if i had not been there he would have hurt fenella that kept me quite cool afterwards i put the club carefully back in the case pushed him a little under the sofa and then i stopped to think for a moment i was quite clever chetwode the window was open through which the man had come so i locked the door on the inside stepped out of the window came in at the front door with my latchkey crept upstairs undressed quickly and got into bed the funny part of it all was chetwode he concluded that nobody ever really found the body  you dont suppose that you could have dreamed it all do you arnold asked  mr weatherley laughed contemptuously  what an absurd idea he exclaimed what a perfectly absurd idea besides although it did disappear they came up and told me that there was a man lying in the boudoir you understand now how it all happened he went on it seemed to me quite natural at the time still when the morning came i realized that i had killed a man its a horrid thing to kill a man chetwode  of course it is sir arnold said sympathetically still i dont see what else you could have done  mr weatherley beamed  i am glad to hear you say that chetwode he declared very glad still i didnt want to go to prison you know so a few days afterwards i went away i meant to hide for quite a long time ii dont know what im doing back here  he looked around the office like a trapped animal  i didnt mean to come back yet chetwode he exclaimed dont leave me do you hear dont leave me  only for one second sir arnold replied taking an invoice from the desk they are wanting this in the warehouse  arnold stepped rapidly across to mr jarviss desk  telephone home for his wife to come and bring a doctor he ordered quick  hes out of his mind jarvis gasped  stark mad arnold agreed  when he reentered the office mr weatherley was sitting muttering to himself arnold came over and sat opposite to him  mrs weatherley is calling round presently sir he announced youll be glad to see her again  mr weatherley went deadly pale  does she know he moaned  she knows that some one was hurt arnold said as a matter of fact he continued i dont think the man could have been dead we were all out of the room for about five minutes and when we came back he was gone i think that he must have got up and walked away  you dont think that i murdered him then mr weatherley inquired anxiously  not you arnold assured him you stopped his hurting mrs weatherley though  mr weatherley sighed  i should like to have killed him he admitted simply fenella and sabatini too her brotherthey both laugh at me theyre a little inclined to be romantic and they think im a queer sort of a stick i could never make out why she married me he went on confidentially of course they were both stoneybroke at the time and i put up a decent bit of money but it isnt money after all that buys a woman like fenella  im sure she will be very pleased to see you again sir arnold said  do you think she will chetwode do you think she will mr weatherley demanded anxiously has she missed me while i have beenwhere the devil have i been chetwode you must tell metell me quick shell be here directly and shell want to know i cant remember it was a long street and there was a publichouse at the corner and i had a job somewhere hadnt i stacking cheeses look here chetwode you must tell me all about it youre my private secretary you ought to know everything of that sort  ill make it all right with mrs weatherley arnold promised we cant go into all these matters now  of course notof course not mr weatherley agreed youre quite right chetwode a time for everything eh hows the little lady you brought down to bourne end  shes very well thank you sir arnold replied  now its a queer thing mr weatherley continued but only yesterdayor was it the day beforei was trying to think whom she reminded me of it couldnt have been my brotherinlaw could it chetwode did you ever fancy that she was like sabatini  i had noticed it sir arnold admitted with a little start there is a likeness  im glad you agree with me mr weatherley declared approvingly splendid fellow sabatini he continuedfull of race to his fingertips brave as a lion too but unscrupulous hed wring a mans neck who refused to do what he told him yet do you know chetwode he wouldnt take money from me he was desperately hard up one day i know and i offered him a cheque but he only shook his head you can look after fenella he said thats all youve got to do one in the family is enough the night after he played baccarat with rosario and he won two thousand pounds clever fellowsabatini i wish i wasnt so frightened of him you know the sort of feeling he gives me chetwode mr weatherley continued he always makes me feel that im wearing the wrong clothes or doing the wrong thing im never really at my ease when hes about but i like himi like him very much indeed  arnold had turned a little away he was beginning to feel the strain of the situation  i wish fenella would come mr weatherley wandered on i dont seem to be able to get on with my work this morning since you told me she was coming down queer thing although i was with her last evening you know chetwode i feel somehow as though id been away from her for weeks and weeks i cant remember exactly how longtheres such a buzzing in my head when i try what do you do when you have a buzzing in your head chetwode  i generally try and rest in an easychair arnold replied  ill try that too mr weatherley decided rising to his feet its amost extraordinary thing chetwode but my knees are shaking hold me upcatch hold of me quick  arnold half carried him to the easychair the horn of the automobile sounded outside  mrs weatherley is here sir arnold whispered  mr weatherley opened his eyes  good he murmured let me sit up  there was a moments pause arnold moved to the door and held it open they heard the swish of her skirts as she came through the outer office and the heavier footsteps of the doctor who followed mr weatherley tried vainly to rise to his feet he held out his arms fenella hastened towards him  fenella i couldnt help it her husband gasped i had to kill himhe told me he was waiting there for you my hands are quite clean now chetwode told me that he got up and walked away but thats all nonsense i struck him right over the skull  she fell on her knees by his side  you dear brave man she murmured i believe you saved my life  he smiled his face was suddenly childlike he was filled with an infinite content  i think he said that i should liketo go home nowif this other gentleman and chetwode will kindly help me out you see i havent been here since may 4 and today is july 2 i think i must have overslept myself and that idiot jarvis was opening the letters when i arrived yes im quite ready  they helped him out to the carriage he stepped in and took his usual place without speaking again the car drove off fenella holding his hand the doctor sitting opposite     chapter xxxvi  counterclaims   there was nothing about their attitude or appearance which indicated the change their chairs were so close together that they almost touched her white ringless hand lay in his through the wideopen window of their tiny sittingroom they looked down upon the river as they had sat and watched it so many evenings before yet the change was unmistakable arnold no longer guessed at ithe felt it the old days of their pleasant comradeship had gone there were reserves in everything she said sometimes she shrank from him almost as though he were a stranger the eyes that grew bright and still danced with pleasure at his coming were almost a moment later filled with apprehension as she watched him  tell me again he begged what the doctor really said it sounds too good to be true  so i thought she agreed but i havent exaggerated a thing he assured me that there was no risk no pain and that the cure was certain i am to go to the hospital in three weeks time  you dont mind it  why should i she answered the last time she continued it was in france i remember the white stone corridors the white room and the surgeons all dressed in white do you know they say that i shall be out again in a fortnight  he nodded  i can see you already he declared with a goldheaded stick and a fascinating limp like marguerite de vallières  she smiled very faintly but said nothing somehow it was hard to make conversation ruth was unusually pale even for her the eyes which followed that line of yellow lights were full of trouble  tell me he begged presently you have something on your mind i am sure there is nothing you are keeping from me  have i not enough she asked to make me anxious  naturally he admitted and yet after all you have only seen your father once in your life  but i am sure that i could have loved him so much she murmured he seems to have come and gone in a dream  this mornings report was more hopeful he reminded her there is every chance that he may live  all the time she answered fervently i am praying that he may if he treated my mother badly i am sure that he has suffered i cant quite forget either she went on although that seems selfish that when i come out of the hospital even if all goes well i may still be homeless  he leaned over her  ruth he exclaimed what do you mean  you know she answered simply you must know  his heart began to beat more quickly he turned his head but she was looking away he could see only the curve of her long eyelashes it seemed to him strange then that he had never noticed the likeness to sabatini before her mouth her forehead the carriage of her head were all his he leaned towards her there was something stirring in his heart then something throbbing there which seemed to bring with it a cloud of new and bewildering emotions the whole world was slipping away something strange had come into the room  ruth he whispered will you look at me for a moment  she kept her head turned away  dont she pleaded dont talk to me just now i cant bear it arnold  but i have something to say to you he persisted i have something new something i must say something that has just come to me you must listen ruth  she held out her hand feverishly  please arnold she begged i dont want to hearanything i know how kind you are and how generous just nowi think it is the heatbe still please i cant bear anything  her fingers clutched his and yet kept him away every moment he was more confident of this thing which had come to him a strange longing was filling his heart the old days when he had kissed her carelessly upon the forehead seemed far enough away then in that brief period of silence which seemed to him too wonderful to break there came a little tap at the door they both turned their heads  come in arnold invited  there was a moments hesitation then the door was opened fenella entered arnold sprang to his feet  mrs weatherley he exclaimed  she smiled at him with all her old insolent grace  since when she demanded fenella if you please  she was more simply dressed than usual in a thin black gown and black picture hat and there were shadows under her eyes no one could look at her and fail to know that she was suffering she came across to ruth  my brother is the dearest thing in life to me she said he is all that i have left to me belonging to my own world all these days i have spent at his bedside except when they have sent me away this evening i have come to see you you are his child ruth  ruth turned her head slowly  yes she murmured half fearfully  when arnold brought you to bourne end fenella continued for one moment i looked at you and i wondered you seemed even then to remind me of some one who had existed in the past i know now who it was you have something of andreas air but you are very like your mother ruth  you knew her ruth asked  very slightly fenella replied she was a very clever actress and i saw her sometimes upon the stage sometimes i think that andrea did not treat her well but that was the way of his world assuredly he never treated her badly or you and i would not be here together now  i am afraid that you are sorry ruth said timidly  fenella laid her hand almost caressingly upon the girls shoulder  you need fear nothing of the sort she assured her why should i be sorry you are something that will remind me of him something i shall always be glad to have near me you can guess why i have come  ruth made no answer for a moment fenella laughed a little imperiously  you poor child she exclaimed you cannot think that since i know the truth i could leave you here for a single second we can fetch your clothes any time tonight you are coming home with me  ruth gazed at her with straining face  home she murmured  but naturally fenella replied you are my brothers child and i am a lonely woman do you think that i could leave you here for a single second arnold has some claims i know she continued he can come and see you sometimes do not be afraid she went on her voice suddenly softening i shall try to be kind to you i have been a very selfish person all my life i think it will be good for me to have some one to care for arnold please to go and ring for the lift now that i have two invalids to think about i must not be away for long  he looked at ruth for a moment then he obeyed her when he returned ruth was standing up leaning upon fenellas arm she held out her other hand to arnold  you will help me down please she begged  it was a day of new emotions for arnold he was conscious suddenly of a fierce wave of jealousy of despair she was going and notwithstanding the half pathetic half appealing smile with which she held out her hands she was happy to go fenella saw his expression and laughed in his face  arnold looks at me as though i were a thief she declared lightly and i have only come to claim my own if you behave very nicely arnold you can come and see us just as often as you please  it was all over in a few minutes the automobile which had been standing in the street below was gone arnold was alone upon the sofa the book which she had been reading her handkerchief a bowl of flowers which she had arranged an odd glove were lying on the table by his side but ruth had gone the little room seemed cold and empty he gripped the windowsill and sitting where they had sat together only a few minutes ago he looked down at the curving lights the old dreams surged up into his brain the treasure ship had come indeed the treasure ship for ruth almost immediately the egotism of the man rebuked itself if indeed she were passing into a new and happier life should he not first of every one be thankfulfirst of every one because within that hour he had learned the secret toward which he had been dimly struggling     chapter xxxvii  the ships come in   the accountant was preparing to take his leave there had been an informal little meeting held in the dingy private office of messrs samuel weatherley  company at which he had presided  i really feel he said as he drew on his gloves thoughtfully that i must repeat my congratulations to you mr jarvis and to your young coadjutor here mr chetwode the results which i have had the pleasure of laying before you are quite excellent in fact so far as i can remember the firm has scarcely ever had a more prosperous half year  very kind of you i am sure mr jarvis declared and most satisfactory to us weve worked hard of course but that doesnt amount to much after all when youve been in a business as i have in this one for something like thirtyfive years the interest you take in it is such that you cant help working this i must say though he went on placing his hand on arnolds shoulder mr chetwode is almost a newcomer here and yet his energy has sometimes astounded me most remarkable and most creditable for the last two months mr neville he has scarcely slept in london for a single night he has been to bristol and cardiff and liverpoolall over the country in factin the interests of the firm with results that have sometimes astonished us  the accountant nodded approvingly he took up the balance sheet which they had been perusing and placed it in its envelope  i shall now he said call upon mr weatherley and i am sure he will be most gratified i understand that our next meeting is to be down here  mr jarvis beamed  although i must say he admitted that the responsibility has been a great pleasure still we shall be heartily glad to see mr weatherley back again  i am sure of it the accountant assented i understand that he has made a complete recovery  absolutely his own self again sir mr jarvis declared and looking better than ever  odd thing though that loss of memory the accountant remarked i was talking to the doctor about it only the other day he seems to have wandered away into some sort of hiding under the impression that he had committed a crime and now that he is getting better he has absolutely forgotten all about it he just thinks that he has had an ordinary illness and has had to stay away from business for a time  queer thing altogether sir mr jarvis admitted a queer business sir however its over and done with and the less said about it the better we are both very much obliged to you mr neville for your kind offices and i am only thankful that the results have been so satisfactory  mr jarvis conducted his visitor to the door and returned to arnold with beaming face in anticipation of the accountants visit he was wearing a frockcoat which was already a shade too small for him he carefully divested himself of this garment put on his linen officecoat and turned towards his companion  chetwode he said i have a proposition to make the firm shall stand us a little dinner this evening which we will take together we will go up to the westend you shall choose the proper place and order everythingjust the best you can think of the firm shall pay mr weatherley would be quite agreeable i am sure  arnold forced himself to accept the suggestion with some appearance of pleasure  delighted he agreed well have to finish up the letters and go through this mail first  just so mr jarvis replied after that well shut up shop this is quite a redletter day chetwode i knew that wed held our own but i must confess that i found those figures most exhilarating our little bonus too will be worth having  later on they found their way to a restaurant in the strand where mr jarvis ate and drank perhaps better than he had ever done in his life the evening to him was one of unalloyed pleasure and he was genuinely disappointed when arnold pleaded an engagement as an excuse for not finishing up at a musichall about nine oclock the two men parted mr jarvis to spend the rest of the evening alone with a big cigar in his mouth and an unaccustomed feeling of levity in his head arnold after a moments hesitation walked slowly back to his empty rooms  so this was success without a friend in the world without training or any practical knowledge of life his feet were firmly planted upon the ladder he had stifled all sorts of nameless ambitions he had set his teeth and done what appeared to be his duty now it seemed to him that he had come to a pause he drew up his sofa to the window of his sittingroom and looked downward somehow or other the depression against which he had struggled all the evening seemed only intensified by what he saw below an early autumn had stripped bare the leaves from the scanty trees the sky was gray and starless even the lights along the river front seemed to burn with a dull and uninspiring fire he looked around him and his depression became an almost overmastering sensation he hated the sight of his empty room the phantom thoughts that would light upon his shoulder the sofa upon which he was sitting alone the memory of the things which he might have said to ruth in the days when the opportunity was his for a moment he even thought of mr jarvis at the musichall alone the welcoming lights the pleasant warmth the music the cheerful throngs of people better anything he told himself than this brooding a sudden almost reckless impulse called him back again into the streets only to pass away the same moment with the vision of ruths pale face by his side her eyes alternately gazing down the lighted way and seeking his her fingers grasping his hand his head sank forward into his hands he was alone  he sat up suddenly with a start the inner door of the room had opened and was softly closed again a familiar voice addressed him  i find your habits my young friend somewhat erratic sabatini remarked your supply of common necessaries too seems limited i have been driven to explore quite fruitlessly the whole of your little domain in the vain search for a match  he pointed to the unlit cigarette between his fingers arnold who was a little dazed rose and produced a box of matches  but i dont understand how it is that you are here he exclaimed i thought that you were at brighton and how did you get in  sabatini seated himself comfortably at the end of the sofa and placed a cushion behind his head  we came up from brighton this afternoon he explained puffing contentedly at his cigarette i am now pronounced convalescent ruth too could throw away her stick any moment she wanted to only i fancy that she thinks its use becoming  but arnold persisted i dont understand how you got in you know that i am glad to see you  i got in with ruths key of course sabatini replied  arnold leaned against the back of the sofa  i had forgotten he said of course if i had known that you had been coming i would have been here the accountant brought in the result of our last six months work this afternoon and mr jarvis insisted upon a little celebration we had dinner together  sabatini nodded  so you have been successful he remarked thoughtfully you kept your feet along the narrow way and you have done well i am glad sit down here by my side  arnold sat down on the end of the sofa the curtain was pulled up as far as it would go below them the curving arc of lights stretched away to the dim distance sabatini followed them with his eyes for a moment as though he too found something inspiring in that lighted way then he turned to arnold with a queer little twinkle in his eyes  by the bye he asked you havent heardfenella hasnt told you of the last turn in fortunes wheel  i have seen little of mrs weatherley lately arnold murmured  sabatini leaned back in his place his hollow eyes were lit now with laughter his mouth twitched the marks of his illness seemed almost to pass  it is delicious he declared listen you remember that one day when you dined with me i told you of my uncle the cardinal  the uncle from whom you borrowed money arnold remarked dryly  precisely sabatini agreed i borrowed money from him it was only a trifle but i chose my own methods heavens but it is droll  sabatini began to laugh softly his whole face now was alight with enjoyment  last month he continued his eminence died he had fourteen nephews three brothers two sisters and no end of nieces to whom do you think he has left his entire fortune my dear arnoldthree hundred thousand pounds they say it is  to you arnold gasped  to me indeed sabatini assented i did not even go to the funeral i read of his death in the newspapers and i shrugged my shoulders it was nothing to me yet those fourteen nephews were left not so much as would buy their mourning clothes this is the chief sentence in the willto the only one of my relatives whose method of seeking my favors has really appealed to me i leave the whole of my fortune without partition or reserveand then my name i was that one almost sabatini concluded with a little sigh i am sorry that he is dead i should have liked once more to have shaken him by the hand  arnold was speechless the realization of what it all meant was beginning to dawn upon him sabatini was wealthyruth was a great heiress her treasure ship had come in indeedand his was passing him by  i am glad he said slowly glad for your sake and for ruths  sabatini nodded  my shadowy means he remarked have kept me in comfort perhaps even they have been a trifle more than i have let people imagine still this is all very different ruth and i are going to wander about the riviera for a time afterwards we are going to sail to sabatini and patch up my old castle i have some tenants there who certainly deserve a little consideration from meold friends who would sooner live without a roof over their heads than seek a new master i shall grow vines again my young friend and make cheeses you shall come from the illustrious firm of samuel weatherley  company and be my most favored customer but let me give you just a word of advice while i am in the humor buy our cheeses if you will but never touch our wine leave that for the peasants who make it somehow or other they thrivethey even become at times merry upon itbut the lord have mercy upon those others not born upon the island of sabatini who raise it to their lips  i will leave the wine alone arnold promised but shant i be able to say goodbye to ruth  sabatini leaned towards him his expression was once more grave yet there was the dawn of a smile upon his sensitive lips  you can say to her what you will he murmured for she is here she had a fancy to look at her old room i was there with her when you arrived i have a fancy now to give an order to my chauffeur À bientôt  arnold rose slowly to his feet his heart was beginning to beat fiercely he was looking across the room with straining eyes it was not possible that clothes and health could make so great a difference as this she was standing upon the threshold of her room she was coming now slowly towards him leaning ever so slightly upon her stick her cheeks were touched with pink her eyes were lit with so soft and wonderful a brilliance that they shone like stars he forgot her fashionable hat the quiet elegance of her clothes it was ruth who came towards himruth radiantly beautiful transformedyet ruth he held out his arms and with a little sob she glided into them  side by side they took their accustomed places upon the horsehair sofa her head sank upon his shoulder her hands clasped his her eyes were wet with tears a siren blew from the river a little tug with two barges lashed alongside was coming valiantly along the dark coil of water seemed suddenly agleam with quivering lights  our ships she whispered together dear  the end
