55452899	illustration christian confides in his wife                                    see page 13       the pilgrims progress    by john bunyan    every child can read    edited by rev jesse lyman hurlbut dd    illustrated    every childs library    the john c winston co philadelphia copyright 1909 by the john c   winston co     preface   it may seem a very bold undertaking to change even a word of the book which next to the bible has been read by more people old and young than any other book in the english language  but it must be remembered that although the pilgrims progress has come to be a childrens book and is read more often by young people than by those who are older it was not in the purpose of john bunyan to write a book for children or even for the young  the pilgrims progress was a book for men and women and it was aimed to teach the great truths of the gospel hence while most of it is written in a simple styleas all books should be writtenit contains much that a child cannot understand not often in the story but in the conversations and discussions between the different persons some of these conversations are in reality short sermons on doctrines and teachings which bunyan believed to be of great importance but these are beyond the minds of children and give them great trouble when the book is read they do not like to have them left out of the reading thinking that they may lose something interesting many a young person has stumbled through the dull doctrinal parts of the book without understanding them and even grown people find them in our time somewhat of a blemish upon the wonderful story valuable as they were supposed to be in bunyans own time  for many years it has been in my mind not to rewrite the pilgrims progress for that would destroy its greatest charm but to change the words here and there to simpler ones and to omit all the conversations and arguments concerning subjects belonging to the field of doctrine in other words to place the story of the pilgrims progress in such a form that every child ten years old can understand it my purpose is to make it plain and interesting to children leaving the older form of the book to be read by them when they become older  perhaps a short account of bunyans own life may add to the interest of his book john bunyan was born in 1628 at elstow a small village near bedford which is in the heart of england his father was a poor man traveling on foot from place to place mending pots and pans and the simple furniture of country kitchens and the son followed the same trade and was known as a tinker he tells us that he lived a wild life and was especially known as one of the worst swearers in the region  when the great civil war broke out in england in 1642 between king charles the first and the parliament bunyan became a soldier on the side of the commonwealth as the party against the king was called he served in the army between 1644 and 1646  in 1648 at the age of twenty years he married a good young woman who led him to prayer and to a new life but it was hard for one who had led such a life as his had been to turn to god and it cost the young man a great struggle it seemed to him that his past sins were like a load upon his back just as he afterward wrote of his pilgrim and it was long before he found peace  he became a member of a little baptist society and soon began to preach crowds came to hear him drawn by his earnest spirit and his quaint striking manner but when charles the second became king no religious services were allowed except those of the church of england and all other meetings were forbidden bunyan however went on preaching until he was sent to prison in bedford in bedford jail he stayed twelve years to find a means of living in jail he made lace and sold it as a support for himself and his blind daughter  if the prison was hard for bunyan his sufferings were made a blessing to untold millions for while in bedford jail he wrote the pilgrims progress this story was intended to be a parable like many of our saviours teachings that is it put into the form of a story the life of one who turns from sin finds salvation through christ and in the face of many difficulties makes his way through this world to heaven even a child who reads or listens to the book will see this meaning in part and he will understand it better as he grows older  in 1672 bunyan was set free and allowed to begin again his work as a baptist minister and he soon became one of the most popular preachers in all england he died quite suddenly in 1688 when he was sixty years old and is buried in an old graveyard now near the center of london called bunhill fields burialground in the same ground is buried another great writer daniel defoe whose story of robinson crusoe ranks next to the pilgrims progress in the number of its readers also isaac watts the author of many hymns sung in all the churches and mrs susanna wesley the mother of the great john wesley four people who have left a deep mark upon the world all lie near together in this small cemetery in london  every child should read the pilgrims progress as a story if no more than a story should read it until he knows it by heart and the older he grows the deeper will be the meaning that he will see in it

i walked through the wilderness of this world i lighted on a certain place where was a den1 and laid me down in that place to sleep and as i slept i dreamed a dream i dreamed and behold i saw a man clothed with rags standing in a certain place with his face from his own house a book in his hand and a great burden upon his back i looked and saw him open the book and read therein and as he read he wept and trembled and not being able longer to contain he brake out with a lamentable cry saying what shall i do    1 bedford jail in which bunyan was twelve years a prisoner  in this plight therefore he went home and restrained himself as long as he could that his wife and children should not perceive his distress but he could not be silent long because that his trouble increased wherefore at length he brake his mind to his wife and children and thus he began to talk to them oh my dear wife said he and you my sweet children i your dear friend am in myself undone by reason of a burden that lieth hard upon me moreover i am told to a certainty that this our city will be burned with fire from heaven in which fearful overthrow both myself with thee my wife and you my sweet babes shall miserably come to ruin except some way of escape can be found whereby we may be delivered at this all his family were sore amazed not for that they believed that what he had said to them was true but because they thought that some frenzy or madness had got into his head therefore it drawing towards night and they hoping that sleep might settle his brain with all haste they got him to bed but the night was as troublesome to him as the day wherefore instead of sleeping he spent it in sighs and tears so when the morning was come they would know how he did he told them worse and worse he also set to talking to them again but they began to be hardened they also thought to drive away his madness by harsh and surly treatment of him sometimes they would ridicule sometimes they would chide and sometimes they would quite neglect him wherefore he began to retire himself to his chamber to pray for and pity them and also to sorrow over his own misery he would also walk solitary in the fields sometimes reading and sometimes praying and thus for some days he spent his time  sidenote christians distress of mind  now i saw upon a time when he was walking in the fields that he was as he was wont reading in his book and greatly distressed in his mind and as he read he burst out as he had done before crying what shall i do to be saved  i saw also that he looked this way and that way as if he would run yet he stood still because as i perceived he could not tell which way to go i looked then and saw a man named evangelist coming to him who asked wherefore dost thou cry  illustration evangelist points to wicketgate                                    page 15  he answered sir i read in the book in my hand that i am condemned to die and after that to come to judgment and i find that i am not willing to do the first nor able to do the second  then said evangelist why not willing to die since this life is troubled with so many evils the man answered because i fear that this burden that is upon my back will sink me lower than the grave and i shall fall into tophet2 and sir if i be not fit to go to prison i am not fit to go to judgment and from thence to death and the thoughts of these things make me cry    2 tophet here means hell  then said evangelist if this be thy condition why standest thou still  he answered because i know not whither to go then he gave him a parchment roll and there was written within flee from the wrath to come  the man therefore read it and looking upon evangelist very carefully said whither must i fly then said evangelist pointing with his finger over a very wide field do you see yonder wicketgate the man said no then said the other do you see yonder shining light he said i think i do then said evangelist keep that light in your eye and go up directly thereto so shalt thou see the gate at which when thou knockest it shall be told thee what thou shalt do so i saw in my dream that the man began to run now he had not run far from his own door when his wife and children perceiving it began to cry after him to return but the man put his fingers in his ears and ran on crying life life eternal life so he looked not behind him but fled towards the middle of the plain  sidenote christian flees from the city  the neighbors also came out to see him run and as he ran some mocked others threatened and some cried after him to return and among those that did so there were two that resolved to fetch him back by force the name of the one was obstinate and the name of the other pliable now by this time the man was got a good distance from them but however they were resolved to pursue him which they did and in a little time they overtook him then said the man neighbors wherefore are ye come they said to persuade you to go back with us but he said that can by no means be you dwell said he in the city of destruction the place also where i was born i see it to be so and dying there sooner or later you will sink lower than the grave into a place that burns with fire and brimstone be content good neighbors and go along with me  obst what said obstinate and leave our friends and comforts behind us  chris yes said christian for that was his name because that all which you forsake is not worthy to be compared with a little of that i am seeking to enjoy and if you would go along with me and hold it you shall fare as i myself for there where i go is enough and to spare come away and prove my words  obst what are the things you seek since you leave all the world to find them  chris i seek a place that can never be destroyed one that is pure and that fadeth not away and it is laid up in heaven and safe there to be given at the time appointed to them that seek it with all their heart read it so if you will in my book  obst tush said obstinate away with your book will you go back with us or no  chris no not i said the other because i have put my hand to the plough  sidenote discourses with pliable  obst come then neighbor pliable let us turn again and go home without him there is a company of these crazyheaded fools that when they take a fancy by the end are wiser in their own eyes than seven men that can render a reason  pli then said pliable dont revile if what the good christian says is true the things he looks after are better than ours my heart inclines to go with my neighbor  obst what more fools still be ruled by me and go back who knows whither such a brainsick fellow will lead you go back go back and be wise  chris nay but do thou come with thy neighbor pliable there are such things to be had which i spoke of and many more glories besides if you believe not me read here in this book and for the truth of what is told therein behold all is made by the blood of him that made it  pli well neighbor obstinate said pliable i begin to come to a point i intend to go along with this good man and to cast in my lot with him but my good companion do you know the way to this desired place  chris i am directed by a man whose name is evangelist to speed me to a little gate that is before us where we shall receive directions about the way  pli come then good neighbor let us be going then they went both together  and i will go back to my place said obstinate i will be no companion of such misled fantastical fellows  now i saw in my dream that when obstinate was gone back christian and pliable went talking over the plain and thus they began  chris come neighbor pliable how do you do i am glad you are persuaded to go along with me had even obstinate himself but felt what i have felt of the powers and terrors of what is yet unseen he would not thus lightly have given us the back  pli come neighbor christian since there are none but us two here tell me now further what the things are and how to be enjoyed whither we are going  chris i can better understand them with my mind than speak of them with my tongue but yet since you are desirous to know i will read of them in my book  pli and do you think that the words of your book are certainly true  chris yes verily for it was made by him that cannot lie  pli well said what things are they  chris there is an endless kingdom to be enjoyed and everlasting life to be given us that we may live in that kingdom forever  pli well said and what else  chris there are crowns of glory to be given us and garments that will make us shine like the sun in the sky  pli this is very pleasant and what else  chris there shall be no more crying nor sorrow for he that is owner of the place will wipe all tears from our eyes  pli and what company shall we have there  chris there we shall be with seraphims and cherubims creatures that shall dazzle your eyes to look on them there also you shall meet with thousands and ten thousands that have gone before us to that place none of them are hurtful but all loving and holy every one walking in the sight of god and standing in his presence with acceptance for ever in a word there we shall see the elders with their golden crowns there we shall see the holy women with their golden harps there we shall see men that by the world were cut in pieces burnt in flames eaten of beasts drowned in the seas for the love they bear to the lord of the place all well and clothed with everlasting life as with a garment  pli the hearing of this is enough to delight ones heart but are these things to be enjoyed how shall we get to be sharers thereof  chris the lord the governor of the country hath written that in this book the substance of which is if we be truly willing to have it he will bestow it upon us freely  pli well my good companion glad am i to hear of these things come on let us mend our pace  chris i cannot go so fast as i would by reason of this burden that is on my back  sidenote the slough of despond  now i saw in my dream that just as they had ended this talk they drew nigh to a very miry slough or swamp that was in the midst of the plain and they being heedless did both fall suddenly into the bog the name of the slough was despond here therefore they wallowed for a time being grievously bedaubed with the dirt and christian because of the burden that was on his back began to sink into the mire  pli then said pliable ah neighbor christian where are you now  chris truly said christian i do not know  pli at this pliable began to be offended and angrily said to his fellow is this the happiness you have told me all this while of if we have such ill speed at our first setting out what may we expect between this and our journeys end may i get out again with my life you shall possess the brave country alone for me and with that he gave a desperate struggle or two and got out of the mire on that side of the swamp which was next to his own house so away he went and christian saw him no more  wherefore christian was left to tumble in the slough of despond alone but still he tried to struggle to that side of the slough which was farthest from his own house and next to the wicketgate the which he did but could not get out because of the burden that was upon his back but i beheld in my dream that a man came to him whose name was help and asked him what he did there  chris sir said christian i was bid to go this way by a man called evangelist who directed me also to yonder gate that i might escape the wrath to come and as i was going there i fell in here  help but why did you not look for the steps  chris fear followed me so hard that i fled the next way and fell in  help then said he give me thine hand so he gave him his hand and he drew him out and set him upon solid ground and bade him go on his way  then i stepped to him that plucked him out and said sir wherefore since over this place is the way from the city of destruction to yonder gate is it that this place is not mended that poor travelers might go thither with more safety and he said unto me this miry slough is such a place as cannot be mended it is the hollow whither the scum and filth that go with the feeling of sin do continually run and therefore it is called the slough of despond for still as the sinner is awakened by his lost condition there arise in his soul many fears and doubts and discouraging alarms which all of them get together and settle in this place and this is the reason of the badness of the ground  it is not the pleasure of the king that this place should remain so bad his laborers also have by the direction of his majestys surveyors been for about these sixteen hundred years employed about this patch of ground if perhaps it might have been mended yea and to my knowledge said he here have been swallowed up at least twenty thousand cartloads yea millions of wholesome teachings that have at all seasons been brought from all places of the kings dominions and they that can tell say they are the best materials to make good ground of the place if so be it might have been mended but it is the slough of despond still and so will be when they have done what they can  true there are by the direction of the lawgiver certain good and substantial steps placed even through the very midst of this slough but at such time as this place doth much spew out its filth as it doth against change of weather these steps are hardly seen or if they be men through the dizziness of their heads step aside and then they are bemired to purpose notwithstanding the steps be there but the ground is good when they are got in at the gate  now i saw in my dream that by this time pliable was got home to his house so his neighbors came to visit him and some of them called him wise man for coming back and some called him a fool for risking himself with christian others again did mock at his cowardliness saying surely since you began to venture i would not have been so base to have given out for a few difficulties so pliable sat sneaking among them but at last he got more confidence and then they all turned their tales and began to abuse poor christian behind his back and thus much concerning pliable  sidenote worldly wisemans counsel  now as christian was walking solitary by himself he espied one afar off come crossing over the field to meet him and their hap was to meet just as they were crossing the way of each other the gentlemans name that met him was mr worldly wiseman he dwelt in the town of carnal policy a very great town and also hard by from whence christian came this man then meeting with christian and having heard about himfor christians setting forth from the city of destruction was much noised abroad not only in the town where he dwelt but also it began to be the towntalk in some other placesmr worldly wiseman therefore having some guess of him by beholding his laborious going by noticing his sighs and groans and the like began thus to enter into some talk with christian  world how now good fellow whither away after this burdened manner  chris a burdened manner indeed as ever i think poor creature had and whereas you ask me whither away i tell you sir i am going to yonder wicketgate before me for there as i am informed i shall be put into a way to be rid of my heavy burden  world hast thou a wife and children  chris yes but i am so laden with this burden that i cannot take that pleasure in them as formerly methinks i am as if i had none  world wilt thou hearken to me if i give thee counsel  chris if it be good i will for i stand in need of good counsel  world i would advise thee then that thou with all speed get thyself rid of thy burden for thou wilt never be settled in thy mind till then nor canst thou enjoy the blessings which god hath bestowed upon thee till then  chris that is that which i seek for even to be rid of this heavy burden but get it off myself i cannot nor is there any man in our country that can take it off my shoulders therefore am i going this way as i told you that i may be rid of my burden  world who bid thee go this way to be rid of thy burden  chris a man that appeared to me to be a very great and honorable person his name as i remember is evangelist  world i curse him for his counsel there is not a more dangerous and troublesome way in the world than is that into which he hath directed thee and that thou shalt find if thou wilt be ruled by his advice thou hast met with something as i perceive already for i see the dirt of the slough of despond is upon thee but that slough is the beginning of the sorrows that do attend those that go on in that way hear me i am older than thou thou art like to meet with in the way which thou goest wearisomeness painfulness hunger perils nakedness sword lions dragons darkness and in a word death and what not these things are certainly true having been proved by the words of many people and why should a man so carelessly cast away himself by giving heed to a stranger  chris why sir this burden upon my back is more terrible to me than all these things which you have mentioned nay methinks i care not what i meet with in the way if so be i can also meet with deliverance from my burden  world how camest thou by the burden at first  chris by reading this book in my hand  world i thought so and it has happened unto thee as unto other weak men who meddling with things too high for them do suddenly fall into thy crazy thoughts which thoughts do not only unman men as thine i perceive have done thee but they run them upon desperate efforts to obtain they know not what  chris i know what i would obtain it is ease for my heavy burden  world but why wilt thou seek for ease this way seeing so many dangers attend it especially since hadst thou but patience to hear me i could direct thee to the getting of what thou desirest without the dangers that thou in this way wilt run thyself into yea and the remedy is at hand besides i will add that instead of those dangers thou shalt meet with much safety friendship and content  chris sir i pray open this secret to me  world why in yonder village the village is named morality there dwells a gentleman whose name is legality a very wise man and a man of very good name that has skill to help men off with such burdens as thine is from their shoulders yea to my knowledge he hath done a great deal of good this way aye and besides he hath skill to cure those that are somewhat crazed in their wits with their burdens to him as i said thou mayest go and be helped presently his house is not quite a mile from this place and if he should not be at home himself he hath a pretty young man as his son whose name is civility that can do it to speak on as well as the old gentleman himself there i say thou mayest be eased of thy burden and if thou art not minded to go back to thy former habitation as indeed i would not wish thee thou mayest send for thy wife and children to thee in this village where there are houses now standing empty one of which thou mayest have at a reasonable rate provision is there also cheap and good and that which will make thy life the more happy is to be sure there thou shalt live by honest neighbors in credit and good fashion  now was christian somewhat at a stand but presently he concluded if this be true which this gentleman hath said my wisest course is to take his advice and with that he thus further spake  chris sir which is my way to this honest mans house  world do you see yonder high hill  chris yes very well  world by that hill you must go and the first house you come at is his  sidenote evangelist and christian  so christian turned out of his way to go to mr legalitys house for help but behold when he was got now hard by the hill it seemed so high and also that side of it that was next the wayside did hang so much over that christian was afraid to venture farther lest the hill should fall on his head wherefore there he stood still and knew not what to do also his burden now seemed heavier to him than while he was in his way there came also flashes of fire out of the hill that made christian afraid that he should be burnt here therefore he sweat and did quake for fear and now he began to be sorry that he had taken mr worldly wisemans counsel and with that he saw evangelist coming to meet him at the sight also of whom he began to blush for shame so evangelist drew nearer and nearer and coming up to him he looked upon him with a severe and dreadful countenance and thus began to reason with christian  evan what dost thou here christian said he at which words christian knew not what to answer wherefore at present he stood speechless before him then said evangelist further art thou not the man that i found crying without the walls of the city of destruction  chris yes dear sir i am the man  evan did not i direct thee the way to the little wicketgate  chris yes dear sir said christian  evan how is it then that thou art so quickly turned aside for thou art now out of the way  chris i met with a gentleman as soon as i had got over the slough of despond who persuaded me that i might in the village before me find a man that could take off my burden  evan what was he  chris he looked like a gentleman and talked much to me and got me at last to yield so i came hither but when i beheld this hill and how it hangs over the way i suddenly made a stand lest it should fall on my head  evan what said that gentleman to you  chris why he asked me whither i was going and i told him  evan and what said he then  chris he asked me if i had a family and i told him but said i i am so laden with the burden that is on my back that i cannot take pleasure in them as formerly  evan and what said he then  chris he bid me with speed get rid of my burden and i told him it was ease that i sought and said i i am therefore going to yonder gate to receive further direction how i may get to the place of deliverance so he said that he would show me a better way and short not so hard as the way sir that you sent me in which way said he will direct you to a gentlemans house that hath skill to take off these burdens so i believed him and turned out of that way into this if haply i might soon be eased of my burden but when i came to this place and beheld things as they are i stopped for fear as i said of danger but i now know not what to do  evan then said evangelist stand still a little that i may show thee the words of god so he stood trembling then said evangelist god says in his book see that ye refuse not him that speaketh for if they escaped not who refused him that spake on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven he said moreover now the righteous man shall live by faith in god but if any man draw back my soul shall have no pleasure in him he also did thus apply them thou art the man that art running into misery thou hast begun to reject the counsel of the most high and to draw back thy foot from the way of peace even almost to the danger of thy everlasting ruin  then christian fell down at his feet as dead crying woe is me for i am undone at the sight of which evangelist caught him by the right hand saying all manner of sin and evil words shall be forgiven unto men be not faithless but believing then did christian again a little revive and stood up trembling as at first before evangelist  then evangelist proceeded saying give more earnest heed to the things that i shall tell thee of i will now show thee who it was that led thee astray and who it was also to whom he sent thee that man that met thee is one worldly wiseman and rightly is he so called partly because he seeks only for the things of this world therefore he always goes to the town of morality to church and partly because he loveth that way best for it saveth him from the cross and because he is of this evil temper therefore he seeketh to turn you from my way though it is the right way  he to whom thou wast sent for ease being by name legality is not able to set thee free from thy burden no man was as yet ever rid of his burden by him no nor ever is like to be ye cannot be set right by any such plan therefore mr worldly wiseman is an enemy and mr legality is a cheat and for his son civility notwithstanding his simpering looks he is but a fraud and cannot help thee believe me there is nothing in all this noise that thou hast heard of these wicked men but a design to rob thee of thy salvation by turning thee from the way in which i had set thee after this evangelist called aloud to the heavens for proof of what he had said and with that there came words and fire out of the mountain under which poor christian stood which made the hair of his flesh stand up the words were thus spoken as many as are of the works of the law are under the curse  now christian looked for nothing but death and began to cry out lamentably even cursing the time in which he met with mr worldly wiseman still calling himself a thousand fools for listening to his counsel he also was greatly ashamed to think that this gentlemans arguments should have the power with him so far as to cause him to forsake the right way this done he spoke again to evangelist in words and sense as follows  chris sir what think you is there any hope may i now go back and go up to the wicketgate shall i not be abandoned for this and sent back from thence ashamed i am sorry i have hearkened to this mans counsel but may my sins be forgiven  evan then said evangelist to him thy sin is very great for by it thou hast committed two evils thou hast forsaken the way that is good to tread in forbidden paths yet will the man at the gate receive thee for he has good will for men only said he take heed that thou turn not aside again lest thou perish from the way when his anger is kindled but a little     chapter ii   then did christian begin to go back to the right road and evangelist after he had kissed him gave him one smile and bid him god speed so he went on with haste neither spake he to any man by the way nor if any asked him would he give them an answer he went like one that was all the while treading on forbidden ground and could by no means think himself safe till again he was got in the way which he had left to follow mr worldly wisemans counsel so after a time christian got up to the gate now over the gate there was written knock and it shall be opened unto you  he knocked therefore more than once or twice saying    may i now enter here will he within   open to sorry me though i have been   an undeserving rebel then shall i   not fail to sing his lasting praise on high  sidenote goodwill opens the gate  at last there came a grave person to the gate named goodwill who asked who was there and whence he came and what he would have  chris here is a poor burdened sinner i come from the city of destruction but am going to mount zion that i may be set free from the wrath to come i would therefore sir since i am told that by this gate is the way thither know if you are willing to let me in  good i am willing with all my heart said he and with that he opened the gate  so when christian was stepping in the other gave him a pull then said christian what means that the other told him a little distance from this gate there is erected a strong castle of which beelzebub the evil one is the captain from whence both he and they that are with him shoot arrows at those that come up to this gate if haply they may die before they can enter in then said christian i rejoice and tremble so when he was got in the man of the gate asked him who directed him thither  chris evangelist bid me come hither and knock as i did and he said that you sir would tell me what i must do  good an open door is set before thee and no man can shut it  chris now i begin to reap the benefit of the trouble which i have taken  good but how is it that you came alone  chris because none of my neighbors saw their danger as i saw mine  good did any of them know you were coming  chris yes my wife and children saw me at the first and called after me to turn again also some of my neighbors stood crying and calling after me to return but i put my fingers in my ears and so came on my way  good but did none of them follow you to persuade you to go back  chris yes both obstinate and pliable but when they saw that they could not prevail obstinate went railing back but pliable came with me a little way  good but why did he not come through  chris we indeed came both together until we came to the slough of despond into the which we also suddenly fell and then was my neighbor pliable discouraged and would not venture farther wherefore getting out again on the side next his own house he told me i should win the brave country alone for him so he went his way and i came mine he after obstinate and i to this gate  good then said goodwill alas poor man is the heavenly glory of so little worth with him that he counteth it not worth running the risk of a few difficulties to obtain it  chris truly said christian i have said the truth of pliable and if i should also say the truth of myself it will appear there is not betterment betwixt him and myself tis true he went on back to his own house but i also turned aside to go into the way of death being persuaded thereto by the words of one mr worldly wiseman  good oh did he light upon you what he would have had you seek for ease at the hands of mr legality they are both of them a very cheat but did you take his counsel  chris yes as far as i durst i went to find out mr legality until i thought that the mountain that stands by his house would have fallen upon my head wherefore there i was forced to stop  good that mountain has been the death of many and will be the death of many more it is well you escaped being by it dashed in pieces  chris why truly i do not know what had become of me there had not evangelist happily met me again as i was musing in the midst of my dumps but it was gods mercy that he came to me again for else i had never come hither but now i am come such a one as i am more fit indeed for death by that mountain than thus to stand talking with my lord but oh what a favor this is to me that yet i am to enter here  good we make no objections against any notwithstanding all that they have done before they come hither they in no wise are cast out and therefore good christian come a little with me and i will teach thee about the way thou must go look before thee dost thou see this narrow way that is the way thou must go it was cast up by the men of old prophets christ and his apostles and it is as straight as a rule can make it this is the way thou must go  chris but said christian are there no turnings nor windings by which a stranger may lose his way  good yes there are many ways butt down upon this and they are crooked and wide but thus thou mayest distinguish the right from the wrong the right only being straight and narrow  then i saw in my dream that christian asked him further if he could not help him off with his burden that was upon his back for as yet he had not got rid thereof nor could he by any means get it off without help  he told him as to thy burden be content to bear it until thou comest to the place of deliverance for there it will fall from thy back of itself  then christian began to gird up his loins and to turn again to his journey  so the other told him that as soon as he was gone some distance from the gate he would come at the house of the interpreter at whose door he should knock and he would show him excellent things then christian took his leave of his friend and he again bid him god speed  sidenote house of the interpreter  then he went on till he came to the house of the interpreter where he knocked over and over at last one came to the door and asked who was there  chris sir here is a traveler who was bid by a friend of the good man of this house to call here for his benefit i would therefore speak with the master of the house  so he called for the master of the house who after a little time came to christian and asked him what he would have  chris sir said christian i am a man that am come from the city of destruction and am going to mount zion and i was told by the man that stands at the gate at the head of this way that if i called here you would show me excellent things such as would be helpful to me on my journey  inter then said the interpreter come in i will show thee that which will be profitable to thee so he commanded his man to light the candle and bid christian follow him so he led him into a private room and bid his man open a door the which when he had done christian saw the picture of a very grave person hung up against the wall and this was the fashion of it it had eyes lifted up to heaven the best of books in its hand the law of truth was written upon its lips the world was behind its back it stood as if it pleaded with men and a crown of gold did hang over its head  chris then said christian what meaneth this  inter the man whose picture this is is one of a thousand he can say in the words of the apostle paul though ye have ten thousand teachers in christ yet have you not many fathers for in christ jesus i have been your father through the gospel and whereas thou seest him with his eyes lifted up to heaven the best of books in his hand and the law of truth writ on his lips it is to show thee that his work is to know and unfold dark things to sinners even as also thou seest him stand as if he pleaded with men and whereas thou seest the world is cast behind him and that a crown hangs over his head that is to show thee that slighting and despising the things that are in the world for the love that he hath to his masters service he is sure in the world that comes next to have glory for his reward now said the interpreter i have showed thee this picture first because the man whose picture this is is the only man whom the lord of the place whither thou art going hath chosen to be thy guide in all difficult places thou mayest meet with in thy way wherefore take good heed to what i have showed thee and bear well in thy mind what thou hast seen lest in thy journey thou meet with some that pretend to lead thee right but their way goes down to death  then he took him by the hand and led him into a very large parlor that was full of dust because never swept the which after he had looked at it a little while the interpreter called for a man to sweep now when he began to sweep the dust began so abundantly to fly about that christian had almost therewith been choked then said the interpreter to a girl that stood by bring hither water and sprinkle the room the which when she had done it was swept and cleansed with ease  chris then said christian what means this  inter the interpreter answered this parlor is the heart of a man that was never made pure by the sweet grace of the gospel the dust is his sin and inward evils that have defiled the whole man he that began to sweep at first is the law but she that brought water and did sprinkle it is the gospel now whereas thou sawest that as soon as the first began to sweep the dust did fly so about that the room could not by him be cleansed but that thou wast almost choked therewith this is to show thee that the law instead of cleansing the heart by its working from sin doth revive put strength into and increase it in the soul even as it doth discover and forbid it for it doth not give power to overcome again as thou sawest the girl sprinkle the room with water upon which it was cleansed with ease this is to show thee that when the gospel comes in the sweet and gracious power thereof to the heart then i say even as thou sawest the maiden lay the dust by sprinkling the floor with water so is sin vanquished and subdued and the soul made clean through the faith of it and consequently fit for the king of glory to dwell in  i saw moreover in my dream that the interpreter took him by the hand and led him into a little room where sat two little children each one in his own chair the name of the eldest was passion and the name of the other patience passion seemed to be much discontented but patience was very quiet the christian asked what is the reason of the discontent of passion the interpreter answered the governor of them would have him stay for his best things till the beginning of next year but he will have all now patience is willing to wait  then i saw that one came to passion and brought him a bag of treasure and poured it down at his feet the which he took up and rejoiced therein and withal laughed patience to scorn but i beheld but awhile and he had wasted all away and had nothing left him but rags  chris then said christian to the interpreter explain this matter more fully to me  inter so he said these two lads are pictures passion of the men of this world and patience of the men of that which is to come for as here thou seest passion will have all now this year that is to say in this world so are the men of this world they must have all their good things now they cannot stay till the next year that is until the next world for their portion of good that proverb a bird in the hand is worth two in the bush is of more weight with them than all the words in the bible of the good of the world to come but as thou sawest that he had quickly wasted all away and had presently left him nothing but rags so will it be with all such men at the end of this world  chris then said christian now i see that patience has the best wisdom and that upon many accounts 1 because he stays for the best things 2 and also because he will have the glory of his when the other has nothing but rags  inter nay you may add another this the glory of the next world will never wear out but these are suddenly gone therefore passion had not so much reason to laugh at patience because he had his good things at first as patience will have to laugh at passion because he had his best things last for first must give place to last because last must have his time to come but last gives place to nothing for there is not another to succeed he therefore that hath his portion first must needs have a time to spend it but he that hath his portion last must have it lastingly  chris then i see it is not best to covet things that are now but to wait for things to come  inter you say truth for the things that are seen soon pass away but the things that are not seen endure forever  then i saw in my dream that the interpreter took christian by the hand and led him into a place where was a fire burning against a wall and one standing by it always casting much water upon it to quench it yet did the fire burn higher and hotter  chris then said christian what means this  inter the interpreter answered this fire is the work of god that is wrought in the heart he that casts water upon it to extinguish and put it out is the devil but in that thou seest the fire notwithstanding burn higher and hotter thou shalt also see the reason of that so then he led him about to the other side of the wall where he saw a man with a vessel of oil in his hand of the which he did also continually cast but secretly into the fire  chris then said christian what means this  inter the interpreter answered this is christ who continually with the oil of his grace helps the work already begun in the heart by the means of which notwithstanding what the devil can do the souls of his people prove gracious still and in that thou sawest that the man stood behind the wall to keep up the fire this is to teach thee that it is hard for the tempted to see how this work of grace is kept alive in the soul  i saw also that the interpreter took him again by the hand and led him into a pleasant place where was built a stately palace beautiful to behold at the sight of which christian was greatly delighted he saw also upon the top thereof certain persons walking who were clothed all in gold  then said christian may we go in thither  then the interpreter took him and led him up toward the door of the palace and behold at the door stood a great company of men as desirous to go in but durst not there also sat a man at a little distance from the door at a tableside with a book and his inkhorn before him to take the name of him that should enter therein he saw also that in the doorway stood many men in armor to keep it being resolved to do to the men that would enter what hurt and mischief they could now was christian somewhat in amaze at last when every man started back for fear of the armed men christian saw a man of a very stout countenance come up to the man that sat there to write saying set down my name sir the which when he had done he saw the man draw his sword and put a helmet upon his head and rush toward the door upon the armed men who laid upon him with deadly force but the man not at all discouraged fell to cutting and hacking most fiercely so that after he had received and given many wounds to those that attempted to keep him out he cut his way through them all and pressed forward into the palace at which there was a pleasant voice heard from those that were within even of those that walked upon the top of the palace saying    come in come in   eternal glory thou shalt win  so he went in and was clothed in such garments as they then christian smiled and said i think verily i know the meaning of this  now said christian let me go hence nay stay said the interpreter until i have showed thee a little more and after that thou shalt go on thy way so he took him by the hand again and led him into a very dark room where there sat a man in an iron cage  now the man to look on seemed very sad he sat with his eyes looking down to the ground his hands folded together and he sighed as if he would break his heart then said christian what means this at which the interpreter bid him talk with the man  then said christian to the man what art thou the man answered i am what i was not once  chris what wast thou once  man the man said i was once a fair and flourishing christian both in mine own eyes and also in the eyes of others i was once as i thought fair for the celestial city and had even joy at the thoughts that i should get thither  chris well but what art thou now  man i am now a man of despair and am shut up in it as in this iron cage i cannot get out oh now i cannot  chris but how camest thou in this condition  man i left off to watch and be sober i gave free reins to sin i sinned against the light of the word and the goodness of god i have grieved the spirit and he is gone i tempted the devil and he has come to me i have provoked god to anger and he has left me i have so hardened my heart that i cannot turn  then said christian to the interpreter but are there no hopes for such a man as this ask him said the interpreter  chris then said christian is there no hope but you must be kept in the iron cage of despair  man no none at all  chris why the son of the blessed is very pitiful  man i have crucified him to myself afresh i have despised his person i have despised his holiness i have counted his blood an unholy thing i have shown contempt to the spirit of mercy therefore i have shut myself out of all the promises of god and there now remains to me nothing but threatenings dreadful threatenings fearful threatenings of certain judgment and fiery anger which shall devour me as an enemy  chris for what did you bring yourself into this condition  man for the desires pleasures and gains of this world in the enjoyment of which i did then promise myself much delight but now every one of those things also bite me and gnaw me like a burning worm  chris but canst thou not now turn again to god  man god no longer invites me to come to him his word gives me no encouragement to believe yea himself hath shut me up in this iron cage nor can all the men in the world let me out o eternity eternity how shall i grapple with the misery that i must meet with in eternity  inter then said the interpreter to christian let this mans misery be remembered by thee and be an everlasting caution to thee  sidenote the dream of the judgment  chris well said christian this is fearful god help me to watch and be sober and to pray that i may shun the cause of this mans misery sir is it not time for me to go on my way now  inter tarry till i show thee one thing more and then thou shalt go on thy way  so he took christian by the hand again and led him into a chamber where there was one rising out of bed and as he put on his clothing he shook and trembled then said christian why doth this man thus tremble the interpreter then bid him tell to christian the reason of his so doing so he began and said this night as i was in my sleep i dreamed and behold the heavens grew exceeding black also it thundered and lightened in most fearful manner that it put me into an agony so i looked up in my dream and saw the clouds rack at an unusual rate upon which i heard a great sound of a trumpet and saw also a man sitting upon a cloud attended with the thousands of heaven they were all in flaming fire also the heavens were in a burning flame i heard then a great voice saying arise ye dead and come to judgment and with that the rocks rent the graves opened and the dead that were therein came forth some of them were exceeding glad and looked upward and some thought to hide themselves under the mountains then i saw the man that sat upon the cloud open the book and bid the world draw near yet there was by reason of a fierce flame that issued out and came before him a certain distance betwixt him and them as betwixt the judge and the prisoners at the bar i heard it also called out to them that stood around on the man that sat on the cloud gather together the tares the chaff and stubble and cast them into the burning lake and with that the bottomless pit opened just whereabout i stood out of the mouth of which there came in an abundant manner smoke and coals of fire with hideous noises it was also said to the same persons gather my wheat into the garner and with that i saw many catched up and carried away into the clouds but i was left behind i also sought to hide myself but i could not for the man that sat upon the cloud still kept his eye upon me my sins also came into my mind and my conscience did accuse me on every side upon this i awakened from my sleep  chris but what was it that made you so afraid of this sight  man why i thought that the day of judgment was come and that i was not ready for it but this affrighted me most that the angels gathered up several and left me behind also the pit of hell opened her mouth just where i stood my conscience too troubled me and as i thought the judge had always his eye upon me showing anger in his countenance  inter then said the interpreter to christian hast thou considered these things  chris yes and they put me in hope and fear  inter well keep all things so in thy mind that they may be as a goad in thy sides to prick thee forward in the way thou must go  then christian began to gird up his loins and to address himself to his journey then said the interpreter the comforter be always with thee good christian to guide thee into the way that leads to the city  so christian went on his way saying    here have i seen things rare and profitable   things pleasant dreadful things to make me stable   in what i have begun to take in hand   then let me think on them and understand   wherefore they showed me where and let me be   thankful o good interpreter to thee     chapter iii   now i saw in my dream that the highway up which christian was to go was fenced on either side with a wall that was called salvation up this way therefore did burdened christian run but not without great difficulty because of the load on his back  he ran thus till he came to a place somewhat ascending and upon that place stood a cross and a little below in the bottom a tomb so i saw in my dream that just as christian came up with the cross his burden loosed from off his shoulders and fell from off his back and began to tumble and so continued to do till it came to the mouth of the tomb where it fell in and i saw it no more  illustration christian before the cross                                    page 50  then was christian glad and lightsome and said with a merry heart he hath given me rest by his sorrow and life by his death then he stood still awhile to look and wonder for it was very surprising to him that the sight of the cross should thus ease him of his burden he looked therefore and looked again even till the springs that were in his head sent the water down his cheeks now as he stood looking and weeping behold three shining ones came to him and saluted him with peace be to thee so the first said to him thy sins be forgiven thee the second stripped him of his rags and clothed him with a change of garments the third also set a mark on his forehead and gave him a roll with a seal upon it which he bade him look on as he ran and that he should give it in at the heavenly gate so they went their way then christian gave three leaps for joy and went on singing    thus far did i come laden with my sin   nor could aught ease the grief that i was in   till i came hither what a place is this   must here be the beginning of my bliss   must here the burden fall from off my back   must here the strings that bound it to me crack   blest cross blest sepulchre blest rather be   the man that was there put to shame for me  sidenote simple sloth presumption  i saw then in my dream that he went on thus even until he came to the bottom where he saw a little out of the way three men fast asleep with fetters upon their heels the name of one was simple of another sloth and of the third presumption  christian then seeing them lie in this case went to them if perhaps he might awake them and cried you are like them that sleep on the top of a mast for the deep sea is under you a gulf that hath no bottom awake therefore and come away be willing also and i will help you off with your irons he also told them if he that goeth about like a roaring lion comes by you will certainly become a prey to his teeth with that they looked upon him and began to reply in this sort simple said i see no danger sloth said yet a little more sleep and presumption said every tub must stand upon his own bottom and so they lay down to sleep again and christian went on his way  sidenote formalist and hypocrisy  yet was he troubled to think that men in that danger should so little care for the kindness of him that so offered to help them both by awakening of them advising them and offering to help them off with their irons and as he was troubled thereabout he espied two men come tumbling over the wall on the left hand of the narrow way and they made up apace to him the name of one was formalist and the name of the other was hypocrisy so as i said they drew up unto him who thus began talking with them  chris gentlemen whence came you and whither go you  form and hyp we were born in the land of vainglory and are going for praise to mount zion  chris why came you not in at the gate which standeth at the beginning of the way know ye not that it is written he that cometh not in by the door but climbeth up some other way the same is a thief and a robber  form and hyp they said that to go to the gate for entrance was by all their countrymen counted too far about and that therefore their usual way was to make a short cut of it and to climb over the wall as they had done  chris but will it not be counted a trespass against the lord of the city whither we are bound thus to disobey his will  form and hyp they told him that as for that he needed not trouble his head thereabout for what they did they had custom for and could show if need were testimony that could prove it for more than a thousand years  chris but said christian will it stand a trial at law  form and hyp they told him that custom it being of so long standing as above a thousand years would doubtless now be admitted as a thing according to law by a fair judge and besides said they if we get into the way what matter is it which way we may get in if we are in we are in thou art but in the way who as we perceive came in at the gate and we are also in the way that came tumbling over the wall wherein now is thy condition better than ours  chris i walk by the rule of my master you walk by the rude working of your fancies you are counted thieves already by the lord of the way therefore i doubt you will not be found true men at the end of the way you come in by yourselves without his word and shall go out by yourselves without his mercy  to this they made him but little answer only they bid him look to himself then i saw that they went on every man in his way without much talking one with another save that these two men told christian that as to law and rules they doubted not but that they should as carefully do them as he therefore said they we see not wherein thou differest from us but by the coat which is on thy back which was as we believe given thee by some of thy neighbors to hide the shame of thy nakedness  chris by laws and rules you will not be saved since you came not in by the door and as for this coat that is on my back it was given to me by the lord of the place whither i go and that as you say to cover my nakedness with and i take it as a token of his kindness to me for i had nothing but rags before and besides thus i comfort myself as i go surely think i when i come to the gate of the city the lord thereof will know me for good since i have his coat on my back a coat that he gave me freely in the day that he stripped me of my rags i have moreover a mark in my forehead of which perhaps you have taken no notice which one of my lords most intimate friends fixed there the day that my burden fell off my shoulders i will tell you moreover that i had then given me a roll sealed to comfort me by reading as i go in the way i was also bid to give it in at the heavenly gate in token of my certain going in after it all which things i doubt you want and want them because you came not in at the gate  to these things they gave him no answer only they looked upon each other and laughed then i saw that they went on all save that christian kept before who had no more talk but with himself and sometimes sighingly and sometimes comfortably also he would be often reading in the roll that one of the shining ones gave him by which he was refreshed  sidenote the hill of difficulty  i beheld then that they all went on till they came to the foot of the hill difficulty at the bottom of which was a spring there were also in the same place two other ways besides that which came straight from the gate one turned to the left hand and the other to the right at the bottom of the hill but the narrow way lay right up the hill and the name of that going up the side of the hill is called difficulty christian now went to the spring and drank thereof to refresh himself and then began to go up the hill saying    the hill though high i covet to ascend   the difficulty will not me offend   for i perceive the way to life lies here   come pluck up heart lets neither faint nor fear   better though difficult the right way to go   than wrong though easy where the end is woe  the other two also came to the foot of the hill but when they saw that the hill was steep and high and that there were two other ways to go and supposing also that these two ways might meet again with that up which christian went on the other side of the hill therefore they were resolved to go in those ways now the name of one of those ways was danger and the name of the other destruction so the one took the way which is called danger which led him into a great wood and the other took directly up the way to destruction which led him into a wide field full of dark mountains where he stumbled and fell and rose no more  i looked then after christian to see him go up the hill where i perceived he fell from running to going and from going to clambering upon his hands and his knees because of the steepness of the place now about the midway to the top of the hill was a pleasant arbor made by the lord of the hill for the refreshment of weary travelers thither therefore christian got where also he sat down to rest him then he pulled his roll out of his bosom and read therein to his comfort he also now began afresh to take a review of the coat or garment that was given him as he stood by the cross thus pleasing himself a while he at last fell into a slumber and thence into a fast sleep which detained him in that place until it was almost night and in his sleep his roll fell out of his hand now as he was sleeping there came one to him and awaked him saying go to the ant thou sluggard3 consider her ways and be wise and with that christian suddenly started up and sped on his way and went apace till he came to the top of the hill    3 idle one  sidenote timorous and mistrust  now when he was got up to the top of the hill there came two men running amain the name of the one was timorous and of the other mistrust to whom christian said sirs whats the matter you run the wrong way timorous answered that they were going to the city of zion and had got up that difficult place but said he the farther we go the more danger we meet with wherefore we turned and are going back again  yes said mistrust for just before us lie a couple of lions in the way whether sleeping or waking we know not and we could not think if we came within reach but they would presently pull us in pieces  chris then said christian you make me afraid but whither shall i fly to be safe if i go back to my own country that is prepared for fire and brimstone and i shall certainly perish there if i can get to the celestial city i am sure to be in safety there i must venture to go back is nothing but death to go forward is fear of death and life everlasting beyond it i will yet go forward so mistrust and timorous ran down the hill and christian went on his way but thinking again of what he heard from the men he felt in his bosom for his roll and found it not then was christian in great distress and knew not what to do for he wanted that which used to comfort him and that which should have been his pass into the celestial city here therefore he began to be greatly troubled and knew not what to do at last he bethought himself that he had slept in the arbor that is on the side of the hill and falling down upon his knees he asked gods forgiveness for that his foolish act and then went back to look for his roll but all the way he went back who can sufficiently set forth the sorrow of christians heart sometimes he sighed sometimes he wept and oftentimes he blamed himself for being so foolish to fall asleep in that place which was erected only for a little refreshment from his weariness thus therefore he went back carefully looking on this side and on that all the way as he went if happily he might find his roll that had been his comfort so many times in his journey he went thus till he came again within sight of the arbor where he sat and slept but that sight renewed his sorrow the more by bringing again even afresh his evil of sleeping into his mind thus therefore he now went on bewailing his sinful sleep saying o wretched man that i am that i should sleep in the daytime that i should sleep in the midst of difficulty that i should so indulge myself as to use that rest for ease to my flesh which the lord of the hill hath builded only for the relief of the spirits of pilgrims how many steps have i taken in vain thus it happened to israel for their sin they were sent back again by the way of the red sea and i am made to tread those steps with sorrow which i might have trod with delight had it not been for this sinful sleep how far might i have been on my way by this time i am made to tread those steps thrice over which i needed not to have trod but once yea also now i am like to be benighted for the day is almost spent oh that i had not slept  sidenote christian recovers his roll  now by this time he was come to the arbor again where for awhile he sat down and wept but at last as providence would have it looking sorrowfully down under the settle there he espied his roll the which he with trembling and haste caught up and put it into his bosom but who can tell how joyful this man was when he had got his roll again for this roll was the assurance of his life and acceptance at the desired haven therefore he laid it up in his bosom giving thanks to god for directing his eye to the place where it lay and with joy and tears betook himself again to his journey but oh how nimbly now did he go up the rest of the hill yet before he got up the sun went down upon christian and this made him again recall the folly of his sleeping to his remembrance and thus he began again to condole with himself oh thou sinful sleep how for thy sake am i like to be benighted in my journey i must walk without the sun darkness must cover the path of my feet and i must hear the noise of the doleful creatures because of my sinful sleep now also he remembered the story that mistrust and timorous told him of how they were frighted with the sight of the lions then said christian to himself again these beasts range in the night for their prey and if they should meet with me in the dark how should i avoid them how should i escape being torn in pieces thus he went on his way but while he was thus bewailing his unhappy mistake he lifted up his eyes and behold there was a very stately palace before him the name of which was beautiful and it stood just by the highway side  sidenote watchful the porter  so i saw in my dream that he made haste and went forward that if possible he might get lodging there now before he had gone far he entered into a very narrow passage which was about a furlong off the porters lodge and looking very narrowly before him as he went he espied two lions in the way now thought he i see the dangers by which mistrust and timorous were driven back the lions were chained but he saw not the chains then he was afraid and thought also himself to go back after them for he thought nothing but death was before him but the porter at the lodge whose name is watchful perceiving that christian made a halt as if he would go back cried out unto him saying is thy strength so small fear not the lions for they are chained and are placed there for the trial of faith where it is and for the finding out of those that have none keep in the midst of the path and no hurt shall come unto thee  then i saw that he went on trembling for fear of the lions but taking good heed to the words of the porter he heard them roar but they did him no harm then he clapped his hands and went on till he came and stood before the gate where the porter was then said christian to the porter sir what house is this and may i lodge here tonight  the porter answered this house was built by the lord of the hill and he built it for the relief and security of pilgrims the porter also asked whence he was and whither he was going  chris i am come from the city of destruction and am going to mount zion but because the sun is now set i desire if i may to lodge here tonight  port what is your name  chris my name is now christian but my name at the first was graceless  port but how doth it happen that you come so late the sun is set  chris i had been here sooner but that wretched man that i am i slept in the arbor that stands on the hillside nay i had notwithstanding that been here much sooner but that in my sleep i lost my roll and came without it to the brow of the hill and then feeling for it and finding it not i was forced with sorrow of heart to go back to the place where i slept my sleep where i found it and now i am come  port well i will call out one of the women of this place who will if she likes your talk bring you in to the rest of the family according to the rules of the house  so watchful the porter rang a bell at the sound of which came out of the door of the house a grave and beautiful young woman named discretion and asked why she was called  the porter answered this man is on a journey from the city of destruction to mount zion but being weary and benighted he asked me if he might lodge here tonight so i told him i would call for thee who after speaking with him mayest do as seemeth thee good even according to the law of the house  sidenote piety prudence charity  then she asked him whence he was and whither he was going and he told her she asked him also how he got into the way and he told her then she asked him what he had seen and met with on the way and he told her and at last she asked his name so he said it is christian and i have so much the more a desire to lodge here tonight because by what i perceive this place was built by the lord of the hill for the relief and safety of pilgrims so she smiled but the water stood in her eyes and after a little pause she said i will call forth two or three of my family so she ran to the door and called out prudence piety and charity who after a little more discourse with him brought him in to the family and many of them meeting him at the threshold of the house said come in thou blessed of the lord this house was built by the lord of the hill on purpose to entertain such pilgrims in then he bowed his head and followed them into the house so when he was come in and sat down they gave him something to drink and agreed together that until supper was ready some of them should talk with christian for the best use of the time and they appointed piety prudence and charity to talk with him and thus they began  piety come good christian since we have been so loving to you to receive you into our house this night let us if perhaps we may better ourselves thereby talk with you of all things that have happened to you in your pilgrimage  chris with a very good will and i am glad that you are so well disposed  piety what moved you at first to betake yourself to a pilgrims life  sidenote christians adventures  chris i was driven out of my native country by a dreadful sound that was in mine ears to wit that certain destruction did await me if i abode in that place where i was  piety but how did it happen that you came out of your country this way  chris it was as god would have it for when i was under the fears of destruction i did not know whither to go but by chance there came a man even to me as i was trembling and weeping whose name is evangelist and he directed me to the wicketgate which else i should never have found and so set me in the way that hath led me directly to this house  piety but did you not come by the house of the interpreter  chris yes and did see such things there the remembrance of which will stick by me as long as i live especially three things to wit how christ in despite of satan the evil one maintains his work of grace in the heart how the man had sinned himself quite out of hopes of gods mercy and also the dream of him that thought in his sleep the day of judgment was come  piety why did you hear him tell his dream  chris yes and a dreadful one it was i thought it made my heart ache as he was telling of it but yet i am glad i heard of it  piety was that all you saw at the house of the interpreter  chris no he took me and had me where he showed me a stately palace and how the people were clad in gold that were in it and how there came a venturous man and cut his way through the armed men that stood in the door to keep him out and how he was bid to come in and win eternal glory methought those things did delight my heart i would have stayed at that good mans house a twelvemonth but that i knew i had farther to go  piety and what saw you else in the way  chris saw why i went but a little farther and i saw one as i thought in my mind hang bleeding upon a tree and the very sight of him made my burden fall off my back for i groaned under a very heavy burden and then it fell down from off me it was a strange thing to me for i never saw such a thing before yea and while i stood looking up for then i could not forbear looking three shining ones came to me one of them told me that my sins were forgiven me another stripped me of my rags and gave me this broidered coat which you see and the third set the mark which you see in my forehead and gave me this sealed roll and with that he plucked it out of his bosom  piety but you saw more than this did you not  chris the things that i have told you were the best yet some other matters i saw as namely i saw three men simple sloth and presumption lie asleep a little out of the way as i came with irons upon their heels but do you think i could wake them i also saw formalist and hypocrisy come tumbling over the wall to go as they pretended to zion but they were quickly lost even as i myself did tell them but they would not believe but above all i found it hard work to get up this hill and as hard to come by the lions mouths and truly if it had not been for the good man the porter that stands at the gate i do not know but that after all i might have gone back again but now i thank god i am here and i thank you for receiving of me  then prudence thought good to ask him a few questions and desired his answer to them  pru do you think sometimes of the country from whence you came  chris yes but with much shame and detestation truly if i had been mindful of that country from whence i came out i might have had an opportunity to have returned but now i desire a better country that is a heavenly one  pru do you not yet bear away with you in your thoughts some of the things that you did in the former time  chris yes but greatly against my will especially my inward and sinful thoughts with which all my countrymen as well as myself were delighted but now all those things are my grief and might i but choose mine own things i would choose never to think of those things more but when i would be doing that which is best that which is worst is with me  pru do you not find sometimes as if those things were overcome which at other times are your trouble  chris yes but that is but seldom but they are to me golden hours in which such things happen to me  pru can you remember by what means you find your annoyances at times as if they were overcome  chris yes when i think what i saw at the cross that will do it and when i look upon my broidered coat that will do it also when i look into the roll that i carry in my bosom that will do it and when my thoughts wax warm about whither i am going that will do it  pru and what makes you so desirous to go to mount zion  chris why there i hope to see him alive that did hang dead on the cross and there i hope to be rid of all these things that to this day are in me an annoyance to me there they say there is no death and there i shall dwell with such company as i like best for to tell you the truth i love him because i was by him eased of my burden and i am weary of my inward sickness i would fain be where i shall die no more and with the company that shall continually cry holy holy holy  sidenote charity talks with christian  char then said charity to christian have you a family are you a married man  chris i have a wife and four small children  char and why did you not bring them along with you  chris then christian wept and said oh how willingly would i have done it but they were all of them utterly against my going on pilgrimage  char but you should have talked to them and endeavored to have shown them the danger of staying behind  chris so i did and told them also what god had shown to me of the destruction of our city but i seemed to them as one that mocked and they believed me not  char and did you pray to god that he would bless your words to them  chris yes and that with much affection for you must think that my wife and poor children are very dear unto me  char but did you tell them of your own sorrow and fear of destruction for i suppose that you could see your destruction before you  chris yes over and over and over they might also see my fears in my countenance in my tears and also in my trembling under the fear of the judgment that did hang over our heads but all was not enough to prevail with them to come with me  char but what could they say for themselves why they came not  chris why my wife was afraid of losing this world and my children were given to the foolish delights of youth so what by one thing and what by another they left me to wander in this manner alone  char but did you not with your vain life hinder all that you by words used by way of persuasion to bring them away with you  chris indeed i cannot commend my life for i am conscious to myself of many failings therein i know also that a man by his actions may soon overthrow what by proofs or persuasion he doth labor to fasten upon others for their good yet this i can say i was very wary of giving them occasion by any unseemly action to make them averse to going on pilgrimage yea for this very thing they would tell me i was too precise and that i denied myself of things for their sakes in which they saw no evil nay i think i may say that if what they saw in me did hinder them it was my great tenderness in sinning against god or of doing any wrong to my neighbor  char indeed cain hated his brother because his own works were evil and his brothers righteous and if thy wife and children have been offended with thee for this they thereby show themselves to be resolutely opposed to good thou hast freed thy soul from their blood  now i saw in my dream that thus they sat talking together till supper was ready so when they had made ready they sat down to meat now the table was furnished with fat things and wine that was well refined and all their talk at the table was about the lord of the hill as namely about what he had done and wherefore he did what he did and why he had builded that house and by what they said i perceived that he had been a great warrior and had fought with and slain him that had the power of death but not without great danger to himself which made me love him the more  for as they said and as i believe said christian he did it with the loss of much blood but that which puts the glory of grace into all he did was that he did it out of pure love to this country and besides there were some of them of the household that said they had seen and spoken with him since he did die on the cross and they have declared that they had it from his own lips that he is such a lover of poor pilgrims that the like is not to be found from the east to the west they moreover gave an instance of what they affirmed and that was he had stripped himself of his glory that he might do this for the poor and that they had heard him say and affirm that he would not dwell in the mountains of zion alone they said moreover that he had made many pilgrims princes though by nature they were beggars born and their home had been the dunghill  thus they talked together till late at night and after they had committed themselves to their lord for protection they betook themselves to rest the pilgrim they laid in a large upper chamber whose window opened towards the sunrising the name of the chamber was peace where he slept till break of day and then he awoke and sang    where am i now is this the love and care   of jesus for the men that pilgrims are   thus to provide that i should be forgiven   and dwell already the next door to heaven  sidenote the virgins read to christian  so in the morning they all got up and after some more talking together they told him that he should not depart till they had shown him the rarities of that place and first they took him into the study where they showed him records of the greatest age in which as i remember in my dream they showed him first the history of the lord of the hill that he was the son of the ancient of days and had lived from the beginning here also were more fully written the acts that he had done and the names of many hundreds that he had taken into his service and how he had placed them in such houses that could neither by length of days nor decays of nature be destroyed  then they read to him some of the worthy acts that some of his servants had done as how they had conquered kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong waxed valiant in fight and turned to flight the armies of the enemies  they then read again in another part of the records of the house where it was shown how willing their lord was to receive into his favor any even any though they in time past had done great wrongs to his person and rule here also were several other histories of many other famous things of all which christian had a view as of things both ancient and modern together with prophecies and foretellings of things that surely come to pass both to the dread and wonder of enemies and the comfort and happiness of pilgrims  the next day they took him and led him into the armory where they showed him all manner of weapons which their lord had provided for pilgrims as sword shield helmet breastplate allprayer and shoes that would not wear out and there was here enough of this to harness out as many men for the service of their lord as there be stars in the heaven for multitude  they also showed him some of the things with which some of his servants had done wonderful things they showed him moses rod the hammer and nail with which jael slew sisera the pitchers trumpets and lamps too with which gideon put to flight the armies of midian then they showed him the oxs goad wherewith shamgar slew six hundred men they showed him also the jawbone with which samson did such mighty feats they showed him moreover the sling and stone with which david slew goliath of gath and the sword also with which their lord will kill the man of sin in the day that he shall rise up to the battle they showed him besides many excellent things with which christian was much delighted this done they went to their rest again  then i saw in my dream that on the morrow he got up to go forward but they desired him to stay till the next day also and then said they we will if the day be clear show you the delectable mountains which they said would yet further add to his comfort because they were nearer the desired haven than the place where at present he was so he consented and stayed when the morning was up they led him to the top of the house and bid him look south so he did and behold at a great distance he saw a most pleasant mountainous country beautified with woods vineyards fruits of all sorts flowers also with springs and fountains very lovely to behold then he asked the name of the country they said it was immanuels land and it is as common said they as this hill is to and for all the pilgrims and when thou comest there from thence thou mayest see to the gate of the celestial city as the shepherds that live there will make appear  now he bethought himself of setting forward and they were willing he should but first said they let us go again into the armory so they did and when he came there they dressed him from head to foot with armor of proof lest perhaps he should meet with assaults in the way he being therefore thus armed walked out with his friends to the gate and there he asked the porter if he saw any pilgrim pass by then the porter answered yes  chris pray did you know him said he  port i asked his name and he told me it was faithful  chris oh said christian i know him he is my townsman my near neighbor he comes from the place where i was born how far do you think he may be before  port he has got by this time below the hill  chris well said christian good porter the lord be with thee and add to all thy blessings much increase for the kindness thou has shown to me  then he began to go forward but discretion piety charity and prudence would accompany him down to the foot of the hill so they went on together repeating their former discourses till they came to go down the hill then said christian as it was difficult coming up so far so as i can see it is dangerous going down yes said prudence so it is for it is a hard matter for a man to go down the valley of humiliation as thou art now and to catch no slip by the way therefore said they are we come out to accompany thee down the hill so he began to go down but very warily yet he caught a slip or two  then i saw in my dream that these good companions when christian was gone down to the bottom of the hill gave him a loaf of bread a bottle of wine and a cluster of raisins and then he went his way     chapter iv   but now in this valley of humiliation poor christian was hard put to it for he had gone but a little way before he espied a foul fiend coming over the field to meet him his name is apollyon then did christian begin to be afraid and to cast in his mind whether to go back or to stand his ground but he considered again that he had no armor for his back and therefore thought that to turn the back to him might give him greater advantage with ease to pierce him with darts therefore he resolved to venture and stand his ground for thought he had i no more in mine eye than the saving of my life it would be the best way to stand so he went on and apollyon met him now the monster was hideous to behold he was clothed with scales like a fish and they are his pride he had wings like a dragon and feet like a bear and out of his belly came fire and smoke and his mouth was as the mouth of a lion when he was come up to christian he beheld him with a disdainful countenance and thus began to question with him  sidenote apollyon stays christian  apollyon whence come you and whither are you bound  chris i am come from the city of destruction which is the place of all evil and am going to the city of zion  apol by this i perceive that thou art one of my subjects for all that country is mine and i am the prince and god of it how is it then that thou hast run away from thy king were it not that i hope that thou mayest do me more service i would strike thee now at one blow to the ground  chris i was indeed born in your kingdom but your service was hard and your wages such as a man could not live on for the wages of sin is death therefore when i was come to years i did as other thoughtful persons do look out if perhaps i might mend myself  apol there is no prince that will thus lightly lose his subjects neither will i as yet lose thee but since thou complainest of thy service and wages be content to go back and what our country will afford i do here promise to give thee  chris but i have let myself to another even to the king of princes and how can i with fairness go back with thee  apol thou hast done in this according to the proverb changed a bad for a worse but it is common for those that have called themselves his servants after awhile to give him the slip and return again to me do thou so too and all shall be well  chris i have given him my faith and sworn my service to him how then can i go back from this and not be hanged as a traitor  apol thou didst the same to me and yet i am willing to pass by all if now thou wilt yet turn again and go back  chris what i promised thee was in my youth and besides i count that the prince under whose banner i now stand is able to set me free yea and to pardon also what i did as to my service with thee and besides o thou destroying apollyon to speak the truth i like his service his wages his servants his government his company and country better than thine therefore leave off to persuade me further i am his servant and i will follow him  apol consider again when thou art in cold blood what thou art likely to meet with in the way that thou goest thou knowest that for the most part his servants come to an ill end because they are disobedient against me and my ways how many of them have been put to shameful deaths and besides thou countest his service better than mine whereas he never came yet from the place where he is to deliver any that served him out of their hands but as for me how many times as all the world very well knows have i delivered either by power or fraud those that have faithfully served me from him and his though taken by them and so i will deliver thee  chris his forbearing at present to deliver them is on purpose to try their love whether they will cleave to him to the end and as for the ill end thou sayest they come to that is most glorious in their account for for present deliverance they do not much expect it for they stay for their glory and then they shall have it when their prince comes in his and the glory of the angels  apol thou hast already been unfaithful in thy service to him and how dost thou think to receive wages of him  chris wherein o apollyon have i been unfaithful to him  apol thou didst faint at first setting out when thou wast almost choked in the gulf of despond thou didst attempt wrong ways to be rid of thy burden whereas thou shouldst have stayed till thy prince had taken it off thou didst sinfully sleep and lose thy choice things thou wast almost persuaded to go back at the sight of the lions and when thou talkest of thy journey and of what thou hast seen and heard thou art inwardly desirous of glory to thyself in all that thou sayest or doest  chris all this is true and much more which thou hast left out but the prince whom i serve and honor is merciful and ready to forgive but besides these infirmities possessed me in thy own country for there i sucked them in and i have groaned under them been sorry for them and have obtained pardon of my prince  apol then apollyon broke out into a grievous rage saying i am an enemy to this prince i hate his person his laws and people i am come out on purpose to withstand thee  sidenote christian the conqueror  chris apollyon beware what you do for i am in the kings highway the way of holiness therefore take heed to yourself  apol then apollyon straddled quite over the whole breadth of the way and said i am void of fear in this matter prepare thyself to die for i swear by my infernal den that thou shalt go no farther here will i spill thy soul and with that he threw a flaming dart at his breast but christian held a shield in his hand with which he caught and so prevented the danger of that  then did christian draw for he saw it was time to bestir him and apollyon as fast made at him throwing darts as thick as hail by the which notwithstanding all that christian could do to avoid it apollyon wounded him in his head his hand and foot this made christian give a little back apollyon therefore followed his work amain and christian again took courage and resisted as manfully as he could this sore combat lasted for above half a day even till christian was almost quite spent for you must know that christian by reason of his wounds must needs grow weaker and weaker  then apollyon espying his opportunity began to gather up close to christian and wrestling with him gave him a dreadful fall and with that christians sword flew out of his hand then said apollyon i am sure of thee now and with that he had almost pressed him to death so that christian began to despair of life but as god would have it while apollyon was fetching his last blow thereby to make a full end of this good man christian nimbly reached out his hand for his sword and caught it saying rejoice not against me o mine enemy when i fall i shall arise and with that gave him a deadly thrust which made him give back as one that had received his mortal wound christian perceiving that made at him again saying nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us and with that apollyon spread forth his dragons wings and sped him away that christian for a season saw him no more  in this combat no man can imagine unless he had seen and heard as i did what yelling and hideous roaring apollyon made all the time of the fight he spake like a dragon and on the other side what sighs and groans burst from christians heart i never saw him all the while give so much as one pleasant look till he perceived he had wounded apollyon with his twoedged sword then indeed he did smile and look upward but it was the dreadfullest sight that ever i saw  sidenote christian gives thanks  chris so when the battle was over christian said i will here give thanks to him that hath delivered me out of the mouth of the lion to him that did help me against apollyon and so he did saying    great satan the captain of this fiend   designed my ruin therefore to this end   he sent him harnessed out and he with rage   that hellish was did fiercely me engage   but blessed angels helped me and i   by dint of sword did quickly make him fly   therefore to god let me give lasting praise   and thank and bless his holy name always  then there came to him a hand with some of the leaves of the tree of life the which christian took and laid upon the wounds that he had received in the battle and was healed immediately he also sat down in that place to eat bread and to drink of the bottle that was given to him a little before so being refreshed he went forth on his journey with his sword drawn in his hand for he said i know not but some other enemy may be at hand but he met with no other harm from apollyon quite through this valley  now at the end of this valley was another called the valley of the shadow of death and christian must needs go through it because the way to the celestial city lay through the midst of it now this valley is a very solitary place the prophet jeremiah thus describes it a wilderness a land of deserts and pits a land of drought and of the shadow of death a land that no man but a christian passeth through and where no man dwelt  now here christian was worse put to it than in his fight with apollyon as in the story you shall see  i saw then in my dream that when christian was got to the borders of the shadow of death there met him two men children of them that brought up an evil report of the good land making haste to go back to whom christian spake as follows  chris whither are you going  men they said back back and we would have you to do so too if either life or peace is prized by you  chris why whats the matter said christian  men matter said they we were going that way as you are going and went as far as we durst and indeed we were almost past coming back for had we gone a little farther we had not been here to bring the news to thee  chris but what have you met with said christian  men why we were almost in the valley of the shadow of death but that by good hap we looked before us and saw the danger before we came to it  chris but what have you seen said christian  men seen why the valley itself which is as dark as pitch we also saw there the hobgoblins satyrs and dragons of the pit we heard also in that valley a continual howling and yelling as of a people under unutterable misery who there sat bound in affliction and irons and over that hung the discouraging clouds of confusion death also does always spread his wings over it in a word it is every whit dreadful being utterly without order  chris then said christian i perceive not yet by what you have said but that this is my way to the desired haven  men be it thy way we will not choose it for ours  so they parted and christian went on his way but still with his sword drawn in his hand for fear lest he should be attacked  i saw then in my dream as far as this valley reached there was on the right hand a very deep ditch that ditch is it into which the blind have led the blind in all ages and have both there miserably perished again behold on the left hand there was a very dangerous quag or marsh into which if even a good man falls he finds no bottom for his foot to stand on into that quag king david once did fall and had no doubt there been smothered had not he that is able plucked him out  the pathway was here also exceedingly narrow and therefore good christian was the more put to it for when he sought in the dark to shun the ditch on the one hand he was ready to tip over into the mire on the other also when he sought to escape the mire without great carefulness he would be ready to fall into the ditch thus he went on and i heard him here sigh bitterly for besides the danger mentioned above the pathway was here so dark that ofttimes when he lifted up his foot to go forward he knew not where or upon what he should set it next  sidenote a company of fiends  about the midst of this valley i perceived the mouth of hell to be and it stood also hard by the wayside now thought christian what shall i do and ever and anon the flame and smoke would come out in such abundance with sparks and hideous noises things that cared not for christians sword as did apollyon before that he was forced to put up his sword and betake himself to another weapon called allprayer so he cried in my hearing o lord i beseech thee deliver my soul thus he went on a great while yet still the flames would be reaching towards him also he heard doleful voices and rushings to and fro so that sometimes he thought he should be torn in pieces or trodden down like mire in the streets this frightful sight was seen and those dreadful noises were heard by him for several miles together and coming to a place where he thought he heard a company of fiends coming forward to meet him he stopped and began to muse what he had best to do sometimes he had half a thought to go back then again he thought he might be halfway through the valley he remembered also how he had already vanquished many a danger and that the danger of going back might be much more than going forward so he resolved to go on yet the fiends seemed to come nearer and nearer but when they were come even almost at him he cried out with a most vehement voice i will walk in the strength of the lord god so they gave back and came no farther  sidenote valley of shadow of death  one thing i would not let slip i took notice that now poor christian was so confounded that he did not know his own voice and thus i perceived it just when he was come over against the mouth of the burning pit one of the wicked ones got behind him and stepped up softly to him and whisperingly suggested many wicked words to him which he verily thought had proceeded from his own mind this put christian more to it than anything he had met with before even to think that he should now speak evil of him that he had so much loved before yet if he could have helped it he would not have done it but he had not the wisdom either to stop his ears or to know from whence those wicked words came  when christian had traveled in this sorrowful condition some considerable time he thought he heard the voice of a man as going before him saying though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i will fear no evil for thou art with me  then he was glad and that for these reasons  firstbecause he gathered from thence that some who feared god were in this valley as well as himself  secondlyfor that he perceived god was with them though in that dark and dismal state and why not thought he with me though by reason of the kindness that attends this place i cannot perceive it  thirdlyfor that he hoped could he overtake them to have company byandby so he went on and called to him that was before but he knew not what to answer for that he also thought himself to be alone and byandby the day broke then said christian he hath turned the shadow of death into the morning  now morning being come he looked back not out of desire to return but to see by the light of the day what dangers he had gone through in the dark so he saw more perfectly the ditch that was on the one hand and the quag that was on the other also how narrow the way which led betwixt them both also now he saw the hobgoblins and satyrs and dragons of the pit but all afar off for after break of day they came not nigh yet they were shown to him according to that which is written he showeth deep things out of darkness and bringeth out to light the shadow of death  now was christian much affected with his deliverance from all the dangers of his solitary way which dangers though he feared them much before yet he saw them more clearly now because the light of the day made them plain to him and about this time the sun was rising and this was another mercy to christian for you must note that though the first part of the valley of the shadow of death was dangerous yet this second part which he was yet to go was if possible far more dangerous for from the place where he now stood even to the end of the valley the way was all along set so full of snares traps gins and nets here and so full of pits pitfalls deep holes and shelvings down there that had it now been dark as it was when he came the first part of the way had he had a thousand souls they had in reason been cast away but as i said just now the sun was rising then said he his candle shineth on my head and by his light i go through darkness  sidenote pope and pagan  in this light therefore he came to the end of the valley now i saw in my dream that at the end of the valley lay blood bones ashes and mangled bodies of men even of pilgrims that had gone this way formerly and while i was musing what should be the reason i espied a little before me a cave where two giants pope and pagan dwelt in old time by whose power and tyranny the men whose bones blood ashes etc lay there were cruelly put to death but by this place christian went without danger whereat i somewhat wondered but i have learnt since that pagan has been dead many a day and as for the other though he be yet alive he is by reason of age also of the many shrewd brushes that he met with in his younger days grown so crazy and stiff in his joints that he can now do little more than sit in his caves mouth grinning at pilgrims as they go by and biting his nails because he cannot come to them  so i saw that christian went on his way yet at the sight of the old man that sat at the mouth of the cave he could not tell what to think especially because he spoke to him though he could not go after him saying you will never mend till more of you be burned but he held his peace and set a good face on it and so went by and caught no hurt then sang christian    o world of wonders i can say no less   that i should be preserved in that distress   that i have met with here oh blessed be   that hand that from it hath delivered me   dangers in darkness devils hell and sin   did compass me while i this vale was in   yes snares and pits and traps and nets did lie   my path about that worthless silly i   might have been catched entangled and cast down   but since i live let jesus wear the crown  illustration christian and faithful join company                                    page 89     chapter v   now as christian went on his way he came to a little ascent which was cast up on purpose that pilgrims might see before them up there therefore christian went and looking forward he saw faithful before him upon his journey then said christian aloud ho ho soho stay and i will be your companion at that faithful looked behind him to whom christian cried stay stay till i come up to you but faithful answered no i am upon my life and the avenger of blood is behind me  sidenote christian joins faithful  at this christian was somewhat moved and putting to all his strength he quickly got up with faithful and did also overrun him so the last was first then did christian boastfully smile because he had gotten the start of his brother but not taking good heed to his feet he suddenly stumbled and fell and could not rise again until faithful came up to help him  then i saw in my dream they went very lovingly on together and had sweet talk together of all things that had happened to them in their pilgrimage and thus christian began  chris my honored and wellbeloved brother faithful i am glad that i have overtaken you and that god has so tempered our spirits that we can walk as companions in this so pleasant a path  faith i had thought dear friend to have had your company quite from our town but you did get the start of me wherefore i was forced to come thus much of the way alone  chris how long did you stay in the city of destruction before you set out after me on your pilgrimage  sidenote what was said in the city  faith till i could stay no longer for there was great talk presently after you were gone out that our city would in a short time with fire from heaven be burned down to the ground  chris what did your neighbors talk so  faith yes it was for a while in everybodys mouth  chris what and did no more of them but you come out to escape the danger  faith though there was as i said a great talk thereabout yet i do not think they did firmly believe it for in the heat of the talking i heard some of them deridingly speak of you and of your desperate journey for so they called this your pilgrimage but i did believe and do still that the end of our city will be with fire and brimstone from above and therefore i have made my escape  chris did you hear no talk of neighbor pliable  faith yes christian i heard that he followed you till he came to the slough of despond where as some said he fell in but he would not be known to have so done but i am sure he was soundly bedabbled with that kind of dirt  chris and what said the neighbors to him  faith he hath since his going back been held greatly in derision and that among all sorts of people some do mock and despise him and scarce any will set him on work he is now seven times worse than if he had never gone out of the city  chris but why should they be set so against him since they also despise the way that he forsook  faith oh they say hang him he is a turncoat he was not true to his profession i think god has stirred up even his enemies to hiss at him and laugh at him because he hath forsaken the way  chris had you no talk with him before you came out  faith i met him once in the streets but he leered away on the other side as one ashamed of what he had done so i spake not to him  chris well at my first setting out i had hopes of that man but now i fear he will perish in the overthrow of the city for it has happened to him according to the true proverb the dog is turned to his vomit again and the sow that was washed to her wallowing in the mire  faith these are my fears of him too but who can hinder that which will be  chris well neighbor faithful said christian let us leave him and talk of things that more immediately concern ourselves tell me now what you have met with in the way as you came for i know you have met with some things or else it may be writ for a wonder  faith i escaped the slough that i perceive you fell into and got up to the gate without that danger only i met with one whose name was wanton that had like to have done me a mischief  chris it was well you escaped her net joseph was hard put to it by her and he escaped her as you did but it had like to have cost him his life but what did she do to you  faith you cannot think but that you know something what a flattering tongue she had she lay at me hard to turn aside with her promising me all manner of enjoyment  chris nay she did not promise you the enjoyment of a good conscience  faith you know what i meannot the enjoyment of the soul but of the body  chris thank god you have escaped her the abhorred of the lord shall fall into her ditch  faith nay i know not whether i did wholly escape her or no  chris why i suppose you did not consent to her desires  faith no not to defile myself for i remembered an old writing that i had seen which saith her steps take hold of hell so i shut mine eyes because i would not be bewitched with her looks then she railed on me and i went my way  chris did you meet with no other assault as you came  sidenote faithful and adam the first  faith when i came to the foot of the hill called difficulty i met with a very aged man who asked me what i was and whither bound i told him that i was a pilgrim going to the celestial city then said the old man thou lookest like an honest fellow wilt thou be content to dwell with me for the wages that i shall give thee then i asked him his name and where he dwelt he said his name was adam the first and that he dwelt in the town of deceit i asked him then what was his work and what the wages that he would give he told me that his work was many delights and his wages that i should be his heir at last i further asked him what house he kept and what other servants he had so he told me that his house was filled with all the dainties of the world and that his servants were his own children then i asked him how many children he had he said that he had but three daughters the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life and that i should marry them if i would then i asked how long time he would have me live with him and he told me as long as he lived himself  chris well and what conclusion came the old man and you to at last  faith why at first i found myself somewhat inclinable to go with the man for i thought he spake very fair but looking in his forehead as i talked with him i saw there written put off the old man with his deeds  chris and how then  faith then it came burning hot into my mind whatever he said and however he flattered when he got home to his house he would sell me for a slave so i bid him forbear for i would not come near the door of his house then he reviled me and told me that he would send such a one after me that should make my way bitter to my soul so i turned to go away from him but just as i turned myself to go thence i felt him take hold of my flesh and give me such a deadly twitch back that i thought he had pulled part of me after himself this made me cry o wretched man so i went on my way up the hill now when i had got about halfway up i looked behind me and saw one coming after me swift as the wind so he overtook me just about the place where the settle stands  chris just there said christian did i sit down to rest me but being overcome with sleep i there lost this roll out of my bosom  faith but good brother hear me out so soon as the man overtook me he was but a word and a blow for down he knocked me and laid me for dead but when i was a little come to myself again i asked him wherefore he served me so he said because of my secret inclining to adam the first and with that he struck me another deadly blow on the breast and beat me down backwards so i lay at his feet as dead as before so when i came to myself again i cried him mercy but he said i know not how to show mercy and with that he knocked me down again he had doubtless made an end of me but that one came by and bid him forbear  chris who was that that bid him forbear  faith i did not know him at first but as he went by i perceived the holes in his hands and his side then i concluded that he was our lord so i went up the hill  chris that man that overtook you was moses he spareth none neither knoweth he how to show mercy to those that disobey his law  faith i know it very well it was not the first time that he has met with me it was he that came to me when i dwelt securely at home and that told me he would burn my house over my head if i stayed there  chris but did not you see the house that stood there on the top of that hill on the side of which moses met you  faith yes and the lions too before i came at it but for the lions i think they were asleep for it was about noon and because i had so much of the day before me i passed by the porter and came down the hill  chris he told me indeed that he saw you go by but i wished you had called at the house for they would have showed you so many rarities that you would scarce have forgot them to the day of your death but pray tell me did you meet nobody in the valley of humility  faith yes i met with one discontent who would willingly have persuaded me to go back again with him his reason was for that the valley was altogether without honor he told me moreover that there to go was the way to disoblige all my friends as pride arrogancy selfconceit worldlyglory with others who he knew as he said would be very much offended if i made such a fool of myself as to wade through this valley  chris well and how did you answer him  faith i told him that although all these that he named might claim kindred of me and that rightly for indeed they were my relations according to the flesh yet since i became a pilgrim they have disowned me as i also have rejected them and therefore they were to me now no more than if they had never been of my lineage i told him moreover that as to this valley he had quite misrepresented the thing for before honor is humility and a haughty spirit before a fall therefore said i i had rather go through this valley to the honor that was so accounted by the wisest than choose that which he esteemed most worthy of our affections  chris met you with nothing else in that valley  sidenote shame a bold villain  faith yes i met with shame but of all the men that i met with in my pilgrimage he i think bears the wrong name the others would take no for an answer at least after some words of denial but this boldfaced shame would never have done  chris why what did he say to you  faith what why he objected against religion itself he said it was a pitiful low sneaking business for a man to mind religion he said that a tender conscience was an unmanly thing and that for a man to watch over his words and ways so as to tie up himself from that liberty that the brave spirits of the times accustom themselves unto would make him the ridicule of all the people in our time he objected also that but a few of the mighty rich or wise were ever of my opinion nor any of them neither before they were persuaded to be fools to venture the loss of all for nobody else knows what he moreover objected the base and low estate and condition of those that were chiefly the pilgrims of the times in which they lived also their ignorance and want of understanding in all worldly knowledge yea he did hold me to it at that rate also about a great many more things than here i relate as that it was a shame to sit whining and mourning under a sermon and a shame to come sighing and groaning home that it was a shame to ask my neighbor forgiveness for petty faults or to give back what i had taken from any he said also that religion made a man grow strange to the great because of a few vices which he called by finer names and because religion made him own and respect the base who were of the same religious company and is not this said he a shame  chris and what did you say to him  faith say i could not tell what to say at first yea he put me so to it that my blood came up in my face even this shame fetched it up and had almost beat me quite off but at last i began to consider that that which is highly esteemed among men is had in abomination with god and i thought again this shame tells me what men are but it tells me nothing what god or the word of god is and i thought moreover that at the day of doom we shall not be doomed to death or life according to the spirits of the world but according to the wisdom and law of the highest therefore thought i what god says is bestis best though all the men in the world are against it seeing then that god prefers his religion seeing god prefers a tender conscience seeing they that make themselves fools for the kingdom of heaven are wisest and that the poor man that loveth christ is richer than the greatest man in the world that hates him shame depart thou art an enemy to my salvation shall i listen to thee against my sovereign lord how then shall i look him in the face at his coming should i now be ashamed of his way and servants how can i expect the blessing but indeed this shame was a bold villain i could scarce shake him out of my company yea he would be haunting of me and continually whispering me in the ear with some one or other of the weak things that attend religion but at last i told him it was in vain to attempt further in this business for those things that he despised in those did i see most glory and so at last i got past this persistent one and when i had shaken him off then i began to sing    the trials that those men do meet withal   that are obedient to the heavenly call   are manifold and suited to the flesh   and come and come and come again afresh   that now or some time else we by them may   be taken overcome and cast away   oh let the pilgrims let the pilgrims then   be vigilant and quit themselves like men  chris i am glad my brother that thou didst withstand this villain so bravely for of all as thou sayest i think he has the wrong name for he is so bold as to follow us in the streets and to attempt to put us to shame before all men that is to make us ashamed of that which is good but if he was not himself bold he would never attempt to do as he does but let us still resist him for notwithstanding all his bold words he promoteth the fool and none else the wise shall inherit glory said solomon but shame shall be the promotion of fools  faith i think we must cry to him for help against shame who would have us to be valiant for truth upon the earth  chris you say true but did you meet nobody else in that valley  faith no not i for i had sunshine all the rest of the way through that and also through the valley of the shadow of death  chris it was well for you i am sure it fared far otherwise with me i had for a long season as soon almost as i entered into that valley a dreadful combat with that foul fiend apollyon yea i thought verily he would have killed me especially when he got me down and crushed me under him as if he would have crushed me to pieces for as he threw me my sword flew out of my hand nay he told me he was sure of me and i cried to god and he heard me and delivered me out of all my troubles then i entered into the valley of the shadow of death and had no light for almost half the way through it i thought i should have been killed there over and over but at last day broke and the sun rose and i went through that which was behind with far more ease and quiet  sidenote talkative overtaken  moreover i saw in my dream that as they went on faithful as he chanced to look on one side saw a man whose name is talkative walking at a distance beside them for in this place there was room enough for them all to walk he was a tall man and something better looking at a distance than near at hand to this man faithful spoke himself in this manner  faith friend whither away are you going to the heavenly country  talk i am going to that same place  faith that is well then i hope we may have your good company  talk with a very good will will i be your companion  faith come on then and let us go together and let us spend our time in talking of things that are profitable  talk to talk of things that are good to me is very acceptable with you or with any other and i am glad that i have met with those that incline to so good a work for to speak the truth there are but few who care thus to spend their time as they are in their travels but choose much rather to be speaking of things to no profit and this has been a trouble to me  faith that is indeed a thing to be lamented for what things so worthy of the use of the tongue and mouth of men on earth as are the things of the god of heaven  talk i like you wonderfully well for your saying is full of the truth and i will add what thing is so pleasant and what so profitable as to talk of the things of god what things so pleasant that is if a man hath any delight in things that are wonderful for instance if a man doth delight to talk of the history or the mystery of things or if a man doth love to talk of miracles wonders or signs where shall he find things written so delightful or so sweetly penned as in the holy scripture  faith thats true but to be profited by such things in our talk should be that which we design  sidenote talkative selfdeceived  talk that is it that i said for to talk of such things is most profitable for by so doing a man may get knowledge of many things as of the folly of earthly things and the benefit of things above besides by this a man may learn what it is to turn from sin to believe to pray to suffer or the like by this also a man may learn what are the great promises and comforts of the gospel to his own enjoyment further by this a man may learn to answer false opinions to prove the truth and also to teach the ignorant  faith all this is true and glad am i to hear these things from you  talk alas the want of this is the cause that so few understand the need of faith and the necessity of a work of grace in their soul in order to eternal life  faith but by your leave heavenly knowledge of these is the gift of god no man attaineth to them by human working or only by the talk of them  talk all that i know very well for a man can receive nothing except it be given him from heaven i could give you a hundred scriptures for the confirmation of this  faith well then said faithful what is that one thing that we shall at this time found our talk upon  talk what you will i will talk of things heavenly or things earthly things in life or things in the gospel things sacred or things worldly things past or things to come things foreign or things at home things necessary or things accidental provided that all be done to our profit  faith now did faithful begin to wonder and stepping to christian for he walked all this while by himself he said to him but softly what a brave companion have we got surely this man will make a very excellent pilgrim  sidenote faithful disputes talkative  chris at this christian modestly smiled and said this man with whom you are so taken will deceive with this tongue of his twenty of them that know him not  faith do you know him then  chris know him yes better than he knows himself  faith pray what is he  chris his name is talkative he dwelleth in our town i wonder that you should be a stranger to him only i consider that our town is large  faith whose son is he and whereabout doth he dwell  chris he is the son of one saywell he dwelt in prating row and is known to all that are acquainted with him by the name of talkative of prating row and notwithstanding his fine tongue he is but a sorry fellow  faith well he seems to be a very pretty man  chris that is to them that have not a thorough acquaintance with him for he is best abroad near home he is ugly enough your saying that he is a pretty man brings to my mind what i have observed in the work of the painter whose pictures show best at a distance but very near more unpleasing  faith but i am ready to think you do but jest because you smiled  chris god forbid that i should jest though i smiled in this matter or that i should accuse any falsely i will give you a further discovery of him this man is for any company and for any talk as he talketh now with you so will he talk when he is on the alebench and the more drink he hath in his crown the more of these things he hath in his mouth religion hath no place in his heart or house or conversation all he hath lieth in his tongue and his religion is to make a noise therewith  faith say you so then am i in this man greatly deceived  chris deceived you may be sure of it remember the proverb they say and do not but the kingdom of god is not in word but in power he talketh of prayer of turning to god of faith and of the new birth but he knows but only to talk of them i have been in his family and have seen him both at home and abroad and i know what i say of him is the truth his house is as empty of religion as the white of an egg is of savor there is there neither prayer nor sign of turning from sin yea the brute in his kind serves god far better than he he is the very stain reproach and shame of religion to all that know him it can hardly have a good word in all that end of the town where he dwells through him thus say the common people that know him a saint abroad and a devil at home his poor family finds it so he is such a faultfinder such a railer at and so unreasonable with his servants that they neither know how to do for or speak to him men that have any dealings with him say it is better to deal with a turk than with him for fairer dealing they shall have at their hands this talkative if it be possible will go beyond them cheat beguile and overreach them besides he brings up his sons to follow his steps and if he findeth in any of them a foolish timorousness for so he calls the first appearance of a tender conscience he calls them fools and blockheads and by no means will employ them in much or speak to their commendation before others for my part i am of opinion that he has by his wicked life caused many to stumble and fall and will be if god prevent not the ruin of many more  faith well my brother i am bound to believe you not only because you say you know him but also because like a christian you make your reports of men for i cannot think you speak these things of illwill but because it is even so as you say  chris had i known him no more than you i might perhaps have thought of him as at first you did yea had he received this report only from those that are enemies to religion i should have thought it had been a slander a lot that often falls from bad mens mouths upon good mens names and professions but all these things yea and a great many more as bad of my own knowledge i can prove him guilty of besides good men are ashamed of him they can neither call him brother nor friend the very naming of him among them makes them blush if they know him  faith well i see that saying and doing are two things and hereafter i shall better observe the difference between them  chris they are two things indeed and are as diverse as are the soul and the body for as the body without the soul is but a dead carcase so saying if it be alone is but a dead carcase also the soul of religion is the practical part pure religion and undefiled before god and the father is this to visit the fatherless and the widows in their affliction and to keep himself unspotted from the world this talkative is not aware of he thinks that hearing and saying will make a good christian and thus he deceiveth his own soul hearing is but as the sowing of the seed talking is not sufficient to prove that fruit is indeed in the heart and life and let us assure ourselves that at the day of doom men shall be judged according to their fruits  faith well i was not so fond of his company at first but i am as sick of it now what shall we do to be rid of him  chris take my advice and do as i bid you and you shall find that he will soon be sick of your company too except god shall touch his heart and turn it  faith what would you have me to do  chris why go to him and enter into some serious conversation about the power of religion and ask him plainly when he has approved of it for that he will whether this thing be set up in his heart house or conduct  faith then faithful stepped forward again and said to talkative come what cheer how is it now  talk thank you well i thought we should have had a great deal of talk by this time  faith well if you will we will fall to it now and since you left it with me to state the question let it be this how doth the saving grace of god show itself when it is in the heart of man  talk i perceive then that our talk must be about the power of things well it is a very good question and i shall be willing to answer you and take my answer in brief thus first where the grace of god is in the heart it causeth there a great outcry against sin secondly  faith nay hold let us consider of one at once i think you should rather say it shows itself by inclining the soul to hate its sin  talk why what difference is there between crying out against and hating sin  faith oh a great deal a man may cry out against sin in order to appear good but he cannot hate it except by a real dislike for it i have heard many cry out against sin in the pulpit who yet can abide it well enough in the heart house and life some cry out against sin even as the mother cries out against her child in her lap when she calleth it a naughty girl and then falls to hugging and kissing it  talk you are trying to catch me i perceive  faith no not i i am only for setting things right but what is the second thing whereby you would prove a discovery of a work of god in the heart  talk great knowledge of hard things in the bible  sidenote talkative parts company  faith this sign should have been first but first or last it is also false for knowledge great knowledge may be obtained in the mysteries of the gospel and yet no work of grace in the soul yea if a man have all knowledge he may yet be nothing and so consequently be no child of god when christ said do ye know all these things and the disciples had answered yes he added blessed are ye if ye do them he doth not lay the blessing in the knowledge of them but in the doing of them for there is a knowledge that is not attended with doing he that knoweth his masters will and doeth it not a man may know like an angel and yet be no christian therefore your sign of it is not true indeed to know is a thing that pleaseth talkers and boasters but to do is that which pleaseth god  talk you are trying to catch me again this is not profitable  faith well if you please name another sign how this work of grace showeth itself where it is  talk not i for i see we shall not agree  faith well if you will not will you give me leave to do it  talk you may say what you please  faith gods work in the soul showeth itself either to him that hath it or to standers by to him that has it it is shown by making him see and feel his own sins to others who are standing by it is shown by his life a life of doing right in the sight of god and now sir as to this brief account of the work of grace and also the showing of it if you have aught to object object if not then give me leave to ask you a second question  talk nay my part is not now to object but to hear let me therefore have your second question  faith it is this have you felt your own sins and have you turned from them and do your life and conduct show it the same or is your religion in word or in tongue and not in deed and truth pray if you incline to answer me in this say no more than you know the god above will say amen to and also nothing but what your conscience can approve you in for not he that commendeth himself is approved but whom the lord commendeth besides to say i am thus and thus when my conduct and all my neighbors tell me i lie is great wickedness  talk then talkative at first began to blush but recovering himself thus he replied this kind of discourse i did not expect nor am i disposed to give an answer to such questions because i count not myself bound thereto unless you take upon you to be a questioner and though you should do so yet i may refuse to make you my judge but i pray will you tell me why you ask me such questions  faith because i saw you forward to talk and because i knew not that you had aught else but notion besides to tell you all the truth i have heard of you that you are a man whose religion lies in talk and that your life gives this your mouthprofession the lie they say you are a spot among christians and that religion fareth the worse for your ungodly conduct that some already have stumbled at your wicked ways and that more are in danger of being destroyed thereby your religion and an alehouse and greed for gain and uncleanness and swearing and lying and vain companykeeping etc will stand together you are a shame to all who are members of the church  talk since you are ready to take up reports and to judge so rashly as you do i cannot but conclude you are some peevish or cross man not fit to be talked with and so adieu  chris then came up christian and said to his brother i told you how it would happen your words and his heart could not agree he had rather leave your company than reform his life but he is gone as i said let him go the loss is no mans but his own he has saved us the trouble of going from him for he continuing as i suppose he will do as he is he would have been but a blot in our company besides the apostle says from such withdraw thyself  faith but i am glad we had this little talk with him it may happen that he will think of it again however i have dealt plainly with him and so am clear of his blood if he perisheth  chris you did well to talk so plainly to him as you did there is but little of this faithful dealing with men nowadays and that makes religion to be despised by so many for they are these talkative fools whose religion is only in word and are vile and vain in their life that being so much admitted into the fellowship of the godly do puzzle the world blemish christianity and grieve the sincere i wish that all men would deal with such as you have done then should they either be made more suitable to religion or the company of saints would be too hot for them  faith then did faithful say    how talkative at first lifts up his plumes   how bravely doth he speak how he presumes   to drive down all before him but so soon   as faithful talks of heartwork like the moon   thats past the full into the wane he goes   and so will all but he who heartwork knows  thus they went on talking of what they had seen by the way and so made that way easy which would otherwise no doubt have been tedious to them for now they went through a wilderness     chapter vi   now when they were got almost quite out of this wilderness faithful chanced to cast his eye back and espied one coming after him and he knew him oh said faithful to his brother who comes yonder then christian looked and said it is my good friend evangelist ay and my good friend too said faithful for it was he that set me the way to the gate now was evangelist come up unto them and thus saluted them  evan peace be with you dearly beloved and peace be to your helpers  chris welcome welcome my good evangelist the sight of thy face brings to my thought thy former kindness and unwearied laboring for my eternal good  faith and a thousand times welcome said good faithful thy company o sweet evangelist how desirable is it to us poor pilgrims  evan then said evangelist how hath it fared with you my friends since the time of our last parting what have you met with and how have you behaved yourselves  then christian and faithful told him of all things that had happened to them in the way and how and with what difficulty they had arrived to that place  evan right glad am i said evangelist not that you met with trials but that you have been victors and for that you have notwithstanding many weaknesses continued in the way to this very day i say right glad am i of this thing and that for my own sake and yours i have sowed and you have reaped and the day is coming when both he that sowed and they that reaped shall rejoice together that is if you faint not the crown is before you and it is an uncorruptible one so run that you may obtain it some there be that set out for this crown and after they have gone far for it another comes in and takes it from them hold fast therefore that you have let no man take your crown  then christian thanked him for his words but told him withal that they would have him speak further to them for their help the rest of the way and the rather for that they well knew that he was a prophet and could tell them of things that might happen unto them and also how they might resist and overcome them to which request faithful also consented so evangelist began as followeth  sidenote evangelist exhorts christian  evan my sons you have heard in the words of the truth of the gospel that you must through many trials enter into the kingdom of heaven and again that in every city bonds and afflictions await you and therefore you cannot expect that you should go long on your pilgrimage without them in some sort or other you have found something of the truth of these words upon you already and more will immediately follow for now as you see you are almost out of this wilderness and therefore you will soon come into a town that you will byandby see before you and in that town you will be hardly beset with enemies who will strain hard but they will kill you and be you sure that one or both of you must seal the truth which you hold with blood but be you faithful unto death and the king will give you a crown of life he that shall die there although his death will be unnatural and his pain perhaps great he will yet have the better of his fellow not only because he will be arrived at the celestial city soonest but because he will escape many miseries that the other will meet with in the rest of his journey but when you are come to the town and shall find fulfilled what i have here related then remember your friend and quit yourselves like men and commit the keeping of your souls to god in welldoing as unto a faithful creator  sidenote the pilgrims at vanity fair  then i saw in my dream that when they were got out of the wilderness they presently saw a town before them and the name of that town is vanity and at the town there is a fair kept called vanity fair it is kept all the year long it beareth the name of vanity fair because the town where it is kept is lighter than vanity and also because all that is there sold or that cometh thither is vanity as is the saying of the wise all that cometh is vanity  this is no newly begun business but a thing of ancient standing i will show you the original of it  almost five thousand years ago there were pilgrims walking to the celestial city as these two honest persons are and beelzebub apollyon and legion with their companions perceiving by the path that the pilgrims made that their way to the city lay through this town of vanity they contrived here to set up a fair a fair wherein should be sold all sorts of vanity and that it should last all the year long therefore at this fair are all such things sold as houses lands trades places honors preferments titles countries kingdoms lusts pleasures and delights of all sorts as wives husbands children masters servants lives blood bodies souls silver gold pearls precious stones and what not  and moreover at this fair there are at all times to be seen jugglings cheats games plays fools apes knaves and rogues and that of every kind  here are to be seen too and that for nothing thefts murders false swearers and that of a bloodred color  and as in other fairs of less moment there are several rows and streets under their proper names where such and such wares are vended so here likewise you have the proper places rows streets namely countries and kingdoms where the wares of this fair are soonest to be found here are the britain row the french row the italian row the spanish row the german row where several sorts of vanities are to be sold but as in other fairs some one commodity is as the chief of all the fair so the ware of rome and her goods are greatly promoted in this fair only our english nation with some others have taken dislike thereat  now as i said the way to the celestial city lies just through this town where this lusty fair is kept and he that would go to the city and yet not go through this town must needs go out of the world the prince of princes himself when here went through this town to his own country and that upon a fair day too yea and as i think it was beelzebub the chief lord of this fair that invited him to buy of his vanities yea would have made him lord of the fair would he but have done him reverence as he went through the town yea because he was such a person of honor beelzebub had him from street to street and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in a little time that he might if possible allure that blessed one to ask for and buy some of his vanities but he had no mind to the merchandise and therefore left the town without laying out so much as one farthing upon these vanities this fair therefore is an ancient thing of longstanding and a very great fair  now these pilgrims as i said must needs go through this fair well so they did but behold even as they entered into the fair all the people in the fair were moved and the town itself as it were in a hubbub about them and that for several reasons for  firstthe pilgrims were clothed with such kind of garments as were different from the raiment of any that traded in that fair the people therefore of the fair made a great gazing upon them some said they were fools some they were bedlams and some they were outlandish men  secondlyand as they wondered at their apparel so they did likewise at their speech for few could understand what they said they naturally spoke the language of canaan but they that kept the fair were the men of this world so that from one end of the fair to the other they seemed barbarians each to the other  thirdlybut that which did not a little amuse the storekeepers was that these pilgrims set very light by all their wares they cared not so much as to look upon them and if they called upon them to buy they would put their fingers in their ears and cry turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity and look upwards signifying that their trade and traffic were in heaven  one chanced mockingly beholding the actions of the men to say unto them what will you buy but they looking gravely upon him said we buy the truth at that there was an occasion taken to despise the men the more some mocking some taunting some speaking reproachfully and some calling on others to smite them at last things came to a hubbub and great stir in the fair insomuch that all order was confounded now was word presently brought to the great one of the fair who quickly came down and deputed some of his most trusty friends to take these men for trial about whom the fair was almost overturned so the men were brought to trial and they that sat upon them asked them whence they came whither they went and what they did there in such an unusual garb the men told them that they were pilgrims and strangers in the world and that they were going to their own country which was the heavenly jerusalem and that they had given no occasion to the men of the town nor yet to the merchants thus to abuse them and to hinder them in their journey except it was for that when one asked them what they would buy they said they would buy the truth but they that were appointed to examine them did not believe them to be any other than crazy people and mad or else such as came to put all things into a confusion in the fair therefore they took them and beat them and besmeared them with dirt and then put them into the cage that they might be made a spectacle to all the men of the fair there therefore they lay for some time and were made the objects of any mans sport or malice or revenge the great one of the fair laughing still at all that befell them but the men being patient and not rendering railing for railing but contrariwise blessing and giving good words for bad and kindness for injuries done some men in the fair that were more observing and less opposed than the rest began to check and blame the baser sort for their continual abuses done by them to the men they therefore in an angry manner let fly at them again counting them as bad as the men in the cage and telling them that they seemed to be in league with them and should be made partakers of their misfortunes the others replied that for aught they could see the men were quiet and sober and intended nobody any harm and that there were many that traded in their fair that were more worthy to be put into the cage yea and pillory too than were the men that they had abused thus after divers words had passed on both sides the men behaving themselves all the while very wisely and soberly before them they fell to some blows and did harm to one another then were these two poor men brought before the court again and there charged as being guilty of the late hubbub that had been in the fair so they beat them pitifully and hanged irons upon them and led them in chains up and down the fair for an example and terror to others lest any should speak in their behalf or join themselves unto them but christian and faithful behaved themselves yet more wisely and received the wrongs and shame that were cast upon them with so much meekness and patience that it won to their side though but few in comparison of the rest several of the men in the fair this put the other party in yet a greater rage insomuch that they resolved upon the death of these two men wherefore they threatened that neither cage nor irons should serve their turn but that they should die for the abuse they had done and for deceiving the men of the fair  sidenote the pilgrims in stocks  then were they remanded to the cage again until further order should be taken with them so they put them in and made their feet fast in the stocks  here therefore they called again to mind what they had heard from their faithful friend evangelist and were more confirmed in their way and sufferings by what he told them would happen to them they also now comforted each other that whose lot it was to suffer even he should have the best of it therefore each man secretly wished he might have that privilege but committing themselves to the allwise disposal of him that ruleth all things with much content they abode in the condition in which they were until they should be otherwise disposed of  sidenote lord hategood  then a convenient time being appointed they brought them forth to their trial in order to their being condemned when the time was come they were brought before their enemies and placed on trial the judges name was lord hategood the charges against both were one and the same in substance though somewhat varying in form the contents whereof were this that they were enemies to and disturbers of their trade that they had made riots and divisions in the town and had won a party to their own most dangerous opinions in contempt of the law of their prince  then faithful began to answer that he had only set himself against that which had set itself against him that is higher than the highest and said he as for disturbances i make none being myself a man of peace the parties that were won to us were won by beholding our truth and innocence and they are only turned from the worse to the better and as to the king you talk of since he is beelzebub the enemy of our lord i defy him and all his angels  sidenote the pilgrims on trial  then it was made known that they that had aught to say for their lord the king against the prisoner at the bar should forthwith appear and give in their evidence so there came in three witnesses to wit envy superstition and pickthank they were then asked if they knew the prisoner at the bar and what they had to say for their lord the king against him  then stood forth envy and said to this effect my lord i have known this man a long time and will attest upon my oath before this honorable bench that he is  judge hold give him his oath  envy so they sware him then said he my lord this man notwithstanding his name faithful is one of the vilest men in our country he cares for neither prince nor people law nor custom but doth all that he can to possess all men with certain of his disloyal notions which he in the general calls principles of faith and holiness and in particular i heard him once myself affirm that christianity and the customs of our town of vanity were opposite and could not be reconciled by which saying my lord he doth at once not only condemn all our laudable doings but us in the doing of them  judge then did the judge say to him hast thou any more to say  envy my lord i could say much more only i would not be tiresome to the court yet if need be when the other gentlemen have given in their evidence rather than anything shall be wanting that will dispatch him i will have more to speak against him so he was bid stand by  then they called superstition and bade him look upon the prisoner they also asked what he could say for their lord the king against him then they sware him so he began  super my lord i have no great acquaintance with this man nor do i desire to have further knowledge of him however this i know that he is a very pestilent fellow from some discourse the other day that i had with him in this town for then talking with him i heard him say that our religion was naught and such by which a man could by no means please god which saying of his my lord your lordship very well knows what necessarily thence will follow to wit that we still do worship in vain are yet in our sins and finally shall be destroyed and this is that which i have to say  then was pickthank sworn and bid say what he knew in behalf of their lord the king against the prisoner at the bar  pick my lord and you gentlemen all this fellow i have known a long time and have heard him speak things that ought not to be spoken for he hath railed on our noble prince beelzebub and hath spoken contemptuously of his honorable friends whose names are the lord oldman the lord carnaldelight the lord luxurious the lord desireofvainglory my old lord lust sir having greedy with all the rest of our nobility and he hath said moreover that if all men were of his mind if possible there is not one of these noblemen should have any longer a being in this town besides he has not been afraid to rail on you my lord who are now appointed to be his judge calling you an ungodly villain with many other suchlike abusive terms with which he hath bespattered most of the gentry of our town  judge when this pickthank had told his tale the judge directed his speech to the prisoner at the bar saying thou runagate heretic and traitor hast thou heard what these honest gentlemen have witnessed against thee  faith may i speak a few words in my own defense  judge sirrah sirrah thou deservest to live no longer but to be slain immediately upon the place yet that all men may see our gentleness towards thee let us hear what thou vile runagate hast to say  faith 1 i say then in answer to what mr envy hath spoken i have never said aught but this that what rule or laws or custom or people were flat against the word of god are opposite to christianity if i have said amiss in this convince me of my error and i am ready here before you to take back my words  2 as to the second to wit mr superstition and his charge against me i said only this that in the worship of god there is required true faith but there can be no true faith without a knowledge of the will of god therefore whatever is thrust into the worship of god that is not agreeable to the word of god will not profit to eternal life  3 as to what mr pickthank hath said i say avoiding terms as that i am said to rail and the like that the prince of this town with all the rabblement his attendants by this gentleman named are more fit for a being in hell than in this town and country and so the lord have mercy upon me  then the judge called to the jury who all this while stood by to hear and observe gentlemen of the jury you see this man about whom so great an uproar hath been made in this town you have also heard what these worthy gentlemen have witnessed against him also you have heard his reply and confession it lieth now in your breast to hang him or to save his life but yet i think meet to instruct you into our law  there was an act made in the days of pharaoh the great servant to our prince that lest those of a contrary religion should multiply and grow too strong for him their males should be thrown into the river there was also an act made in the days of nebuchadnezzar the great another of his servants that whoever would not fall down and worship his golden image should be thrown into a fiery furnace there was also an act made in the days of darius that whoso for some time called upon any god but him should be cast into the lions den now the substance of these laws this rebel has broken not only in thought which is not to be borne but also in word and deed which must therefore needs be intolerable you see he disputeth against our religion and for the reason that he hath confessed he deserveth to die the death  sidenote faithful dies at the stake  then went the jury out whose names were mr blindman mr nogood mr malice mr lovelust mr liveloose mr heady mr highmind mr enmity mr liar mr cruelty mr hatelight and mr implacable who every one gave in his private voice against him among themselves and afterwards unanimously concluded to bring him in guilty before the judge and first among themselves mr blindman the foreman said i see clearly that this man is a heretic then said mr nogood away with such a fellow from the earth ay said mr malice for i hate the very look of him then said mr lovelust i could never endure him nor i said mr liveloose for he would always be condemning my way hang him hang him said mr heady a sorry scrub said mr highmind my heart riseth against him said mr enmity he is a rogue said mr liar hanging is too good for him said mr cruelty let us dispatch him out of the way said mr hatelight then said mr implacable might i have all the world given to me i could not be reconciled to him therefore let us forthwith bring him in guilty of death  and so they did therefore he was presently condemned to be had from the place where he was to the place from whence he came and there to be put to the most cruel death that could be invented  they therefore brought him out to do with him according to their law and first they scourged him then they buffeted him then they lanced his flesh with knives after that they stoned him with stones then pricked him with their swords and last of all they burned him to ashes at the stake thus came faithful to his end  now i saw that there stood behind the multitude a chariot and a couple of horses waiting for faithful who so soon as his enemies had slain him was taken up into it and straightway was carried up through the clouds with sound of trumpet the nearest way to the celestial gate but as for christian he had some delay and was sent back to prison so he there remained for a space but he who overrules all things having the power of their rage in his own hand so wrought it about that christian for that time escaped them and went his way and as he went he sang saying    well faithful thou hast faithfully professed   unto thy lord with whom thou shalt be blest   when faithless ones with all their vain delights   are crying out under their hellish plights   sing faithful sing and let thy name survive   for though they killed thee thou art yet alive  illustration hopeful and christian                                    page 120     chapter vii   now i saw in my dream that christian went forth not alone for there was one whose name was hopeful being so made by looking upon christian and faithful in their words and behavior in their sufferings at the fair who joined himself unto him and entering into a brotherly pledge told him that he would be his companion thus one died to show faithfulness to the truth and another rises out of his ashes to be a companion with christian in his pilgrimage this hopeful also told christian that there were many more of the men in the fair that would take their time and follow after  sidenote byends of fairspeech  so i saw that quickly after they were got out of the fair they overtook one that was going before them whose name was byends so they said to him what countryman sir and how far go you this way he told them that he came from the town of fairspeech and he was going to the celestial city but told them not his name  chris from fairspeech are there any that be good live there  by yes said byends i hope  chris pray sir what may i call you  by i am a stranger to you and you to me if you be going this way i shall be glad of your company if not i must be content  chris this town of fairspeech i have heard of it and as i remember they say its a wealthy place  by yes i will assure you that it is and i have very many rich kindred there  chris pray who are your kindred there if a man may be so bold  by almost the whole town but in particular my lord turnabout my lord timeserver my lord fairspeech from whose ancestors that town first took its name also mr smoothman mr facingbothways mr anything and the parson of our parish mr twotongues was my mothers own brother by fathers side and to tell you the truth i am become a gentleman of good quality yet my greatgrandfather was but a waterman looking one way and rowing another and i got most of my estate by the same occupation  chris are you a married man  by yes and my wife is a very virtuous woman the daughter of a virtuous woman she was my lady feignings daughter therefore she came of a very honorable family and is arrived to such a pitch of breeding that she knows how to carry it to all even to prince and peasant tis true we somewhat differ in religion from those of the stricter sort yet but in two small points first we never strive against wind and tide secondly we are always most zealous when religion is well dressed and goes in his silver slippers we love much to walk with him in the street if the sun shines and the people praise him  then christian stepped a little aside to his fellow hopeful saying it runs in my mind that this is one byends of fairspeech and if it be he we have as very a knave in our company as dwelleth in all these parts then said hopeful ask him methinks he should not be ashamed of his name so christian came up with him again and said sir you talk as if you knew something more than all the world doth and if i take not my mark amiss i deem i have half a guess of you is not your name mr byends of fairspeech  by this is not my name but indeed it is a nickname that is given me by some that cannot abide me and i must be content to bear it as a reproach as other good men have borne theirs before me  chris but did you never give an occasion to men to call you by this name  by never never the worst that ever i did to give them an occasion to give me this name was that i had always the luck to jump in my judgment with the present way of the times whatever it was and my chance was to gain thereby but if things are thus cast upon me let me count them a blessing but let not the malicious load me therefore with reproach  chris i thought indeed that you were the man that i heard of and to tell you what i think i fear this name belongs to you more properly than you are willing we should think it doth  by well if you will thus imagine i cannot help it you shall find me a fair companykeeper if you still admit me your companion  chris if you will go with us you must go against wind and tide the which i perceive is against your opinion you must also own religion in his rags as well as when in his silver slippers and stand by him too when bound in irons as well as when he walketh the streets with applause  by you must not impose or lord it over my faith leave it to my liberty and let me go with you  chris not a step farther unless you will do in what i declare as we do  by then said byends i never desert my old principles since they are harmless and profitable if i may not go with you i must do as i did before you overtook me even go by myself until some overtake me that will be glad of my company  sidenote moneyloves principles  now i saw in my dream that christian and hopeful forsook him and kept their distance before him but one of them looking back saw three men following mr byends and behold as they came up with him he made them a very low bow and they also gave him a compliment the mens names were mr holdtheworld mr moneylove and mr saveall men that mr byends had been formerly acquainted with for in their boyhood they were schoolfellows and taught by one mr gripeman a schoolmaster in lovegain which is a market town in the county of coveting in the north this schoolmaster taught them the art of getting either by violence cheating flattery lying or by putting on a pretence of religion and these four gentlemen had learned much of the art of their master so that they could each of them have kept such a school themselves  well when they had as i said thus saluted each other mr moneylove said to mr byends who are they upon the road before us for christian and hopeful were yet within view  by they are a couple of far countrymen that after their mode are going on pilgrimage  money alas why did they not stay that we might have had their good company for they and we and you sir i hope are all going on pilgrimage  by we are so indeed but the men before us are so rigid and love so much their own notions and do also so lightly esteem the opinions of others that let a man be ever so godly yet if he agrees not with them in all things they thrust him quite out of their company  save that is bad but we read of some that are righteous overmuch and such mens rigidness makes them to judge and condemn all but themselves but i pray what and how many were the things wherein you differed  by why they after their headstrong manner conclude that it is their duty to rush on their journey all weathers and i am for waiting for wind and tide they are for taking the risk of all for god at a clap and i am for taking all advantages to secure my life and property they are for holding their notions though all other men be against them but i am for religion in what and so far as the times and my safety will bear it they are for religion when in rags and contempt but i am for him when he walks in his golden slippers in the sunshine and with applause  hold ay and hold you there still good mr byends for for my part i can count him but a fool that having the liberty to keep what he has shall be so unwise as to lose it let us be wise as serpents it is best to make hay while the sun shines you see how the bee lieth still all winter and bestirs her only when she can have profit and pleasure god sends sometimes rain and sometimes sunshine if they be such fools to go through the rain yet let us be content to take fair weather along with us for my part i like that religion best that will stand with the safety of gods good blessings unto us for who can imagine that is ruled by his reason since god has bestowed upon us the good things of this life but that he would have us keep them for his sake abraham and solomon grew rich in religion and job says that a good man should lay up gold as dust but he must not be such as the men before us if they be as you have described them  save i think that we are all agreed in this matter and therefore there needs no more words about it  money no there needs no more words about this matter indeed for he that believes neither scripture nor reason and you see we have both on our side neither knows his own liberty nor seeks his own safety  and so these four men mr byends mr moneylove mr saveall and old mr holdtheworld walked on together while christian and hopeful were far in advance  sidenote christian and hopeful  then christian and hopeful went on till they came to a delicate plain called ease where they went with much content but that plain was but narrow so they were quickly got over it now at the farther side of that plain was a little hill called lucre4 and in that hill a silver mine which some of them that had formerly gone that way because of the rarity of it had turned aside to see but going too near the brink of the pit the ground being deceitful under them broke and they were slain some also had been maimed there and could not to their dying day be their own men again    4 an old word meaning money or riches  then i saw in my dream that a little off the road over against the silver mine stood demas gentlemanlike to call to passengers to come and see who said to christian and his fellow ho turn aside hither and i will show you a thing  chris what thing so deserving as to turn us out of the way  demas here is a silver mine and some digging in it for treasure if you will come with a little pains you may richly provide for yourselves  hope then said hopeful let us go see  chris not i said christian i have heard of this place before now and how many have there been slain and besides that treasure is a snare to those that seek it for it hindereth them in their pilgrimage  chris then christian called to demas saying is not the place dangerous hath it not hindered many in their pilgrimage  demas not very dangerous except to those that are careless but withal he blushed as he spake  chris then said christian to hopeful let us not stir a step but still keep on our way  hope i will warrant you when byends comes up if he hath the same invitation as we he will turn in thither to see  chris no doubt thereof for his principles lead him that way and a hundred to one but he dies there  demas then demas called out again saying but will you not come over and see  chris then christian roundly answered saying demas thou art an enemy to the right ways of the lord of this way and hast been already condemned for thine own turning aside by one of his majestys judges and why seekest thou to have us condemned also besides if we at all turn aside our lord the king will certainly hear thereof and will there put us to shame where we should stand with boldness before him  demas cried again that he also was one of their company a pilgrim like themselves and that if they would tarry a little he also himself would walk with them  chris then said christian what is thy name is it not the same by the which i have called thee  demas yes my name is demas i am the son of abraham  chris i know you gehazi was your greatgrandfather and judas your father and you have trod in their steps it is but a devilish prank that thou usest thy father was hanged for a traitor and thou deservest no better reward assure thyself that when we come to the king we will tell him of this thy behavior thus they went their way  by this time byends and his companions were come again within sight and they at the first beck went over to demas now whether they fell into the pit by looking over the brink thereof or whether they went down to dig or whether they were smothered in the bottom by the damps that commonly arise of these things i am not certain but this i observed that they never were seen again in the way then sang christian    byends and silver demas both agree   one calls the other runs that he may be   a sharer in his lucre so these two   take up in this world and no farther go  now i saw that just on the other side of the plain the pilgrims came to a place where stood an old monument hard by the highwayside at the sight of which they were both concerned because of the strangeness of the form thereof for it seemed to them as if it had been a woman changed into the shape of a pillar here therefore they stood looking and looking upon it but could not for a time tell what they should make thereof at last hopeful espied written above upon the head thereof a writing in an unusual hand but he being no scholar called to christian for he was learned to see if he could pick out the meaning so he came and after a little laying of letters together he found the same to be this remember lots wife so he read it to his fellow after which they both concluded that that was the pillar of salt into which lots wife was turned for her looking back with a covetous heart when she was going from sodom which sudden and amazing sight gave them occasion for speaking thus  chris ah my brother this is a seasonable sight it came just in time to us after the invitation which demas gave us to come over to view the hill lucre and had we gone over as he desired us and as thou wast inclining to do my brother we had for aught i know been made ourselves like this woman a spectacle for those that shall come after to behold  hope i am sorry that i was so foolish and am made to wonder that i am not now as lots wife for wherein was the difference betwixt her sin and mine she only looked back and i had a desire to go see let gods goodness be praised and let me be ashamed that ever such a thing should be in mine heart  chris let us take notice of what we see here for our help for time to come this woman escaped one judgment for she fell not by the destruction of sodom yet she was destroyed by another as we see she is turned into a pillar of salt  hope what a mercy is it that neither thou but especially i am not made myself this example this gives reason to us to thank god to fear before him and always to remember lots wife  sidenote river of the water of life  i saw then that they went on their way to a pleasant river which david the king called the river of god but john the river of the water of life now their way lay just upon the bank of this river here therefore christian and his companion walked with great delight they drank also of the water of the river which was pleasant and enlivening to their weary spirits besides on the banks of this river on either side were green trees that bore all manner of fruit and the leaves of the trees were good for medicine with the fruit of these trees they were also much delighted and the leaves they ate to prevent illness especially such diseases that come to those that heat their blood by travels on either side of the river was also a meadow curiously beautified with lilies and it was green all the year long in this meadow they lay down and slept for here they might lie down safely when they awoke they gathered again of the fruit of the trees and drank again of the water of the river and they lay down again to sleep this they did several days and nights then they sang    behold ye how these crystal streams do glide   to comfort pilgrims by the highwayside   the meadows green besides their fragrant smell   yield dainties for them and he who can tell   what pleasant fruit yea leaves these trees do yield   will soon sell all that he may buy this field  so when they were disposed to go on for they were not as yet at their journeys end they ate and drank and departed  now i beheld in my dream that they had not journeyed far but the river and the way for a time parted at which they were not a little sorry yet they durst not go out of the way now the way from the river was rough and their feet tender by reason of their travels so the souls of the pilgrims were much discouraged because of the way wherefore still as they went on they wished for a better way now a little before them there was on the left hand of the road a meadow and a stile to go over into it and that meadow is called bypath meadow then said christian to his fellow if this meadow lieth along by our wayside lets go over it then he went to the stile to see and behold a path lay along by the way on the other side of the fence it is according to my wish said christian here is the easiest going come good hopeful and let us go over  hope but how if this path should lead us out of the way  sidenote vainconfidence  chris that is not likely said the other look doth it not go along by the wayside so hopeful being persuaded by his fellow went after him over the stile when they were gone over and were got into the path they found it very easy to their feet and withal they looking before them espied a man walking as they did and his name was vainconfidence so they called after him and asked him whither that way led he said to the celestial gate look said christian did not i tell you so by this you may see we are right so they followed and he went before them but behold the night came on and it grew very dark so that they that were behind lost sight of him that went before he therefore that went before vainconfidence by name not seeing the way before him fell into a deep pit which was on purpose there made by the prince of those grounds to catch careless fools withal and was dashed in pieces with his fall  now christian and his fellow heard him fall so they called to know the matter but there was none to answer only they heard a groaning then said hopeful where are we now then was his fellow silent as mistrusting that he had led him out of the way and now it began to rain and thunder and lighten in a most dreadful manner and the water rose amain  then hopeful groaned in himself saying oh that i had kept on my way  chris who could have thought that this path should have led us out of the way  hope i was afraid ont at the very first and therefore gave you that gentle caution i would have spoken plainer but that you are older than i  chris good brother be not offended i am very sorry i have brought thee out of the way and that i have put thee into such great danger pray my brother forgive me i did not do it of any evil intent  hope be comforted my brother for i forgive thee and believe too that this shall be for our good  chris i am glad i have with me a merciful brother but we must not stand still let us try to go back again  hope but good brother let me go before  chris no if you please let me go first that if there be any danger i may be first therein because by my means we are both gone out of the way  hope no you shall not go first for your mind being troubled may lead you out of the way again then for their encouragement they heard the voice of one saying let thine heart be towards the highway even the way that thou wentest turn again but by this time the waters were greatly risen by reason of which the way of going back was very dangerous then i thought that it is easier going out of the way when we are in than going in when we are out yet they undertook to go back but it was so dark and the flood so high that in their going back they had like to have been drowned nine or ten times  sidenote giant despair  neither could they with all the skill they had get again to the stile that night wherefore at last lighting under a little shelter they sat down there until daybreak but being weary they fell asleep now there was not far from the place where they lay a castle called doubting castle the owner whereof was giant despair and it was in his grounds they now were sleeping wherefore he getting up in the morning early and walking up and down in his fields caught christian and hopeful asleep in his grounds then with a grim and surly voice he bid them awake and asked them whence they were and what they did in his grounds they told him they were pilgrims and that they had lost their way then said the giant you have this night trespassed on me by trampling in and lying on my grounds and therefore you must go along with me so they were forced to go because he was stronger than they they had also but little to say for they knew themselves in fault the giant therefore drove them before him and put them into his castle into a very dark dungeon nasty and smelling vilely to the spirits of these two men here then they lay from wednesday morning till saturday night without one bit of bread or drop of drink or light or any to ask how they did they were therefore here in evil case and were far from friends and people whom they knew now in this place christian had double sorrow because it was through his thoughtless haste that they were brought into this distress  sidenote the pilgrims in a dungeon  now giant despair had a wife and her name was diffidence so when he was gone to bed he told his wife what he had done to wit that he had taken a couple of prisoners and cast them into his dungeon for trespassing on his grounds then he asked her also what he had best to do further to them so she asked him what they were whence they came and whither they were bound and he told her then she advised him that when he arose in the morning he should beat them without any mercy so when he arose he getteth him a grievous crabtree cudgel and goes down into the dungeon to them and there first fell to abusing them as if they were dogs although they never gave him a word of distaste then he falls upon them and beats them fearfully in such sort that they were not able to help themselves or to turn them upon the floor this done he withdraws and leaves them there to sorrow over their misery and to mourn under their distress so all that day they spent their time in nothing but sighs and bitter grief the next night she talking with her husband about them further and understanding that they were yet alive did advise him to tell them to make away with themselves so when morning was come he goes to them in a surly manner as before and perceiving them to be very sore with the stripes that he had given them the day before he told them that since they were never like to come out of that place their only way would be forthwith to make an end of themselves either with knife halter or poison for why said he should you choose life seeing it is attended with so much bitterness but they desired him to let them go with that he looked ugly upon them and rushing to them had doubtless made an end of them himself but that he fell into one of his fits for he sometimes in sunshiny weather fell into fits and lost for a time the use of his hands wherefore he withdrew and left them as before to consider what to do then did the prisoners consult between themselves whether it was best to take his advice or no and thus they began to discourse  chris brother said christian what shall we do the life we now live is miserable for my part i know not whether is best to live thus or to die out of hand my soul chooseth strangling rather than life and the grave is more easy for me than this dungeon shall we be ruled by the giant  sidenote hopeful cheers christian  hope indeed our present condition is dreadful and death would be far more welcome to me than thus for ever to abide but yet let us think the lord of the country to which we are going hath said thou shalt do no murder no not to another mans person much more then are we forbidden to take his advice to kill ourselves besides he that kills another can but commit murder upon his body but for one to kill himself is to kill body and soul at once and moreover my brother thou talkest of ease in the grave but hast thou forgotten the hell whither for certain the murderers go for no murderer hath eternal life and let us consider again that all the law is not in the hand of giant despair others so far as i can understand have been taken by him as well as we and yet have escaped out of his hand who knows but that god who made the world may cause that giant despair may die or that at some time or other he may forget to lock us in or that he may in a short time have another of his fits before us and he may lose the use of his limbs and if ever that should come to pass again for my part i am resolved to pluck up the heart of a man and try to my utmost to get from under his hand i was a fool that i did not try to do it before but however my brother let us be patient and endure awhile the time may come that may give us a happy release but let us not be our own murderers  with these words hopeful at present did calm the mind of his brother so they continued together in the dark that day in their sad and doleful condition  well towards evening the giant goes down into the dungeon again to see if his prisoners had taken his counsel but when he came there he found them alive and truly alive was all for now what for want of bread and water and by reason of the wounds they received when he beat them they could do little but breathe but i say he found them alive at which he fell into a grievous rage and told them that seeing they had disobeyed his counsel it should be worse with them than if they had never been born  at this they trembled greatly and i think that christian fell into a swoon but coming a little to himself again they renewed their discourse about the giants advice and whether yet they had best to take it or no now christian again seemed for doing it but hopeful made his second reply as followeth  hope my brother said he rememberest thou not how valiant thou hast been heretofore apollyon could not crush thee nor could all that thou didst hear or see or feel in the valley of the shadow of death what hardship terror and amazement hast thou already gone through and art thou now nothing but fear thou seest that i am in the dungeon with thee a far weaker man by nature than thou art also this giant has wounded me as well as thee and hath also cut off the bread and water from my mouth and with thee i mourn without the light but let us have a little more patience remember how thou showedst thyself the man at vanity fair and wast neither afraid of the chain nor cage nor yet of bloody death wherefore let us at least to avoid the shame that it becomes not a christian to be found in bear up with patience as well as we can  now night being come again and the giant and his wife being in bed she asked him concerning the prisoners and if they had taken his advice to which he replied they are sturdy rogues they choose rather to bear all hardship than to make away with themselves then said she take them unto the castleyard tomorrow and show them the bones and skulls of those that thou hast already killed and make them believe ere a week comes to an end thou wilt tear them also in pieces as thou hast done their fellows before them  so when the morning was come the giant goes to them again and takes them into the castleyard and shows them as his wife had bidden him these said he were pilgrims as you are once and they trespassed in my grounds as you have done and when i thought fit i tore them in pieces and so within ten days i will do you go get you down to your den again and with that he beat them all the way thither they lay therefore all day on saturday in a lamentable case as before now when night was come and when mrs diffidence and her husband the giant were got to bed they began to renew their talking of their prisoners and withal the old giant wondered that he could neither by his blows nor counsel bring them to an end and with that his wife replied i fear said she that they live in hope that some will come to relieve them or that they have picklocks about them by the means of which they hope to escape and sayest thou so my dear said the giant i will therefore search them in the morning  sidenote the pilgrims escape  well on saturday about midnight they began to pray and continued in prayer till almost break of day  now a little before it was day good christian as one half amazed brake out into this earnest speech what a fool quoth he am i to lie in a foulsmelling dungeon when i may as well walk at liberty i have a key in my bosom called promise that will i am sure open any lock in doubting castle then said hopeful that is good news good brother pluck it out of thy bosom and try  then christian pulled it out of his bosom and began to try at the dungeon door whose bolt as he turned the key gave back and the door flew open with ease and christian and hopeful both came out then he went to the outward door that leads into the castleyard and with his key opened that door also after he went to the iron gate for that must be opened too but that lock went exceedingly hard yet the key did open it then they thrust open the gate to make their escape with speed but that gate as it opened made such a creaking that it waked giant despair who hastily rising to pursue his prisoners felt his limbs to fail for his fits took him again so that he could by no means go after them then they went on and came to the kings highway again and so were safe because they were out of giant despairs rule  now when they were gone over the stile they began to contrive with themselves what they should do at that stile to prevent those that should come after from falling into the hands of giant despair so they agreed to build there a pillar and to engrave upon the side thereof this sentence over this stile is the way to doubting castle which is kept by giant despair who despiseth the king of the celestial country and seeks to destroy his holy pilgrims many therefore that followed after read what was written and escaped the danger this done they sang as follows    out of the way we went and then we found   what twas to tread upon forbidden ground   and let them that come after have a care   lest heedlessness make them as we to fare   lest they for trespassing his prisoners are   whose castles doubting and whose names despair     chapter viii  sidenote the delectable mountains   they went then till they came to the delectable5 mountains which mountains belong to the lord of that hill of which we have spoken before so they went up to the mountains to behold the gardens and orchards the vineyards and fountains of water where also they drank and washed themselves and did freely eat of the vineyards now there were on the tops of these mountains shepherds feeding their flocks and they stood by the highwayside the pilgrims therefore went to them and leaning upon their staves as is common with weary pilgrims when they stand to talk with any by the way they asked whose delightful mountains are these and whose be the sheep that feed upon them    5 this word means pleasant or delightful  shep these mountains are immanuels land and they are within sight of his city and the sheep also are his and he laid down his life for them  chris is this the way to the celestial city  shep you are just in your way  chris how far is it thither  shep too far for any but those who shall get thither indeed  chris is the way safe or dangerous  shep safe for those for whom it is to be safe but sinners shall fall therein  chris is there in this place any relief for pilgrims that are weary and faint in the way  shep the lord of these mountains hath given us a charge not to be forgetful to care for strangers therefore the good of the place is before you  i saw also in my dream that when the shepherds perceived that they were wayfaring men they also put questions to them to which they made answer as in other places as whence came you and how got you into the way and by what means have you so persevered therein for but few of them that begin to come hither do show their faces on these mountains but when the shepherds heard their answers being pleased therewith they looked very lovingly upon them and said welcome to the delectable mountains  the shepherds i say whose names were knowledge experience watchful and sincere took them by the hand and took them to their tents and made them partake of what was ready at present they said moreover we would that you should stay here awhile to be acquainted with us and yet more to cheer yourselves with the good of these delectable mountains they then told them that they were content to stay so they went to rest that night because it was very late  sidenote the shepherds conduct them  then i saw in my dream that in the morning the shepherds called up christian and hopeful to walk with them upon the mountains so they went forth with them and walked a while having a pleasant prospect on every side then said the shepherds one to another shall we show these pilgrims some wonders so when they had concluded to do it they had them first to the top of the hill called error which was very steep on the farthest side and bid them look down to the bottom so christian and hopeful looked down and saw at the bottom several men dashed all to pieces by a fall they had had from the top then said christian what meaneth this then the shepherds answered have you not heard of them that were made to err by hearkening to hymeneus and philetus as concerning the faith of the rising from the dead they answered yes then said the shepherds those you see lie dashed to pieces at the bottom of this mountain are they and they have continued to this day unburied as you see for an example to others to take heed how they clamber too high or how they come too near the brink of this mountain  then i saw that they had them to the top of another mountain and the name of that is caution and bid them look afar off and when they did they perceived as they thought several men walking up and down among the tombs that were there and they perceived that the men were blind because they stumbled sometimes upon the tombs and because they could not get out from among them then said christian what means this  the shepherds then answered did you not see a little below these mountains a stile that led into a meadow on the left hand side of this way they answered yes then said the shepherds from that stile there goes a path that leads directly to doubting castle which is kept by giant despair and these men pointing to them among the tombs came once on pilgrimage as you do now even until they came to that same stile and because the right way was rough in that place they chose to go out of it into that meadow and there were taken by giant despair and cast into doubting castle where after they had been kept a while in the dungeon he at last did put out their eyes and led them among those tombs where he has left them to wander to this very day that the saying of the wise man might be fulfilled he that wandereth out of the way of knowledge shall remain in the congregation of the dead then christian and hopeful looked upon one another with tears gushing out but yet said nothing to the shepherds  then i saw in my dream that the shepherds had them to another place in a bottom where was a door on the side of a hill and they opened the door and bid them look in they looked in therefore and saw that within it was very dark and smoky they also thought that they heard there a rumbling noise as of fire and a cry of some tormented and that they smelt the scent of brimstone then said christian what means this the shepherds told them this is a byway to hell a way that hypocrites go in at namely such as sell their birthright with esau such as sell their master with judas such as blaspheme the gospel with alexander and that lie and deceive with ananias and sapphira his wife  hope then said hopeful to the shepherds i perceive that these had on them even every one a show of pilgrimage as we have now had they not  shep yes and held it a long time too  hope how far might they go on in pilgrimage in their day since they notwithstanding were thus miserably cast away  shep some farther and some not so far as these mountains  then said the pilgrims one to another we have need to cry to the strong for strength  shep ay and you will have need to use it when you have it too  sidenote gate of the celestial city  by this time the pilgrims had a desire to go forward and the shepherds a desire they should so they walked together towards the end of the mountains then said the shepherds one to another let us here show to the pilgrims the gate of the celestial city if they have skill to look through our perspective glass6 the pilgrims then lovingly accepted the motion so they had them to the top of a high hill called clear and gave them their glass to look    6 perspective glass is an old name for a telescope or spyglass  then they tried to look but the remembrance of that last thing that the shepherds had showed them made their hands shake by means of which hindrance they could not look steadily through the glass yet they thought they saw something like the gate and also some of the glory of the place thus they went away and sang this song    thus by the shepherds secrets are revealed   which from all other men are kept concealed   come to the shepherds then if you would see   things deep things hid and that mysterious be  when they were about to depart one of the shepherds gave them a note of the way another of them bid them beware of the flatterer the third bid them take heed that they slept not upon the enchanted ground and the fourth bid them god speed  so i awoke from my dream     chapter ix  sidenote they overtake ignorance   and i slept and dreamed again and saw the same two pilgrims going down the mountains along the highway towards the city now a little below these mountains on the left hand lieth the country of conceit from which country there comes into the way in which the pilgrims walked a little crooked lane here therefore they met with a very brisk lad that came out of that country and his name was ignorance so christian asked him from what parts he came and whither he was going  ignor sir i was born in the country that lieth off there a little on the left hand and i am going to the celestial city  chris but how do you think to get in at the gate for you may find some difficulty there  ignor as other people do  chris but what have you to show at the gate that may cause that the gate should be opened to you  ignor i know my lords will and have been a good liver i pay every man his own i pray fast pay money to the church and give to the poor and have left my country for whither i am going  chris but thou camest not in at the wicketgate that is at the head of this way thou camest in hither through that same crooked lane and therefore i fear however thou mayest think of thyself when the reckoning day shall come thou wilt have laid to thy charge that thou art a thief and a robber instead of getting admittance into the city  ignor gentlemen ye be utter strangers to me i know you not be content to follow the custom of your country and i will follow the custom of mine i hope all will be well and as for the gate that you talk of all the world knows that that is a great way off of our country i cannot think that any man in all our parts doth so much as know the way to it nor need they matter whether they do or no since we have as you see a fine pleasant green lane that comes down from our country the next way into the way  when christian saw that the man was wise in his own opinion he said to hopeful whisperingly there is more hope of a fool than of him and said moreover when he that is a fool walketh by the way his wisdom faileth him and he saith to every one that he is a fool what shall we talk further with him or outgo him at present and so leave him to think of what he hath heard already and then stop again for him afterwards and see if by degrees we can do any good to him  then said hopeful    let ignorance a little while now muse   on what is said and let him not refuse   good counsel to embrace lest he remain   still ignorant of whats the chiefest gain   god saith those that no understanding have   although he made them them he will not save  hope he further added it is not good i think to say all to him at once let us pass him by if you will and talk to him by and by even as he is able to bear it  so they both went on and ignorance he came after now when they had passed him a little way they entered into a very dark lane where they met a man whom seven devils had bound with seven strong cords and were carrying of him back to the door that they saw on the side of the hill now good christian began to tremble and so did hopeful his companion yet as the devils led away the man christian looked to see if he knew him and he thought it might be one turnaway that dwelt in the town of apostasy but he did not perfectly see his face for he did hang his head like a thief that is found but being gone past hopeful looked after him and espied on his back a paper with this inscription one who was wicked while claiming to be good and turned away from god  sidenote three sturdy rogues  then said christian to his fellow now i call to remembrance that which was told of a thing that happened to a good man hereabout the name of that man was littlefaith but a good man and dwelt in the town of sincere the thing was this at the entering in at this passage there comes down from broadway gate a lane called dead mans lane socalled because of the murders that are commonly done there and this littlefaith going on pilgrimage as we do now chanced to sit down there and slept now there happened at that time to come down that lane from broadway gate three sturdy rogues and their names were faintheart mistrust and guilt three brothers and they espying littlefaith where he was came galloping up with speed now the good man was just awaked from his sleep and was getting up to go on his journey so they came up all to him and with threatening language bid him stand at this littlefaith looked as white as a sheet and had neither power to fight nor fly then said faintheart deliver thy purse but he making no haste to do it for he was loth to lose his money mistrust ran up to him and thrusting his hand into his pocket pulled out thence a bag of silver then he cried out thieves thieves with that guilt with a great club that was in his hand struck littlefaith on the head and with that blow felled him flat to the ground where he lay bleeding as one that would bleed to death all this while the thieves stood by but at last they hearing that some were upon the road and fearing lest it should be one greatgrace that dwells in the city of goodconfidence they betook themselves to their heels and left this good man to shift for himself now after a while littlefaith came to himself and getting up made shift to scramble on his way this was the story  hope but did they take from him all that ever he had  chris no the place where his jewels were they never ransacked so those he kept still but as i was told the good man was much afflicted for his loss for the thieves got most of his spending money that which they got not as i said were jewels also he had a little odd money left but scarce enough to bring him to his journeys end nay if i was not misinformed he was forced to beg as he went to keep himself alive for his jewels he might not sell but beg and do what he could he went as we say often with a hungry stomach the most part of the rest of the way  hope but is it not a wonder they got not from him his certificate by which he was to receive admission at the celestial gate  chris it is a wonder but they got not that though they missed it not through any cunning of his for he being dismayed by their coming upon him had neither power nor skill to hide anything so it was more by good providence than by his endeavor that they missed of that good thing  hope but it must needs be a comfort to him that they got not his jewels from him  chris it might have been great comfort to him had he used it as he should but they that told me the story said that he made but little use of it all the rest of the way and that because of the alarm that he had in their taking away his money indeed he forgot it a great part of the rest of his journey and besides when at any time it came into his mind and he began to be comforted therewith then would fresh thoughts of his loss come again upon him and those thoughts would swallow up all  sidenote hopeful rebuked  hope alas poor man this could not but be a great grief unto him  chris grief ay a grief indeed would it not have been so to any of us had we been used as he to be robbed and wounded too and that in a strange place as he was it is a wonder he did not die with grief poor heart i was told that he scattered almost all the rest of the way with nothing but doleful and bitter complaints telling also to all that overtook him or that he overtook in the way as he went where he was robbed and how who they were that did it and what he had lost how he was wounded and that he hardly escaped with life  hope but it is a wonder that his necessities did not put him upon selling or pawning some of his jewels that he might have wherewith to relieve himself in his journey  chris thou talkest like one whose head is thick to this very day for what should he pawn them or to whom should he sell them in all that country where he was robbed his jewels were not accounted of nor did he want that relief which could from thence be administered to him besides had his jewels been missing at the gate of the celestial city he had and that he knew well enough been shut out from an inheritance there and that would have been worse to him than the coming and villany of ten thousand thieves  hope but christian these three fellows i am persuaded in my heart are but a company of cowards would they have run else think you as they did at the noise of one that was coming on the road why did not littlefaith pluck up a greater heart he might methinks have stood one brush with them and have yielded when there had been no remedy  chris that they are cowards many have said but few have found it so in the time of trial as for a great heart littlefaith had none and i perceive by thee my brother hadst thou been the man concerned thou art but for a brush and then to yield and verily since this is the height of thy courage now they are at a distance from us should they appear to thee as they did to him they might put thee to second thoughts but consider again they are but journeymenthieves they serve under the king of the bottomless pit who if need be will come in to their aid himself and his voice is as the roaring of a lion i myself have been engaged as this littlefaith was and i found it a terrible thing these three villains set upon me and i beginning like a christian to resist they gave but a call and in came their master i would as the saying is have given my life for a penny but that as god would have it i was clothed with armor of proof ay and yet though i was so protected i found it hard work to quit myself like a man no man can tell what in that combat attends us but he that hath been in the battle himself  sidenote littlefaith and greatgrace  hope well but they ran you see when they did but suppose that one greatgrace was in the way  chris true they have often fled both they and their master when greatgrace hath but appeared and no marvel for he is the kings champion but i trow you will put some difference between littlefaith and the kings champion all the kings subjects are not his champions nor can they when tried do such feats of war as he is it meet to think that a little child should handle goliath as david did or that there should be the strength of an ox in a wren some are strong some are weak some have great faith some have little this man was one of the weak and therefore he went to the wall  hope i would it had been greatgrace for their sakes  chris if it had been he he might have had his hands full for i must tell you that though greatgrace is excellent good at his weapons and has and can so long as he keeps them at swords point do well enough with them yet if they get within him even faintheart mistrust or the other it shall go hard but they will throw up his heels and when a man is down you know what can he do  whoso looks well upon greatgraces face will see those scars and cuts there that shall easily give proof of what i say yea once i heard that he should say and that when he was in the combat we despaired even of life how did these sturdy rogues and their fellows make david groan mourn and roar yea heman and hezekiah too though champions in their days were forced to bestir when by these attacked and yet notwithstanding they had their coats soundly brushed by them peter upon a time would go try what he could do but though some do say of him that he is the prince of the apostles they handled him so that they made him at last afraid of a sorry girl  sidenote littlefaith among thieves  besides their king is at their whistlehe is never out of hearing and if at any time they be put to the worst he if possible comes in to help them and of him it is said the sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold the spear the dart nor the habergeon he esteemeth iron as straw and brass as rotten wood the arrow cannot make him flee slingstones are turned with him into stubble darts are counted as stubble he laugheth at the shaking of a spear what can a man do in this case it is true if a man could at every turn have jobs horse and had skill and courage to ride him he might do notable things for his neck is clothed with thunder he will not be afraid as the grasshopper the glory of his nostrils is terrible he paweth in the valley and rejoiceth in his strength he goeth on to meet the armed men he mocketh at fear and is not affrighted neither turneth he his back from the sword the quiver rattleth against him the glittering spear and the shield he swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet he saith among the trumpets ha ha and he smelleth the battle afar off the thunder of the captains and the shouting  but for such footmen as thee and i are let us never desire to meet with an enemy nor vaunt as if we could do better when we hear of others that have been foiled nor be tickled at the thoughts of our manhood for such commonly come by the worst when tried witness peter of whom i made mention before he would swagger ay he would he would as his vain mind prompted him to say do better and stand more for his master than all men but who so foiled and run down by those villains as he  then christian sang    poor littlefaith hast been among the thieves   wast robbed remember this whoso believes   and gets more faith shall then a victor be   over ten thousand else scarce over three  so they went on and ignorance followed they went then till they came to a place where they saw a way put itself into their way and seemed withal to lie as straight as the way which they should go and here they knew not which of the two to take for both seemed straight before them therefore here they stood still to consider and as they were thinking about the way behold a man black of flesh but covered with a very light robe came to them and asked them why they stood there they answered they were going to the celestial city but knew not which of these ways to take follow me said the man it is thither that i am going so they followed him to the way that but now came into the road which by degrees turned and turned them so from the city that they desired to go to that in a little time their faces were turned away from it yet they followed him but byandby before they were aware he led them both within the folds of a net in which they were both so entangled that they knew not what to do and with that the white robe fell off the black mans back then they saw where they were wherefore there they lay crying some time for they could not get themselves out  chris then said christian to his fellow now do i see myself in an error did not the shepherds bid us beware of flatterers as is the saying of the wise man so we have found it this day a man that flattereth his neighbor spreadeth a net at his feet  sidenote a shining one appears  hope they also gave us a note of directions about the way for our more sure finding thereof but therein we have also forgotten to read and have not kept ourselves from the paths of the destroyer thus they lay bewailing themselves in the net at last they espied a shining one coming towards them with a whip of small cord in his hand when he was come to the place where they were he asked them whence they came and what they did there they told him that they were poor pilgrims going to zion but were led out of their way by a black man clothed in white who bid us said they follow him for he was going thither too then said he with the whip it is flatterer a false prophet that hath changed himself into an angel of light so he rent the net and let the men out then said he to them follow me that i may set you in your way again so he led them back to the way which they had left to follow the flatterer then he asked them saying where did you lie the last night they said with the shepherds upon the delectable mountains he asked them then if they had not of those shepherds a note of direction for the way they answered yes but did you not said he when you were at a stand pluck out and read your note they answered no he asked them why they said they forgot he asked them moreover if the shepherds did not bid them beware of the flatterer they answered yes but we did not imagine said they that this finespoken man had been he  then i saw in my dream that he commanded them to lie down which when they did he whipped them sore to teach them the good way wherein they should walk and as he whipped them he said as many as i love i rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent this done he bid them go on their way and take good heed to the other directions of the shepherds so they thanked him for all his kindness and went softly along the right way singing    come hither you that walk along the way   see how the pilgrims fare that go astray   they catchèd are in an entangling net   cause they good counsel lightly did forget   tis true they rescued were but yet you see   theyre scourged to boot let this your caution be  now after awhile they perceived afar off one coming softly and alone all along the highway to meet them then said christian to his fellow yonder is a man with his back towards zion and he is coming to meet us  hope i see him let us take heed to ourselves lest he should prove a flatterer also  sidenote they meet atheist  so he drew nearer and nearer and at last came up to them his name was atheist7 and he asked them whither they were going    7 an atheist is one who does not believe that there is a god  chris we are going to mount zion  then atheist fell into a very great laughter  chris what is the meaning of your laughter  atheist i laugh to see what ignorant persons you are to take upon yourselves so tedious a journey and yet are like to have nothing but your travel for your pains  illustration atheist laughing at christian and hopeful                                    page 170  chris why man do you think we shall not be received  atheist received there is no such a place as you dream of in all this world  chris but there is in the world to come  atheist when i was at home in mine own country i heard as you now affirm and from that hearing went out to see and have been seeking this city these twenty years but find no more of it than i did the first day i set out  chris we have both heard and believe that there is such a place to be found  atheist had not i when at home believed i had not come thus far to seek but finding none and yet i should had there been such a place to be found for i have gone to seek it farther than you i am going back again and will seek to refresh myself with the things that i then cast away for hopes of that which i now see is not  chris then said christian to hopeful his fellow is it true which this man hath said  hope take heed he is one of the flatterers remember what it hath cost us once already for hearkening to such kind of fellows what no mount zion did we not see from the delectable mountains the gate of the city also are we not now to walk by faith let us go on lest the man with the whip overtake us again i say my brother cease to hear him and let us believe to the saving of the soul  chris my brother i did not put the question to thee for that i doubted of the truth of our belief myself but to prove thee and to fetch from thee a fruit of the honesty of thy heart as for this man i know that he is blinded let thee and me go on knowing that we have belief of the truth and no lie is of the truth  hope now do i rejoice in hope of the glory of god  so they turned away from the man and he laughing at them went his way  i then saw in my dream that they went till they came into a certain country whose air naturally tended to make one drowsy if he came a stranger into it and here hopeful began to be very dull and heavy of sleep wherefore he said unto christian i do now begin to grow so drowsy that i can scarcely hold up mine eyes let us lie down here and take one nap  chris by no means said the other lest sleeping we never awake more  hope why my brother sleep is sweet to the laboring man we may be refreshed if we take a nap  chris do not you remember that one of the shepherds bid us beware of the enchanted ground he meant by that that we should beware of sleeping wherefore let us not sleep as others but let us watch and be sober  hope i acknowledge myself in fault and had i been here alone i had by sleeping run the danger of death i see it is true that the wise man saith two are better than one hitherto hath thy company been my help and thou shalt have a good reward for thy labor  chris now then said christian to prevent drowsiness in this place let us talk about something profitable  hope with all my heart  sidenote hopeful narrates conversion  chris where shall we begin  hope where god began with us but do you begin if you please  chris i will sing you first this song    when saints do sleepy grow let them come hither   and hear how these two pilgrims talk together   yea let them learn of them in any wise   thus to keep ope their drowsy slumbering eyes   saints fellowship if it be managed well   keeps them awake and that in spite of hell  chris then christian began and said i will ask you a question how came you to think at first of doing as you do now  hope do you mean how came i at first to look after the good of my soul  chris yes that is my meaning  hope i continued a great while in the delight of those things which were seen and sold at our fair things which i believe now would have had i continued in them still drowned me in ruin and destruction  chris what things were they  hope all the treasures and riches of the world also i delighted much in rioting revelling drinking swearing lying uncleanness sabbathbreaking and what not that tended to destroy the soul but i found at last by hearing and considering of things that are holy which indeed i heard of you as also of beloved faithful that was put to death for his faith and good living in vanity fair that the end of these things is death and that for these things sake the wrath of god cometh upon those who disobey him  chris and did you presently fall under the power of this feeling  hope no i was not willing presently to know the evil of sin nor the destruction that follows upon the doing of it but tried when my mind at first began to be shaken with the word to shut mine eyes against the light thereof  chris but what was the cause of your waiting so long  hope the causes werefirstly i was ignorant that this was the work of god upon me secondly sin was yet very sweet to my flesh and i was loth to leave it thirdly i could not tell how to part with mine old companions their presence and actions were so desirable unto me fourthly the hours in which these feelings were upon me were such troublesome and such heartaffrighting hours that i could not bear no not so much as the remembrance of them upon my heart  chris then as it seems sometimes you got rid of your trouble  hope yes verily but it would come into my mind again and then i should be as bad nay worse than i was before  chris why what was it that brought your sins to mind again  hope many things as    1 if i did but meet a good man in the streets or    2 if i have heard any read in the bible or    3 if mine head did begin to ache or    4 if i were told that some of my neighbors   were sick or    5 if i heard the bell toll for some that were   dead or    6 if i thought of dying myself or    7 if i heard that sudden death happened to   others    8 but especially when i thought of myself that   i must quickly come to judgment  chris and could you at any time with ease get off the guilt of sin when by any of these ways it came upon you  hope no not i for then they got faster hold of my conscience and then if i did but think of going back to sin though my mind was turned against it it would be double torment to me  chris and how did you do then  hope i thought i must endeavor to mend my life for else thought i i am sure to be lost forever  chris and did you endeavor to mend  hope yes and fled from not only my sins but sinful company too and betook me to religious duties as praying reading weeping for sin speaking truth to my neighbors etc these things did i with many others too much here to tell  chris and did you think yourself well then  hope yes for a while but at the last my trouble came tumbling upon me again and that over the neck of all my trying to do right  chris how came that about since you were now doing right as far as you knew  hope there were several things brought it upon me especially such sayings as these all our righteousness are as filthy rags by the works of the law shall no flesh be made righteous when ye shall have done all those things which are commanded you say we are unprofitable with many more such like from whence i began to reason with myself thus if all my righteousness are filthy rags if by the deeds of the law no man can be made righteous and if when we have done all we are yet unprofitable then it is but a folly to think of heaven by the law i further thought thus if a man runs a hundred pounds into the shopkeepers debt and after that shall pay for all that he shall buy yet his old debt stands still in the book uncrossed for the which the shopkeeper may sue him and cast him into prison till he shall pay the debt  chris well and how did you apply this to yourself  hope why i thought thus with myself i have by my sins run a great way into gods book and my now reforming will not pay off that score therefore i should think still under all my present trying but how shall i be freed from that punishment that i have brought myself in danger of by my former sins  chris a very good application but pray go on  hope another thing that hath troubled me ever since my late turning from sin is that if i look narrowly into the best of what i do now i still see sin new sin mixing itself with the best of that i do so that now i am forced to conclude that notwithstanding my former fond opinion of myself and duties i have committed sin enough in one duty to send me to hell though my former life had been faultless  chris and what did you do then  hope do i could not tell what to do till i brake my mind to faithful for he and i were well acquainted and he told me that unless i could obtain the righteousness of a man that never had sinned neither mine own nor all the righteousness of the world could save me  chris and did you think he spake true  hope had he told me so when i was pleased and satisfied with mine own trying i had called him fool for his pains but now since i see mine own weakness and the sin which cleaves to my best performance i have been forced to be of his opinion  chris but did you think when at first he suggested it to you that there was such a man to be found of whom it might justly be said that he never committed sin  hope i must confess the words at first sounded strangely but after a little more talk and company with him i had full certainty about it  chris and did you ask him what man this was and how you must be made righteous by him  hope yes and he told me it was the lord jesus that dwelleth on the right hand of the most high and thus said he you must be made right by him even by trusting what he hath done by himself in the days of his flesh and suffered when he did hang on the tree i asked him further how that mans righteousness could be of that power to help another before god and he told me he was the mighty god and did what he did and died the death also not for himself but for me to whom his doings and the worthiness of them should be given if i believed on him  chris and what did you do then  hope i made my objections against my believing for that i thought he was not willing to save me  chris and what said faithful to you then  hope he bid me go to him and see then i said it was too much for me to ask for but he said no for i was invited to come then he gave me a book of jesus own writing to encourage me the more freely to come and he said concerning that book that every word and letter thereof stood firmer than heaven and earth then i asked him what i must do when i came and he told me i must entreat on my knees with all my heart and soul the father to reveal him to me then i asked him further how i must make my prayer to him and he said go and thou shalt find him upon a mercyseat where he sits all the year long to give pardon and forgiveness to them that come i told him that i knew not what to say when i came and he bid me say to this effect god be merciful to me a sinner and make me to know and believe in jesus christ for i see that if his righteousness had not been or i have not faith in that righteousness i am utterly cast away lord i have heard that thou art a merciful god and hast given that thy son jesus christ should be the saviour of the world and moreover that thou art willing to bestow him upon such a poor sinner as i am and i am a sinner indeed lord take therefore this opportunity and show thy grace in the salvation of my soul through thy son jesus christ amen  chris and did you do as you were bidden  hope yes over and over and over  chris and did the father show his son to you  hope not at the first nor second nor third nor fourth nor fifth no nor at the sixth time neither  chris what did you do then  hope what why i could not tell what to do  chris had you no thoughts of leaving off praying  hope yes a hundred times twice told  chris and what was the reason you did not  hope i believed that that was true which had been told me to wit that without the righteousness of this christ all the world could not save me and therefore thought i with myself if i leave off i die and i can but die at the throne of grace and withal this came into my mind though it tarry wait for it because it will surely come it will not tarry so i continued praying until the father showed me his son  chris and how was he shown unto you  hope i did not see him with my bodily eyes but with the eyes of my heart and thus it was one day i was very sad i think sadder than at any one time in my life and this sadness was through a fresh sight of the greatness and vileness of my sins and as i was then looking for nothing but hell and the everlasting loss of my soul suddenly as i thought i saw the lord jesus look down from heaven upon me and saying believe on the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved  but i replied lord i am a great a very great sinner and he answered my grace is sufficient for thee then i said but lord what is believing and then i saw from that saying he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst that believing and coming was all one and that he that came that is ran out in his heart and desire after salvation by christ he indeed believed in christ then the water stood in mine eyes and i asked further but lord may such a great sinner as i am be indeed accepted of thee and be saved by thee and i heard him say and him that cometh to me i will in no wise cast out then said i but how lord must i consider of thee in my coming to thee that my faith may be placed aright upon thee then he said christ jesus came into the world to save sinners he is the end of the law for righteousness to every one that believes he died for our sins and rose again for our righteousness he loved us and washed us from our sins in his own blood he is mediator between god and us he ever liveth to plead for us from all which i gathered that i must look for righteousness in his person and for satisfaction for my sins by his blood that what he did in obedience to his fathers law and in submitting to the penalty thereof was not for himself but for him that will accept it for his salvation and be thankful and now was my heart full of joy mine eyes full of tears and mine affections running over with love to the name people and ways of jesus christ  chris this was a revelation of christ to your soul indeed but tell me particularly what effect this had upon your spirit  hope it made me see that all the world notwithstanding all the righteousness thereof is in a state of condemnation it made me see that god the father though he be just can justly forgive the coming sinner it made me greatly ashamed of the vileness of my former life and confounded me with the sense of my own ignorance for there never came thought into my heart before now that showed me so the beauty of jesus christ it made me love a holy life and long to do something for the honor and glory of the name of the lord jesus yea i thought that had i now a thousand gallons of blood in my body i could spill it all for the sake of the lord jesus     chapter x   i saw then in my dream that hopeful looked back and saw ignorance whom they had left behind coming after look said he to christian how far yonder youngster loitereth behind  chris ay ay i see him he careth not for our company  hope but i think it would not have hurt him had he kept pace with us hitherto  chris that is true but i warrant you he thinks otherwise  hope that i think he doth but however let us tarry for him so they did  chris then christian said to him come away man why do you stay so behind  ignor i take my pleasure in walking alone even more a great deal than in company unless i like it the better  then said christian to hopeful but softly did i not tell you he cared not for our company but however said he come up and let us talk away the time in this solitary place then directing his speech to ignorance he said come how do you how stands it between god and your soul now  ignor i hope well for i am always full of good thoughts that come into my mind to comfort me as i walk  chris what good motions pray tell us  ignor why i think of god and heaven  chris so do the devils and lost souls  ignor but i think of them and desire them  chris so do many that are never like to come there the soul of the sluggard desireth and hath nothing  ignor but i think of them and leave all for them  chris that i doubt for leaving of all is a very hard matter yea a harder matter than many are aware of but why or by what art thou persuaded that thou hast left all for god and heaven  ignor my heart tells me so  chris the wise man says he that trusteth in his own heart is a fool  ignor this is spoken of an evil heart but mine is a good one  chris but how dost thou prove that  ignor it comforts me in the hopes of heaven  chris that may be through its deceitfulness for a mans heart may minister comfort to him in the hopes of that thing for which he has yet no ground to hope  ignor but my heart and life agree together and therefore my hope is well grounded  chris who told thee that thy heart and life agree together  ignor my heart tells me so  chris ask my fellow if i be a thief thy heart tells thee so except the word of god telleth thee in this matter other testimony is of no value  ignor but is it not a good heart that hath good thoughts and is not that a good life that is according to gods commandments  chris yes that is a good heart that hath good thoughts and that is a good life that is according to gods commandments but it is one thing indeed to have these and another thing only to think so  ignor pray what count you good thoughts and a life according to gods commandments  chris there are good thoughts of many kinds some respecting ourselves some god some christ and some other things  ignor you go so fast i cannot keep pace with you do you go on before i must stay awhile behind  then they said    well ignorance wilt thou yet foolish be   to slight good counsel ten times given thee   and if thou yet refuse it thou shalt know   ere long the evil of thy doing so   remember man in time stoop do not fear   good counsel taken well saves therefore hear   but if thou yet shalt slight it thou wilt be   the loser ignorance ill warrant thee  then christian addressed himself thus to his fellow  chris well come my good hopeful i perceive that thou and i must walk by ourselves again  sidenote the two pilgrims proceed  so i saw in my dream that they went on apace before and ignorance he came hobbling after then said christian to his companion it pities me much for this poor man it will certainly go ill with him at last  hope alas there are abundance in our town in his condition whole families yea whole streets and that of pilgrims too and if there be so many in our parts how many think you must there be in the place where he was born  chris indeed the word saith he hath blinded their eyes lest they should see  hope well said i believe you have said the truth are we now almost got past the enchanted ground  chris why art thou weary of our talking  hope no verily but that i would know where we are  chris we have not now above two miles farther to go thereon well we will leave at this time our neighbor ignorance by himself and fall upon another subject  hope with all my heart but you shall still begin  chris well then did you not know about ten years ago one temporary in your parts who was a forward man in religion then  hope know him yes he dwelt in graceless a town about two miles off of honesty and he dwelt next door to one turnback  chris right he dwelt under the same roof with him well that man was much awakened once i believe that then he had some sight of his sins and of the punishment that was due thereto  hope i am of your mind for my house not being above three miles from him he would ofttimes come to me and that with many tears truly i pitied the man and was not altogether without hope of him but one may see it is not every one that cries lord lord  chris he told me once that he was resolved to go on pilgrimage as we do now but all of a sudden he grew acquainted with one saveself and then he became a stranger to me for at that time he gave up going on pilgrimage     chapter xi  sidenote beulah land   now i saw in my dream that by this time the pilgrims were got over the enchanted ground and entering into the country of beulah whose air was very sweet and pleasant the way lying directly through it they enjoyed themselves there for a season yea here they heard continually the singing of birds and saw every day the flowers appear on the earth and heard the voice of the turtle in the land in this country the sun shineth night and day wherefore this was beyond the valley of the shadow of death and also out of the reach of giant despair neither could they from this place so much as see doubting castle here they were within sight of the city they were going to also here met them some of the inhabitants thereof for in this land the shining ones commonly walked because it was upon the borders of heaven here they had no want of corn and wine for in this place they met with abundance of what they had sought for in all their pilgrimage here they heard voices from out of the city loud voices saying say ye to the daughter of zion behold thy salvation cometh behold his reward is with him here all the inhabitants of the country called them the holy people and redeemed of the lord sought out etc  now as they walked in this land they had more rejoicing than in parts more remote from the kingdom to which they were bound and drawing near to the city they had yet a more perfect view thereof it was builded of pearls and precious stones also the streets thereof were paved with gold so that by reason of the natural glory of the city and the reflection of the sunbeams upon it christian with desire fell sick hopeful also had a fit or two of the same disease wherefore here they lay by it awhile crying out because of their pangs if you see my beloved tell him that i am sick of love  but being a little strengthened and better able to bear their sickness they walked on their way and came yet nearer and nearer where were orchards vineyards and gardens and their gates opened into the highway now as they came up to these places behold the gardener stood in the way to whom the pilgrims said whose goodly vineyards and gardens are these he answered they are the kings and are planted here for his own delight and also for the solace of pilgrims so the gardener had them into the vineyards and bid them refresh themselves with the dainties he also showed them there the kings walks and the arbors where he delighted to be and here they tarried and slept  now i beheld in my dream that they talked more in their sleep at this time than ever they did in all their journey and being in thought thereabout the gardener said even to me wherefore dost thou meditate at the matter it is the nature of the fruit of the grapes of these vineyards to go down so sweetly as to cause the lips of them that are asleep to speak  so i saw when they awoke they undertook to go up to the city but as i said the reflection of the sun upon the city for the city was pure gold was so extremely glorious that they could not as yet with open face behold it but through a glass made for that purpose so i saw that as they went on there met them two men in raiment that shone like gold also their faces shone as the light  these men asked the pilgrims whence they came and they told them they also asked them where they had lodged what difficulties and dangers what comforts and pleasures they had met in the way and they told them then said the men that met them you have but two difficulties more to meet with and then you are in the city  christian then and his companion asked the men to go along with them so they told them that they would but said they you must obtain it by your own faith so i saw in my dream that they went on together till they came in sight of the gate  sidenote a river intervenes  now i further saw that betwixt them and the gate was a river but there was no bridge to go over and the river was very deep at the sight therefore of this river the pilgrims were much stunned but the men that went with them said you must go through or you cannot come at the gate  the pilgrims then began to inquire if there was no other way to the gate to which they answered yes but there hath not any save two to wit enoch and elijah been permitted to tread that path since the foundation of the world nor shall until the last trumpet shall sound the pilgrims then especially christian began to be anxious in his mind and looked this way and that but no way could be found by them by which they might escape the river then they asked the men if the waters were all of a depth they said no yet they could not help them in that case for said they you shall find it deeper or shallower as you believe in the king of the place  they then addressed themselves to the water and entering christian began to sink and crying out to his good friend hopeful he said i sink in deep waters the billows go over my head all his waves go over me  then said the other be of good cheer my brother i feel the bottom and it is good then said christian ah my friend the sorrows of death have compassed me about i shall not see the land that flows with milk and honey and with that a great darkness and horror fell upon christian so that he could not see before him also here he in a great measure lost his senses so that he could neither remember nor orderly talk of any of those sweet refreshments that he had met with in the way of his pilgrimage but all the words that he spake still tended to show that he had horror of mind and heartfears that he should die in that river and never obtain entrance in at the gate here also as they that stood by perceived he was much in the troublesome thoughts of the sins that he had committed both since and before he began to be a pilgrim it was also observed that he was troubled with the sight of demons and evil spirits for ever and anon he would intimate so much by words  hopeful therefore here had much ado to keep his brothers head above water yea sometimes he would be quite gone down and then ere a while he would rise up again half dead hopeful would also endeavor to comfort him saying brother i see the gate and men standing by to receive us but christian would answer it is you it is you they wait for you have been hopeful ever since i knew you and so have you said he to christian ah brother said he surely if i were right he would now arise to help me but for my sins he hath brought me into this snare and hath left me then said hopeful my brother these troubles and distresses that you go through in these waters are no sign that god hath forsaken you but are sent to try you whether you will call to mind that which hitherto you have received of his goodness and live upon him in your distresses  then i saw in my dream that christian was in thought awhile to whom also hopeful added these words be of good cheer jesus christ maketh thee whole and with that christian brake out with a loud voice oh i see him again and he tells me when thou passest through the waters i will be with thee and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee then they both took courage and the enemy was after that as still as a stone until they were gone over christian therefore presently found ground to stand upon and so it followed that the rest of the river was but shallow thus they got over  sidenote two shining men  now upon the bank of the river on the other side they saw the two shining men again who there waited for them wherefore being come out of the river they saluted them saying we are heavenly spirits sent forth to help those that shall be heirs of salvation thus they went along towards the gate now you must note that the city stood upon a mighty hill but the pilgrims went up that hill with ease because they had these two men to lead them up by the arms also they had left their mortal garments behind them in the river for though they went in with them they came out without them they therefore went up here with much activity and speed though the foundation upon which the city was framed was higher than the clouds they therefore went up through the regions of the air sweetly talking as they went being comforted because they had safely got over the river and had such glorious companions to attend them  sidenote mount zion  the talk they had with the shining ones was about the glory of the place who told them that the beauty and glory of it were such as could not be put into words there said they is the mount zion the heavenly jerusalem the innumerable company of angels and the spirits of good men made perfect you are going now said they to the paradise of god wherein you shall see the tree of life and eat of the neverfading fruits thereof and when you come there you shall have white robes given you and your walk and talk shall be every day with the king even all the days of an eternal life there you shall not see again such things as you saw when you were in the lower region upon the earth to wit sorrow sickness affliction and death for the former things are passed away you are going now to abraham to isaac and to jacob and to the prophets men that god hath taken away from the evil to come and that are now resting upon their beds each one walking in his righteousness the men then asked what must we do in the holy place to whom it was answered you must there receive the comfort of all your toil and have joy for all your sorrow you must reap what you have sown even the fruit of all your prayers and tears and sufferings for the king by the way in that place you must wear crowns of gold and enjoy the perpetual sight and visions of the holy one for there you shall see him as he is there also you shall serve him continually with praise with shouting and thanksgiving whom you desired to serve in the world though with much difficulty because of the weakness of your bodies there your eyes shall be delighted with seeing and your ears with hearing the pleasant voice of the mighty one there you shall enjoy your friends again that are gone thither before you and there you shall with joy receive even every one that follows into the holy place after you there also you shall be clothed with glory and majesty and put into a state fit to ride out with the king of glory when he shall come with sound of trumpet in the clouds as upon the wings of the wind you shall come with him and when he shall sit upon the throne of judgment you shall sit by him yea and when he shall pass sentence upon all the workers of evil let them be angels or men you also shall have a voice in that judgment because they were his and your enemies also when he shall again return to the city you shall go too with sound of trumpet and be ever with him  now while they were thus drawing towards the gate behold a company of the heavenly host came out to meet them to whom it was said by the other two shining ones these are the men that have loved our lord when in the world and that have left all for his holy name and he hath sent us to fetch them and we have brought them thus far on their desired journey that they may go in and look their redeemer in the face with joy then the heavenly host gave a great shout saying blessed are they which are called to the marriage supper of the lamb there came out also at this time to meet them several of the kings trumpeters clothed in white and shining raiment who with melodious noises and loud made even the heavens to echo with their sound these trumpeters saluted christian and his fellow with ten thousand welcomes from the world and this they did with shouting and sound of trumpet  sidenote the celestial city  this done they compassed them round on every side some went before some behind and some on the right hand some on the left as it were to guard them through the upper regions continually sounding as they went with melodious noise in notes on high so that the very sight was to them that could behold it as if heaven itself was come down to meet them thus therefore they walked on together and as they walked ever and anon these trumpeters even with joyful sound would by mixing their music with looks and gestures still signify to christian and his brother how welcome they were into their company and with what gladness they came to meet them and now were these two men as it were in heaven before they came at it being swallowed up with the sight of angels and with hearing of their melodious notes here also they had the city itself in view and thought they heard all the bells therein to ring and welcome them thereto but above all the warm and joyful thoughts that they had about their own dwelling there with such company and that for ever and ever oh by what tongue or pen can their glorious joy be expressed  and thus they came up to the gate now when they were come up to the gate there was written over it in letters of gold blessed are they that do his commandments that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates into the city  then i saw in my dream that the shining men bid them call at the gate the which when they did some from above looked over the gate such as enoch moses and elijah and others to whom it was said these pilgrims are come from the city of destruction for the love that they bear to the king of this place and then the pilgrims gave in unto them each man his certificate which they had received in the beginning those therefore were carried in to the king who when he had read them said where are the men to whom it was answered they are standing without the gate the king then commanded to open the gate that the righteous nation said he which keepeth the truth may enter in  now i saw in my dream that these two men went in at the gate and lo as they entered their looks were changed so that their faces became bright and they had garments put on that shone like gold there were also that met them with harps and crowns and gave them to themthe harps to praise withal and the crowns in token of honor then i heard in my dream that all the bells in the city rang again for joy and that it was said unto them enter ye into the joy of your lord i also heard the men themselves that they sang with a loud voice saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb for ever and ever  now just as the gates were opened to let in the men i looked in after them and behold the city shone like the sun the streets also were paved with gold and in them walked many men with crowns on their heads palms in their hands and golden harps to sing praises withal  there were also of them that had wings and they answered one another without ceasing saying holy holy holy is the lord and after that they shut up the gates which when i had seen i wished myself among them  sidenote ignorance fails to enter  now while i was gazing upon all these things i turned my head to look back and saw ignorance come up to the riverside but he soon got over and that without half the difficulty which the other two men met with for it happened that there was then in the place one vainhope a ferryman that with his boat helped him over so he as the others i saw did ascend the hill to come up to the gate only he came alone neither did any man meet him with the least encouragement when he was come up to the gate he looked up to the writing that was above and then began to knock supposing that entrance should have been quickly given to him but he was asked by the men that looked over the top of the gate whence came you and what would you have he answered i have eaten and drunk in the presence of the king and he has taught in our streets then they asked him for his certificate that they might go in and show it to the king so he fumbled in his bosom for one and found none then said they have you none but the man answered never a word so they told the king but he would not come down to see him but commanded the two shining ones that conducted christian and hopeful to the city to go out and take ignorance and bind him hand and foot and have him away then they took him up and carried him through the air to the door that i saw in the side of the hill and put him in there then i saw that there was a way to hell even from the gates of heaven as well as from the city of destruction                                       so i awoke and behold it was a dream     conclusion     now reader i have told my dream to thee   see if thou canst interpret it to me   or to thyself or neighbor but take heed   of misinterpreting for that instead   of doing good will but thyself abuse   by misinterpreting evil ensues     take heed also that thou be not extreme   in playing with the outside of my dream   nor let my figure or similitude   put thee into a laughter or a feud   leave this for boys and fools but as for thee   do thou the substance of my matter see     put by the curtains look within my veil   turn up my metaphors and do not fail   there if thou seekest them such things to find   as will be helpful to an honest mind     what of my dross thou findest there be bold   to throw away but yet preserve the gold   what if my gold be wrapped up in ore   none throws away the apple for the core   but if thou shalt cast all away as vain   i know not but twill make me dream again     the pilgrims progress  part ii     chapter i  courteous companions   some time since to tell you my dream that i had of christian the pilgrim and of his dangerous journey towards the celestial country was pleasant to me and profitable to you i told you then also what i saw concerning his wife and children and how unwilling they were to go with him on pilgrimage insomuch that he was forced to go on his progress without them for he durst not run the danger of that destruction which he feared would come by staying with them in the city of destruction wherefore as i then showed you he left them and departed  now it hath so happened through the abundance of business that i have been much hindered and kept back from my wonted travels into those parts whence he went and so could not till now obtain an opportunity to make further inquiry after those whom he left behind that i might give you an account of them but having had some concerns that way of late i went down again thitherward now having taken up my lodgings in a wood about a mile off the place as i slept i dreamed again  sidenote the author and mr sagacity  and as i was in my dream behold an aged gentleman came by where i lay and because he was to go some part of the way that i was travelling methought i got up and went with him so as we walked and as travelers usually do i was as if we fell into discourse and our talk happened to be about christian and his travels for thus i began with the old man  sir said i what town is that there below that lieth on the left hand of our way  then said mr sagacity for that was his name it is the city of destruction a populous place but possessed with a very illconditioned and idle sort of people  i thought that was that city quoth i i went once myself through that town and therefore know that this report you give of it is true  sag too true i wish i could speak truth in speaking better of them that dwell therein  well sir quoth i then i perceive you to be a wellmeaning man and so one that takes pleasure to hear and tell of that which is good pray did you never hear what happened to a man some time ago of this town whose name was christian that went on pilgrimage up towards the higher regions  sag hear of him ay and i also heard of the difficulties troubles wars captivities cries groans frights and fears that he met with and had in his journey besides i must tell you all our country rings of him there are but few houses that have heard of him and his doings but have sought after and got the record of his pilgrimage yea i think i may say that his hazardous journey has got many wellwishers to his ways for though when he was here he was a fool in every mans mouth yet now he is gone he is highly commended of all for tis said he lives bravely where he is yea many of them that are resolved never to run his risks yet have their mouths water at his gains  they may quoth i well think if they think anything that is true that he liveth well where he is for he now lives at and in the fountain of life and has what he has without labor and sorrow for there is no grief mixed therewith but pray what talk have the people about him  sag talk the people talk strangely about him some say that he now walks in white that he has a chain of gold about his neck that he has a crown of gold beset with pearls upon his head others say that the shining ones that sometimes showed themselves unto him in his journey are become his companions and that he is as familiar with them in the place where he is as here one neighbor is with another besides it is confidently spoken concerning him that the king of the place where he is has bestowed upon him already a very rich and pleasant dwelling at court and that he every day eateth and drinketh and walketh with him and receiveth of the smiles and favors of him that is judge of all there moreover it is expected of some that his prince the lord of that country will shortly come into these parts and will know the reason if they can give any why his neighbors set so little by him and had him so much in derision when they perceived that he would be a pilgrim for they say now he is so in the affections of his prince and that his sovereign is so much concerned with the wrongs that were cast upon christian when he became a pilgrim that he will look upon all as if done unto himself and no marvel for it was for the love that he had to his prince that he ventured as he did  sidenote sagacity tells of christiana  i daresay quoth i i am glad ont i am glad for the poor mans sake for that he now has rest from his labor and for that he reapeth the benefit of his tears with joy and for that he has got beyond gunshot of his enemies and is out of the reach of them that hate him i also am glad for that a rumor of these things is noised abroad in this country who can tell but that it may work some good effect on some that are left behind but pray sir while it is fresh in my mind do you hear anything of his wife and children poor hearts i wonder in my mind what they do  sag who christiana and her sons they are like to do as well as did christian himself for though they all played the fool at first and would by no means be persuaded by either the tears or entreaties of christian yet second thoughts have wrought wonderfully with them so they have packed up and are also gone after him  better and better quoth i but what wife and children and all  sag it is true i can give you an account of the matter for i was upon the spot at the instant and was thoroughly acquainted with the whole affair  then said i a man it seems may report it for a truth  sag you need not fear to declare it i mean that they are all gone on pilgrimage both the good woman and her four boys and since we are as i perceive going some considerable way together i will give you an account of the whole matter  this christiana for that was her name from the day that she with her children betook themselves to a pilgrims life after her husband had gone over the river and she could hear of him no more her thoughts began to work in her mind first for that she had lost her husband and of that the loving bond of that relation was utterly broken betwixt them for you know said he to me it is only natural that the living should have many sad thoughts in the remembrance of the loss of loving relations this therefore of her husband did cost her many a tear but this was not all for christiana did also begin to consider with herself whether unbecoming behavior towards her husband was not one cause that she saw him no more and that in such sort he was taken away from her and upon this came into her mind by swarms all her unkind unnatural and ungodly treatment of her dear friend which also troubled her conscience and did load her with guilt she was moreover much broken with recalling to remembrance the restless groans brinish tears and selfbemoanings of her husband and how she did harden her heart against all his entreaties and loving persuasions of her and her sons to go with him yea there was not anything that christian either said to her or did before her all the while that his burden did hang on his back but it returned upon her like a flash of lightning and rent her heart in sunder specially that bitter outcry of his what shall i do to be saved did ring in her ears most dolefully  then said she to her children sons we are all undone i have sinned away your father and he is gone he would have had us with him but i would not go myself i also have hindered you of life  with that the boys fell all into tears and cried out to go after their father  oh said christiana that it had been but our lot to go with him then had it fared well with us beyond what it is like to do now for though i formerly foolishly imagined concerning the troubles of your father that they came from a foolish fancy that he had or for that he was overrun with melancholy humors yet now it will not out of my mind but that they sprang from another cause and it was this that the light of life was given him by the help of which as i perceive he has escaped the snares of death  sidenote of christianas dream  then they all wept again and cried out oh woe worth the day  the next night christiana had a dream and behold she saw as if a broad parchment were opened before her in which were recorded the sum of her ways and the times as she thought looked very black upon her then she cried out aloud in her sleep lord have mercy upon me a sinner and the little children heard her  after this she thought she saw two very illfavored ones standing by her bedside and saying what shall we do with this woman for she cries out for mercy waking and sleeping if she be suffered to go on as she begins we shall lose her as we have lost her husband wherefore we must by one way or other seek to take her off from the thoughts of what shall be hereafter else all the world cannot help but she will become a pilgrim  now she awoke in a great sweat also a trembling was upon her but after a while she fell to sleeping again and then she thought she saw christian her husband in a place of bliss among many immortals with a harp in his hand standing and playing upon it before one that sat upon a throne with a rainbow about his head  she saw also as if he bowed his head with his face to the paved work that was under the princes feet saying i heartily thank my lord and king for bringing of me into this place then shouted a company of them that stood round about and harped with their harps but no man living could tell what they said but christian and his companions  next morning when she was up and had prayed to god and talked with her children a while one knocked hard at the door to whom she spake out saying if thou comest in gods name come in so he said amen and opened the door and saluted her with peace be to this house the which when he had done he said christiana knowest thou wherefore i am come then she blushed and trembled also her heart began to wax warm with desires to know from whence he came and what was his errand to her so he said unto her my name is secret i dwell with those that are on high it is talked of where i dwell as if thou hadst a desire to go thither also there is a report that thou art aware of the evil thou hast formerly done to thy husband in hardening thy heart against his way and in keeping of these thy babes in their ignorance christiana the merciful one hath sent me to tell thee that he is a god ready to forgive and that he taketh delight to pardon offences he also would have thee know that he inviteth thee to come into his presence to his table and that he will feed thee with the fat of his house and with the heritage of jacob thy father  there is christian thy husband that was with legions more his companions ever behold that face that doth minister life to beholders and they will be glad when they shall hear the sound of thy feet step over thy fathers threshold  sidenote christiana is sent for  christiana at this was greatly abashed in herself and bowed her head to the ground  this visitor proceeded and said christiana here is also a letter for thee which i have brought from thy husbands king so she took it and opened it but it smelt after the manner of the best perfume also it was written in letters of gold the contents of the letter were these that the king would have her to do as christian her husband for that was the way to come to his city and to dwell in his presence with joy for ever  at this the good woman was quite overcome so she cried out to her visitor sir will you carry me and my children with you that we also may worship this king  then said the visitor christiana the bitter is before the sweet thou must through troubles as did he that went before thee enter the celestial city wherefore i advise thee to do as did christian thy husband go to the wicketgate yonder over the plain for that stands in the head of the way up which you must go and i wish thee all good speed also i advise that thou put this letter in thy bosom that thou read therein to thyself and to thy children until you have got it by rote of heart for it is one of the songs that thou must sing while thou art in this house of thy pilgrimage also this thou must deliver in at the farther gate  now i saw in my dream that this old gentleman as he told me the story did himself seem to be greatly affected therewith he moreover went on and said  so christiana called her sons together and began thus to address herself unto them my sons i have as you may perceive been of late under much trouble in my soul about the death of your father not for that i doubt at all of his happiness for i am satisfied now that he is well i have also been much affected with the thoughts of mine own state and yours which i verily believe is by nature miserable my treatment also of your father in his distress is a great load to my conscience for i hardened both mine own heart and yours against him and refused to go with him on pilgrimage  the thoughts of these things would now kill me outright but for a dream which i had last night and but for the encouragement that this stranger has given me this morning come my children let us pack up and be gone to the gate that leads to the celestial country that we may see your father and be with him and his companions in peace according to the laws of that land  then did her children burst out into tears for joy that the heart of their mother was so inclined so their visitor bade them farewell and they began to prepare to set out for their journey  sidenote mrs timorous and christiana  but while they were thus about to be gone two of the women that were christianas neighbors came up to the house and knocked at the door to whom she said as before if you come in gods name come in at this the women were stunned for this kind of language they used not to hear or to perceive to drop from the lips of christiana yet they came in but behold they found the good woman preparing to be gone from her house  so they began and said neighbor pray what is your meaning by this  christiana answered and said to the eldest of them whose name was mrs timorous i am preparing for a journey  this timorous was daughter to him that met christian upon the hill difficulty and would have had him go back for fear of the lions  tim for what journey i pray you  chr even to go after my good husband and with that she fell a weeping  tim i hope not so good neighbor pray for your poor childrens sake do not so unwomanly cast away yourself  chr nay my children shall go with me not one of them is willing to stay behind  tim i wonder in my very heart what or who has brought you into this mind  chr oh neighbor knew you but as much as i do i doubt not but that you would go with me  tim prithee what new knowledge hast thou got that so worketh off thy mind from thy friends and that tempteth thee to go nobody knows where  chr then christiana replied i have been sorely afflicted since my husbands departure from me but especially since he went over the river but that which troubleth me most is my unkind treatment of him when he was under his distress besides i am now as he was then nothing will serve me but going on pilgrimage i was adreaming last night that i saw him oh that my soul was with him he dwelleth in the presence of the king of the country he sits and eats with him at his table he has become a companion of immortals and has a house now given him to dwell in to which the best palaces on earth if compared seem to me but as a dunghill the prince of the place has also sent for me with promises of entertainment if i shall come to him his messenger was here even now and has brought me a letter which invites me to come and with that she plucked out the letter and read it and said to them what now will you say to this  sidenote mercy also desires to go  tim oh the madness that hath possessed thee and thy husband to run yourselves upon such difficulties you have heard i am sure what your husband did meet with even in a manner at the first step that he took on his way as our neighbor obstinate can yet testify for he went along with them yea and pliable too until they like wise men were afraid to go any farther we also heard over and above how he met with the lions apollyon the shadow of death and many other things nor is the danger he met with at vanity fair to be forgotten by thee for if he though a man was so hard put to it what canst thou being but a poor woman do consider also that these four sweet babes are thy children thy flesh and thy bones wherefore though thou shouldest be so rash as to cast away thyself yet for the sake of thy children keep thou at home  but christiana said unto her tempt me not my neighbor i have now a price put into my hands to get gain and i should be a fool of the greatest size if i should have no heart to strike in with the opportunity and for that you tell me of all these troubles which i am like to meet with in the way they are so far off from being to me a discouragement that they show i am in the right the bitter must come before the sweet and that also will make the sweet the sweeter wherefore since you came not to my house in gods name as i said i pray you to be gone and not to disquiet me further  then timorous reviled her and said to her fellow come neighbor mercy let us leave her in her own hands since she scorns our counsel and company but mercy was at a stand and could not so readily comply with her neighbor and that for a twofold reason 1 her heart yearned over christiana so she said within herself if my neighbor will needs be gone i will go a little way with her and help her 2 her heart yearned over her own soul for what christiana had said had taken hold upon her mind wherefore she said within herself again i will yet have more talk with this christiana and if i find truth and life in what she shall say myself with my heart shall also go with her wherefore mercy began thus to reply to her neighbor timorous  mer neighbor i did indeed come with you to see christiana this morning and since she is as you see taking her last farewell of her country i think to walk this sunshiny morning a little with her to help her on her way  but she told her not of the second reason but kept that to herself  tim well i see you have a mind to go afooling too but take heed in time and be wise while we are out of danger we are out but when we are in we are in  so mrs timorous returned to her house and christiana betook herself to her journey but when timorous was got home to her house she sends for some of her neighbors to wit mrs batseyes mrs inconsiderate mrs lightmind and mrs knownothing so when they were come to her house she falls to telling of the story of christiana and of her intended journey and thus she began her tale  sidenote mrs timorous neighbors  tim neighbors having had little to do this morning i went to give christiana a visit and when i came at the door i knocked as you know it is our custom and she answered if you come in gods name come in so in i went thinking all was well but when i came in i found her preparing herself to depart the town she and also her children so i asked her what was her meaning by that and she told me in short that she was now of a mind to go on pilgrimage as did her husband she told me also a dream that she had and how the king of the country where her husband was had sent her an inviting letter to come thither  then said mrs knownothing and what do you think she will go  tim ay go she will whatever comes ont and methinks i know it by this for that which was my great reason in persuading her to stay at home that is the troubles she was like to meet with in the way is one great reason with her to put her forward on her journey for she told me in so many words the bitter goes before the sweet yea and forasmuch as it so doth it makes the sweet the sweeter  mrs batseyes oh this blind and foolish woman said she will she not take warning by her husbands trials for my part i see if he were here again he would rest him content in a whole skin and never run so many dangers for nothing  mrs inconsiderate also replied saying away with such fantastical fools from the town a good riddance for my part i say of her should she stay where she dwells and retain this her mind who could live quietly by her for she will either be dumpish or unneighborly or talk of such matters as no wise body can abide wherefore for my part i shall never be sorry for her departure let her go and let better come in her room it was never a good world since these whimsical fools dwelt in it  then mrs lightmind added as followeth come put this kind of talk away i was yesterday at madam wantons where we were as merry as the maids for who do you think should be there but i and mrs lovetheflesh and three or four more with mr lechery mrs filth and some others so there we had music and dancing and what else was meet to fill up the pleasure and i dare say my lady herself is an admirable wellbred gentlewoman and mr lechery is as pretty a fellow     chapter ii  the wicketgate   by this time christiana was got on her way and mercy went along with her so as they went her children being there also christiana began to discourse and mercy said christiana i take this as an unexpected favor that thou shouldest set forth out of doors with me to accompany me a little in my way  mer then said young mercy for she was but young if i thought it would be a good purpose to go with you i would never go near the town any more  chr well mercy said christiana cast in thy lot with me i well know what will be the end of our pilgrimage my husband is where he would not but be for all the gold in the spanish mines nor shalt thou be turned away though thou goest but upon my invitation the king who hath sent for me and my children is one that delighteth in mercy besides if thou wilt i will hire thee and thou shalt go along with me as my servant yet we will have all things in common betwixt thee and me only go along with me  mer but how shall i be sure that i also shall be welcomed had i this hope but from one that can tell i would have no hesitation at all but would go being helped by him that can help though the way be never so tedious  chr well loving mercy i will tell thee what thou shalt do go with me to the wicketgate and there i will further inquire for thee and if there thou dost not meet with encouragement i will be content that thou shalt return to thy place i also will pay thee for thy kindness which thou showest to me and my children in the accompanying of us in our way as thou dost  sidenote mercy goes with christiana  mer then will i go thither and will take what shall follow and the lord grant that my lot may there fall even as the king of heaven shall have his heart upon me  christiana was then glad at her heart not only that she had a companion but also for that she had prevailed with this poor maid to fall in love with her own salvation so they went on together and mercy began to weep  then said christiana wherefore weepeth my sister so  mer alas said she who can but lament that shall but rightly consider what a state and condition my poor relations are in that yet remain in our sinful town and that which makes my grief the more heavy is because they have no one to teach them nor to tell them what is to come  chr tenderness becometh pilgrims and thou dost for thy friends as my good christian did for me when he left me he mourned for that i would not heed nor regard him but his lord and ours did gather up his tears and put them into his bottle and now both i and thou and these my sweet babes are reaping the fruit and benefit of them i hope mercy that these tears of thine will not be lost for the truth hath said that they that sow in tears shall reap in joy in singing and he that goeth forth and weepeth bearing precious seed shall doubtless come again with rejoicing bringing his sheaves with him  then said mercy    let the most blessèd be my guide     if t be his blessèd will   unto his gate into his fold     up to his holy hill    and never let him suffer me     to swerve or turn aside   from his free grace and holy ways     whateer shall me betide    and let him gather them of mine     that i have left behind   lord make them pray they may be thine     with all their heart and mind  now my old friend proceeded and said but when christiana came to the slough of despond she began to be at a stand for said she this is the place in which my dear husband had like to have been smothered with mud she perceived also that notwithstanding the command of the king to make this place for pilgrims good yet it was rather worse than formerly so i asked if that was true  yes said the old gentleman too true for many there be that pretend to be the kings laborers and say they are for mending the kings highway that bring dirt and dung instead of stones and so mar instead of mending here christiana therefore with her boys did make a stand but said mercy come let us venture only let us be wary then they looked well to their steps and made shift to get staggeringly over yet christiana had to have been in and that not once nor twice  now they had no sooner got over but they thought they heard words that said unto them blessed is she that believeth for there shall be a performance of those things which were told her from the lord  then they went on again and said mercy to christiana had i as good ground to hope for a loving reception at the wicketgate as you i think no slough of despond would discourage me  well said the other you know your trouble and i know mine and good friend we shall have enough evil before we come at our journeys end for can it be imagined that the people that design to attain such excellent glories as we do and that are so envied that happiness as we are but that we shall meet with what fears with what troubles and afflictions they can possibly assault us with that hate us  sidenote at the wicket gate  and now mr sagacity left me to dream out my dream by myself wherefore methought i saw christiana and mercy and the boys go all of them up to the gate to which when they were come they betook themselves to a short debate about how they must manage their calling at the gate and what should be said unto him that did open unto them so it was concluded since christiana was the eldest that she should knock for entrance and that she should speak to him that did open for the rest so christiana began to knock and as her poor husband did she knocked and knocked again but instead of any that answered they all thought that they heard as if a dog came barking upon them a dog and a great one too and this made the women and children afraid nor durst they for a while to knock any more for fear the mastiff should fly upon them now therefore they were greatly tumbled up and down in their minds and knew not what to do knock they durst not for fear of the dog go back they durst not for fear the keeper of the gate should espy them as they so went and should be offended with them at last they thought of knocking again and knocked more loudly than they did at first then said the keeper of the gate who is there so the dog left off to bark and he opened unto them  then christiana made low obeisance and said let not our lord be offended with his handmaidens for that we have knocked at his princely gate  then said the keeper whence come ye and what is it that you would have  christiana answered we are come from whence christian did come and upon the same errand as he to wit to be if it shall please you graciously admitted by this gate into the way that leads to the celestial city and i answer my lord in the next place that i am christiana once the wife of christian that now is gotten above  with that the keeper of the gate did marvel saying what is she now become a pilgrim that but a while ago hated that life  then she bowed her head and said yes and so are these my sweet babes also  then he took her by the hand and let her in and said also suffer the little children to come unto me and with that he shut up the gate this done he called to a trumpeter that was above over the gate to entertain christiana with shouting and sound of trumpet for joy so he obeyed and sounded and filled the air with his melodious notes  now all this while poor mercy did stand without trembling and crying for fear that she was rejected but when christiana had got admittance for herself and her boys then she began to make intercession for mercy  sidenote mercy falls in a swoon  chr and she said my lord i have a companion of mine that stands yet without that is come hither upon the same account as myself one that is much troubled in her mind for that she comes as she thinks without sending for whereas i was sent to by my husbands king to come  now mercy began to be very impatient for each minute was as long to her as an hour wherefore she prevented christiana from asking for her more fully by knocking at the gate herself and she knocked then so loud that she made christiana to start then said the keeper of the gate who is there and said christiana it is my friend  so he opened the gate and looked out but mercy was fallen down without in a swoon for she fainted and was afraid that no gate would be opened to her  then he took her by the hand and said maiden i bid thee arise  oh sir said she i am faint there is scarce life left in me  but he answered that one once said when my soul fainted within me i remembered the lord and my prayer came in unto thee into thy holy temple fear not but stand upon thy feet and tell me wherefore thou art come  mer i am come for that unto which i was never invited as my friend christiana was hers was from the king and mine was but from her wherefore i fear i presume  keep did she desire thee to come with her to this place  mer yes and as my lord sees i am come and if there is any grace and forgiveness of sins to spare i beseech that i thy poor handmaiden may be partaker thereof  sidenote mercy permitted to enter  then he took her again by the hand and led her gently in and said i pray for all them that believe on me by what means soever they come unto me then said he to those that stood by fetch something and give it to mercy to smell on thereby to stay her fainting so they fetched her a bundle of myrrh and a while after she was revived  and now was christiana and her boys and mercy received of the lord at the head of the way and spoke kindly unto by him then said they yet further unto him we are sorry for our sins and beg of our lord his pardon and further information what we must do  i grant pardon said he by word and deed by word in the promise of forgiveness by deed in the way i obtained it take the first from my lips with a kiss and the other as it shall be revealed  now i saw in my dream that he spake many good words unto them whereby they were greatly gladded he also had them up to the top of the gate and showed them by what deed they were saved and told them withal that that sight they would have again as they went along the way to their comfort  so he left them a while in a summer parlor below where they entered into a talk by themselves and thus christiana began  o lord how glad am i that we are got in hither  mer so you well may but i of all have cause to leap for joy  chr i thought one time as i stood at the gate because i knocked and none did answer that all our labor had been lost specially when that ugly cur made such a heavy barking against us  mer but my worst fear was after i saw that you were taken into his favor and that i was left behind now thought i it is fulfilled which is written two women shall be grinding at the mill the one shall be taken and the other left i had much ado to forbear crying out undone undone and afraid i was to knock any more but when i looked up to what was written over the gate i took courage i also thought that i must either knock again or die so i knocked but i cannot tell how for my spirit now struggled betwixt life and death  chr can you not tell how you knocked i am sure your knocks were so earnest that the very sound of them made me start i thought i never heard such knocking in all my life i thought you would come in by violent hands or take the kingdom by storm  mer alas to be in my case who that so was could but have done so you saw that the door was shut upon me and that there was a most cruel dog thereabout who i say that was so fainthearted as i would not have knocked with all their might but pray what said my lord to my rudeness was he not angry with me  chr when he heard your lumbering noise he gave a wonderful innocent smile i believe what you did pleased him well enough for he showed no sign to the contrary but i marvel in my heart why he keeps such a dog had i known that afore i should not have had heart enough to have ventured myself in this manner but now we are in we are in and i am glad with all my heart  mer i will ask if you please next time he comes down why he keeps such a filthy cur in his yard i hope he will not take it amiss  ay do said the children and persuade him to hang him for we are afraid he will bite us when we go hence  so at last he came down to them again and mercy fell to the ground on her face before him and worshiped and said let my lord accept the offering of praise which i now offer unto him with my lips  sidenote mercy expresses her fears  so he said unto her peace be to thee stand up but she continued upon her face and said righteous art thou o lord when i plead with thee yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments wherefore dost thou keep so cruel a dog in thy yard at the sight of which such women and children as we are ready to fly from the gate with fear he answered and said that dog has another owner he also is kept close in another mans ground only my pilgrims hear his barking he belongs to the castle which you see there at a distance but can come up to the walls of this place he has frighted many an honest pilgrim from worse to better by the great voice of his roaring indeed he that owneth him doth not keep him out of any goodwill to me or mine but with intent to keep the pilgrims from coming to me and that they may be afraid to come and knock at this gate for entrance sometimes also he has broken out and has worried some that i love but i take all at present patiently i also give my pilgrims timely help so that they are not delivered up to his power to do with them what his doggish nature would prompt him to but what my beloved one i should suppose hadst thou known even so much beforehand thou wouldst not have been afraid of a dog the beggars that go from door to door will rather than lose a supposed alms run the danger of the bawling barking and biting too of a dog and shall a dog in another mans yard a dog whose barking i turn to the profit of pilgrims keep any one from coming to me i deliver them from the lions their darling from the power of the dog  mer then said mercy i confess my ignorance i spake what i understood not i acknowledge that thou doest all things well  chr then christiana began to talk of their journey and to inquire after the way  so he fed them and washed their feet and set them in the way of his steps according as he had dealt with her husband before  so i saw in my dream that they walked on in their way and had the weather very comfortable to them  then christiana began to sing    blessed be the day that i began     a pilgrim for to be   and blessèd also be the man     that thereto movèd me    tis true twas long ere i began     to seek to live for ever   but now i run fast as i can     tis better late than never    our tears to joy our fears to faith     are turnèd as we see   thus our beginning as one saith     shows what our end will be  now there was on the other side of the wall that fenced in the way up which christiana and her companions were to go a garden and that garden belonged to him whose was that barking dog of whom mention was made before and some of the fruittrees that grew in that garden shot their branches over the wall and being mellow they that found them did gather them up and oft eat of them to their hurt so christianas boys as boys are apt to do being pleased with the trees and the fruit that did hang thereon did bend the branches down and pluck the fruit and begin to eat their mother did also chide them for so doing but still the boys went on  illustration christianas boys began to eat                                    page 231  well said she my sons you do wrong for that fruit is none of ours but she did not know that it did belong to the enemy ill warrant you if she had she would have been ready to die for fear but that passed and they went on their way  sidenote the illfavored ones  now by that they were gone about two bowshots from the place that led them unto the way they espied two very illfavored ones coming down apace to meet them with that christiana and mercy her friend covered themselves with their veils and so kept on their journey the children also went on before so that at last they met together then they that came down to meet them came just up to the women as if they would embrace them but christiana said stand back or go peaceably by as you should  yet these two as men that are deaf regarded not christianas words but began to lay hands upon them at that christiana waxing very wroth spurned at them with her feet mercy also as well as she could did what she could to shift them christiana again said to them stand back and be gone for we have no money to lose being pilgrims as you see and such too as live upon the charity of our friends  illfavored one then said one of the two men we make no assault upon you for money but are come out to tell you that if you will grant one small request which we shall ask we will make women of you for ever  chr now christiana imagining what they should mean made answer again we will neither hear nor regard nor yield to what you shall ask we are in haste and cannot stay our business is a business of life or death  so again she and her companions made a fresh attempt to go past them but they letted them in their way  illfav and they said we intend no hurt to your lives it is another thing we would have  chr ay quoth christiana you would have us body and soul for i know it is for that you are come but we will die rather upon the spot than to suffer ourselves to be brought into such snares as shall risk the loss of our wellbeing hereafter and with that they both shrieked out and cried murder murder and so put themselves under those laws that are provided for the protection of women but the men still made their approach upon them with design to prevail against them they therefore cried out again  sidenote a reliever appears  now they being as i said far from the gate in at which they came their voices were heard from where they were thither wherefore some of the house came out and knowing it was christianas tongue they made haste to her relief but by the time that they were got within sight of them the women were in a very great terror the children also stood crying by then did he that came in for their relief call out to the ruffians saying what is that thing you do would you make my lords people to do wrong he also attempted to take them but they did make their escape over the wall into the garden of the man to whom the great dog belonged so the dog became their protector this reliever then came up to the women and asked them how they did  so they answered we thank thy prince pretty well only we have been somewhat affrighted we thank thee also for that thou camest in to our help otherwise we had been overcome  reliever so after a few more words this reliever said as followeth i marvelled much when you were entertained at the gate above being ye knew that ye were but weak women that you asked not the lord for a conductor then might you have avoided these troubles and dangers for he would have granted you one  chr alas said christiana we were taken so with our present blessing that dangers to come were forgotten by us besides who could have thought that so near the kings palace there could have lurked such naughty ones indeed it had been well for us had we asked our lord for one but since our lord knew it would be for our profit i wonder he sent not one along with us  rel it is not always necessary to grant things not asked for lest by so doing they become of little value but when the want of a thing is felt then he who needs it feels its preciousness and so when it is given it will be used had my lord granted you a conductor you would not either have so bewailed that oversight of yours in not asking for one as now you have occasion to do so all things work for good and tend to make you more wary  chr shall we go back again to my lord and confess our folly and ask one  rel your confession of your folly i will present him with to go back again you need not for in all places where you shall come you will find no want at all for in every one of my lords lodgings which he has prepared for the care of his pilgrims there is sufficient to furnish them against all attempts whatsoever but as i said he will be asked of by them to do it for them and tis a poor thing that is not worth asking for  sidenote the pilgrims proceed  when he had thus said he went back to his place and the pilgrims went on their way  mer then said mercy what a sudden blank is here i made account we had been past all danger and that we should never see sorrow more  chr thy innocence my sister said christiana to mercy may excuse thee much but as for me fault is so much the greater for that i saw the danger before i came out of the doors and yet did not provide for it when provision might have been had i am therefore much to be blamed  mer then said mercy how knew you this before you came from home pray open to me this riddle  chr why i will tell you before i set foot out of doors one night as i lay in my bed i had a dream about this for methought i saw two men as like these as ever any in the world could look stand at my beds feet plotting how they might prevent my salvation i will tell you their very words they said it was when i was in my troubles what shall we do with this woman for she cries out waking and sleeping for forgiveness if she be suffered to go on as she begins we shall lose her as we have lost her husband this you know might have made me take heed and have provided when provision might have been had  mer well said mercy as by this neglect we have been made to behold our own imperfections so our lord has taken occasion thereby to make manifest the riches of his grace for he as we see has followed us with unasked kindness and has delivered us from their hands that were stronger than we of his mere good pleasure     chapter iii  the interpreters house   thus now when they had talked away a little more time they drew near to a house which stood in the way which house was built for the relief of pilgrims as you will find more fully related in the first part of these records of the pilgrims progress so they drew on towards the house the house of the interpreter and when they came to the door they heard a great talk in the house then they gave ear and heard as they thought christiana mentioned by name for you must know that there went along even before her a talk of her and her childrens going on pilgrimage and this was the more pleasing to them because they had heard she was christians wife that woman who was some time ago so unwilling to hear of going on pilgrimage thus therefore they stood still and heard the good people within commending her who they little thought stood at the door at last christiana knocked as she had done at the gate before now when she had knocked there came to the door a young maiden and opened the door and looked and behold two women were there  sidenote the interpreters house  maid then said the maid to them with whom would you speak in this place  chr christiana answered we understand that this is a place prepared for those that are become pilgrims and we now at this door are such wherefore we pray that we may be partakers of that for which we at this time are come for the day as thou seest is very far spent and we are loth tonight to go any farther  dam pray what may i call your name that i may tell it to my lord within  chr my name is christiana i was the wife of that pilgrim that some years ago did travel this way and these be his four children this young woman is my companion and is going on pilgrimage too  innocent then innocent ran in for that was her name and said to those within can you think who is at the door there are christiana and her children and her companion all waiting for entertainment here  then they leaped for joy and went and told their master so he came to the door and looking upon her he said art thou that christiana whom christian the good man left behind him when he betook himself to a pilgrims life  chr i am that woman that was so hardhearted as to slight my husbands troubles and then left him to go on his journey alone and these are his four children but now also i am come for i am convinced that no way is right but this  inter then is fulfilled that which also is written of the man that said to his son go work today in my vineyard and he said to his father i will not but afterwards he repented and went  chr then said christiana so be it amen god make it a true saying upon me and grant that i may be found at the last of him in peace without spot and blameless  inter but why standest thou thus at the door come in thou blessed one we were talking of thee but now for tidings have come to us before how thou art become a pilgrim come children come in come maiden come in  so he had them all into the house  sidenote pilgrims entertained  so when they were within they were bidden to sit down and rest them the which when they had done those that attended upon the pilgrims in the house came into the room to see them and one smiled and another smiled and they all smiled for joy that christiana was become a pilgrim they also looked upon the boys they stroked them over the faces with the hand in token of their kind reception of them they also carried it lovingly to mercy and bid them all welcome into their masters house  after a while because supper was not ready the interpreter took them into his significant rooms and showed them what christian christianas husband had seen some time before here therefore they saw the man in the cage the man and his dream the man that cut his way through his enemies and the picture of the biggest of them all together with the rest of those things that were then so profitable to christian  this done and after those things had been seen and thought of by christiana and her company the interpreter takes them apart again and has them first into a room where was a man that could look no way but downwards with a muckrake in his hand there stood also one over his head with a celestial crown in his hand and proffered to give him that crown for his muckrake but the man did neither look up nor regard but raked to himself the straws the small sticks and the dust of the floor  then said christiana i persuade myself that i know somewhat the meaning of this for this is a figure of a man of this world is it not good sir  inter thou hast said the right said he and his muckrake doth show his worldly mind and whereas thou seest him rather give heed to rake up straws and sticks and the dust of the floor than to do what he says that calls to him from above with the celestial crown in his hand it is to show that heaven is but a fable to some and that things here are counted the only things substantial now whereas it was also showed thee that the man could look no way but downwards it is to let thee know that earthly things when they are with power upon mens minds quite carry their hearts away from god  chr then said christiana oh deliver me from this muckrake  inter that prayer said the interpreter has lain by till it is almost rusty give me not riches is scarce the prayer of one of ten thousand straws and sticks and dust with most are the great things now looked after  with that mercy and christiana wept and said it is alas too true  sidenote interpreters allegories  when the interpreter had showed them this he had them into the very best room in the house a very brave room it was so he bid them look round about and see if they could find anything there then they looked round and round for there was nothing to be seen but a very great spider on the wall and that they overlooked  mer then said mercy sir i see nothing  but christiana held her peace  inter but said the interpreter look again  she therefore looked again and said here is not anything but an ugly spider who hangs by her hands upon the wall  then said he is there but one spider in all this spacious room  then the water stood in christianas eyes for she was a woman quick of mind and she said yes my lord there is here more than one yea and spiders whose venom is far more destructive than that which is in her  the interpreter then looked pleasantly upon her and said thou hast said the truth  this made mercy blush and the boys to cover their faces for they all began now to understand the riddle  then said the interpreter again the spider taketh hold with her hands as you see and is in kings palaces and wherefore is this recorded but to show you that how full of the venom of sin soever you be yet you may by the hand of faith lay hold of and dwell in the best room that belongs to the kings house above  chr i thought said christiana of something of this but i could not imagine it all i thought that we were like spiders and that we looked like ugly creatures in what fine rooms soever we were but that by this spider this venomous and illfavored creature we were to learn how to act faith that came not into my mind and yet she has taken hold with her hands and as i see dwelleth in the best room in the house god has made nothing in vain  then they seemed all to be glad but the water stood in their eyes yet they looked one upon another and also bowed before the interpreter  he had them then into another room where were a hen and chickens and bid them observe a while so one of the chickens went to the trough to drink and every time she drank she lifted up her head and her eyes toward heaven see said he what this little chick doth and learn of her to acknowledge whence your mercies come by receiving them with looking up yet again said he observe and look  so they gave heed and perceived that the hen did walk in a fourfold method towards her chickens first she had a common call and that she hath all day long secondly she had a special call and that she had but sometimes thirdly she had a brooding note and fourthly she had an outcry  inter now said he compare this hen to your king and these chickens to his obedient ones for answerable to her he himself hath his methods which he walketh in toward his people by his common call he gives nothing by his special call he always has something to give he also has a brooding voice for them that are under his wing and he hath an outcry to give the alarm when he seeth the enemy come i chose my darlings to lead you into the room where such things are because you are women and they are easy for you  chr and sir said christiana pray let us see some more  so he had them into the slaughterhouse where the butcher was killing a sheep and behold the sheep was quiet and took her death patiently then said the interpreter you must learn of this sheep to suffer and to put up with wrongs without murmurings and complaints behold how quietly she takes her death and without objecting she suffereth her skin to be pulled over her ears your king doth call you his sheep  after this he led them into his garden where was great variety of flowers and he said do you see all these so christiana said yes then said he again behold the flowers are diverse in stature in quality and color and smell and virtue and some are better than others also where the gardener has set them there they stand and quarrel not one with another  again he had them into his field which he had sowed with wheat and corn but when they beheld the tops of all were cut off and only the straw remained he said again this ground was made rich and was ploughed and sowed but what shall we do with the crop then said christiana burn some and make muck of the rest then said the interpreter again fruit you see is that thing you look for and for want of that you send it to the fire and to be trodden under foot of men beware that in this you condemn not yourselves  then as they were coming in from abroad they espied a little robin with a great spider in his mouth so the interpreter said look here so they looked and mercy wondered but christiana said what a disparagement is it to such a pretty little bird as the robinredbreast is he being also a bird above many that loveth to maintain a kind of sociableness with man i had thought they had lived upon crumbs of bread or upon other such harmless matter i like him worse than i did  the interpreter then replied this robin is an emblem very apt to set forth some people by for to sight they are as this robin pretty of note color and conduct they seem also to have a very great love for those that are sincere followers of christ and above all other to desire to associate with them and to be in their company as if they could live upon the good mans crumbs they pretend also that therefore it is that they frequent the house of the godly and the appointments of the lord but when they are by themselves as the robin they can catch and gobble up spiders they can change their diet drink wickedness and swallow down sin like water  so when they were come again into the house because supper as yet was not ready christiana again desired that the interpreter would either show or tell of some other things that were profitable  then the interpreter began and said the fatter the sow is the more she desires the mire the fatter the ox is the more thoughtlessly he goes to the slaughter and the more healthy the lusty man is the more prone he is unto evil there is a desire in women to go neat and fine and it is a comely thing to be adorned with that which in gods sight is of great price tis easier watching a night or two than to sit up a whole year together so tis easier for one to begin to profess well than to hold out as he should to the end every shipmaster when in a storm will willingly cast that overboard which is of the smallest value in the vessel but who will throw the best out first none but he that feareth not god one leak will sink a ship and one sin will destroy a sinner he that forgets his friends is ungrateful unto him but he that forgets his saviour is unmerciful to himself he that lives in sin and looks for happiness hereafter is like him that soweth weeds and thinks to fill his barn with wheat or barley if a man would live well let him bring before him his last day and make it always his companykeeper whispering and change of thoughts prove that sin is in the world if the world which god sets light by is counted a thing of that worth with men what is heaven that god commendeth if the life that is attended with so many troubles is so loth to be let go by us what is the life above everybody will cry up the goodness of men but who is there that is as he should be affected with the goodness of god  when the interpreter had done he takes them out into his garden again and had them to a tree whose inside was all rotten and gone and yet it grew and had leaves  then said mercy what means this  this tree said he whose outside is fair and whose inside is rotten is that to which many may be compared that are in the garden of god who with their mouths speak high in behalf of god but indeed will do nothing for him whose leaves are fair but their heart good for nothing but to be tinder for the devils tinderbox  now supper was ready the table spread and all things set on the board so they sat down and did eat when one had given thanks and the interpreter did usually entertain those that lodged with him with music at meals so the minstrels played there was also one that did sing and a very fine voice he had his song was this    the lord is only my support     and he that doth me feed   how can i then want anything     whereof i stand in need  sidenote discourse at supper  when the song and music were ended the interpreter asked christiana what it was that first did move her to betake herself to a pilgrims life christiana answered first the loss of my husband came into my mind at which i was heartily grieved but all that was but natural affection then after that came the troubles and pilgrimages of my husband into my mind and also how unkindly i had behaved to him as to that so guilt took hold of my mind and would have drawn me into the pond to drown myself but that just at the right time i had a dream of the wellbeing of my husband and a letter sent by the king of that country where my husband dwells to come to him the dream and the letter together so wrought upon my mind that they forced me to this way  inter but met you with no opposition afore you set out of doors  chr yes a neighbor of mine one mrs timorous she was akin to him that would have persuaded my husband to go back for fear of the lions she alltobefooled me for as she called it my intended desperate adventure she also urged what she could to dishearten me from itthe hardship and troubles that my husband met with in the way but all this i got over pretty well but a dream that i had of two illlooked ones that i thought did plot how to make me fail in my journey that hath troubled me much yea it still runs in my mind and makes me afraid of every one that i meet lest they should meet me to do me a mischief and to turn me out of my way yea i may tell my lord though i would not have everybody know it that between this and the gate by which we got into the way we were both so sorely attacked that we were made to cry out murder and the two that made this attack upon us were like the two that i saw in my dream  then said the interpreter thy beginning is good thy latter end shall greatly increase so he addressed himself to mercy and said unto her and what moved thee to come hither sweetheart  then mercy blushed and trembled and for a while continued silent  inter then said he be not afraid only believe and speak thy mind  mer so she began and said truly sir my lack of knowledge is that which makes me wish to be in silence and that also that fills me with fears of coming short at last i cannot tell of visions and dreams as my friend christiana can nor know i what it is to mourn for my refusing the advice of those that were good relations  inter what was it then dear heart that hath prevailed with thee to do as thou hast done  mer why when our friend here was packing up to be gone from our town i and another went accidentally to see her so we knocked at the door and went in when we were within and seeing what she was doing we asked her what was her meaning she said she was sent for to go to her husband and then she up and told us how she had seen him in a dream dwelling in a wonderful place among immortals wearing a crown playing upon a harp eating and drinking at his princes table and singing praises to him for bringing him thither and so on now methought while she was telling these things unto us my heart burned within me and i said in my heart if this be true i will leave my father and my mother and the land of my birth and will if i may go along with christiana so i asked her further of the truth of these things and if she would let me go with her for i saw now that there was no dwelling but with the danger of ruin any longer in our town but yet i came away with a heavy heart not for that i was unwilling to come away but for that so many of my relations were left behind and i am come with all the desire of my heart and will go if i may with christiana unto her husband and his king  inter thy setting out is good for thou hast given credit to the truth thou art a ruth who did for the love she bare to naomi and to the lord her god leave father and mother and the land of her birth to come out and go with a people that she knew not heretofore the lord bless thy work and a full reward be given thee of the lord god of israel under whose wings thou art come to trust  now supper was ended and preparation was made for bed the women were laid singly alone and the boys by themselves now when mercy was in bed she could not sleep for joy for that now her doubts of missing at last were removed farther from her than ever they were before so she lay blessing and praising god who had had such favor for her  in the morning they arose with the sun and prepared themselves for their departure but the interpreter would have them tarry a while for said he you must orderly go from hence then said he to the maid that first opened to them take them and have them into the garden to the bath and there wash them and make them clean from the soil which they have gathered by traveling  then innocent the maid took them and had them into the garden and brought them to the bath so she told them they must wash and be clean for so her master would have the women to do that called at his house as they were going on pilgrimage then they went in and washed yea they and the boys and all and they came out of that bath not only sweet and clean but also much enlivened and strengthened in their joints so when they came in they looked fairer a deal than when they went out to the washing  when they were returned out of the garden from the bath the interpreter took them and looked upon them and said unto them fair as the moon then he called for the seal wherewith they used to be sealed that were washed in this bath so the seal was brought and he set his mark upon them that they might be known in the places whither they were yet to go and the mark was set between their eyes this seal added greatly to their beauty for it was an ornament to their faces it also added to their glory and made their countenances more like those of angels  sidenote clothed in white raiment  then said the interpreter again to the maid that waited upon these women go into the vestry and fetch out garments for these people so she went and fetched out white raiment and laid it down before him so he commanded them to put it on it was fine linen white and clean when the women were thus adorned they seemed to be afraid one of the other for that they could not see that glory each one had in herself which they could see in each other now therefore they began to esteem each other better than themselves for you are fairer than i am said one and you are more beautiful than i am said another the children also stood amazed to see into what fashion they were brought  the interpreter then called for a manservant of his one greatheart and bid him take sword and helmet and shield and take these my daughters said he and conduct them to the house called beautiful at which place they will rest next so he took his weapons and went before them and the interpreter said god speed those also that belonged to the family sent them away with many a good wish so they went on their way and sang    this place hath been our second stage     here we have heard and seen   those good things that from age to age     to others hid have been   the dunghillraker spider hen     the chicken too to me   have taught a lesson let me then     conformèd to it be    the butcher garden and the field     the robin and his bait   also the rotten tree doth yield     me argument of weight   to move me for to watch and pray     to strive to be sincere   to take my cross up day by day     and serve the lord with fear     chapter iv  the cross and the consequences   now i saw in my dream that they went on and greatheart before them so they went and came to the place where christians burden fell off his back and tumbled into a sepulchre here then they made a pause and here also they blessed god now said christiana comes to my mind what was said to us at the gate to wit that we should have pardon by word and deed by word that is by the promise by deed that is in the way it was obtained what the promise is of that i know something but what it is to have pardon by deed or in the way that it was obtained mr greatheart i suppose you know wherefore if you please let us hear you speak thereof  sidenote greatheart discourses  great pardon by the deed done is pardon obtained by some one for another that hath need thereof not by the person pardoned but in the way saith another in which i have obtained it so then to speak to the question at large the pardon that you and mercy and these boys have obtained was obtained by another to wit by him that let you in at the gate and he hath obtained it in this double way he has shown righteousness to cover you and spilt his blood to wash you in  chr this is brave now i see that there was something to be learnt by our being pardoned by word and deed good mercy let us labor to keep this in mind and my children do you remember it also but sir was not this it that made my good christians burden fall from off his shoulders and that made him give three leaps for joy  great yes it was the belief of this that cut off those strings that could not be cut by other means and it was to give him proof of the virtue of this that he was suffered to carry his burden to the cross  chr i thought so for though my heart was lightsome and joyous before yet it is ten times more lightsome and joyous now and i am persuaded by what i have felt though i have felt but little as yet that if the most burdened man in the world was here and did see and believe as i now do it would make his heart merry and blithe  great there is not only comfort and the ease of a burden brought to us by the sight and consideration of these but an endeared love born in us by it for who can if he doth but once think that pardon comes not only by promise but thus but be affected with the way and means of his redemption and so love the man that hath wrought it for him  chr true methinks it makes my heart bleed to think that he should bleed for me oh thou loving one oh thou blessed one thou deservest to have me thou hast bought me thou deservest to have me all thou hast paid for me ten thousand times more than i am worth no marvel that this made the water stand in my husbands eyes and that it made him trudge so nimbly on i am persuaded he wished me with him but vile wretch that i was i let him come all alone oh mercy that thy father and mother were here yea and mrs timorous also nay i wish now with all my heart that here was madam wanton too surely surely their hearts would be affected nor could the fear of the one nor the powerful passions of the other prevail with them to go home again and refuse to become good pilgrims  great you speak now in the warmth of your affections will it think you be always thus with you besides this is not given to every one nor to every one that did see your jesus bleed there were that stood by and that saw the blood run from his heart to the ground and yet were so far off this that instead of lamenting they laughed at him and instead of becoming his disciples did harden their hearts against him so that all that you have my daughters you have by a peculiar feeling made by a thinking upon what i have spoken to you this you have therefore by a special grace  sidenote simple sloth presumption  now i saw still in my dream that they went on till they were come to the place that simple and sloth and presumption lay and slept in when christian went by on pilgrimage and behold they were hanged up in irons a little way off on the other side  mer then said mercy to him that was their guide and conductor what are those three men and for what are they hanged there  great these three men were men of very bad qualities they had no mind to be pilgrims themselves and whomsoever they could they hindered they were for sloth and folly themselves and whomsoever they could persuade with they made so too and withal taught them to presume that they should do well at last they were asleep when christian went by and now you go by they are hanged  mer but could they persuade any to be of their opinion  great yes they turned several out of the way there was slowpace that they persuaded to do as they they also prevailed with one shortwind with one noheart with one lingerafterlust and with one sleepyhead and with a young womanher name was dullto turn out of the way and become as they besides they brought up an ill report of your lord persuading others that he was a hard taskmaster they also brought up an evil report of the good land saying it was not half so good as some pretended it was they also began to speak falsely about his servants and to count the very best of them meddlesome troublesome busybodies further they would call the bread of god husks the comforts of his children fancies the travel labor of pilgrims things to no purpose  chr nay said christiana if they were such they never shall be bewailed by me they have but what they deserve and i think it is well that they hang so near the highway that others may see and take warning but had it not been well if their crimes had been engraven on some plate of iron or brass and left here where they did their mischiefs for a caution to other bad men  great so it is as you well may perceive if you will go a little to the wall  mer no no let them hang and their names rot and their crimes live for ever against them i think it a high favor that they were hanged afore we came hither who knows else what they might have done to such poor women as we are  then she turned it into a song saying    now then you three hang there and be a sign   to all that shall against the truth combine   and let him that comes after fear this end   if unto pilgrims he is not a friend   and thou my soul of all such men beware   that unto holiness opposers are  thus they went on till they came at the foot of the hill difficulty where again their good friend mr greatheart took an occasion to tell them of what happened there when christian himself went by so he had them first to the spring lo saith he this is the spring that christian drank of before he went up this hill and then it was clear and good but now it is dirty with the feet of some that are not desirous that pilgrims here should quench their thirst thereat mercy said and why are they so envious i wonder but said their guide it will do if taken up and put into a vessel that is sweet and good for then the dirt will sink to the bottom and the water come out by itself more clear thus therefore christiana and her companions were compelled to do they took it up and put it into an earthen pot and so let it stand till the dirt was gone to the bottom and then they drank thereof  sidenote two dangerous paths  next he showed them the two byways that were at the foot of the hill where formality and hypocrisy lost themselves and said he these are dangerous paths two were here cast away when christian came by and although as you see these ways are since stopped up with chains posts and a ditch yet there are that will choose to adventure here rather than take the pains to go up this hill  chr the way of transgressors is hard it is a wonder that they can get into those ways without danger of breaking their necks  great they will venture yea if at any time any of the kings servants doth happen to see them and doth call unto them and tell them that they are in the wrong ways and do bid them beware the danger then they will railingly return them answer and say as for the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the name of the king we will not hearken unto thee but we will certainly do whatsoever thing goeth forth out of our own mouth nay if you look a little farther you shall see that these ways are warned against enough not only by these posts and ditch and chain but also by being hedged up yet they will choose to go there  chr they are idle they love not to take pains uphill way is unpleasant to them so it is fulfilled unto them as it is written the way of the slothful man is a hedge of thorns yea they will rather choose to walk upon a snare than go up this hill and the rest of this way to the city  then they set forward and began to go up the hill and up the hill they went but before they got to the top christiana began to pant and said i dare say this is a breathing hill no marvel if they that love their ease more than their souls choose to themselves a smoother way then said mercy i must sit down also the least of the children began to cry come come said greatheart sit not down here for a little above is the princes arbor then took he the little boy by the hand and led him up thereto  sidenote the arbor on the hill  when they were come to the arbor they were very willing to sit down for they were all in a pelting heat then said mercy how sweet is rest to them that labor and how good is the prince of pilgrims to provide such restingplaces for them of this arbor i have heard much but i never saw it before but here let us beware of sleeping for as i have heared for that it cost poor christian dear  then said mr greatheart to the little ones come my pretty boys how do you do what think you now of going on pilgrimage  sir said the least i was almost beat out of heart but i thank you for lending me a hand at my need and i remember now what my mother has told me namely that the way to heaven is as up a ladder and the way to hell is as down a hill but i rather go up the ladder to life than the hill to death  then said mercy but the proverb is to go down the hill is easy  but james said for that was his name the day is coming when in my opinion going downhill will be the hardest of all  thats a good boy said his master thou hast given her a right answer  then mercy smiled but the little boy did blush  chr come said christiana will you eat a bit a little to sweeten your mouths while you sit here to rest your legs for i have here a piece of pomegranate which mr interpreter put in my hand just when i came out of his doors he gave me also a piece of a honeycomb and a little bottle of spirits  i thought he gave you something said mercy because he called you aside  yes so he did said the other but mercy it shall still be as i said it should when at first we came from home thou shalt be a sharer in all the good that i have because thou so willingly didst become my companion  then she gave to them and they did eat both mercy and the boys and said christiana to mr greatheart sir will you do as we and take some refreshment  but he answered you are going on pilgrimage and presently i shall return much good may have do to you at home i eat the same every day  now when they had eaten and drunk and had chatted a little longer their guide said to them the day wears away if you think good let us prepare to be going so they got up to go and the little boys went before but christiana forgot to take her bottle of spirits with her so she sent her little boy back to fetch it  then said mercy i think this is a losing place here christian lost his roll and here christiana left her bottle behind her sir what is the cause of this  so their guide made answer and said the cause is sleep or forgetfulness some sleep when they should keep awake and some forget when they should remember and this is the very cause why often at the restingplaces some pilgrims in some things come off losers pilgrims should watch and remember what they have already received under their greatest enjoyments but for want of doing so ofttimes their rejoicing ends in tears and their sunshine in a cloud witness the story of christian at this place  sidenote mistrust and timorous  when they were come to the place where mistrust and timorous met christian to persuade him to go back for fear of the lions they perceived as it were a stage and before it towards the road a broad plate with a copy of verses written thereon and underneath the reason of the raising up of that stage in that place rendered the verses were these    let him that sees this stage take heed     unto his heart and tongue   lest if he do not here he speed     as some have long agone  the words underneath the verses were this stage was built to punish such upon who through timorousness or mistrust shall be afraid to go farther on pilgrimage also on this stage both mistrust and timorous were burned through the tongue with a hot iron for endeavoring to hinder christian in his journey  then said mercy this is much like to the saying of the beloved what shall be given unto thee or what shall be done unto thee thou false tongue sharp arrows of the mighty with coals of juniper  so they went on till they came within sight of the lions now mr greatheart was a strong man so he was not afraid of a lion but yet when they were come up to the place where the lions were the boys that went before were glad to cringe behind for they were afraid of the lions so they stepped back and went behind  at this their guide smiled and said how now my boys do you love to go before when no danger doth approach and love to come behind so soon as the lions appear  now as they went up mr greatheart drew his sword with intent to make a way for the pilgrims in spite of the lions then there appeared one that it seems had taken upon him to back the lions and he said to the pilgrims guide what is the cause of your coming hither now the name of that man was grim or bloodyman because of his slaying of pilgrims and he was of the race of the giants  great then said the pilgrims guide these women and children are going on pilgrimage and this is the way they must go and go it they shall in spite of thee and the lions  grim this is not their way neither shall they go therein i am come forth to withstand them and to that end will back the lions  sidenote greatheart overcomes grim  now to say truth by reason of the fierceness of the lions and of the grim carriage of him that did back them this way had of late lain much unoccupied and was almost all grown over with grass  chr then said christiana though the highways have been unoccupied heretofore and though the travellers have been made in times past to walk through bypaths it must not be so now i am risen now i am risen a mother in israel  grim then he swore by the lions but it should and therefore bid them turn aside for they should not passage there  but greatheart their guide made first his approach unto grim and laid so heavily at him with his sword that he forced him to a retreat  grim then said he that attempted to back the lions will you slay me upon mine own ground  great it is the kings highway that we are in and in his way it is that thou hast placed thy lions but these women and these children though weak shall hold on their way in spite of thy lions  and with that he gave him again a downright blow and brought him upon his knees with this blow he also broke his helmet and with the next he cut off an arm then did the giant roar so hideously that his voice frighted the women and yet they were glad to see him lie sprawling upon the ground now the lions were chained and so of themselves could do nothing  wherefore when old grim that intended to back them was dead mr greatheart said to the pilgrims come now and follow me and no hurt shall happen to you from the lions they therefore went on but the women trembled as they passed by them the boys also looked as if they would die but they all got by without further hurt     chapter v  the palace beautiful   now then they were within sight of the porters lodge and they soon came up unto it but they made the more haste after this to go thither because it is dangerous travelling there in the night so when they were come to the gate the guide knocked and the porter cried who is there but as soon as the guide had said it is i he knew his voice and came down for the guide had oft before that come thither as a conductor of pilgrims when he was come down he opened the gate and seeing the guide stand just before it for he saw not the women for they were behind him he said unto him how now mr greatheart what is your business here so late tonight  i have brought said he some pilgrims hither where by my lords commandment they must lodge i had been here some time ago had i not been opposed by the giant that did use to back the lions but i after a long and tedious combat with him have cut him off and have brought the pilgrims hither in safety  port will you not go in and stay till morning  great no i will return to my lord tonight  chr oh sir i know not how to be willing you should leave us in our pilgrimage you have been so faithful and so loving to us you have fought so stoutly for us you have been so hearty in counselling of us that i shall never forget your favor towards us  mer then said mercy oh that we might have thy company to our journeys end how can such poor women as we hold out in a way so full of troubles as this way is without a friend and defender  james then said james the youngest of the boys pray sir be persuaded to go with us and help us because we are so weak and the way so dangerous as it is  great i am at my lords commandment if he shall allot me to be your guide quite through i will willingly wait upon you but here you failed at first for when he bid me come thus far with you then you should have begged me of him to have gone quite through with you and he would have granted your request however at present i must withdraw and so good christiana mercy and my brave children adieu  then the porter mr watchful asked christiana of her country and of her kindred and she said i come from the city of destruction i am a widow woman and my husband is dead his name was christian the pilgrim  how said the porter was he your husband  sidenote a joyful reception  yes said she and these are his children and this pointing to mercy is one of my townswomen  then the porter rang his bell as at such times he is wont and there came to the door one of the maids whose name was humblemind and to her the porter said go tell it within that christiana the wife of christian and her children are come hither on pilgrimage  she went in therefore and told it but oh what a noise for gladness was there within when the maid did but drop that word out of her mouth  so they came with haste to the porter for christiana stood still at the door then some of those within said unto her come in christiana come in thou wife of that good man come in thou blessed woman come in with all that are with thee  so she went in and they followed her that were her children and her companions now when they were gone in they were had into a very large room where they were bidden to sit down so they sat down and the chief of the house were called to see and welcome the guests then they came in and understanding who they were did salute each other with a kiss and said welcome ye that bear the grace of god welcome to us your friends  now because it was somewhat late and because the pilgrims were weary with their journey and also made faint with the sight of the fight and of the terrible lions therefore they desired as soon as might be to prepare to go to rest nay said those of the family refresh yourselves first with a morsel of meat for they had prepared for them a lamb with the accustomed sauce belonging thereto for the porter had heard before of their coming and had told it to them within so when they had supped and ended their prayer with a psalm they desired they might go to rest  but let us said christiana if we may be so bold as to choose be in that chamber that was my husbands when he was here  so they had them up thither and they lay all in a room when they were at rest christiana and mercy entered into discourse about things that were convenient  chr little did i think once when my husband went on pilgrimage that i should ever have followed  mer and you as little thought of lying in his bed and in his chamber to rest as you do now  chr and much less did i ever think of seeing his face with comfort and of worshipping the lord the king with him and yet now i believe i shall  mer hark dont you hear a noise  chr yes it is as i believe a noise of music for joy that we are here  mer wonderful music in the house music in the heart and music also in heaven for joy that we are here  sidenote mercys dream  thus they talked a while and then betook themselves to sleep so in the morning when they were awake christiana said to mercy what was the matter that you did laugh in your sleep tonight i suppose you were in a dream  mer so i was and a sweet dream it was but are you sure i laughed  chr yes you laughed heartily but prithee mercy tell me thy dream  mer i was dreaming that i sat all alone in a solitary place and was bemoaning of the hardness of my heart now i had not sat there long but methought many were gathered about me to see me and to hear what it was that i said so they hearkened and i went on bemoaning the hardness of my heart at this some of them laughed at me some called me fool and some thrust me about with that methought i looked up and saw one coming with wings towards me so he came directly to me and said mercy what aileth thee now when he had heard me make my complaint he said peace be to thee he also wiped mine eyes with his handkerchief and clad me in silver and gold he put a chain about my neck and earrings in mine ears and a beautiful crown upon my head then he took me by the hand and said mercy come after me so he went up and i followed till we came to a golden gate then he knocked and when they within opened the man went in and i followed him up to a throne upon which one sat and he said to me welcome daughter the place looked bright and twinkling like the stars or rather like the sun and i thought that i saw your husband there so i awoke from my dream but did i laugh  chr laugh ay and well you might to see yourself so well for you must give me leave to tell you that i believe it was a good dream and that as you have begun to find the first part true so you shall find the second at last god speaks once yea twice yet man perceiveth it not in a dream in a vision of the night when deep sleep falleth upon men in slumberings upon the bed we need not when abed to lie awake to talk with god he can visit us while we sleep and cause us then to hear his voice our heart oftentimes wakes when we sleep and god can speak to that either by words by proverbs or by signs and similitudes as well as if one was awake  mer well i am glad of my dream for i hope ere long to see it fulfilled to the making of me laugh again  chr i think it is now high time to rise and to know what we must do  mer pray if they invite us to stay a while let us willingly accept of the proffer i am the willinger to stay a while here to grow better acquainted with these maids methinks prudence piety and charity have very lovely and sober countenances  chr we shall see what they will do  so when they were up and ready they came down and they asked one another of their rest and if it was comfortable or not  mer very good said mercy it was one of the best nights lodging that ever i had in my life  then said prudence and piety if you will be persuaded to stay here a while you shall have what the house will afford  char ay and that with a very good will said charity  so they consented and stayed there about a month or above and became very profitable one to another  sidenote mr brisk visits mercy  now by that these pilgrims had been at this place a week mercy had a visitor that pretended some goodwill unto her and his name was mr brisk a man of some breeding and that pretended to religion but a man that stuck very close to the world so he came once or twice or more to mercy and offered love unto her now mercy was a fair countenance and therefore the more alluring  her mind also was to be always busying of herself in doing for when she had nothing to do for herself she would be making of hose and garments for others and would bestow them upon them that had need and mr brisk not knowing where or how she disposed of what she made seemed to be greatly taken for that he found her never idle i will warrant her a good housewife quoth he to himself  mercy then told the matter to the maidens that were of the house and inquired of them concerning him for they did know him better than she so they told her that he was a very busy young man and one who pretended to serve the lord but was as they feared a stranger to the power of that which is good  nay then said mercy i will look no more on him for i purpose never to have a clog to my soul  prudence then replied that there needed no great matter of discouragement to be given to him her continuing so as she had begun to do for the poor would quickly cool his courage  so the next time he comes he finds her at her old work amaking of things for the poor then said he what always at it  yes said she either for myself or for others  and what canst thou earn a day quoth he  i do these things said she that i may be rich in good works laying up in store for myself a good foundation against the time to come that i may lay hold on eternal life  why prithee what doest thou with them said he  clothe the naked said she  with that his countenance fell so he forbore to come at her again and when he was asked the reason why he said that mercy was a pretty lass but troubled with too much working for others  sidenote mercy rejects the suitor  when he had left her prudence said did i not tell thee that mr brisk would soon forsake thee yea he will raise up an ill report of thee for notwithstanding his pretence to serve bad and his seeming love to mercy yet mercy and he are of tempers so different that i believe they will never come together  mer i might have had husbands afore now though i spake not of it to any but they were such as did not like my ways though never did any of them find fault with my person so they and i could not agree  prud mercy in our days is little set by any further than as to its name the practice which is set forth by thy works there are but few that can abide  mer well said mercy if nobody will have me i will die a maid or my works shall be to me as a husband for i cannot change my nature and to have one that lies cross to me in this that i purpose never to admit of as long as i live i had a sister named bountiful that was married to one of these selfish people but he and she could never agree but because my sister was resolved to do as she had begun that is to show kindness to the poor therefore her husband first cried her down in public and then turned her out of his doors  prud and yet he was a churchmember i warrant you  mer yes such a one as he was and of such as he the world is now full but i am for none of them at all  sidenote matthew falls sick  now matthew the eldest son of christiana fell sick and his sickness was sore upon him for he was much pained in his bowels so that he was with it at times pulled as it were both ends together  there dwelt also not far from thence one mr skill an ancient and wellapproved physician so christiana desired it and they sent for him and he came when he was entered the room and had a little observed the boy he concluded that he was sick of the gripes then he said to his mother what diet has matthew of late fed upon  diet said christiana nothing but that which is wholesome  the physician answered this boy has been tampering with something that lies in his stomach undigested and that will not away without means and i tell you he must be purged or else he will die  sam then said samuel mother what was that which my brother did gather up and eat so soon as we were come from the gate that is at the head of this way you know that there was an orchard on the left hand on the other side of the wall and some of the trees hung over the wall and my brother did pull down the branches and did eat  chr true my child said christiana he did take thereof and did eat naughty boy as he was i did chide him and yet he would eat thereof  skill i knew he had eaten something that was not wholesome food and that food to wit that fruit is even the most hurtful of all it is the fruit of beelzebubs orchard i do marvel that none did warn you of it many have died thereof  chr then christiana began to cry and she said oh naughty boy and oh careless mother what shall i do for my son  skill come do not be too much dejected the boy may do well again but he must purge and vomit  chr pray sir try the utmost of your skill with him whatever it costs  skill nay i hope i shall be reasonable  sidenote doctor skill prescribes  so he made him a purge but it was too weak it was said it was made of the blood of a goat the ashes of an heifer and with some of the juice of hyssop etc when mr skill had seen that that purge was too weak he made him one to the purpose it was made the name was written in latin ex carne et sanguine christi8 you know physicians give strange medicines to their patientsand it was made up into pills with a promise or two and a proportionable quantity of salt now he was to take them three at a time fasting in half a quarter of a pint of the tears of sorrow    8 that is of the body and blood of christ  when this potion was prepared and brought to the boy he was loth to take it though torn with the gripes as if he should be pulled in pieces  come come said the physician you must take it  it goes against my stomach said the boy  i must have you take it said his mother  i shall vomit it up again said the boy  pray sir said christiana to mr skill how does it taste  it has no ill taste said the doctor and with that she touched one of the pills with the tip of her tongue  o matthew said she this potion is sweeter than honey if thou lovest thy mother if thou lovest thy brothers if thou lovest mercy if thou lovest thy life take it  so with much ado after a short prayer for the blessing of god upon it he took it and it wrought kindly with him it caused him to purge it caused him to sleep and rest quietly it put him into a fine heat and breathing sweat and did quite rid him of his gripes so in a little time he got up and walked about with a staff and would go from room to room and talk with prudence piety and charity of his sickness and how he was healed  so when the boy was healed christiana asked mr skill saying sir what will content you for your pains and care to and of my child  and he said you must pay the master of the college of physicians according to the rules made in that case and provided  chr but sir said she what is this pill good for else  skill it is an universal pill it is good against all the diseases that pilgrims are troubled with and when it is well prepared it will keep good time out of mind  chr pray sir make me up twelve boxes of them for if i can get these i will never take other physic  skill these pills are good to prevent diseases as well as to cure when one is sick yea i dare say it and stand to it that if a man will but use this physic as he should it will make him live for ever but good christiana thou must give these pills no other way than as i have prescribed for if you do they will do no good so he gave unto christiana physic for herself and her boys and for mercy and bid matthew take heed how he ate any more green plums and kissed them and went his way  it was told you before that prudence bid the boys if at any time they would they should ask her some questions that might be profitable and she would say something to them  matt then matthew who had been sick asked her why for the most part physic should be bitter to our palates  prud to show how unwelcome the word of god and the effects thereof are to a sinful heart  matt why does physic if it does good purge and cause that we vomit  prud to show that the word when it works effectually cleanseth the heart and mind for look what the one doth to the body the other doth to the soul  matt what should we learn by seeing the flame of our fire go upwards and by seeing the beams and sweet influences of the sun strike downwards  prud by the going up of the fire we are taught to ascend to heaven by fervent and hot desires and by the suns sending his heat beams and sweet influences downwards we are taught that the saviour of the world though high reaches down with his grace and love to us below  matt where have the clouds their water  prud out of the sea  matt what may we learn from that  prud that ministers should fetch their teaching from god  matt why do they empty themselves upon the earth  prud to show that ministers should give out what they know of god to the world  matt why is the rainbow caused by the sun  prud to show that the promise of gods grace is made sure to us in christ  matt why do the springs come from the sea to us through the earth  prud to show that the grace of god comes to us through the body of christ  matt why do some of the springs rise out of the tops of high hills  prud to show that the spirit of grace shall spring up in some that are great and mighty as well as in many that are poor and low  matt why doth the fire fasten upon the candlewick  prud to show that unless grace doth kindle upon the heart there will be no true light of life in us  matt why is the wick and tallow and all spent to maintain the light of the candle  prud to show that body and soul and all should be at the service of and spend themselves to maintain in good condition that grace of god that is in us  matt why doth the pelican pierce her own breast with her bill  prud to nourish her young ones with her blood and thereby to show that christ the blessed so loveth his young his people as to save them from death by his blood  matt what may one learn by hearing the cock to crow  prud learn to remember peters sin and peters sorrow the cocks crowing shows also that day is coming on let then the crowing of the cock put thee in mind of that last and terrible day of judgment  now about this time their month was out wherefore they signified to those of the house that it was convenient for them to be up and going then said joseph to his mother it is convenient that you forget not to send to the house of mr interpreter to pray him to grant that mr greatheart should be sent unto us that he may be our conductor the rest of our way  good boy said she i had almost forgot so she drew up a petition and prayed mr watchful the porter to send it by some fit man to her good friend mr interpreter who when it was come and he had seen the contents of the petition said to the messenger go tell them that i will send him  when the family where christiana was saw that they had a purpose to go forward they called the whole house together to give thanks to their king for sending of them such profitable guests as these which done they said unto christiana and shall we not show thee something according as our custom is to do to pilgrims on which thou mayest meditate when thou art upon the way  sidenote the pilgrims view curiosities  so they took christiana her children and mercy into the closet and showed them one of the apples that eve did eat of and that which she also did give to her husband and that for the eating of which they were both turned out of paradise and asked her what she thought that was  then christiana said it is food or poison i know not which  so they opened the matter to her and she held up her hands and wondered  then they had her to a place and showed her jacobs ladder now at that time there were some angels ascending upon it so christiana looked and looked to see the angels go up and so did the rest of the company then they were going into another place to show them something else but james said to his mother pray bid them stay here a little longer for this is a curious sight so they turned again and stood feeding their eyes with this so pleasing a prospect  after this they had them into a place where did hang up a golden anchor so they bid christiana take it down for said they you shall have it with you for it is of absolute necessity that you should that you may lay hold of that within the veil and stand steadfast in case you should meet with turbulent weather so they were glad thereof  then they took them and had them to the mount upon which abraham our father had offered up isaac his son and showed them the altar the wood the fire and the knife for they remain to be seen to this very day when they had seen it they held up their hands and blessed themselves and said oh what a man for love to his master and for denial to himself was abraham  after they had showed them all these things prudence took them into the diningroom where stood a pair of excellent virginals9 so she played upon them and turned what she had showed them into this excellent song saying    eves apple we have showèd you     of that be you aware   you have seen jacobs ladder too     upon which angels are   an anchor you receivèd have     but let not these suffice   until with abram you have gave     your best a sacrifice    9 an instrument of music used in the time of john bunyan somewhat   like a very small piano  sidenote greatheart conducts them  now about this time one knocked at the door so the porter opened and behold mr greatheart was there but when he was come in what joy was there for it came now fresh again into their minds how but a while ago he had slain old grim bloodyman the giant and had delivered them from the lions  then said mr greatheart to christiana and to mercy my lord has sent each of you a bottle of wine and also some parched corn together with a couple of pomegranates he has also sent the boys some figs and raisins to refresh you in your way  then they addressed themselves to their journey and prudence and piety went along with them when they came at the gate christiana asked the porter if any one of late went by  he said no only one some time since who also told me that of late there had been a great robbery committed on the kings highway as you go but he saith the thieves are taken and will shortly be tried for their lives  then christiana and mercy were afraid but matthew said mother fear nothing as long as mr greatheart is to go with us and to be our conductor  then said christiana to the porter sir i am much obliged to you for all the kindnesses that you have shown me since i came hither and also for that you have been so loving and kind to my children i know not how to gratify your kindness wherefore pray as a token of my respects to you accept of this small mite  so she put a gold angel10 in his hand and he made her a low obeisance and said let thy garments be always white and let thy head want no ointment let mercy live and not die and let not her works be few and to the boys he said do you flee youthful passions and follow after godliness with them that are grave and wise so shall you put gladness into your mothers heart and obtain praise of all that are soberminded    10 an old english coin bearing the figure of an angel  so they thanked the porter and departed  now i saw in my dream that they went forward until they were come to the brow of the hill where piety bethinking herself cried out alas i have forgot what i intended to bestow upon christiana and her companions i will go back and fetch it so she ran and fetched it while she was gone christiana thought she heard in a grove a little way off on the right hand a most curious melodious note with words much like these    through all my life thy favor is     so frankly showed to me   that in thy house for evermore     my dwellingplace shall be  and listening still she thought she heard another answer it saying    for why the lord our god is good     his mercy is for ever sure   his truth at all times firmly stood     and shall from age to age endure  so christiana asked prudence what it was that made those curious notes they are said she our country birds they sing these notes but seldom except it be at the spring when the flowers appear and the sun shines warm and then you may hear them all day long i often said she go out to hear them we also ofttimes keep them tame in our house they are very fine company for us when we are melancholy also they make the woods and groves and solitary places places desirable to be in  by this time piety was come again so she said to christiana look here i have brought thee a plan of all those things that thou hast seen at our house upon which thou mayest look when thou findest thyself forgetful and call those things again to remembrance for thy teaching and comfort     chapter vi  the valley of humiliation   now they began to go down the hill into the valley of humiliation it was a steep hill and the way was slippery but they were very careful so they got down pretty well when they were down in the valley piety said to christiana this is the place where christian your husband met with the foul fiend apollyon and where they had that dreadful fight that they had i know you cannot but have heard thereof but be of good courage as long as you have here mr greatheart to be your guide and conductor we hope you will fare the better  so when these two had given the pilgrims unto the care of their guide he went forward and they went after  great then said mr greatheart we need not to be so afraid of this valley for here is nothing to hurt us unless we procure it to ourselves it is true that christian did here meet with apollyon with whom he had also a sore combat but that fray was the fruit of those slips that he got in his going down the hill for they that get slips there must look for combats here and hence it is that this valley has got so hard a name for the common people when they hear that some frightful thing has befallen such a one in such a place are of an opinion that that place is haunted with some foul fiend or evil spirit when alas it is for the fruit of their doing that such things do befall them there this valley of humiliation is of itself as fruitful a place as any the crow flies over and i am persuaded if we could hit upon it we might find somewhere hereabouts something that might give us an account why christian was so hardly beset in this place  then james said to his mother lo yonder stands a pillar and it looks as if something was written thereon let us go and see what it is so they went and found there written let christians slips before he came hither and the battles that he met with in this place be a warning to those that come after  lo said their guide did not i tell you that there was something hereabouts that would give intimation of the reason why christian was so hard beset in this place then turning himself to christiana he said no disgrace to christian more than to many others whose hap and loss his was for it is easier going up than down this hill and that can be said but of few hills in all these parts of the world but we will leave the good man he is at rest he also had a brave victory over his enemy let him that dwelleth above grant that we fare no worse when we come to be tried than he  but we will come again to this valley of humiliation it is the best and most fruitful piece of ground in all these parts it is fat ground and as you see consisteth much in meadows and if a man was to come here in the summertime as we do now if he knew not anything before thereof and if he also delighted himself in the sight of his eyes he might see that that would be delightful to him behold how green this valley is also how beautified with lilies i have also known many laboring men that have got good estates in this valley of humiliation for god resisteth the proud but giveth grace to the humble indeed it is a very fruitful soil and doth bring forth by handfuls some also have wished that the next way to their fathers house were here that they might be troubled no more with either hills or mountains to go over but the way is the way and theres an end  now as they were going along and talking they espied a boy feeding his fathers sheep the boy was in very mean clothes but of a very fresh and wellfavored countenance and as he sat by himself he sang hark said mr greatheart to what the shepherds boy saith so they hearkened and he said    he that is down needs fear no fall     he that is low no pride   he that is humble ever shall     have god to be his guide    i am content with what i have     little be it or much   and lord contentment still i crave     because thou savest much    fulness to such a burden is     that go on pilgrimage   here little and hereafter bliss     is best from age to age  then said their guide do you hear him i will dare to say that this boy lives a merrier life and wears more of that herb called heartsease in his bosom than he that is clad in silk and velvet but we will proceed in our account of this valley  in this valley our lord formerly had his country house he loved much to be here he loved also to walk these meadows for he found the air was pleasant besides here a man shall be free from the noise and from the hurryings of this life all states are full of noise and confusion only the valley of humiliation is that empty and solitary place here a man shall not be so let and hindered in his thoughts as in other places he is apt to be this is a valley that nobody walks in but those that love a pilgrims life and though christian had the hard hap to meet here with apollyon and to enter with him into a brisk encounter yet i must tell you that in former times men have met with angels here have found pearls here and have in this place found the words of life  did i say our lord had here in former days his country house and that he loved here to walk i will add in this place and to the people that love to tread these grounds he has left a yearly sum of money to be faithfully paid them at certain seasons for their support by the way and for their further encouragement to go on their pilgrimage  sam now as they went on samuel said to mr greatheart sir i perceive that in this valley my father and apollyon had their battle but whereabout was the fight for i perceive this valley is large  sidenote forgetful green  great your father had that battle with apollyon at a place yonder before us in a narrow passage just beyond forgetful green and indeed that place is the most dangerous place in all these parts for if at any time the pilgrims meet with any brunt it is when they forget what favors they have received and how unworthy they are of them this is the place also where others have been hard put to it but more of the place when we are come to it for i persuade myself that to this day there remains either some sign of the battle or some monument to testify that such a battle there was fought  mer then said mercy i think that i am as well in this valley as i have been anywhere else in all our journey the place methinks suits with my spirit i love to be in such places where there is no rattling with coaches nor rumbling with wheels methinks here one may without much trouble be thinking what he is whence he came what he has done and to what the king has called him here one may think and break at heart and melt in ones spirit until ones eyes become like the fishpools in heshbon they that go rightly through this valley of baca make it a well the rain that god sends down from heaven upon them that are here also filleth the pools this valley is that from whence also the king will give to his their vineyards and they that go through it shall sing as christian did for all he met with apollyon  great tis true said their guide i have gone through this valley many a time and never was better than when here i have also been a conductor to several pilgrims and they have confessed the same to this man will i look saith the king even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit and that trembleth at my word  now they were come to the place where the aforementioned battle was fought then said the guide to christiana her children and mercy this is the place on this ground christian stood and up there came apollyon against him and lookdid not i tell youhere is some of your husbands blood upon these stones to this day behold also how here and there are yet to be seen upon the place some of the shivers of apollyons broken darts see also how they did beat the ground with their feet as they fought to make good their places against each other how also with their byblows they did split the very stones in pieces verily christian did here play the man and showed himself as stout as could had he been there even hercules himself when apollyon was beat he made his retreat to the next valley that is called the valley of the shadow of death unto which we shall come soon lo yonder also stands a monument on which is engraven this battle and christians victory to his fame throughout all ages  sidenote valley of shadow of death  so because it stood just on the wayside before them they stepped to it and read the writing which word for word was this    hard by here was a battle fought     most strange and yet most true   christian and apollyon sought     each other to subdue    the man so bravely played the man     he made the fiend to fly   of which a monument i stand     the same to testify  when they had passed by this place they came upon the borders of the shadow of death this valley was longer than the other a place also most strangely haunted with evil things as many are able to testify but these women and children went the better through it because they had daylight and because mr greatheart was their conductor  when they were entered upon this valley they thought that they heard a groaning as of dead mena very great groaning they thought also that they did hear words of moaning spoken as of some in extreme torment these things made the boys to quake the women also looked pale and wan but their guide bid them be of good comfort  so they went on a little farther and they thought that they felt the ground begin to shake under them as if some hollow place was there they heard also a kind of hissing as of serpents but nothing as yet appeared then said the boys are we not yet at the end of this doleful place but the guide also bid them be of good courage and look well to their feet lest haply said he you be taken in some snare  now james began to be sick but i think the cause thereof was fear so his mother gave him some of that glass of spirits that had been given her at the interpreters house and three of the pills that mr skill had prepared and the boy began to revive thus they went on till they came to about the middle of the valley and then christiana said methinks i see something yonder upon the road before us a thing of such a shape as i have not seen then said joseph mother what is it an ugly thing child an ugly thing said she but mother what is it like said he tis like i cannot tell what said she and now it is but a little way off then said she it is nigh  sidenote resist the devil  well well said mr greatheart let them that are most afraid keep close to me so the fiend came on and the conductor met it but when it was just come to him it vanished to all their sights then remembered they what had been said some time ago resist the devil and he will flee from you  they went therefore on as being a little refreshed but they had not gone far before mercy looking behind her saw as she thought something most like a lion and it came a great padding pace after and it had a hollow voice of roaring and at every roar that it gave it made all the valley echo and all their hearts to ache save the heart of him that was their guide so it came up and mr greatheart went behind and put the pilgrims all before him the lion also came on apace and mr greatheart addressed himself to give him battle but when he saw that it was determined that resistance should be made he also drew back and came no farther  they then went on again and their conductor did go before them till they came to a place where was cast up a pit the whole breadth of the way and before they could be prepared to go over that a great mist and darkness fell upon them so that they could not see then said the pilgrims alas what now shall we do but their guide made answer fear not stand still and see what an end will be put to this also so they stayed there because their path was marred they then also thought that they did hear more apparently the noise and rushing of the enemies the fire also and the smoke of the pit were much easier to be discerned then said christiana to mercy now i see what my poor husband went through i have heard much of this place but i never was here before now poor man he went here all alone in the night he had night almost quite through the way also these fiends were busy about him as if they would have torn him in pieces many have spoken of it but none can tell what the valley of the shadow of death should mean until they come in it themselves the heart knoweth its own bitterness and a stranger intermeddleth not with its joy to be here is a fearful thing  great this is like doing business in great waters or like going down into the deep this is like being in the heart of the sea and like going down to the bottoms of the mountains now it seems as if the earth with its bars were about us for ever but let them that walk in darkness and have no light trust in the name of the lord and stay upon their god for my part as i have told you already i have gone often through this valley and have been much harder put to it than now i am and yet you see i am alive i would not boast for that i am not mine own saviour but i trust we shall have a good deliverance come let us pray for light to him that can lighten our darkness and that can rebuke not only these but all the satans in hell  so they cried and prayed and god sent light and deliverance for there was now no hindrance in their way no not there where but now they were stopped with a pit yet they were not got through the valley so they went on still and behold great stinks and loathsome smells to the great annoyance of them then said mercy to christiana it is not so pleasant being here as at the gate or at the interpreters or at the house where we lay last  oh but said one of the boys it is not so bad to go through here as it is to abide here always and for aught i know one reason why we must go this way to the house prepared for us is that our home might be made the sweeter to us  well said samuel quoth the guide thou hast now spoke like a man  why if ever i get out here again said the boy i think i shall prize light and good way better than ever i did in all my life  then said the guide we shall be out byandby  so on they went and joseph said cannot we see to the end of this valley as yet  sidenote among the snares  then said the guide look to your feet for we shall presently be among the snares  so they looked to their feet and went on but they were troubled much with the snares now when they were come among the snares they espied a man cast into the ditch on the left hand with his flesh all rent and torn  then said the guide that is one heedless that was going this way he has lain there a great while there was one takeheed with him when he was taken and slain but he escaped their hands you cannot imagine how many are killed hereabouts and yet men are so foolishly venturous as to set out lightly on pilgrimage and to come without a guide poor christian it is a wonder that he here escaped but he was beloved of his god also he had a good heart of his own or else he could never have done it  sidenote greatheart encounters maul  now they drew towards the end of the way and just where christian had seen the cave when he went by out thence came forth maul a giant this maul did use to spoil young pilgrims by deceiving them and he called greatheart by his name and said unto him how many times have you been forbidden to do these things  then said mr greatheart what things  what things quoth the giant you know what things but i will put an end to your trade  but pray said mr greatheart before we fall to it let us understand wherefore we must fight  now the women and children stood trembling and knew not what to do  quoth the giant you rob the country and rob it with the worst of thefts  these are but random words said mr greatheart tell what robberies i have done man  then said the giant thou practicest the craft of a kidnapper thou gatherest up women and children and carriest them into a strange country to the weakening of my masters kingdom  but now greatheart replied i am a servant of the god of heaven my business is to persuade sinners to turn to god i am commanded to do my best to turn men women and children from darkness to light and from the power of satan unto god and if this be indeed the ground of thy quarrel let us fall to it as soon as thou wilt  sidenote the giant is slain  then the giant came up and mr greatheart went to meet him and as he went he drew his sword but the giant had a club so without more ado they fell to it and at the first blow the giant struck mr greatheart down upon one of his knees with that the women and children cried out so mr greatheart recovering himself laid about him in full lusty manner and gave the giant a wound in his arm thus he fought for the space of an hour to that height of heat that the breath came out of the giants nostrils as the heat doth out of a boiling cauldron  then they sat down to rest them but mr greatheart betook himself to prayer also the women and children did nothing but sigh and cry all the time that the battle did last  when they had rested them and taken breath they both fell to it again and mr greatheart with a blow fetched the giant down to the ground nay hold and let me recover quoth he so mr greatheart fairly let him get up so to it they went again and the giant missed but little of breaking mr greathearts skull with his club  mr greatheart seeing that runs to him in the full heat of his spirit and pierceth him under the fifth rib with that the giant began to faint and could hold up his club no longer then mr greatheart seconded his blow and smote the head of the giant from his shoulders then the women and the children rejoiced and mr greatheart also praised god for the deliverance he had wrought  when this was done they amongst them erected a pillar and fastened the giants head thereon and wrote under it in letters that passengers might read    he that did wear this head was one     that pilgrims did misuse   he stopped their way he spared none     but did them all abuse   until that i greatheart arose     the pilgrims guide to be   until that i did him oppose     that was their enemy  now i saw that they went to the high ground that was a little way off cast up to be a prospect for pilgrims that was the place from whence christiana had the first sight of faithful his brother wherefore here they sat down and rested they also here did eat and drink and make merry for that they had gotten deliverance from this so dangerous an enemy as they sat thus and did eat christiana asked the guide if he had caught no hurt in the battle then said mr greatheart no save a little on my flesh yet that also shall be so far from being to my harm that it is at present a proof of my love to my master and you and shall be a means by grace to increase my reward at last  chr but were you not afraid good sir when you saw him come out with his club  great it is my duty said he to mistrust my own ability that i may have trust in him who is stronger than all  chr but what did you think when he fetched you down to the ground at the first blow  great why i thought replied he that so my master himself was served and yet he it was that conquered at the last  matt when you all have thought what you please i think god has been wonderful good unto us both in bringing us out of this valley and in delivering us out of the hand of this enemy for my part i see no reason why we should distrust our god any more since he has now and in such a place as this given us such proof of his love as this  sidenote old honest  then they got up and went forward now a little before them stood an oak and under it when they came to it they found an old pilgrim fast asleep they knew that he was a pilgrim by his clothes and his staff and his girdle  so the guide mr greatheart awaked him and the old gentleman as he lifted up his eyes cried out whats the matter what are you and what is your business here  great come man be not so hot here are none but friends  yet the old man gets up and stands upon his guard and will know of them what they are then said the guide my name is greatheart i am the guide of these pilgrims that are going to the celestial country  honest then said mr honest i cry you mercy i feared that you had been of the company of those that some time ago did rob littlefaith of his money but now i look better about me i perceive you are honester people  great why what would or could you have done to have helped yourself if we indeed had been of that company  hon done why i would have fought as long as breath had been in me and had i so done i am sure you could never have given me the worst ont for a christian can never be overcome unless he shall yield of himself  great well said father honest quoth the guide for by this i know thou art a cock of the right kind for thou hast said the truth  hon and by this also i know that thou knowest what true pilgrimage is for all others do think that we are the soonest overcome of any  sidenote converses with honest  great well now we are so happily met pray let me crave your name and the name of the place you came from  hon my name i cannot but i came from the town of stupidity it lieth about four degrees beyond the city of destruction  great oh are you that countryman then i deem i have half a guess of you your name is old honesty is it not  hon so the old gentleman blushed and said not honesty but honest is my name and i wish that my nature may agree to what i am called but sir said the old gentleman how could you guess that i am such a man since i came from such a place  great i had heard of you before by my master for he knows all things that are done on the earth but i have often wondered that any should come from your place for your town is worse than is the city of destruction itself  hon yes we lie more off from the sun and so are more cold and senseless but were a man in a mountain of ice yet if the sun of righteousness should rise upon him his frozen heart shall feel a thaw and thus it hath been with me  great i believe it father honest i believe it for i know the thing is true  then the old gentleman saluted all the pilgrims with a holy kiss of love and asked them their names and how they had fared since they had set out on their pilgrimage  chr then said christiana my name i suppose you have heard of good christian was my husband and these are his children  but can you think how the old gentleman was taken when she told him who she was he skipped he smiled he blessed them with a thousand good wishes saying  hon i have heard much of your husband and of his travels and wars which he underwent in his days be it spoken to your comfort the name of your husband rings all over these parts of the world his faith his courage his enduring and his sincerity under all have made his name famous then he turned him to the boys and asked of them their names which they told him then he said unto them matthew be thou like matthew the publican not in vice but in virtue samuel said he be thou like samuel the prophet a man of faith and prayer joseph said he be thou like joseph in potiphars house pure and one that flees from temptation and james be thou like james the just and like james the brother of our lord then they told him of mercy and how she had left her town and her kindred to come along with christiana and with her sons at that the old honest man said mercy is thy name by mercy shalt thou be sustained and carried through all those difficulties that shall attack thee in thy way till thou shalt come thither where thou shalt look the fountain of mercy in the face with comfort  all this while the guide mr greatheart was very well pleased and smiled upon his companion  sidenote they discuss mr fearing  now as they walked along together the guide asked the old gentleman if he did not know one mr fearing that came on pilgrimage out of his parts  hon yes very well said he he was a man that had the root of the matter in him but he was one of the most troublesome pilgrims that ever i met with in all my days  great i perceive you knew him for you have given a very right character of him  hon knew him i was a great companion of his i was with him most an end when he first began to think upon what would come upon us hereafter i was with him  great i was his guide from my masters house to the gates of the celestial city  hon then you knew him to be a troublesome one  great i did so but i could very well bear it for men of my calling are oftentimes entrusted with the conduct of such as he was  hon well then pray let us hear a little of him and how he managed himself under your conduct  great why he was always afraid that he should come short of whither he had a desire to go everything frightened him that he heard anybody speak of if it had but the least appearance of opposition in it i hear that he lay roaring at the slough of despond for above a month together nor durst he for all he saw several go over before him venture though they many of them offered to lend him their hand he would not go back again neither the celestial city he said he should die if he came not to it and yet was discouraged at every difficulty and stumbled at every straw that anybody cast in his way well after he had lain at the slough of despond a great while as i have told you one sunshine morning i dont know how he ventured and so got over but when he was over he would scarce believe it he had i think a slough of despond in his mind a slough that he carried everywhere with him or else he could never have been as he was so he came up to the gate you know what i mean that stands at the head of this way and here also he stood a good while before he would venture to knock when the gate was opened he would give back and give place to others and say that he was not worthy for for all he got before some to the gate yet many of them went in before him there the poor man would stand shaking and shrinking i dare say it would have pitied ones heart to have seen him nor would he go back again at last he took the hammer that hanged on the gate in his hand and gave a small rap or two then one opened to him but he shrank back as before he that opened stepped out after him and said thou trembling one what wantest thou with that he fell down to the ground he that spoke to him wondered to see him so faint so he said to him peace be to thee up for i have set open the door to thee come in for thou are blessed with that he got up and went in trembling and when he was in he was ashamed to show his face well after he had been entertained there a while as you know how the manner is he was bid go on his way and also told the way he should take so he came till he came to our house but as he behaved himself at the gate so he did at my master the interpreters door he lay thereabout in the cold a good while before he would venture to call yet he would not go back and the nights were long and cold then nay he had a note of need in his bosom to my master to receive him and grant him the comfort of his house and also to allow him a stout and valiant conductor because he was himself so chickenhearted a man and yet for all that he was afraid to call at the door so he lay up and down thereabouts till poor man he was almost starved yea so great was his fear though he had seen several others for knocking get in yet he was afraid to venture at last i think i looked out of the window and perceiving a man to be up and down about the door i went out to him and asked what he was but poor man the water stood in his eyes so i perceived what he wanted i went therefore in and told it in the house and we showed the things to our lord so he sent me out again to entreat him to come in but i dare say i had hard work to do it at last he came in and i will say that for my lord he carried it wonderful lovingly to him there were but few good bits at the table but some of it was laid upon his trencher then he presented the note and my lord looked thereon and said his desire should be granted so when he had been there a good while he seemed to get some heart and to be a little more comfortable for my master you must know is one of very tender heart specially to them that are afraid wherefore he carried it so towards him as might tend most to his encouragement well when he had a sight of the things of the place and was ready to take his journey to go to the city my lord as he did to christian before gave him a bottle of spirits and some comfortable things to eat thus we set forward and i went before him but the man was but of few words only he would sigh aloud  sidenote greathearts reminiscences  when we were come to the place where the three fellows were hanged he said that he doubted that that would be his end also only he seemed glad when he saw the cross and the sepulchre there i confess he desired to stay a little to look and he seemed for a little while after to be a little cheery when we came at the hill difficulty he made no stick at that nor did he much fear the lions for you must know that his trouble was not about such things as those his fear was about his acceptance at last  i got him in at the house beautiful i think before he was willing also when he was in i brought him acquainted with the damsels that were of the place but he was ashamed to make himself much for company he desired much to be alone yet he always loved good talk and often would get behind the screen to hear it he also loved much to see ancient things and to be pondering them in his mind he told me afterwards that he loved to be in those two houses from which he came last to wit at the gate and that of the interpreter but that he durst not be so bold as to ask  when we went also from the house beautiful down the hill into the valley of humiliation he went down as well as ever i saw a man in my life for he cared not how mean he was so he might be happy at last yea i think there was a kind of sympathy betwixt that valley and him for i never saw him better in all his pilgrimage than when he was in that valley  here he would lie down embrace the ground and kiss the very flowers that grew in this valley he would now be up every morning by break of day tracing and walking to and fro in this valley  but when he was come to the entrance of the valley of the shadow of death i thought i should have lost my man not for that he had any inclination to go backthat he always abhorred but he was ready to die for fear oh the hobgoblins will have me the hobgoblins will have me cried he and i could not beat him out of it he made such a noise and such an outcry here that had they but heard him it was enough to encourage them to come and fall upon us  but this i took very great notice of that this valley was as quiet while we went through it as ever i knew it before or since i suppose those enemies here had now a special check from our lord and a command not to meddle until mr fearing had passed over it  sidenote fearing at vanity fair  it would be too tedious to tell you of all i will therefore only mention a passage or two more when he was come at vanity fair i thought he would have fought with all the men in the fair i feared there we should both have been knocked on the head so hot was he against their fooleries upon the enchanted ground he was also very wakeful but when he was come at the river where was no bridge there again he was in a heavy case now now he said he should be drowned for ever and so never see that face with comfort that he had come so many miles to behold  and here also i took notice of what was very remarkable the water of that river was lower at this time than ever i saw it in all my life so he went over at last not much above wetshod when he was going up to the gate i began to take leave of him and to wish him a good reception above so he said i shall i shall then parted we asunder and i saw him no more  hon then it seems he was well at last  great yes yes i never had a doubt about him he was a man of choice spirit only he was always kept very low and that made his life so burthensome to himself and so troublesome to others he was above many tender of sin he was so afraid of doing injuries to others that he often would deny himself of that which was lawful because he would not offend  hon but what should be the reason that such a good man should be all his days so much in the dark  great there are two sorts of reasons for it one is the wise god will have it so some must pipe and some must weep now mr fearing was one that played upon this bass he and his fellows sound the sackbut whose notes are more doleful than the notes of other music are though indeed some say the bass is the ground of music and for my part i care not at all for that profession which begins not in heaviness of mind the first string that the musician usually touches is the bass when he intends to put all in tune god also plays upon this string first when he sets the soul in tune for himself only here was the imperfection of mr fearing he could play upon no other music but this till toward his latter end  i make bold to talk thus in figures for the ripening of the wits of young readers and because in the book of the revelation the saved are compared to a company of musicians that play upon their trumpets and harps and sing their songs before the throne  hon he was a very zealous man as one may see by the relation which you have given of him difficulties lions or vanity fair he feared not at all it was only sin death and hell that were to him a terror because he had some doubts about his interest in that celestial country  great you say right those were the things that were his troublers and they as you have well observed arose from the weakness of his mind thereabout not from weakness of spirit as to the practical part of a pilgrims life i dare believe that as the proverb is he would have bit a firebrand had it stood in his way but the things with which he was oppressed no man ever yet could shake off with ease  chr then said christiana this relation of mr fearing has done me good i thought nobody had been like me but i see there was some semblance betwixt this good man and i only we differed in two things his troubles were so great that they broke out but mine i kept within his also lay so hard upon him they made him that he could not knock at the houses provided for entertainment but my trouble was always such as made me knock the louder  mer if i might also speak my heart i must say that something of him has also dwelt in me for i have ever been more afraid of the lake and the loss of a place in paradise than i have been of the loss of other things oh thought i may i have the happiness to have a habitation there it is enough though i part with all the world to win it  matt then said matthew fear was one thing that made me think that i was far from having that within me which makes me sure of being saved but if it were so with such a good man as he why may it not also go well with me  james no fears no grace said james though there is not always grace where there is the fear of hell yet to be sure there is no grace where there is no fear of god  great well said james thou hast hit the mark for the fear of god is the beginning of wisdom and to be sure they that want the beginning have neither middle nor end but we will here conclude our discourse of mr fearing after we have sent after him this farewell    well master fearing thou didst fear     thy god and wast afraid   of doing anything while here     that would have thee betrayed    and didst thou fear the lake and pit     would others did so too   for as for them that want thy wit     they do themselves undo  sidenote honest tells of mr selfwill  now i saw that they still went on in their talk for after mr greatheart had made an end with mr fearing mr honest began to tell them of another but his name was mr selfwill he pretended himself to be a pilgrim said mr honest but i persuade myself he never came in at the gate that stands at the head of the way  great had you ever any talk with him about it  hon yes more than once or twice but he would always be like himself selfwilled he neither cared for man nor argument nor yet example what his mind prompted him to that he would do and nothing else could he be got to do  great pray what principles did he hold for i suppose you can tell  hon he held that a man might follow the sins as well as the virtues of pilgrims and that if he did both he should be certainly saved  great how if he had said it is possible for the best to be guilty of the vices as well as to partake of the virtues of pilgrims he could not much have been blamed for indeed we are free from no sin absolutely but on condition that we watch and strive but this i perceive is not the thing but if i understood you right your meaning is that he was of opinion that it was allowable so to be  hon ay ay so i mean and so he believed and acted  great but what grounds had he for his so saying  hon why he said he had the scripture for his warrant  sidenote honest quotes selfwill  great prithee mr honest present us with a few particulars  hon so i will he said to have to do with other mens wives had been practiced by david gods beloved and therefore he could do it he said to have more women than one was a thing that solomon practiced and therefore he could do it he said that sarah lied and so did rahab and therefore he could do it he said that the disciples went at the bidding of their master and took away the owners ass and therefore he could do so too he said that jacob got the inheritance of his father in a way of guile and cheating and therefore he could do so too  great highly base indeed and you are sure he was of this opinion  hon i have heard him plead for it bring scripture for it bring argument for it and so on  great an opinion that is not fit to be with any allowance in the world  hon you must understand me rightly he did not say that any man might do this but that they who had the virtues of those that did such things might also do the same  great but what more false than such a conclusion for this is as much as to say that because good men heretofore have sinned through weakness or forgetfulness therefore he had an allowance to do it of a purpose or if because a child by the blast of the wind or for that it stumbled at a stone fell down and defiled itself in the mire therefore he might wilfully lie down and wallow like a boar therein who could have thought that any one could so far have been blinded by the power of sin but what is written must be true they stumble at the word being disobedient whereunto also they were appointed his supposing that such may have the godly mans virtues who accustom themselves to their vices is also a delusion as strong as the other to eat up the sin of gods people as a dog licks up filth is no sign of one that is possessed with their virtues nor can i believe that one who is of this opinion can have faith or love in him but i know you have made strong objections against him prithee what can he say for himself  hon why he says to do this openly and by way of opinion seems abundantly more honest than to do it and yet hold contrary to it in opinion  great a very wicked answer for though to let loose the bridle to lusts while our opinions are against such things is bad yet to sin and plead a toleration so to do is worse the one stumbles beholders accidentally the other pleads them into the snare  hon there are many of this mans mind that have not this mans mouth and that makes going on pilgrimage of so little esteem as it is  great you have said the truth and it is to be lamented but he that feareth the king of paradise shall come out of them all  chr there are strange opinions in the world i know one that said it was time enough to turn from sin when they come to die  great such are not overwise that man would have been loth might he have had a week to run twenty miles in for his life to have deferred that journey to the last hour of that week  hon you say right and yet the most of them who count themselves pilgrims do indeed do thus i am as you see an old man and have been a traveller in this road many a day and i have taken notice of many things i have seen some that have set out as if they would drive all the world afore them who yet have in a few days died as they in the wilderness and so never got sight of the promised land i have seen some that have promised nothing at first setting out to be pilgrims and that one would have thought could not have lived a day that have yet proved very good pilgrims i have seen some that have run hastily forward that again have after a little time run just as fast back again i have seen some who have spoken very well of a pilgrims life at first that after a while have spoken as much against it i have heard some when they first set out for paradise say positively there is such a place who when they have been almost there have come back again and said there is none i have heard some boast what they would do in case they should be opposed that have even at a false alarm fled faith the pilgrims way and all  now as they were thus in their way there came one running to meet them and said gentlemen and you of the weaker sort if you love life shift for yourselves for the robbers are before you  great they be the three that set upon littlefaith heretofore well said he we are ready for them  sidenote the pilgrims proceed  so they went on their way now they looked at every turning when they should have met with the villains but whether they heard of mr greatheart or whether they had some other game they came not up to the pilgrims     chapter vii  entertained by gaius   christiana then wished for an inn for herself and her children because they were weary  then said mr honest there is one a little before us where a very honorable disciple one gaius dwells so they all concluded to turn in thither and the rather because the old gentleman gave him so good a report when they came to the door they went in not knocking for folks use not to knock at the door of an inn then they called for the master of the house and he came to them so they asked if they might lie there that night  gaius yes gentlemen if you be true men for my house is for none but pilgrims  then were christiana mercy and the boys the more glad for that the innkeeper was a lover of pilgrims so they called for rooms and he showed them one for christiana and her children and mercy and another for mr greatheart and the old gentleman  great good gaius what hast thou for supper for these pilgrims have come far today and are weary  gaius it is late so we cannot conveniently go out to seek food but such as we have you shall be welcome to if that will content  great we will be content with what thou hast in the house forasmuch as i have proved thee thou art never without that which is suitable  then he went down and spake to the cook whose name was tastethatwhichisgood to get ready supper for so many pilgrims this done he came up again saying come my good friends you are welcome to me and i am glad that i have a house to entertain you in and while supper is making ready if you please let us entertain one another with some good talking together  so they all said content  gaius whose wife is this aged matron and whose daughter is this young damsel  great the woman is the wife of one christian a pilgrim of former times and these are his four children the maid is one of her acquaintance one that she hath persuaded to come with her on pilgrimage the boys take all after their father and wish to tread in his steps yea if they do but see any place where the old pilgrim hath lain or any print of his foot it bringeth joy to their hearts and they are eager to lie or tread in the same  sidenote family of the christians  gaius is this christians wife and are these christians children i knew your husbands father yea also his fathers father many have been good of this stock their ancestors dwelt first at antioch christians ancestors the early fathers from whom he came i suppose you have heard your husband talk of them were very worthy men they have above any that i know showed themselves men of great virtue and courage for the lord of pilgrims his ways and them that loved him i have heard of many of your husbands relations that have stood all trials for the sake of the truth stephen who was one of the first of the family from whence your husband sprang was knocked on the head with stones james another of this generation was slain with the edge of the sword to say nothing of paul and peter men anciently of the family from whence your husband came there was ignatius who was cast to the lions romanus whose flesh was cut by pieces from his bones and polycarp that played the man in the fire there was he that was hanged up in a basket in the sun for the wasps to eat and he whom they put into a sack and cast him into the sea to be drowned it would be utterly impossible to count up all of that family who have suffered injuries and death for the love of a pilgrims life nor can i but be glad to see that thy husband has left behind him four such boys as these i hope they will bear out their fathers name and tread in their fathers steps and come to their fathers end  great indeed sir they are likely lads they seem to choose heartily their fathers ways  gaius that is it that i said wherefore christians family is like still to spread abroad upon the face of the ground and yet to be numerous upon the face of the earth wherefore let christiana look out some damsels for her sons to whom they may be married etc that the name of their father and the house of his family may never be forgotten in the world  hon tis pity this family should fall and die out of the world  gaius fall it cannot but be diminished it may but let christiana take my advice and that is the way to uphold it and christiana said this innkeeper i am glad to see thee and thy friend mercy together here a lovely couple and may i advise take mercy into a nearer relation to thee if she will let her be given to matthew thy eldest son it is the way to give you a family in the earth  so this match was arranged and in process of time they were married but more of that hereafter  gaius also proceeded and said i will now speak on the behalf of women to take away their reproach for as death and the curse came into the world by a woman so also did life and health god sent forth his son born of a woman i will say again that when the saviour was come women rejoiced in him before either man or angel i read not that man ever gave unto christ so much as one penny but the women followed him and ministered to him of their substance twas a woman that washed his feet with tears and a woman that anointed his body to the burial they were women that wept when he was going to the cross and women that followed him from the cross and that sat over against the sepulchre when he was buried they were women that were first with him at his resurrectionmorn and women that brought tidings first to his disciples that he was risen from the dead women therefore are highly favored and show by these things that they are sharers with us in the grace of life  sidenote the supper at gaiuss house  now the cook sent up to signify that supper was almost ready and sent one to lay the cloth the dishes and to set the salt and bread in order  then said matthew the sight of this cloth and of this forerunner of the supper awaketh in me a greater appetite to my food than i had before  gaius so let all teaching truth to thee in this life awaken in thee a greater desire to sit at the supper of the great king in his kingdom for all preaching books and services here are but as the laying of the dishes and as setting of salt upon the board when compared with the feast which our lord will make for us when we come to his house  so supper came up and first a heaveshoulder and a wavebreast were set on the table before them to show that they must begin their meal with prayer and praise to god the heaveshoulder david lifted up his heart to god with and with the wavebreast where his heart lay he used to lean upon his harp when he played these two dishes were very fresh and good and they all ate heartily well thereof  the next they brought up was a bottle of wine red as blood so gaius said to them drink freely this is the true juice of the vine that makes glad the heart of god and man so they drank and were merry the next was a dish of milk well crumbed but gaius said let the boys have that that they may grow thereby  then they brought up in course of dish of butter and honey then said gaius eat freely of this for this is good to cheer up and strengthen your judgments and understandings this was our lords dish when he was a child butter and honey shall he eat that he may know to refuse the evil and choose the good  then they brought them up a dish of apples and they were very good tasted fruit then said matthew may we eat apples since they were such by and with which the serpent deceived our first mother eve  then said gaius    apples were they with which we were beguiled   yet sin not apples hath our souls defiled   apples forbid if ate corrupt the blood   to eat such when commanded does us good   drink of his flagons then thou church his dove   and eat his apples who are sick of love  then said matthew i made the objection because i a while since was sick with eating of fruit  gaius forbidden fruit will make you sick but not what our lord has allowed  while they were thus talking they were presented with another dish and it was a dish of nuts then said some at the table nuts spoil tender teeth specially the teeth of children which when gaius heared he said    hard texts are nuts i will not call them cheaters   whose shells do keep their kernels from the eaters   ope then the shells and you shall have the meat   they here are brought for you to crack and eat  then were they very merry and sat at the table a long time talking of many things then said the old gentleman my good landlord while we are cracking your nuts if you please do you open this riddle    a man there was though some did count him mad   the more he cast away the more he had  then they all gave good heed wondering what good gaius would say so he sat still awhile and then thus replied    he that bestows his goods upon the poor   shall have as much again and ten times more  then said joseph i dare say sir i did not think you could have found it out  oh said gaius i have been trained up in this way a great while nothing teaches like experience i have learned of my lord to be kind and have found by experience that i have gained thereby there is that scattereth and yet increaseth and there is that withholdeth more than is meet but it tendeth to poverty there is that maketh himself rich yet hath nothing there is that maketh himself poor yet hath great riches  sidenote mercy and matthew  then samuel whispered to christiana his mother and said mother this is a very good mans house let us stay here a good while and let my brother matthew be married here to mercy before we go any farther the which gaius the host overhearing said with a very good will my child  so they stayed there more than a month and mercy was given to matthew to wife while they stayed here mercy as her custom was would be making coats and garments to give to the poor by which she brought up a very good report upon the pilgrims  but to return again to our story after supper the lads desired a bed for that they were weary with travelling then gaius called to show them their chamber but said mercy i will have them to bed so she had them to bed and they slept well but the rest sat up all night for gaius and they were such suitable company that they could not tell how to part  then after much talk of their lord themselves and their journey old mr honest he that put forth the riddle to gaius began to nod  then said greatheart what sir you begin to be drowsy come rub up now heres a riddle for you  then said mr honest let us hear it  then said mr greatheart    he that will kill must first be overcome   who live abroad would first must die at home  ha said mr honest it is a hard one hard to explain and harder to do but come landlord said he i will if you please leave my part to you do you expound it and i will hear what you say  no said gaius it was put to you and it is expected you should answer it then said the old gentleman    he first by grace must conquered be     that sin would mortify   and who that lives would convince me     unto himself must die  thus they sat talking till break of day now when the family were up christiana bade her son james read a chapter so he read the fiftythird of isaiah  well said gaius now you are here and since as i know mr greatheart is good at his weapons if you please after we have refreshed ourselves we will walk into the fields to see if we can do any good about a mile from hence there is one slaygood a giant that doth much annoy the kings highway in these parts and i know whereabout his haunt is he is master of a number of thieves twould be well if we could clear these parts of him  so they consented and went mr greatheart with his sword helmet and shield and the rest with spears and staves  sidenote slaygood destroyed  when they were come to the place where he was they found him with one feebleminded in his hands whom his servants had brought unto him having taken him in the way now the giant was picking his pockets with a purpose after that to pick his bones for he was of the nature of flesheaters  well so soon as he saw mr greatheart and his friends at the mouth of his cave with their weapons he demanded what they wanted  great we want thee for we are come to revenge the quarrel of the many that thou hast slain of the pilgrims when thou has dragged them out of the kings highway wherefore come out of thy cave  so he armed himself and came out and to battle they went and fought for above an hour and then stood still to take wind  slay then said the giant why are you here on my ground  great to revenge the blood of pilgrims as i told thee before  sidenote feeblemind rescued  so they went to it again and the giant made mr greatheart give back but he came up again and in the greatness of his mind he let fly with such stoutness at the giants head and sides that he made him let his weapon fall out of his hand so he smote him and slew him and cut off his head and brought it away to the inn he also took feeblemind the pilgrim and brought him with him to his lodgings when they were come home they showed his head to the family and then set it up as they had done others before for a terror to those that should attempt to do as he hereafter  then they asked mr feeblemind how he fell into his hands  feeble then said the poor man i am a sickly man as you see and because death did usually once a day knock at my door i thought i should never be well at home so i betook myself to a pilgrims life and have travelled hither from the town of uncertain where i and my father were born i am a man of no strength at all of body nor yet of mind but would if i could though i can but crawl spend my life in the pilgrims way when i came at the gate that is at the head of the way the lord of that place did entertain me freely neither objected he against my weakly looks nor against my feeble mind but gave me such things as were necessary for my journey and bid me hope to the end when i came to the house of the interpreter i received much kindness there and because the hill difficulty was judged too hard for me i was carried up that by one of his servants indeed i have found much relief from pilgrims though none were willing to go so softly as i am forced to do yet still as they came on they bid me be of good cheer and said that it was the will of their lord that comfort should be given to the feebleminded and so went on their own pace when i was come to assault lane then this giant met with me and bid me prepare for an encounter but alas feeble one that i was i had more need of a cordial so he came up and took me i believed not that he should kill me also when he got me into his den since i went not with him willingly i believed i should come out alive again for i have heard that not any pilgrim that is taken captive by violent hands if he keeps heartwhole towards his master is by the laws of providence to die by the hands of the enemy robbed i looked to be and robbed to be sure i am but i have as you see escaped with life for the which i thank my king as author and you as the means other brunts i also look for but this i have resolved onto wit to run when i can to go when i cannot run and to creep when i cannot go as to the principal thing i thank him that loves me i am fixed my way is before me my mind is beyond the river that has no bridge though i am as you see but of a feeble mind  hon then said old mr honest have not you some time ago been acquainted with one mr fearing a pilgrim  feeble acquainted with him yes he came from the town of stupidity which lies four degrees northward of the city of destruction and as many off of where i was born yet we were well acquainted for indeed he was my uncle my fathers brother he and i have been much of a temper he was a little shorter than i but yet we were much of a complexion  hon i perceive you know him and i am apt to believe also that you are related one to another for you have his whitely look a cast like his with your eye and your speech is much alike  feeble most have said so that have known us both and besides what i have read in him i have for the most part found in myself  gaius come sir said good gaius be of good cheer you are welcome to me and to my house what thou hast a mind to call for freely and what thou wouldst have my servants do for thee they will do it with a ready mind  then said mr feeblemind this is an unexpected favor and as the sun shining out of a very dark cloud did giant slaygood intend me this favor when he stopped me and resolved to let me go no farther did he intend that after he had rifled my pockets i should go to gaius mine host yet so it is  now just as feeblemind and gaius were thus in talk there came one running and called at the door and said that about a mile and a half off there was one mr notright a pilgrim struck dead upon the place where he was with a thunderbolt  feeble alas said mr feeblemind is he slain he overtook me some days before i came so far as hither and would be my companykeeper he also was with me when slaygood the giant took me but he was nimble of his heels and escaped but it seems he escaped to die and i was taken to live    what one would think doth seek to slay outright   ofttimes delivers from the saddest plight   that very providence whose face is death   doth ofttimes to the lowly life bequeath   i was taken he did escape and flee   hands crossed gives death to him and life to me  sidenote phoebe and james  now about this time matthew and mercy were married also gaius gave his daughter phoebe to james matthews brother to wife after which time they yet stayed about ten days at gaiuss house spending their time and the seasons like as pilgrims use to do  when they were to depart gaius made them a feast and they did eat and drink and were merry now the hour was come that they must be gone wherefore mr greatheart called for the bill of charges but gaius told him that at his house it was not the custom of pilgrims to pay for their entertainment he boarded them by the year but looked for his pay from the good samaritan who had promised him at his return whatsoever charge he was at with them faithfully to repay him  then said mr greatheart to him  great beloved thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the brethren and to strangers which have borne witness of thy liberal giving before the church whom if thou yet bring forward on their journey after a godly sort thou shalt do well  then gaius took his leave of them all and his children and particularly of mr feeblemind he also gave him something to drink by the way  now mr feeblemind when they were going out of the door made as if he intended to linger the which when mr greatheart espied he said come mr feeblemind pray do you go along with us i will be your conductor and you shall fare as the rest  feeble alas i want a suitable companion you are all lusty and strong but i as you see am weak i choose therefore rather to come behind lest by reason of my many weaknesses i should be both a burden to myself and to you i am as i said a man of a weak and feeble mind and shall be injured and made weak at that which others can bear i shall like no laughing i shall like no gay attire i shall like no unprofitable questions nay i am so weak a man as to be harmed with that which others have a liberty to do i do not yet know all the truth i am a very ignorant christian man sometimes if i hear any rejoice in the lord it troubles me because i cannot do so too it is with me as it is with a weak man among the strong or as with a sick man among the healthy or as a lamp despised he that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised in the thought of him that is at ease so that i know not what to do  great but brother said mr greatheart i have it in my work to comfort the feebleminded and to support the weak you must needs go along with us we will wait for you we will lend you our help we will deny ourselves of some things for your sake we will not enter into doubtful questions before you we will be made all things to you rather than you shall be left behind  now all this while they were at gaiuss door and behold as they were thus in the heat of their discourse mr readytohalt came by with his crutches in his hands and he also was going on pilgrimage  feeble then said mr feeblemind to him how camest thou hither i was but now complaining that i had not a suitable companion but thou art according to my wish welcome welcome good mr readytohalt i hope thou and i may be some help  ready i shall be glad of thy company said the other and good mr feeblemind rather than we will part since we are thus happily met i will lend thee one of my crutches  feeble nay said he though i thank thee for thy goodwill i am not inclined to halt before i am lame howbeit i think when occasion is it may help me against a dog  ready if either myself or my crutches can do thee a pleasure we are both at thy command good mr feeblemind  thus therefore they went on mr greatheart and mr honest went before christiana and her children went next and mr feeblemind came behind and mr readytohalt with his crutches then said mr honest  hon pray sir now that we are upon the road tell us some profitable things of some that have gone on pilgrimage before us  sidenote reviews other pilgrimages  great with a good will i suppose you have heard how christian of old did meet with apollyon in the valley of humiliation and also what hard work he had to go through the valley of the shadow of death also i think you cannot but have heard how faithful was put to it by madam wanton with adam the first with one discontent and shame four as deceitful villains as a man can meet with upon the road  hon yes i believe i have heard of all this but indeed good faithful was hardest put to it with shame he was an unwearied one  great ay for as the pilgrim well said he of all men had the wrong name  hon but pray sir where was it that christian and faithful met talkative that same was also a notable one  great he was a confident fool yet many follow his ways  hon he had liked to have deceived faithful  great ay but christian put him into a way quickly to find him out  thus they went on till they came to the place where evangelist met with christian and faithful and foretold them what should befall them at vanity fair then said their guide hereabouts did christian and faithful meet with evangelist who foretold them of their troubles which they should meet with at vanity fair  hon say you so i dare say it was a hard chapter then that he did read unto them  great it was but he gave them encouragement withal but what do we talk of them they were a couple of lionlike men they had set their faces like flint do not you remember how undaunted they were when they stood before the judge  hon well faithful bravely suffered  great so he did and as brave things came ont for hopeful and some others as the story relates it were converted by his death  hon well but pray go on for you are well acquainted with things  great above all that christian met with after he had passed through vanity fair one byends was the arch one  hon byends what was he  great a very arch fellowa downright deceiver one that would be religious which way soever the world went but so cunning that he would be sure never to lose or suffer for it he had his mode of religion for every fresh occasion and his wife was as good at it as he and he would turn and change from opinion to opinion yea and plead for so doing too but as far as i could learn he came to an ill end with his byends nor did i ever hear that any of his children were ever of any esteem with any that truly feared god  sidenote they arrive at vanity fair  now by this time they were come within sight of the town of vanity where vanity fair is kept so when they saw that they were so near the town they consulted with one another how they should pass through the town and some said one thing and some another at last mr greatheart said i have as you may understand often been a conductor of pilgrims through this town now i am acquainted with one mr mnason a cyprusian by nature an old disciple at whose house we may lodge if you think good said he we will turn in there  sidenote mnason entertains pilgrims  content said old honest content said christiana content said mr feeblemind and so they said all now you must think it was eventide by that they got to the outside of the town but mr greatheart knew the way to the old mans house so thither they came and he called at the door and the old man within knew his tongue so soon as ever he heard it so he opened the door and they all came in then said mnason their host how far have ye come today  so they said from the house of gaius our friend  i promise you said he you have come a good stitch you may well be weary sit down so they sat down  great then said their guide come what cheer sirs i dare say you are welcome to my friend  mnas i also said mr mnason do bid you welcome and whatever you want do but say and we will do what we can to get it for you  hon our great want a while since was a restingplace and good company and now i hope we have both  mnas for restingplace you see what it is but for good company that will appear in the trial  great well said greatheart will you have the pilgrims up into their lodging  mnas i will said mr mnason so he had them up to their several places and also showed them a very fair diningroom where they might be and sup together until time should come to go to rest  now when they were set in their places and were a little cheery after their journey mr honest asked his landlord if there were any store of good people in the town  mnas we have a few for indeed they are but a few when compared with them on the other side  hon but how shall we do to see some of them for the sight of good men to them that are going on pilgrimage is like the appearing of the moon and stars to them that are sailing upon the seas  sidenote friends call on the pilgrims  mnas then mr mnason stamped with his foot and his daughter grace came up so he said unto her grace go you tell my friends mr contrite mr holyman mr lovesaint mr darenotlie and mr penitent that i have a friend or two at my house who have a mind this evening to see them so grace went to call them and they came and after salutation made they sat down together at the table  then said mr mnason their landlord my neighbors i have as you see a company of strangers come to my house they are pilgrims they come from afar and are going to mount zion but who quoth he do you think this is pointing with his finger to christiana it is christiana the wife of christian that famous pilgrim who with faithful his brother was so shamefully handled in our town  at that they stood amazed saying we little thought to see christiana when grace came to call us wherefore this is a very comfortable surprise they then asked her of her welfare and if these young men were her husbands sons and when she told them they were they said the king whom you love and serve make you as your father and bring you where he is in peace  hon then mr honest when they had all sat down asked mr contrite and the rest in what posture their town was at present  contrite you may be sure we are full of hurry in fairtime tis hard keeping our hearts and spirits in good order when we are in a cumbered condition he that lives in such a place as this and has to do with such as we have has need of a hint to caution him to take heed every moment of the day  hon but how are your neighbors for quietness  contr they are much more moderate now than formerly you know how christian and faithful were used at our town but of late i say they have been far more moderate i think the blood of faithful lieth as a load upon them till now for since they burned him they have been ashamed to burn any more in those days we were afraid to walk the street but now we can show our heads then the name of a christian was hated now specially in some parts of our town for you know our town is large religion is counted honorable  then said mr contrite to them pray how fareth it with you in your pilgrimage how stands the country towards you  hon it happens to us as it happeneth to wayfaring men sometimes our way is clean sometimes uphill sometimes downhill we are seldom at a certainty the wind is not always on our back nor is every one a friend that we meet with in the way we have met with some notable rubs already and what are yet behind we know not but for the most part we find it true that has been talked of of old a good man must suffer trouble  contr you talk of rubs what rubs have you met withal  hon nay ask mr greatheart our guide for he can give the best account of that  great we have been beset three or four times already first christiana and her children were beset by two ruffians who they feared would take away their lives we were beset by giant bloodyman giant maul and giant slaygood indeed we did rather beset the last than were beset of him and thus it was after we had been some time at the house of gaius mine host and of the whole church we were minded upon a time to take our weapons with us and go and see if we could light upon any of those that were enemies to pilgrims for we heard that there was a notable one thereabouts now gaius knew his haunt better than i because he dwelt thereabout so we looked and looked till at last we saw the mouth of his cave then we were glad and plucked up our spirits so we approached up to his den and lo when we came there he had dragged by mere force into his net this poor man mr feeblemind and was about to bring him to his end but when he saw us supposing as he thought he had had another prey he left the poor man in his house and came out so we fell to it full sore and he lustily laid about him but in conclusion he was brought down to the ground and his head cut off and set up by the wayside for terror to such as should after practice such ungodliness that i tell you the truth here is the man himself to affirm it who was as a lamb taken out of the mouth of the lion  feeble then said mr feeblemind i found this true to my cost and comfort to my cost when he threatened to pick my bones every moment and to my comfort when i saw mr greatheart and his friends with their weapons approach so near for my deliverance  holy then said mr holyman there are two things that they have need to possess who go on pilgrimagecourage and an unspotted life if they have not courage they can never hold on their way and if their lives be loose they will make the very name of the pilgrim stink  love then said mr lovesaint i hope this caution is not needful among you but truly there are many that go upon the road who rather declare themselves strangers to pilgrimage than strangers and pilgrims in the earth  dare then said mr darenotlie tis true they have neither the pilgrims weed nor the pilgrims courage they go not uprightly but all awry with their feet one shoe goeth inward another outward and their hosen out behind there is here a rag and there a rent to the disparagement of their lord  pen these things said mr penitent they ought to be troubled for nor are the pilgrims like to have that grace upon them and their pilgrims progress as they desire until the way is cleared of such spots and blemishes  thus they sat talking and spending the time until supper was set upon the table unto which they went and refreshed their weary bodies so they went to rest  sidenote grace and samuel  now they stayed in this fair a great while at the house of mnason who in process of time gave his daughter grace unto samuel christianas son to wife and his daughter martha to joseph  the time as i said that they stayed here was long for it was not now as in former times wherefore the pilgrims grew acquainted with many of the good people of the town and did them what service they could mercy as she was wont labored much for the poor wherefore their bodies and backs blessed her and she was there an ornament to her profession and to say the truth for grace phoebe and martha they were all of a very good nature and did much good in their places they were also all of them very fruitful so that christians name as was said before was like to live in the world  while they lay here there came a monster out of the woods and slew many of the people of the town it would also carry away their children and teach them to suck its whelps now no man in the town durst so much as face this monster but all fled when they heard the noise of his coming  the monster was like unto no one beast on the earth its body was like a dragon and it had seven heads and ten horns it made great havoc of children and yet it was governed by a woman this monster gave conditions to men and such men as loved their lives more than their souls accepted of those conditions so they came under  now this mr greatheart together with those that came to visit the pilgrims at mr mnasons house entered into a covenant to go and engage this beast if perhaps they might deliver the people of this town from the paws and mouth of this so devouring a serpent  then did mr greatheart mr contrite mr holyman mr darenotlie and mr penitent with their weapons go forth to meet him now the monster was at first very rampant and looked upon these enemies with great disdain but they so belabored him being sturdy menatarms that they made him make a retreat so they came home to mr mnasons house again  sidenote martha and joseph  the monster you must know had his certain seasons to come out in and to make his attempts upon the children of the people of the town also these seasons did these valiant worthies watch him in and did still continually assault him insomuch that in process of time he became not only wounded but lame also he has not made that havoc of the townsmens children as formerly he had done and it is verily believed by some that this beast will die of his wounds  this therefore made mr greatheart and his fellows of great fame in this town so that many of the people that wanted their taste of things yet had a reverent esteem and respect for them upon this account therefore it was that these pilgrims got not much hurt here true there were some of the baser sort that could see no more than a mole nor understand any more than a beast these had no reverence for these men and took no notice of their valor or adventures  well the time grew on that the pilgrims must go on their way wherefore they prepared for their journey they sent for their friends they talked with them they had some time set apart therein to commit each other to the protection of their prince there were again that brought them of such things as they had that were fit for the weak and the strong for the women and the men and so laded them with such things as were necessary then they set forward on their way and their friends accompanying them so far as was convenient they again committed each other to the protection of their king and parted  they therefore that were of the pilgrims company went on and mr greatheart went before them now the women and children being weakly they were forced to go as they could bear by which means mr readytohalt and mr feeblemind had more to sympathize with their condition  when they were gone from the townsmen and when their friends had bid them farewell they quickly came to the place where faithful was put to death there therefore they made a stand and thanked him that had enabled him to bear his cross so well and the rather because they now found that they had a benefit by such manly suffering as his was  they went on therefore after this a good way farther talking of christian and faithful and how helpful joined himself to christian after that faithful was dead  now they were come up with the hill lucre where the silver mine was which took demas off from his pilgrimage and into which as some think byends fell and perished wherefore they considered that but when they were come to the old monument that stood over against the hill lucre to wit the pillar of salt that stood also within view of sodom and its stinking lake they marvelled as did christian before that men of that knowledge and ripeness of wit as they were should be so blind as to turn aside here     chapter viii  the delectable mountains and the shepherds   i saw now that they went on till they came at the river that was on this side of the delectable mountains to the river where the fine trees grow on both sides and whose leaves if taken inwardly are good against sickness where the meadows are green all the year long and where they might lie down safely  by this riverside in the meadow there were cotes and folds for sheep a house built for the nourishing and bringing up of those lambs the babes of those women that go on pilgrimage also there was here one that was entrusted with them who could have pity and that could gather these lambs with his arm and carry them in his bosom and that could gently lead those that were with young  now to the care of this man christiana admonished her four daughters to commit their little ones that by these waters they might be housed cared for helped and nourished and that none of them might be lacking in time to come this man if any of them go astray or be lost he will bring them again he will also bind up that which was broken and will strengthen them that are sick here they will never want food and drink and clothing here they will be kept from thieves and robbers for this man will die before one of those committed to his trust shall be lost besides here they shall be sure to have good nurture and training and shall be taught to walk in right paths and that you know is a favor of no small account also here as you see are delicate waters pleasant meadows dainty flowers variety of trees and such as bear wholesome fruitfruit not like that that matthew ate of that fell over the wall out of beelzebubs garden but fruit that giveth health where there is none and that continueth and increaseth it where it is so they were content to commit their little ones to him and that which was also an encouragement to them so to do was for that all this was to be at the charge of the king and so was as an hospital for young children and orphans  sidenote doubting castle  now they went on and when they were come to bypath meadow to the stile over which christian went with his fellow hopeful when they were taken by giant despair and put into doubting castle they sat down and consulted what was best to be done to wit now they were so strong and had got such a man as mr greatheart for their conductor whether they had not best make an attempt upon the giant demolish his castle and if there were any pilgrims in it to set them at liberty before they went any farther so one said one thing and another said the contrary one questioned if it were lawful to go upon ground that was not the kings another said they might providing their end was good but mr greatheart said though that reason given last cannot be always true yet i have a commandment to resist sin to overcome evil to fight the good fight of faith and i pray with whom should i fight this good fight if not with giant despair i will therefore attempt the taking away of his life and the demolishing of doubting castle then said he who will go with me then said old honest i will and so will we too said christianas four sons matthew samuel joseph and james for they were young men and strong so they left the women in the road and with them mr feeblemind and mr readytohalt with his crutches to be their guard until they came back for in that place though giant despair dwelt so near they keeping in the road a little child might lead them  so mr greatheart old honest and the four young men went to go up to doubting castle to look for giant despair when they came at the castle gate they knocked for entrance with an unusual noise at that the old giant comes to the gate and diffidence his wife follows then said he who and what is he that is so hardy as after this manner to disturb the giant despair  mr greatheart replied it is i greatheart one of the king of the celestial countrys conductors of pilgrims to their place and i demand of thee that thou open thy gates for my entrance prepare thyself also to fight for i am come to take away thy head and to demolish doubting castle  sidenote giant despair is beheaded  now giant despair because he was a giant thought no man could overcome him and again thought he since heretofore i have made a conquest of angels shall greatheart make me afraid so he harnessed himself with his armor and went out he had a cap of steel upon his head a breastplate of fire girded to him and he came out in iron shoes with a great club in his hand then these six men made up to him and beset him behind and before also when diffidence the giantess came up to help him old mr honest cut her down at one blow then they fought for their lives and giant despair was brought down to the ground but was very loath to die he struggled hard and had as they say as many lives as a cat but greatheart was his death for he left him not till he had severed his head from his shoulders  then they fell to demolishing doubting castle and that you know might with ease be done since giant despair was dead they were seven days in destroying of that and in it of pilgrims they found one mr despondency almost starved to death and one muchafraid his daughter these two they saved alive but it would have made you wonder to have seen the dead bodies that lay here and there in the castleyard and how full of dead mens bones the dungeon was  when mr greatheart and his companions had performed this great work they took mr despondency and his daughter muchafraid into their care for they were honest people though they were prisoners in doubting castle to that tyrant giant despair  they therefore i say took with them the head of the giant for his body they had buried under a heap of stones and down to the road and to their companions they came and showed them what they had done now when feeblemind and readytohalt saw that it was the head of giant despair indeed they were very jocund and merry now christiana if need was could play upon the viol and her daughter mercy upon the lute so since they were so merry disposed she played them a lesson and readytohalt would dance so he took despondencys daughter muchafraid by the hand and to dancing they went in the road true he could not dance without one crutch in his hand but i promise you he footed it well also the girl was to be commended for she answered the music handsomely  as for mr despondency the music was not so much to him he was for feeding rather than dancing for that he was almost starved so christiana gave him some of her bottle of spirits for present relief and then prepared him something to eat and in a little time the old gentleman came to himself and began to be finely revived  now i saw in my dream when all these things were finished mr greatheart took the head of giant despair and set it upon a pole by the highwayside right over against the pillar that christian erected for a caution to pilgrims that came after to take heed of entering into his grounds then he writ under it upon a marble stone these verses following    this is the head of him whose name only   in former times did pilgrims terrify   his castles down and diffidence his wife   brave mr greatheart has bereft of life   despondency his daughter muchafraid   greatheart for them also the man has played   who hereof doubts if hell but cast his eye   up hither may his scruples satisfy   this head also when doubting cripples dance   doth show from fears they have deliverance  sidenote the delectable mountains  when these men had thus bravely showed themselves against doubting castle and had slain giant despair they went forward and went on till they came to the delectable mountains where christian and hopeful refreshed themselves with the varieties of the place they also acquainted themselves with the shepherds there who welcomed them as they had done christian before unto the delectable mountains  now the shepherds seeing so great a train follow mr greatheart for with him they were well acquainted they said unto him good sir you have got a goodly company here pray where did you find all these  then mr greatheart replied    first here is christiana and her train   her sons and her sons wives who like the wain   keep by the pole and do by compass steer   from sin to grace else they had not been here   next heres old honest come on pilgrimage   readytohalt too who i dare engage   truehearted is and so is feeblemind   who willing was not to be left behind   despondency good man is coming after   and so also is muchafraid his daughter   may we have entertainment here or must   we farther go lets know whereon to trust  sidenote the shepherds entertain  then said the shepherds this is a comfortable company you are welcome to us for we have care for the feeble as well as for the strong our prince has an eye to what is done to the least of these therefore weakness must not be a block to our entertainment so they had them to the palace door and then said unto them come in mr feeblemind come in mr readytohalt come in mr despondency and mrs muchafraid his daughter these mr greatheart said the shepherds to the guide we call in by name for that they are most subject to draw back but as for you and the rest that are strong we leave you to your wonted liberty  then said mr greatheart this day i see that grace doth shine in your faces and that you are my lords shepherds indeed for that you have not pushed these helpless ones neither with side nor shoulder but have rather strewed their way into the palace with flowers as you should  so the feeble and weak went in and mr greatheart and the rest did follow when they were also sat down the shepherds said to those of the weaker sort what is it that you would have for said they all things must be managed here for the supporting of the weak as well as the warning of the unruly so they made them a feast of things easy of digestion and that were pleasant to the palate and nourishing the which when they had received they went to their rest each one separately unto his proper place  when morning was come because the mountains were nigh and the day clear and because it was the custom of the shepherds to show the pilgrims before their departure some rarities therefore after they were ready and had refreshed themselves the shepherds took them out into the fields and showed them first what they had showed to christian before  then they had them to some new places the first was to mount marvel where they looked and beheld a man at a distance that tumbled the hills about with words then they asked the shepherds what that should mean so they told them that that man was the son of mr greatgrace of whom you read in the first part of the records of the pilgrims progress and he is set down there to teach the pilgrims how to believe or to tumble out of their ways what difficulties they should meet with by faith then said mr greatheart i know him he is a man above many  then they had them to another place called mount innocent and there they saw a man clothed all in white and two men prejudice and illwill continually casting dirt upon them now behold the dirt whatsoever they cast at him would in a little time fall off again and his garment would look as clear as if no dirt had been cast thereat then said the pilgrims what means this  the shepherds answered this man is named godlyman and this garment is to show the innocency of his life now those that throw dirt at him are such as hate his welldoing but as you see the dirt will not stick upon his clothes so it shall be with him that liveth truly innocently in the world whoever they be that would make such men dirty they labor all in vain for god by that a little time is spent will cause that their innocence shall break forth as the light and their righteousness as the noonday  then they took them and had them to mount charity where they showed them a man that had a bundle of cloth lying before him out of which he cut coats and garments for the poor that stood about him yet his bundle or roll of cloth was never the less  then said they what should this be  this is said the shepherds to show you that he who has a heart to give of his labor to the poor shall never want wherewithal he that watereth shall be watered himself and the cake that the widow gave to the prophet did not cause that she had ever the less in her barrel  they had them also to a place where they saw one fool and one wantwit washing of an ethiopian with intention to make him white but the more they washed him the blacker he was then they asked the shepherds what that should mean so they told them saying thus shall it be with the vile person all means used to get such an one a good name shall in the end tend but to make him more abominable thus it was with the pharisees and so shall it be with all pretenders to religion  then said mercy the wife of matthew to christiana her mother mother i would if it might be see the hole in the hill or that commonly called the byway to hell so her mother brake her mind to the shepherds then they went to the door it was in the side of a hill and they opened it and bid mercy hearken awhile so she hearkened and heard one saying cursed be my father for holding of my feet back from the way of peace and life and another said oh that i had been torn in pieces before i had to save my life lost my soul and another said if i were to live again how would i deny myself rather than come to this place then there was as if the very earth groaned and quaked under the feet of this young woman for fear so she looked white and came trembling away saying blessed be he and she that are delivered from this place  sidenote the great glass  now when the shepherds had shown them all these things then they had them back to the palace and entertained them with what the house would afford but mercy longed for something that she saw there but was ashamed to ask her motherinlaw then asked her what she ailed for she looked as one not well then said mercy there is a lookingglass hangs up in the diningroom off of which i cannot take my mind if therefore i have it not i think i shall be unhappy then said her mother i will mention thy wants to the shepherds and they will not deny it thee but she said i am ashamed that these men should know that i longed nay my daughter said she it is no shame but a virtue to long for such a thing as that so mercy said then mother if you please ask the shepherds if they are willing to sell it  now the glass was one of a thousand it would present a man one way with his own features exactly and turn it but another way and it would show one the very face and likeness of the prince of pilgrims himself yea i have talked with them that can tell and they have said that they have seen the very crown of thorns upon his head by looking in that glass they have therein also seen the holes in his hands in his feet and in his side yea such an excellency is there in this glass that it will show him to one where they have a mind to see him whether living or dead whether in earth or in heaven whether in a state of lowliness or in his kingliness whether coming to suffer or coming to reign  christiana therefore went to the shepherds apartnow the names of the shepherds were knowledge experience watchful and sincereand said unto them there is one of my daughters that i think doth long for something that she hath seen in this house and she thinks that she shall be unhappy if she should by you be denied  experience call her call her she shall assuredly have what we can help her to so they called her and said to her mercy what is that thing thou wouldst have then she blushed and said the great glass that hangs up in the diningroom so sincere ran and fetched it and with a joyful consent it was given her then she bowed her head and gave thanks and said by this i know that i have obtained favor in your eyes  they also gave to the other young women such things as they desired and to their husbands great praise for that they joined with greatheart to the slaying of giant despair and the destroying of doubting castle  about christianas neck the shepherds put a necklace and so they did about the necks of her four daughters also they put earrings in their ears and jewels on their foreheads  illustration turnaway resisting evangelist                                    page 357  sidenote they leave the shepherds  when they were minded to go hence they let them go in peace but gave not to them those certain cautions which before were given to christian and his companion the reason was for that these had greatheart to be their guide who was one that was well acquainted with things and so could give them their cautions more seasonably that is even then when the danger was nigh the approaching what cautions christian and his companion had received of the shepherds they had also lost by that the time was come that they had need to put them in practice wherefore here was the advantage that this company had over the other  from hence they went on singing and they said    behold how fitly are the stages set     for their relief that pilgrims are become   and how they us receive without one let11     that make the other life our mark and home    what novelties they have to us they give     that we though pilgrims joyful lives may live   they do upon us too such things bestow     that show we pilgrims are whereer we go    11 the word let here means hindrance  when they were gone from the shepherds they quickly came to the place where christian met with one turnaway that dwelt in the town of apostasy wherefore of him mr greatheart their guide did now put them in mind saying this is the place where christian met with one turnaway who carried with him the character of his rebellion at his back and this i have to say concerning this man he would hearken to no counsel but once falling persuasion could not stop him when he came to the place where the cross and the sepulchre were he did meet with one that bid him look there but he gnashed with his teeth and stamped and said he was resolved to go back to his own town before he came to the gate he met with evangelist who offered to lay hands on him to turn him into the way again but this turnaway resisted him and having done much harm unto him he got away over the wall and so escaped his hand  sidenote meet valiant for truth  then they went on and just at the place where littlefaith formerly was robbed there stood a man with his sword drawn and his face all bloody then said mr greatheart who art thou the man made answer saying i am one whose name is valiantfortruth i am a pilgrim and am going to the celestial city now as i was in my way there were three men did beset me and propounded unto me these three things 1 whether i would become one of them 2 or go back to the place from whence i came 3 or die upon the place to the first i answered i had been a true man a long season and therefore it could not be expected that i should now cast in my lot with thieves then they demanded what i should say to the second so i told them that the place from whence i came had i not found it unsatisfactory i had not forsaken at all but finding it altogether unsuitable to me and very unprofitable for me i forsook it for this way then they asked me what i said to the third and i told them my life cost more dear far than that i should lightly give it away besides you have nothing to do thus to put things to my choice wherefore at your peril be it if you meddle then these three to wit wildhead inconsiderate and pragmatic drew their weapons upon me and i also drew upon them so we fell to it one against three for the space of above three hours they have left upon me as you see some of the marks of their valor and have also carried away with them some of mine they are but just now gone i suppose they might as the saying is hear your horse dash and so they betook them to flight  great but here was great odds three against one  sidenote how valiant bore himself  valiant tis true but little or more are nothing to him that has the truth on his side though an host should encamp against me said one my heart shall not fear though war should rise against me in this will i be confident besides said he i have read in some records that one man has fought an army and how many did samson slay with the jawbone of an ass  great then said the guide why did you not cry out that some might have come in for your succor  valiant so i did to my king who i knew could hear me and afford invisible help and that was sufficient for me  great then said greatheart to mr valiantfortruth thou hast worthily behaved thyself let me see thy sword so he showed it him when he had taken it in his hand and looked thereon a while he said ha it is a right jerusalem blade  valiant it is so let a man have one of these blades with a hand to wield it and skill to use it and he may venture upon an angel with it he need not fear its holding if he can but tell how to lay on its edges will never blunt it will cut flesh and bones and soul and spirit and all  great but you fought a great while i wonder you were not weary  valiant i fought till my sword did cleave to my hand and when they were joined together as if a sword grew out of my arm and when the blood ran through my fingers then i fought with most courage  great thou hast done well thou hast resisted unto blood striving against sin thou shalt abide by us come in and go out with us for we are thy companions  then they took him washed his wounds and gave him of what they had to refresh him and so they went on together  now as they went on because mr greatheart was delighted in him for he loved one greatly that he found to be a man of his own sort and because there were in company them that were feeble and weak therefore he questioned with him about many things as first what countryman he was  valiant i am of darkland for there i was born and there my father and mother are still  great darkland said the guide doth not that lie upon the same coast with the city of destruction  valiant yes it doth now that which caused me to come on pilgrimage was this we had one mr telltrue come into our parts and he told it about what christian had done that went from the city of destruction namely how he had forsaken his wife and children and had betaken himself to a pilgrims life it was also reported and believed how he had killed a serpent that did come out to resist him in his journey and how he got through to whither he intended it was also told what welcome he had at all his lords lodgings specially when he came to the gates of the celestial city for there said the man he was received with sound of trumpet by a company of shining ones he told also how all the bells in the city did ring for joy at his entering in and what golden garments he was clothed with with many other things that now i shall forbear to relate in a word that man so told the story of christian and his travels that my heart fell into a burning haste to be gone after him nor could father or mother stay me so i got from them and am come thus far on my way  great you came in at the gate did you not  valiant yes yes for the same man also told us that all would be nothing if we did not begin to enter this way at the gate  great look you said the guide to christiana the pilgrimage of your husband with what he has gotten thereby is spread abroad far and near  valiant why is this christians wife  great yes that it is and these also are his four sons  valiant what and going on pilgrimage too  great yes verily they are following after  valiant it glads me at heart good man how joyful will he be when he shall see them that would not go with him yet to enter after him in at the gates into the city  great without doubt it will be a comfort to him for next to the joy of seeing himself there it will be a joy to meet there his wife and children  valiant but now you are upon that pray let me hear your opinion about it some make a question whether we shall know one another when we are there  sidenote valiants obstacles  great do they think they shall know themselves then or that they shall rejoice to see themselves in that happiness and if they think they shall know and do this why not know others and rejoice in their welfare also again since relations are our second self though that state will cease there yet why may it not be wisely concluded that we shall be more glad to see them there than to see they are wanting  valiant well i perceive whereabouts you are as to this have you any more things to ask me about my beginning to come on pilgrimage  great yes were your father and mother willing that you should become a pilgrim  valiant oh no they used all means imaginable to persuade me to stay at home  great why what could they say against it  valiant they said it was an idle life and if i myself were not inclined to sloth and laziness i would never favor a pilgrims condition  great and what did they say else  valiant why they told me that it was a dangerous way yea the most dangerous way in the world said they is that which the pilgrims go  great did they show you wherein this way is so dangerous  valiant yes and that in many particulars  great name some of them  sidenote valiants discouragements  valiant they told me of the slough of despond where christian was wellnigh smothered they told me that there were archers standing ready in beelzebubs castle to shoot them who should knock at the wicketgate for entrance they told me also of the wood and dark mountains of the hill difficulty of the lions and also of the three giants bloodyman maul and slaygood they said moreover that there was a foul fiend haunted the valley of humiliation and that christian was by him almost bereft of life besides said they you must go over the valley of the shadow of death where the hobgoblins are where the light is darkness where the way is full of snares pits traps and gins they told me also of giant despair of doubting castle and of the ruin that the pilgrims met with there further they said i must go over the enchanted ground which was dangerous and that after all this i should find a river over which i should find no bridge and that that river did lie betwixt me and the celestial country  great and was this all  valiant no they also told me that this way was full of deceivers and of persons that laid wait there to turn good men out of the path  great but how did they make that out  valiant they told me that mr worldly wiseman did there lie in wait to deceive they also said that there were formality and hypocrisy continually on the road they said also that byends talkative or demas would go near to gather me up that the flatterer would catch me in his net or that with greenheaded ignorance i would presume to go on to the gate from whence he was sent back to the hole that was in the side of the hill and made to go the byway to hell  great i promise you this was enough to discourage you but did they make an end here  valiant no stay they told me also of many that had tried that way of old and that had gone a great way therein to see if they could find something of the glory there that so many had so much talked of from time to time and how they came back again and befooled themselves for setting a foot out of doors in that path to the satisfaction of all the country and they named several that did so as obstinate and pliable mistrust and timorous turnaway and old atheist with several more who they said had some of them gone far to see what they could find but not one of them found so much advantage by going as amounted to the weight of a feather  great said they anything more to discourage you  valiant yes they told me of one mr fearing who was a pilgrim and how he found this way so solitary that he never had a comfortable hour therein also that mr despondency had like to have been starved therein yea and also which i had almost forgot that christian himself about whom there had been such a noise after all his ventures for a celestial crown was certainly drowned in the black river and never went a foot farther however it was smothered up  great and did none of these things discourage you  valiant no they seemed but as so many nothings to me  great how came that about  valiant why i still believed what mr telltrue had said and that carried me beyond them all  great then this was your victory even your faith  valiant it was so i believed and therefore came out got into the way fought all that set themselves against me and by believing am come to this place    who would true valor see     let him come hither   one here will constant be     come wind come weather   theres no discouragement   shall make him once relent   his first avowed intent                 to be a pilgrim    whoso beset him round     with dismal stories   do but themselves confound     his strength the more is   no lion can him fright   hell with a giant fight   but he will have a right                 to be a pilgrim    hobgoblin nor foul fiend     can daunt his spirit   he knows he at the end     shall life inherit   then fancies fly away   hell fear not what men say   hell labor night and day                 to be a pilgrim     chapter ix  the enchanted ground   by this time they were got to the enchanted ground where the air naturally tended to make one drowsy and that place was all grown over with briers and thorns excepting here and there where was an enchanted arbor upon which if a man sits or in which if a man sleeps it is a question say some whether ever he shall rise or wake again in this world over this forest therefore they went both one and another and mr greatheart went before for that he was the guide and mr valiantfortruth came behind being rearguard for fear lest peradventure some fiend or dragon or giant or thief should fall upon their rear and so do mischief they went on here each man with his sword drawn in his hand for they knew it was a dangerous place also they cheered up one another as well as they could feeblemind mr greatheart commanded should come up after him and mr despondency was under the eye of mr valiant  now they had not gone far but a great mist and darkness fell upon them all so that they could scarce for a great while see the one the other wherefore they were forced for some time to feel for one another by words for they walked not by sight but any one must think that here was but sorry going for the best of them all but how much worse for the women and children who both of feet and heart were but tender yet so it was that through the encouraging words of him that led in the front they made a pretty good shift to wag along  the way also was here very wearisome through dirt and slabbiness nor was there on all this ground so much as one inn or victuallinghouse therein to refresh the feebler sort here therefore was grunting and puffing and sighing while one tumbleth over a brush another sticks fast in the dirt and the children some of them lost their shoes in the mire while one cries out i am down and another ho where are you and a third the bushes have got such fast hold on me i think i cannot get away from them  then they came at an arbor warm and promising much refreshing to the pilgrims for it was finely wrought above head beautified with greens furnished with benches and settles it also had in it a soft couch whereon the weary might lean this you must think all things considered was tempting for the pilgrims already began to be foiled with the badness of the way but there was not one of them that made so much as a motion to stop there yea for aught i could perceive they continually gave so good heed to the advice of their guide and he did so faithfully tell them of dangers and of the nature of dangers when they were at them that usually when they were nearest to them they did most pluck up their spirits and hearten one another to deny the flesh this arbor was called the slothfuls friend on purpose to allure if it might be some of the pilgrims there to take up their rest when weary  i saw then in my dream that they went on in this their solitary ground till they came to a place at which a man is apt to lose his way now though when it was light their guide could well enough tell how to miss those ways that led wrong yet in the dark he was put to a stand but he had in his pocket a map of all ways leading to or from the celestial city wherefore he struck a light for he also never goes without his tinderbox and takes a view of his book or map which bids him be careful in that place to turn to the righthand way and had he not here been careful to look in his map they had in all probability been smothered in the mud for just a little before them and that at the end of the cleanest way too was a pit none knows how deep full of nothing but mud there made on purpose to destroy the pilgrims in  then thought i with myself who that goeth on pilgrimage but would have one of those maps about him that he may look when he is at a stand which is the way he must take  they went on then in this enchanted ground till they came to where was another arbor and it was built by the highwayside and in that arbor there lay two men whose names were heedless and toobold these two went thus far on pilgrimage but here being wearied with their journey they sat down to rest themselves and so fell fast asleep when the pilgrims saw them they stood still and shook their heads for they knew that the sleepers were in a pitiful case then they consulted what to dowhether to go on and leave them in their sleep or to step to them and try to awake them so they concluded to go to them and wake them that is if they could but with this caution namely to take heed that themselves did not sit down nor embrace the offered benefit of that arbor  so they went in and spake to the men and called each one by his name for the guide it seems did know them but there was no voice or answer then the guide did shake them and do what he could to disturb them then said one of them i will pay you when i take my money at which the guide shook his head i will fight so long as i can hold my sword in my hand said the other at that one of the children laughed  sidenote the land of beulah  then said christiana what is the meaning of this the guide said they talk in their sleep if you strike them beat them or whatever else you do to them they will answer you after this fashion or as one of them said in old time when the waves of the sea did beat upon him and he slept as one upon the mast of a ship when shall i awake i will seek it yet again you know when men talk in their sleep they say anything but their words are not governed either by faith or reason there is an unsuitableness in their words now as there was before betwixt their going on pilgrimage and sitting down there this then is the mischief of it when heedless ones go on pilgrimage tis twenty to one but they are served thus for this enchanted ground is one of the last refuges that the enemy to pilgrims has wherefore it is as you see placed almost at the end of the way and so it standeth against us with the more advantage for when thinks the enemy will these fools be so desirous to sit down as when they are weary and when so like to be weary as when almost at their journeys end therefore it is i say that the enchanted ground is placed so near to the land of beulah and so near the end of their race wherefore let pilgrims look to themselves lest it happen to them as it has done to these that as you see are fallen asleep and none can wake them  then the pilgrims desired with trembling to go forward only they prayed their guide to strike a light that they might go the rest of their way by the help of the light of a lantern so he struck a light and they went by the help of that through the rest of this way though the darkness was very great but the children began to be sorely weary and they cried out to him that loveth pilgrims to make their way more comfortable so by that they had gone a little farther a wind arose that drove away the fog so the air became more clear yet they were not off by much of the enchanted ground only now they could see one another better and the way wherein they should walk  now when they were almost at the end of this ground they perceived that a little before them was a solemn noise as of one that was much concerned so they went on and looked before them and behold they saw as they thought a man upon his knees with hands and eyes lift up and speaking as they thought earnestly to one that was above they drew nigh but could not tell what he said so they went softly till he had done when he had done he got up and began to run towards the celestial city  then mr greatheart called after him saying soho friend let us have your company if you go as i suppose you do to the celestial city  so the man stopped and they came up to him but as soon as mr honest saw him he said i know this man  then said mr valiantfortruth prithee who is it  it is one said he that comes from whereabout i dwelt his name is standfast he is certainly a right good pilgrim  so they came up one to another and presently standfast said to old honest ho father honest are you there  ay said he that i am as sure as you are there  sidenote heedless and toobold  right glad am i said mr standfast that i have found you on this road  and as glad am i said the other that i espied you upon your knees  then mr standfast blushed and said but why did you see me  yes that i did quoth the other and with my heart was glad at the sight  why what did you think said standfast  think said old honest what should i think i thought we had an honest man upon the road and therefore should have his company byandby  if you thought not amiss said standfast how happy am i but if i be not as i should i alone must bear it  that is true said the other but your fear doth further show me that things are right betwixt the prince of pilgrims and your soul for he saith blessed is the man that feareth always  valiant well but brother i pray thee tell us what was it that was the cause of thy being upon thy knees even now was it for that some special mercy laid upon thee the need of prayer or how  stand why we are as you see upon the enchanted ground and as i was coming along i was musing with myself of what a dangerous road the road in this place was and how many that had come even thus far on pilgrimage had here been stopped and been destroyed i thought also of the manner of the death with which this place destroyeth men those that die here die of no violent painful disease the death which such die is not grievous to them for he that goeth away in such a sleep begins that journey with desire and pleasure yea such sink into the will of that disease  hon then mr honest interrupting of him said did you see the two men asleep in the arbor  sidenote standfast repulses madam  stand ay ay i saw heedless and toobold there and for aught i know there they will lie till they rot but let me go on in my tale as i was thus musing as i said there was one in very pleasant attire but old who presented herself to me and offered me three things to wit her body her purse and her bed now the truth is i was both aweary and sleepy i am also as poor as an owlet and that perhaps the witch knew well i repulsed her once or twice but she put by my repulses and smiled then i began to be angry but she mattered that nothing at all then she made offers again and said if i would be ruled by her she would make me great and happy for said she i am the mistress of the world and men are made happy by me then i asked her name and she told me it was madam bubble this set me farther from her but she still followed me with enticements then i betook me as you saw to my knees and with hands lift up and cries i prayed to him that had said he would help so just as you came up the gentlewoman went her way then i continued to give thanks for this my great deliverance for i verily believe she intended no good but rather sought to make stop of me in my journey  hon without doubt her designs were bad but stay now you talk of her methinks i either have seen her or have read some story of her  stand perhaps you have done both  hon madam bubble is she not a tall comely dame somewhat of a swarthy complexion  stand right you hit it she is just such a one  hon does she not speak very smoothly and give you a smile at the end of a sentence  stand you fall right upon it again for these are her very actions  hon doth she not wear a great purse by her side and is not her hand often in it fingering her money as if that was her hearts delight  stand tis just so had she stood by all this while you could not more amply have set her forth before me nor have better described her features  hon then he that drew her picture was a good artist and he that wrote of her said true  sidenote madam bubbles influence  great this woman is a witch and it is by virtue of her witchcraft that this ground is enchanted whoever doth lay his head down in her lap had as good lay it down upon that block over which the axe doth hang and whoever lay their eyes upon her beauty are accounted the enemies of god this is she that maintaineth in their splendor all those that are the enemies of pilgrims yea this is she that hath bought off many a man from a pilgrims life she is a great gossiper she is always both she and her daughters at one pilgrims heels or other now commanding and then preferring the excellences of this life she is a bold and impudent creature she will talk with any man she always laugheth poor pilgrims to scorn but highly commends the rich if there be one cunning to get money in a place she will speak well of him from house to house she loveth banqueting and feasting mainly

she will promise to some crowns and kingdoms if they will but take her advice yet many hath she brought to the halter and ten thousand times more to hell  stand oh said mr standfast what a mercy it is that i did resist her for whither might she have drawn me  great whither nay none but god knows whither but in general to be sure she would have drawn thee into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and ruin twas she that set absalom against his father and jeroboam against his master twas she that persuaded judas to sell his lord and that prevailed with demas to forsake the godly pilgrims life none can tell of the mischief that she doth she makes variance betwixt rulers and subjects betwixt parents and children betwixt neighbor and neighbor betwixt a man and his wife betwixt a man and himself betwixt the flesh and the heart wherefore good master standfast be as your name is and when you have done all stand  at this course there was among the pilgrims a mixture of joy and trembling but at length they brake out and sang    what danger is the pilgrim in     how many are his foes   how many ways there are to sin     no living mortal knows    some of the ditch shy are yet can     lie tumbling in the mire   some though they shun the fryingpan     do leap into the fire     chapter x  the pilgrims at home   after this i beheld until they were come unto the land of beulah where the sun shineth night and day here because they were weary they betook themselves awhile to rest and because this country was common for pilgrims and because the orchards and vineyards that were here belong to the king of the celestial country therefore they were permitted to make bold with any of his things but a little while soon refreshed them here for the bells did so ring and the trumpets continually sound so melodiously that they could not sleep and yet they received as much refreshing as if they had slept their sleep never so soundly here also the noise of them that walked in the streets was more pilgrims are come to town and another would answer saying and so many went over the water and were let in at the golden gates today they would cry again there is now a legion of shining ones just come to town by which we know that there are more pilgrims upon the road for here they come to wait for them and comfort them after all their sorrow then the pilgrims got up and walked to and fro but how were their ears now filled with heavenly voices and their eyes delighted with celestial visions in this land they heard nothing saw nothing felt nothing smelt nothing tasted nothing that was offensive to their stomach or mind only when they tasted of the water of the river over which they were to go they thought that it tasted a little bitterish to the palate but it proved sweeter when it was down  in this place there was a record kept of the names of them that had been pilgrims of old and a history of all the famous acts that they had done it was here also much spoken of how the river to some had had its flowings and what ebbings it had had while others have gone over it has been in a manner dry for some while it has overflowed its banks for others  in this place the children of the town would go into the kings gardens and gather nosegays for the pilgrims and bring them to them with much affection here also grew camphire with spikenard and saffron calamus and cinnamon with all the trees of frankincense myrrh and aloes with all chief spices with these the pilgrims chambers were perfumed while they stayed here and with these were their bodies anointed to prepare them to go over the river when the time appointed was come  sidenote christiana receives message  now while they lay here and waited for the good hour there was a noise in the town that there was a messenger come from the celestial city with matter of great importance to one christiana the wife of christian the pilgrim so inquiry was made for her and the house was found out where she was so the messenger presented her with a letter the contents whereof were hail good woman i bring thee tidings that the master calleth for thee and expecteth that thou shouldest stand in his presence in clothes of everlasting life within these ten days  when he had read this letter to her he gave her therewith a sure token that he was a true messenger and was come to bid her make haste to be gone the token was an arrow with a point sharpened with love let easily into her heart which by degrees wrought so effectually with her that at the time appointed she must be gone  when christiana saw that her time was come and that she was the first of this company that was to go over she called for mr greatheart her guide and told him how matters were so he told her he was heartily glad of the news and could have been glad had the post come for him then she bid that he should give advice how all things should be prepared for her journey so he told her saying thus and thus it must be and we that are left will accompany you to the riverside  then she called for her children and gave them her blessing and told them that she yet read with comfort the mark that was set in their foreheads and was glad to see them with her there and that they had kept their garments so white lastly she gave to the poor that little she had and commanded her sons and her daughters to be ready against the messenger should come for them  when she had spoken these words to her guide and to her children she called for mr valiantfortruth and said unto him sir you have in all places shown yourself truehearted be faithful unto death and my king will give you a crown of life i would also entreat you to have an eye to my children and if at any time you see them faint speak comfortably to them for my daughters my sons wives they have been faithful and a fulfilling of the promise upon them will be their end but she gave mr standfast a ring  then she called for old mr honest and said of him behold an israelite indeed in whom is no guile  then said he i wish you a fair day when you set out for mount zion and shall be glad to see that you go over the river dry shod  but she answered come wet come dry i long to be gone for however the weather is in my journey i shall have time enough when i come there to sit down and rest me and dry me  then came in that good man mr readytohalt to see her so she said to him thy travel hitherto has been with difficulty but that will make thy rest the sweeter but watch and be ready for at an hour when you think not the messenger may come  after him came in mr despondency and his daughter muchafraid to whom she said you ought with thankfulness for ever to remember your deliverance from the hands of giant despair and out of doubting castle the effect of that mercy is that you are brought with safety hither be ye watchful and cast away fear be sober and hope to the end  then she said to mr feeblemind thou wast delivered from the mouth of giant slaygood that thou mightest live in the light of the living for ever and see thy king with comfort only i advise thee to turn thee of thy aptness to fear and doubt of his goodness before he sends for thee lest thou shouldest when he comes be forced to stand before him for that fault with blushing  sidenote christiana crosses the river  now the day drew on that christiana must be gone so the road was full of people to see her take her journey but behold all the banks beyond the river were full of horses and chariots which were come down from above to accompany her to the city gate so she came forth and entered the river with a beckon of farewell to those that followed her to the riverside the last words that she was heard to say were i come lord to be with thee and bless thee  so her children and friends returned to their place for that those that waited for christiana had carried her out of their sight so she went and called and entered in at the gate with all the tokens of joy that her husband christian had done before her at her departure her children wept but mr greatheart and mr valiant played upon the welltuned cymbal and harp for joy so all departed to their respective places  sidenote pilgrims receive messages  in process of time there came a messenger to the town again and his business was with mr readytohalt so he inquired him out and said to him i am come to thee from him whom thou hast loved and followed though upon crutches and my message is to tell thee that he expects thee at his table to sup with him in his kingdom the next day after easter wherefore prepare thyself for this journey then he also gave him a token that he was a true messenger saying i have broken thy golden bowl and loosed thy silver cord  after this mr readytohalt called for his fellowpilgrims and told them saying i am sent for and god shall surely visit you also so he desired mr valiant to make his will and because he had nothing to bequeath to them that should survive him but his crutches and his good wishes therefore thus he said these crutches i bequeath to my son that shall tread in my steps with a hundred warm wishes that he may prove better than i have done then he thanked mr greatheart for his conduct and kindness and so addressed himself to his journey when he came to the brink of the river he said now i shall have no more need of these crutches since yonder are chariots and horses for me to ride on the last words he was heard to say were welcome life so he went his way  after this mr feeblemind had tidings brought him that the messenger sounded his horn at his chamberdoor then he came in and told him saying i am come to tell thee that thy master has need of thee and that in a very little time thou must behold his face in brightness and take this as a token of the truth of my message those that look out at the windows shall be darkened then mr feeblemind called for his friends and told them what errand had been brought unto him and what token he had received of the truth of the message then he said since i have nothing to bequeath to any to what purpose should i make a will as for my feeble mind that i will leave behind me for that i shall have no need of in the place whither i go nor is it worth bestowing upon the poorest pilgrim wherefore when i am gone i desire that you mr valiant would bury it in a dunghill this done and the day being come on which he was to depart he entered the river as the rest his last words were hold out faith and patience so he went over to the other side  when days had many of them passed away mr despondency was sent for for a messenger was come and brought this message to him trembling man these are to summon thee to be ready with thy king by the next lords day to shout for joy for thy deliverance from all thy doubtings and said the messenger that my message is true take this for a proof so he gave him the grasshopper to be a burden unto him  now mr despondencys daughter whose name was muchafraid said when she heard what was done that she would go with her father then mr despondency said to his friends myself and my daughter you know what we have been and how troublesomely we have behaved ourselves in every company my will and my daughters is that our discouraged feelings and slavish fears be by no man received from the day of our departure for ever for i know that after my death they will offer themselves to others for to be plain with you they are ghosts the which we entertained when we first began to be pilgrims and could never shake them off after and they will walk about and seek entertainment of the pilgrims but for our sakes shut ye the doors upon them when the time was come for them to depart they went to the brink of the river the last words of mr despondency were farewell night welcome day his daughter went through the river singing but none could understand what she said  then it came to pass a while after that there was a messenger in the town that inquired for mr honest so he came to his house where he was and delivered to his hand these lines thou art commanded to be ready against this day sevennight to present thyself before thy lord at his fathers house and for a token that my message is true all thy daughters of music shall be brought low then mr honest called for his friends and said unto them i die but shall make no will as for my honesty it shall go with me let them that come after me be told this when the day that he was to be gone was come he prepared himself to go over the river now the river at that time overflowed its banks in some places but mr honest in his lifetime had spoken to one goodconscience to meet him there the which also he did and lent him his hand and so helped him over the last words of mr honest were grace reigns so he left the world  sidenote the final summons  after this it was noised abroad that mr valiantfortruth was taken with a summons by the same messenger as the other and had this for a token that the summons was true that his pitcher was broken at the fountain when he understood it he called for his friends and told them of it then said he i am going to my fathers and though with great difficulty i am got hither yet now i do not repent me of all the trouble i have been at to arrive where i am my sword i give to him that shall succeed me in my pilgrimage and my courage and skill to him that can get it my marks and scars i carry with me to be a witness for me that i have fought his battles who now will be my rewarder when the day that he must go hence was come many accompanied him to the riverside into which as he went he said death where is thy sting and as he went down deeper he said grave where is thy victory so he passed over and all the trumpets sounded for him on the other side  then there came forth a summons for mr standfast this mr standfast was he whom the pilgrims found upon his knees in the enchanted ground for the messenger brought it him open in his hands the contents thereof were that he must prepare for a change of life for his master was not willing that he should be so far from him any longer at this mr standfast was put into a muse  nay said the messenger you need not doubt the truth of my message for here is a token of the truth thereof thy wheel is broken at the cistern  then he called to him mr greatheart who was their guide and said unto him sir although it was not my hap to be much in your good company in the days of my pilgrimage yet since the time i knew you you have been profitable to me when i came from home i left behind me a wife and five small children let me entreat you at your return for i know that you will go and return to your masters house in hopes that you may yet be a conductor to more of the holy pilgrims that you send to my family and let them be acquainted with all that hath or shall happen unto me tell them moreover of my happy arrival to this place and of the present and late blessed condition that i am in tell them also of christian and christiana his wife and how she and her children came after her husband tell them also what a happy end she made and whither she is gone i have little or nothing to send to my family unless it be my prayers and tears for them of which it will suffice that you acquaint them if peradventure they may prevail  sidenote end of the pilgrimage  when mr standfast had thus set things in order and the time being come for him to haste him away he also went down to the river now there was a great calm at that time in the river wherefore mr standfast when he was about halfway in stood a while and talked to his companions that had waited upon him thither and he said this river has been a terror to many yea the thoughts of it have also frighted me but now methinks i stand easy my foot is fixed upon that on which the feet of the priests that bare the ark of the covenant stood while israel went over jordan the waters indeed are to the palate bitter and to the stomach cold yet the thought of what i am going to and of the conduct that waits for me on the other side doth lie as a glowing coal at my heart i see myself now at the end of my journey my toilsome days are ended i am going to see that head which was crowned with thorns and that face which was spit upon for me i have formerly lived by hearsay and faith but now i go where i shall live by sight and shall be with him in whose company i delight myself i have loved to hear my lord spoken of and wherever i have seen the print of his shoe in the earth there i have coveted to set my foot too his name has been to me as a perfume box yea sweeter than all sweet smells his voice to me has been most sweet and his countenance i have more desired than they that have most desired the light of the sun his word i did use to gather for my food and for medicine against my faintings he has held me and hath kept me from my sins yea my steps hath he strengthened in his way  now while he was thus speaking his countenance changed his strong man bowed under him and after he had said take me for i come unto thee he ceased to be seen of them  but glorious it was to see how the open region was filled with horses and chariots with trumpeters and pipers with singers and players on stringed instruments to welcome the pilgrims as they went up and followed one another in at the beautiful gate of the city  as for christians children the four boys that christiana brought with her with their wives and children i did not stay where i was till they were gone over also since i came away i heard one say that they were yet alive and so would be for the help of the church in that place where they were for a time  shall it be my lot to go that way again i may give those that desire it an account of what i here am silent about meantime i bid my reader    adieu     the little pilgrim  the story of a little girl who tried to go on pilgrimage     in a large old house with two kind aunts     the little marian dwelt   and a happy child she was i ween     for though at times she felt   that playmates would be better far     than either birds or flowers   yet her kind old aunts and story books     soothed many lonely hours    her favorite haunt in the summertime     was a large old appletree   and oft amid the boughs she sat     with her pet book on her knee   the pilgrims progress was its name     and marian loved it much   it is indeed a glorious book     there are not many such    she read it in her little bed     beside the winter fire   and in summertime in the appletree     as though she would never tire    but unexplained tis just the book     to puzzle the young brain   and the poor child had no kind friend     its meaning to explain    for though her aunts were very kind     they were not overwise   and only said dont read so child     im sure youll spoil your eyes    but marian still went reading on     and visions strange and wild   began to fill the little head     of the lonely dreaming child   for she thought that christian and his wife     and all their children too   had left behind their pleasant home     and done what she must do    ill take my bible said the child     and seek the road to heaven   ill try to find the wicket gate     and hope to be forgiven   i wish my aunts would go with me     but tis in vain to ask   they are so deaf and rather lame     theyd think it quite a task    no i must go alone i see     so ill not let them know   or like poor christians friends theyll say     my dear you must not go    but i must wait till some grand scheme     can all their thoughts engage   and then ill leave my pleasant home     and go on pilgrimage    she had not waited long before     one fine autumnal day   she saw the large old coach arrive     to take her aunts away   were going out to spend the day     the two old ladies said   we mean to visit mrs blair     poor soulshes ill in bed    but marian you must stay at home     for the ladys ill you see   you can have your dinner if you like     in the large old appletree   and play in the garden all the day     quite happy and content   a few more parting words were said     and off the ladies went    the servants too were all engaged     the day is come at last   said marian but oh i wish     my pilgrimage was past   she knelt beside the appletree     and for gods assistance prayed   then with her basket in her hand     forth tripped the little maid    behind the house where marian dwelt     far off in the distance lay   a high steep hill which the sun at morn     tinged with its earliest ray   difficulty was its rightful name     the child had often thought   towards this hill she turned her steps     with hopeful visions fraught    the flowers seemed to welcome her     twas a lovely autumn morn   the little lark sang merrily     above the waving corn   ah little lark you sing said she     on your early pilgrimage   i too will sing for pleasant thoughts     should now my mind engage    in clear sweet strains she sang a hymn     and tripped lightly on her way   until a pool of soft thick mud     across her pathway lay   this is the slough of despond she cried     but she bravely ventured through   and safely reached the other side     but she lost one little shoe    on an old gray stone she sat her down     to eat some fruit and bread   then took her little bible out     and a cheering psalm she read    then with fresh hope she journeyed on     for many miles away   and she reached the bottom of the hill     before the close of day    she clambered up the steep ascent     though faint and weary too   but firmly did our marian keep     her purpose still in view    im glad at least the arbors past     said the little tired soul   im sure i should have sat me down     and lost my little roll   on the high hilltop she stands at last     and our weary pilgrim sees   a porters lodge of ample size     half hid by sheltering trees    she clapped her hands with joy and cried     oh theres the wicket gate   and i must seek admittance there     before it is too late   gently she knockstis answered soon     and at the open door   stands a tall stout manpoor marian felt     as she neer had felt before    with tearful eyes and trembling hand     flushed cheek and anxious brow   she said i hope youre watchful sir     i want discretion now    oh yes im watchful said the man     as a porter ought to be   i spose youve lost your way young miss     youve lost your shoe i see    missus he cried to his wife within     heres a child here at the door   youll never see such a one again     if you live to be fourscore   she wants discretion so she says     indeed i think tis true   but i know some who want it more     who will not own they do    go to the hall his wife replies     and take the child with you   the ladies there are all so wise     theyll soon know what to do   the man complied and led the child     through many a flowery glade   is that the palace beautiful     the little pilgrim said    there to the left among the trees     why miss tis mighty grand   call it a palace if you please     tis the finest in the land   now we be come to the fine old porch     and this is the marble hall   here little lady you must stay     while i the servants call    tired and sad he left the child     but he quickly reappeared   and with him the lady of the house     poor marians heart was cheered   sweet little girl the lady said     in accents soft and kind   im sure you sadly want some rest     and rest you soon shall find    to a room where three young ladies sat     the child was quickly led   piety prudence and charity     to herself she softly said   what is your name my little dear     said the eldest of the three   whom marian in her secret thought     had christened piety    well send a servant to your friends     how uneasy they must be   admiringly she watched the child     who indeed was fair to see   around her bright and lovely face     fell waves of auburn hair   as modestly she told her name     with whom she lived and where    how did you lose your way my love     she gently raised her head   i do not think ive lost my way     the little pilgrim said    this is the palace beautiful     may i stay here tonight   they smiled and said were glad our house     finds favor in your sight    yes gladly will we keep you here     for many nights to come   thank you said marian but i soon     must seek my heavenly home   the valley of the shadow of death     is near this house i know   she stopped for she saw with great surprise     their tears began to flow    she little thought the mourning dress     which all the ladies wore   was for one whom they had dearly loved     and should see on earth no more   their brother had been called away     their brightest and their best   no wonder then that marians words     roused grief in every breast    sobs only for awhile were heard     at length the ladies said   my love you have reminded us     of our loved and early dead   but this you could not know my dear     and it indeed is true   we are all near to deaths dark door     even little girls like you    yes said the timid trembling child     i know it must be so   but maam i hope that piety     may be with me when i go   and will you show me your armory     when you have time to spare   i hope you have some small enough     for a little girl to wear    no more she said for piety     as marian called her cast   her arms around the pilgrims neck     the secrets out at last   you puzzled all said piety     but now i see youve read   a glorious book which unexplained     has turned your little head    oh dearly when i was a child     i loved that pilgrim tale   but then mamma explained it well     and if we can prevail   on your kind aunts to let you stay     some time with us my dear   you shall read that book with my mamma     and she will make it clear    now well return to marians home     and see whats passing there   the servants all had company     and a merry group they were    they had not missed our pilgrim long     for they knew she oft would play   in that old garden with a book     the whole of the livelong day    betty at last said the housekeeper     where can miss marian be   her dinner was in the basket packed     but sure shell come in to tea   they sought her here they sought her there     but they could not find the child   and her poor old aunts when they came home     with grief were almost wild    the coachman and the footman too     in different ways were sent   but none thought of the narrow way     in which the pilgrim went   perhaps she followed us to town     poor aunt rebecca said   i wish we had not left our home     i fear the child is dead    and to the town the coachman went     for they knew not what to do   and night drew on when a country boy     brought marians little shoe   with the shoe in her hand the housekeeper     into the parlor ran   oh mistress here is all thats left     of poor miss marian    it was found sticking in the mud     just above harlem chase   i fear the poor childs perished there     for tis a frightful place   then louder grew the ladies grief     but soon their hearts were cheered   when a footman grand with a note in his hand     from the distant hall appeared    aunt ruth now read the note and cried     oh sister all is well   the child is safe at brookland hall     with lady arundel   who wants to keep her for a month     why yes i think she may   such friends as lady arundel     are not met with every day    our compliments and thanks to her     when you return young man   well call tomorrow at the hall     and see miss marian   then came a burst of grateful joy     that could not be suppressed   and with thankful hearts and many tears     the ladies went to rest    well take a peep at our marian now     there in her bed lies she   how blissful were her dreams that night     in the arms of piety    oh that happy month at brookland hall     how soon it passed away   cheerful and good were marians friends     and who so kind as they    and more than all while there she stayed     they did their best to bring   the little lamb to that blest fold     where reigns the shepherd king   for many a lesson neer forgot     the little marian learned   and a thoughtful and a happier child     she to her home returned    years rolled away the scene has changed     a wife and mother now   marian has found the wicket gate     she and her children too   and oh how sweet it is to see     this little pilgrim band   as on towards their heavenly home     they travel hand in hand   when cloudy days fall to their lot     they see a light afar   the light that shone on bethlehems plain     the pilgrims guiding star    and now dear children whosoeer     or wheresoer you be   who ponder oer this strange true tale     of marians history    if to the flowers of your young hearts     instructions dews are given   oh be earnest as our marian was     to find the road to heaven
