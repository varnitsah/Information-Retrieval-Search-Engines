57072754	true words for brave men   by charles kingsley  late rector of eversley chaplain to the queen and to the prince of wales  a book for soldiers and sailors libraries  eleventh thousand  london kegan paul trench  co 1 paternoster square  1884  the rights of translation and of reproduction are reserved  dedicated by kind permission to general sir william codrington gcb and admiral wellesley cb in memory of charles kingsley who was proud of their friendship and loved and honoured them as he loved and honoured all brave soldiers and sailors     yet was he courteous still to every wight    and loved them that did to armes incline     spenser     introductory note   this little volume is selected from the unpublished sermons and addresses of charles kingsley by the request of a colonel of artillery and with the sanction of an army chaplain of long experience who knew the influence of his writings on soldiers and who wish that that influence may live though he is no longer here  the lecture on cortez was given at aldershot camp in 1858 and the address to brave soldiers and sailors written for and sent out to the troops before sebastopol in the winter of 1855 when mr kingsleys own heart with that of all england was grieving over the sufferings of our noble army in the crimea  f e k     i  the good centurion or the man under authority      and when jesus was entered into capernaum there came unto him a    centurion beseeching him and saying lord my servant lieth at home    sick of the palsy grievously tormented  and jesus said unto him i    will come and heal him  the centurion answered and said lord i am    not worthy that thou shouldest come under my roof but speak the word    only and my servant shall be healed  for i am a man under authority    having soldiers under me and i say unto this man go and he goeth    and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and    he doeth it  when jesus heard it he marvelled and said to them that    followed verily i say unto you i have not found such great faith    no not in israelmatt viii 510  we find in holy scripture that of the seven heathens who were first drawn to our lord jesus christ and his gospel three were soldiers  the first was the centurion of whom our lord speaks in such high terms of commendation  the next the centurion who stood by his cross and said truly this was the son of god  old legends say that his name was longinus and tell graceful tales of his afterlife which one would fain believe if there were any evidence of their truth  the third of course was cornelius of whom we read in the acts of the apostles  now these three centurionscommanding each a hundred menhad probably risen from the ranks they were not highly educated men they had seen endless cruelty and immorality they may have had at times to do ugly work themselves in obedience to orders  they were doing at the time when they are mentioned in scripture almost the worst work which a soldier can do  for they were not defending their own country against foreign enemies  they were keeping down a conquered nation by a stern military despotism in which the soldiery acted not merely as police but as gaolers and executioners  and yet three men who had such work as this to do are singled out in scripture to become famous through all time as the firstfruits of the heathen and of one of them our lord said i have not found such great faith no not in israel  why is this  was there anything in these soldiers profession in these soldiers training which made them more ready than other men to acknowledge the lord jesus christ  and if so what was it  let us take the case of this first centurion and see if it will tell us we will not invent any reasons of our own for his great faith  we will let him give his own reasons  we will let him tell his own story  we may trust it for our blessed lord approved of it  our lord plainly thought that what the soldier had spoken he had spoken well  and yet it is somewhat difficult to understand what was in his mind  he was plainly no talker no orator  like many a good english soldier sailor yeoman man of business he had very sound instincts in him and drew very sound conclusions from them but he could not put them into words  he knew that he was right but he could not make a speech about it  better that than beas too many areready to make glib speeches which they only half believe themselves ready to deceive themselves with subtle arguments and highflown oratory till they can give the most satisfactory reasons for doing the most unsatisfactory and unreasonable things  no the good soldier was no orator but he had sound sense under his clumsy words  let us listen to them once more  i am a man under authority having soldiers under me  and i say to this man go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it  surely the thought which was in his mind is to be found in the very words which he usedauthority subordination  discipline  obedience  he was under authority and must obey his superior officer  he had soldiers under him and they must obey him  there must be not only no mutiny but no neglect no arguing no asking why  if he said go a man must go if he said come a man must come and make no words about it  otherwise the emperors service would go to ruin through laziness distrust and mutinous talk  by subordination by discipline by mutual trust and strict obedience that empire of rome was conquering the old world because every roman knew his place and every roman did what he was told  but what had that to do with our lords power and with the healing of the child  this  the honest soldier had i think in his mind that subordination was one of the most necessary things in the world that without it the world could not go on  then he said to himself if there must be subordination on earth must there not be subordination in heaven  if he a poor officer could get his commands obeyed by merely speaking the word then how much more could god  if jesus wasas he saidas his disciples saidthe lord the god of the jews then he had no need to come and see a sick man no need to lay his hands on him to perform ceremonies or say prayers over him  the laws of nature by which health and sickness come would obey his word of command without rebellion and without delay  speak the word only lord and my servant shall be healed  but how did the centurion knowseemingly at first sight that jesus was the lord god  ah how indeed  i think it was because he had learnt the soldiers lesson  he had seen many a valiant officertribunes prefects consuls emperors commanding men and fit to command men  there was no lack of such men in the roman empire then as the poor foolish unruly jews found out to their cost within the next forty years  and the good centurion had been accustomed to look at such men and to look up to them beside and say not merelyit is a duty to obey these men butit is a delight to obey them  he had been accustomedas it is good for every man to be accustomedto meet men superior to himself men able to guide and rule him  and he had learnedas every good soldier ought to learnwhen he met such a man not to envy him not to backbite him not to intrigue against him not to try to pull him down but to accept him for what he wasa man who was to be followed if need be to the death  there was in that good centurion none of the base spirit of envy which dreads and therefore hates excellence hates ability hates authority the mutinous spirit which ends notas it dreamsin freedom and equality but in slavery and tyranny because it transforms a whole armya whole nationfrom what it should be a pack of staunch and faithful hounds into a mob of quarrelsome and greedy curs  not of that spirit was the good centurion but of the spirit of reverence and loyalty the spirit which delights in and looks up to all that is brave and able great and good the spirit of true independence true freedom and the true selfrespect which respects its fellow men and therefore it was that when the centurion came into the divine presence of christ he knew at once instinctively and by a glance into what a presence he had come  christs mere countenance christs mere bearing i believe told that good soldier who he was  he knew of old the look of great commanders and now he saw a countenance in spite of all its sweetness more commanding than he had ever seen before  he knew of old the bearing of consuls and of emperors and now in spite of christs lowly disguise he recognised the bearing of an emperor of emperors a king of kings  he had learnt of old to know a man when he met one and now he felt that he had met the man of all men the son of man and that so godlike was his presence that he must be likewise the son of god  and so had this good soldier his reward his reward for the soldierly qualities which he had acquired for subordination for reverence for admiration of great and able men  and what was his reward  not merely that his favourite servant was healed at his request but that he learnt to know the lord jesus christ whom truly to know is everlasting life whom the selfish the conceited the envious the slanderous the insolent the mutinous know not and never will know for they are not of his spirit neither is he of theirs  but more what is the moral which old divines have drawn from this story if you wish to govern learn first to obey  that is a moral lesson more valuable than even the use of arms  to learnas the good centurion learntthat a free man can give up his independence without losing it losing it  independence is never more called out than by subordination a man never feels himself so much of a free man as when he is freely obeying those whom the laws of his country have set over him  a man never feels so able as when he is following the lead of an abler man than himself  remember this  make it a point of honour to do your duty earnestly scrupulously and to the uttermost and you will find that the habits of selfrestraint discipline and obedience which you as soldiers have learned will stand you in good stead for the rest of your lives and make you each in his place fit to rule just because you have learned to obey  but now go on a step as the good centurion went on and sayif there is no succeeding in earthly things whether in soldiering or any other profession without subordination without obeying rules and orders strictly and without question then perhaps there is no succeeding in spiritual and heavenly things  for has not god his moral laws his spiritual laws which must be obeyed if you intend to prosper in this life or in the life to come  thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart and soul and thy neighbour as thyself  thou shalt honour thy father and thy mother thou shalt not kill steal commit adultery slander or covet  so it is written not merely on those old tables of stone on sinai but in the eternal will of god and in the very nature of this world which god has made  there is no escaping those laws  they fulfil themselves  god says to them go and they go come and they come do justice on the offender and they do it  if we are fools and disobey them they will grind us to powder  if we are wise and obey them they will reward us  for in wisdoms right hand is length of days and in her left hand riches and honour  her ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peace  she is a tree of life to them that lay hold of her and blessed is every one that retaineth her as god grant you all will do  but you too in time may have soldiers under you  think i beseech you earnestly of this and for their sake as well as for your own try by gods help to live worthy of christian english men  let them see you going out and coming in whether on duty or by your own firesides as men who feel that they are ever beneath their great taskmasters eye who have a solemn duty to perform namely the duty of living like good men toward your superior officers your families your neighbours your country and your godeven towards that saviour who so loved you that he died for you on the cross to set you the example of what true men should be the example of perfect duty perfect obedience perfect courage perfect generosityin one wordthe example of a perfect hero  live such lives and then will be fulfilled to you and to your children after you from generation to generation the promises which god made ages since to the men of judea of old promises which are all true still and will continue true in every country of the world till the worlds end  put thou thy trust in the lord and be doing good dwell in the land and verily thou shalt be fed  the lord knoweth the doings of the righteous and their inheritance shall endure for ever  they shall not be confounded in the perilous time and in the days of dearth they shall have enough  the lord ordereth a good mans going and maketh his way acceptable to himself  though he fall he shall not be cast down for the lord upholdeth him with his hand  i have been young and now i am old yet saw i never the righteous forsaken nor his seed begging their bread  flee from evil and do the thing that is good and dwell for evermore  for the lord loveth the thing that is right he forsaketh not his that are godly but they are preserved for ever  amen     ii  christ is come  a christmas sermon      for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and the    government shall be upon his shoulder and his name shall be called    wonderful counsellor the mighty god the everlasting father the    prince of peace  of the increase of his government and peace there    shall be no end upon the throne of david and upon his kingdom to    order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from    henceforth even for everisaiah ix 6 7  it is now more than three thousand years ago that god made to abraham the promise in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed again the promise was renewed to moses when he was commanded to tell the jews a prophet shall the lord your god raise up unto you like unto me hear ye him     in davids psalms again this same strange person was spoken of who was already and yet who was to come  david calls him the son of god the king of kings  again in the prophets in many strange and mysterious words is this same being spoken of as a virgins childbehold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and his name shall be called emmanuel god with us and again unto us a child is born unto us a son is given and his name shall be called wonderful counsellor the mighty godthe everlasting father the prince of peace and again there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of jesse and a branch shall grow out of his roots  and the spirit of the lord shall rest upon himthe spirit of wisdom and understanding the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the lord  and with righteousness shall he judge the poor c  and again thou bethlehem though thou be little among the princes of judah yet out of thee shall come forth he that is to be ruler in israel whose goings forth have been from everlasting  and he shall be great unto the ends of the earth  but time would fail me if i tried to repeat to you half the passages wherein the old jewish prophets foretold him who was to come and in whom all the nations of the earth should be blessed more and more clearly as the time drew nigh  well my friends surely you know of whom i have been speakingof whom moses and the prophets spokeof him who was born of a village maiden laid in a manger proclaimed of angels to the shepherds worshipped with hymns of glory by the heavenly host on the first christmas day eighteen hundred and seventyeight years ago as we count time  aye strange as it may seem he is come and in him all the nations of the earth are blessed  he is comethe conqueror of evilthe desire of all nationsthe lawgiverthe lamb which was to suffer for our sinsthe king of kingsthe light which should lighten the heathenthe virgins child of wondrous wisdom whose name should be god as well as manwhom all the heathens amid strange darkness and mad confusions had still been fearing and looking for  he is comehe came on that first christmastide  and we here on each christmastide can thank god for his coming and say before men and angels unto us a child is bornthe prince of peace is oursto his kingdom we belonghe has borne about on him a mans body a mans soul and spirithe was born like uslike us he grewlike us he rejoiced and sorrowedtempted in all points like as we are yet without sinable to the uttermost to understand and help all who come to god by him  he has bruised the serpents headhe has delivered us from the power of darkness and brought us into his kingdom  through his blood we have redemption and forgivenessyes through him who though he was laid in a manger was yet the image of the unseen god  and by him and for himthat babe of bethlehemwere all things created in heaven and earthand he is before all things and by him all things consist  all heaven and earth and all the powers therein are held together by him for it pleased the father that in him should all fulness dwell and having made peace through the blood of his cross to reconcile by that child all things unto himselfall things in heavenall things in earth  this should be our boastthis should be our gloryfor this do we meet together every christmas day  but what is all this to us if that blessed man be gone away from us  our souls want more than i have told you yet  our souls want more than a beautiful and wonderful story about christ  they want christ himself preaching is blessed and useful if it speaks of christ  our own thoughts are blessed and useful if we think of christ  the bible is most blessed and useful containing all things necessary to salvation for it speaks of christ  our prayers are blessed and useful if in them we call and cry earnestly to christ  but neither preaching nor thinking nor praying are enough  in them we think about him and speak to him  but we want him to speak to us  we want not merely a man to say your sins may be forgiven you we want christ himself to say your sins are forgiven you  we want not merely a wise book to tell us that the good men of old belonged to christs kingdomwe want christ himself to tell us that we belong to his kingdom  we want not merely a book that tells us that he promised always to be with uswe want him himself to tell us that he is really now with us  we want not merely a promise from a prophet of old that in him all the nations of the earth shall be blessed but a sign from christ himself that this nation of england is really now blest in him  in short we want not words however true words however fine words about christ  we want christ himself to forgive us our sinsto give peace and freedom to our heartsto come to us unseen and fill us with thoughts and longings such as our fallen nature cannot give ussuch thoughts and feelings as we cannot explain in words for they are too deep and blessed to be talked aboutbut thoughts which say to us as if the blessed jesus himself spoke to us in the depths of our hearts poor struggling sinful brother thou art mine  for thee i was bornfor thee i diedthee i will teachi will guide thee and inform thee with mine eyei will never leave thee nor forsake thee  wellyou want himand you want a sign of hima sign of his own giving that he is among you this daya sign of his own giving that he has taken you into his kingdoma sign of his own giving that he died for youthat he will feed and strengthen your souls in you with his own life and his own body  thenthere is a signthere is the sign which has stood stedfast and sure to youand to your fathersand your forefathers before themback for eighteen hundred years over half the world  there is the bread of which he said take eat this is my body which is broken for you there is the wine of which he said this cup is the new covenant in my blood which is shed for you and for many for the forgiveness of sins there is his sign  dont ask how  dont try to explain it away and fancy that you can find fitter and soberer and safer and more gospel sounding words than jesus christs own by which to speak of his own sacrament  but say with the great queen elizabeth of old when men tried too curiously to enquire into her opinion concerning this blessed mystery     christ made the word and spake it    he took the bread and brake it    and what his word did make it    that i believe and take it  he said this bread is my body which was broken for you  he said this cup is the new testament in my blood  is it or is it not  and if it is is not christ among us now indeed  is not that something better than all the preaching in the world  jesus christ the king of kingsthe saviourthe delivererthe lamb of godthe everlasting sonthe wordthe lightthe lifeis here among us ready to feed our souls in the holy sacrament of his body and blood as surely as that bread and wine will feed our bodiesyeato feed our souls and bodies to everlasting life  ho every one that thirsteth come ye to the waters and drink  come buy wine without money and without price     iii  is or is not the bible true      if i say the truth why do ye not believe mejohn viii 46  is or is not the bible true  to this question we must all come some day or other  do you believe that that book which lies there which we call the bible is a true book or a lying book  is it true or false  is it right or wrong  is it from god or is it not from god  let us answer that  if it is not from god let it go but if it is from god which we know it is how dare we disobey it  that god the maker of heaven and earth should speak to menshould set his commands down in a book and give it to themand that they should neglect it disobey itit is the strangest sight that can be seen on earth that god in heaven should say one thing and a human being six feet high at most should dare to do another  if the bible is from god i say the question is not whether it is better to obey it or not  better there is no better or worse in the matterit is infinitely necessary  to obey is infinitely right to disobey is infinitely wrong  to obey is infinitely wise to disobey is infinite folly  there can be no question about the matter except in the mind of a fool  better to obey gods word  better indeedfor to obey is heaven to disobey is hell  that is the difference  and at your better moments does not the voice within you witness to and agree with the words of that book  when it tells you to care more for your soul than your bodymore for the life to come which is eternity than for the present life which lasts but a few yearsdoes not common sense tell you that  the bible tells you to reverence and love god the giver of all gooddoes not reason tell you that  the bible tells you loyally to obey to love to worship our blessed king and saviour in heaven  does not common sense tell you that  surely if there be such a person as jesus christif he is sitting now in heaven as saviour of all and one day to be judge of allby all means he is to be obeyed he is to be pleased whoever else we may displease  reason one would think would tell us thatand it is just want of reason which makes us forget it  what have you to say against the pattern of a true and holy man as laid down in the bible  the bible would have you purecan you deny that you ought to be that  it would have you peaceablecan you deny that you ought to be that  the bible would have you forgiving honest honourable active industrious  the bible would have you generous loving charitable  can you deny that that is right however some of you may dislike it  the bible would have you ask all you want from god and ask forgiveness of god for every offence great and small against him can you deny that that is right and reasonable  the bible would have you live in continual remembrance that the great eye of god is on youin continual thankfulness to the blessed saviour who died for you and has redeemed you by his own bloodwith daily and hourly prayer for gods spirit to set your heart and your understanding right on every point  can you deny that that is all right and good and properthat unless the bible be all a dream and there be no holy and almighty god no merciful christ in heaven this is the way and the only way to live  ay if there were no god no christ no hereafter it would be better for man to live as the bible tells him than to live as too many do  there would be infinitely less misery less heartburnings less suffering of body and soul if men followed christs example as told us in the bible  even if this life were all and there were neither punishment nor reward for us after deathdoes not our reason tell us that if all men and women were like christ in gentleness wisdom and purity the world as long as it lasted would be a heaven  and do not your own hearts echo these thoughts at moments when they are quietest and purest and most happy too  have you not said to yourselvesthose bible words are good words  after all if i were like that i should be happier than i am now  ah my friends listen to those thoughts when they come into your heartsthey are not your own thoughtsthey are the voice of one holier than youwiser than youone who loves you better than you love yourselvesone pleading with you stirring you up by his spirit if it be but for a moment to see the things which belong to your peace  but what can you say for yourselves if having once had these thoughts having once settled in your own minds that the gospel of god is right and you are wrong if you persist in disobeying that gospelif you agree one minute with the inner voice which says do this and live do this and be at peace with god and man and your own conscienceand then fall back the next moment into the same worldly selfish peevish sensebound miserable lifeindeath as ever  the reason my friends i am afraid with most of us is sheer follynot want of cunning and cleverness but want of heartwant of feelingwhat solomon calls folly prov i 2227 stupidity of soul when he calls on the simple souls how long ye simple ones will you love simplicity or silliness and the scorners delight in their scorning delight in laughing at what is good and fools hate knowledgehate to think earnestly or steadily about anythingthe stupidity of the ass who is too stubborn and thickskinned to turn out of his way for any oneor the stupidity of the swine who cares for his food and nothing furtheror worse than all the stupidity of the ape who cares for nothing but play and curiosity and the vain and frivolous amusements of the moment  all these tempers are common enough and they may be joined with cleverness enough  what beast so clever as an ape yet what beast so foolish so mean so useless  but this is the fault of stupidityit blinds our eyes to the world of spirits it makes us forget god it makes us see first what we can lay our hands on and nothing more it makes us forget that we have souls  our glorious minds and thoughts which should be stretching on through all eternity are cramped down to thinking of nothing further than this little hour of earthly life  our glorious hearts which should be delighting in everything which is lovely and generous and pure and beautiful and godlikeay delighting in god himselfare turned in upon themselves and set upon our own gain our own ease our own credit  in short our immortal souls made in gods image become no use to us by this stupiditythey seem for mere salt to keep our bodies from decaying  whose work is that  the devils  but whose fault is it  do you suppose that the devil has any right in you any power in you who have been washed in the waters of baptism and redeemed by christ from the service of the devil and signed with his cross on your foreheads unless you give him power  not he  mens sins open the door to the devil and when he is in he will soon trample down the good seed that is springing up and stamp the mellow soil as hard as iron so that nothing but his own seeds can grow there and so keep off the dews of gods spirit and the working of gods own gospel from making any impression on that hardened stupified soil  alas poor soul  and thy misery is double because thou knowest not that thou art miserable and thy misery is treble because thou hast brought it on thyself  my friendsthere is an ancient fable of the jews which though it is not true yet has a deep and holy meaning and teaches an awful lesson  there lived says an ancient jewish scribe by the shores of the dead sea a certain tribe of men utterly given up to pleasure and covetousness the lust of the flesh the lust of the eye and the pride of life  to them the prophet moses was sent and preached to them warning them of repentance and of judgment to cometrying to awaken their souls to high and holy thoughts and bring them back to the thought of god and heaven  and they poor fools listened to him admired his preaching agreed that it all sounded very goodbut that he went too farthat it was too difficultthat their present way of life was very pleasantthat they saw no such great need of change and so on one excuse after another till they began to be tired of moses and gave him to understand that he was impertinent troublesomethat they could see nothing wise in himnothing great how could they  so moses went his way and left them to go theirs  and long after when some travellers came by says the fable they found these foolish people were all changed into dumb beasts what they had tried to be now they really were  they had made no use of their souls and now they had lost them they had given themselves up to folly and now folly had taken to her own they had fancied as people do every day that this world is a great playground wherein every one has to amuse himself as he likes best or at all events a great shop and gamblinghouse where the most cunning wins most of his neighbours money and now according to their faith it was to them  they had forgotten god and spiritual things and now they were hid from their eyes  and these travellers found them sitting playing antics quarrelling for the fruits of the fieldmere beastsreaping as they had sown and filled full with the fruit of their own devices  only every sabbath day says the fable there came over these poor wretches an awful sense of a piercing eye watching them from abovea dim feeling that they had been something better and nobler oncea faint recollection of heavenly things which they once knew when they were little childrena blind dread of some awful unseen ruin into which their miserable empty beastlife was swiftly and steadily sweeping them downand then they tried to think and could notand tried to remember and could notand so they sat there every sabbath day cowering with fear uneasy and moaning and halfremembered that they once had souls  my friends my friends are there not too many nowadays like these poor dwellers by the dead sea who seem to have lost all of gods image except their bodies who all the week dote on the business and the pleasures of this life going on very comfortably till they seem to have quite hardened their own souls and now and then on sabbath days when they come to church and pretend to pray and worship sit all vacant stupid their hearts far away or with a sort of passing uneasiness and dim feeling that all is not righttry to think and cannottry to pray and cannotand like those dwellers by the dead sea once a week on sabbath day half remember that they once had souls  so true it is that from him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he seemeth to have  so true it is that the wages of sin is death death to the soul even in this life  so true it is that why men do not believe christ is because they cannot hear his word  so true it is that only the pure in heart shall see god or love godlike men and god like words  so true it is that he that soweth the wind shall reap the whirlwind and that he who will not hear christs words shall soon not be able to hear them that he who will not have christ for his master must soon be content to have the devil for his master and for his wages spiritual death  from which sad fate of spiritual death may the blessed saviour in his infinite mercy deliver us     iv  the tree of knowledge and the tree of life or the fall      now the serpent was more subtile than any beast of the field which    the lord god had made  and he said unto the woman yea hath god    said ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden  and the woman    said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the    garden but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the    garden god hath said ye shall not eat of it neither shall ye touch    it lest ye die  and the serpent said unto the woman ye shall not    surely die  for god doth know that in the day ye eat thereof then    your eyes shall be opened and ye shall be as gods knowing good and    evil  and when the woman saw that the tree was good for food and    that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one    wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto    her husband with her and he did eatgenesis iii 16  here is a lesson for us all  you and i and all men brought into the world with us a nature which fell in adam and as it fell before we were born it is certain enough to fall again and again after we are born in this life ay and unless we take care to fall lower and lower every day acting adams sin over again until we surely die  this is what i meanwhat god said to adam and eve he says to every one of us and what the devil said to adam and eve he will say to every one of us  first  god says to us of all the trees of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat lest thou die  of all the trees of the garden thou mayest freely eat  god grudges you nothing good for you  he has put you into this good and pleasant world where you will find pleasures enough and comforts enough to satisfy you if you are wise but there are things which god has forbidden you not out of any spite or arbitrariness but because they are bad for you because they will hurt you if you indulge in them and sooner or later kill both body and soul  now many of those wrong things look pleasant enough and reasonable enough as the forbidden fruit did  pleasant to the eyes and good for foodand to be desired to make you wise  as people grow up and go out into life they are tempted to do many things which their parents forbid which the bible forbids which the law of the land forbids and they do not understand at first why they are forbidden any more than adam and eve understood why they were not to eat of the forbidden fruit  then the devil who is always trying to slander god to us whispers to them as he did to eve how unreasonable how hard on you  people say that this is wrong and you must not do it and yet how pleasant it must be  how much money you might get by ithow much wiser and cleverer and more able to help yourself you would become if you went your own way and did what you like  surely god is hard on you and grudges you pleasure  never minddont be afraid  surely you can judge best what is good for you  surely you know your own business best  use your own common sense and do what you like and what you think will profit you are you to be a slave to old rules which your parents or the clergyman taught you  so says the devil to every young man as he goes out in life  and to many alasto many the devils words sound reasonable enough they flatter our fallen nature they flatter our pride and our selfwill and make us fancy we are going up hill and becoming very fine and manly and independent and knowing  knowing  how many a young man have i seen run into sin just that he might be knowing and say why should i not see life for myself  why should i not know the world and try what is good and how i like that and what is bad too and how i like thatand then choose for myself like a man instead of being kept in like a baby  so he says exactly what adam and eve said in their heartsi will eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil  he says in his heart too just what solomon the wise said when he too determined to eat of the fruit of the tree of knowledge  ay young people who love to see the world and to choose for yourselves read that book of ecclesiastes the saddest book on earth and get a golden lesson in every verse of it  see how solomon determined to see life from the top to the bottom of it  how he gave his heart to know seek and search out by wisdom concerning all things that are done under heaven  i have seen all the works that are done under the sun and behold all is vanity and vexation of spirit eccles i 13  and then how he turned round and gave his heart to know mirth and madness and folly and see whether that was good for him and i said of laughter it is mad and of mirth what doeth it eccles ii 226 and then he gave himself to wine and revelling and after that to riches and pomp and glory and music and the fine arts as we call them  i made me great works i builded me houses i planted me vineyards i made me gardens and orchards and i planted trees in them of all kind of fruits i made me pools of water to water therewith the wood that bringeth forth trees i got me servants and maidens and had servants born in my house also i had great possessions of great and small cattle above all that were in jerusalem before me i gathered me also silver and gold and the peculiar treasure of kings and of the provinces i gat me men singers and women singers and the delights of the sons of men as musical instruments and that of all sorts  so i was great and increased more than all that were before me in jerusalem also my wisdom remained with me  and what was the end  then i looked on all the works that my hand had done and on the labour that i had laboured to do and behold all was vanity and vexation of spirit and there was no profit under the sun  therefore he says that he hated all the labour he had taken under the sun because he must leave it to the men who came after him and found out at last after years of labour and sorrow trying to make himself happy with this and that and finding no rest with any of them that the conclusion of the whole matter was to fear god and keep his commandments for this is the whole duty of man  for god shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing whether it be good or evil eccles xii 13  so said solomonand god knows my dear friends god knows he said truly  ay and i know it to be true and i entreat you this day in gods name to hear the conclusion of the whole matter  all this you will find out by eating of the tree of knowledge and seeing life and going your own way and falling into sin and smarting for it for weary years in anxiety and perplexity and shame and sorrow of heart  all that you will find out therebyall that solomon found out therebyis just what you know already and nothing morejust what you have been taught ever since you could speak  fear god and keep his commandments for this is the whole duty of man  why buy your own experience dear when you can get it gratis for nothing already  yes a simple godly industrious life doing the duty which lies nearest you avoiding sin as you would an adder because it is sure sooner or later to sting you if you touch it is the straight road and the only road to happiness either in this life or in the life to come  pleasure and amusement drinking and jollity will not make you happy  money will not make you happy  cleverness and cunning and knowledge of the world will not make you happy  scholarship and learning will not  but plain simple righteousness simply doing right will  do right then and be happy  obey gods commandments and you will find that his commandments are life and in the pathway thereof there is no death  make up your minds to do right to be right to keep right by the help of gods right and holy spirit in the right road  make up your minds whether you will go through the world in gods way or your own waywhether you will taste what god has forbidden and so destroy yourselves or obey him and live with him in bliss  the longer you delay the more difficult you will find it  make up your minds now and ask god to teach you his own heavenly wisdom which is a tree of life to all that lay hold on it     v  i am      i am hath sent me into youexodus iii 10  every day i find it more and more true that the bible is full of good news from beginning to end  the gospelthat is good newsand the best of all good news is to be found in every book of it perhaps if we knew how to search the scriptures in every chapter and verse of it from beginning to end  for from beginning to end from genesis to malachifrom the gospel of st matthew to the end of the revelationwhat our lord said of the bible stands true they the scriptures are they which testify of me john v 39  the whole bible testifies bears witness of him the one unchangeable christ who said to moses say unto the people i am hath sent me unto you  now let us think a while what that text means for it has not to do with moses only but with all gods prophets evangelists preachers  david might have said the same to the jews in his time i am hath sent me unto you  elijah isaiah st matthew st john st paul might have said the same  and so may gods ministers now  and i however sinful or ignorant or unfaithful to my duty i may be have still a right to say as i do now say solemnly and earnestly to you i am hath sent me unto you this day  but what do i mean by that  that ought to depend on what moses meant by it  moses meant what god meant and unless i mean the same thing i must mean something wrong  and this is what i think it does mean  first  i amthe lord jesus christ told moses that his name was i am now you perhaps think that this is but a very common place name for every one can say of himselfi amand it may seem strange that god should have chosen for his own especial name words which you and i might have chosen for ourselves just as well  i daresay you think that you may fairly say you are and that i can say fairly that i am  and yet it is not so  if i say i am i say what is not true of me  i must say i am somethingi am a man i am bad or i am good or i am an englishman i am a soldier i am a sailor i am a clergymanand then i shall say what is true of me  but god alone can say i am without saying anything more  and why  because god alone is  everybody and everything else in the world becomes but god is  we are all becoming something from our birth to our deathchanging continually and becoming something different from what we were a minute before first of all we were created and made and so became men and since that we have been every moment changing becoming older becoming wiser or alas foolisher becoming stronger or weaker becoming better or worse  even our bodies are changing and becoming different day by day  but god never changes or becomes anything different from what he is now what he is that he was and ever will be  god does not even become older  this may seem very strange but it is true for god made time god made the years and once there were no years to count by no years at all  remember how long had god himself been before he made time when there was no time to pass over  remember always that god must have created time  if god did not create time no one else did for there is as the athanasian creed says one uncreated and one eternal even god who made time as well as all things else  am i puzzling you  what i want to do is to make you understand that gods life is quite utterly different from our life or any way of living and being which we can fancy or think of lest you make to yourselves the likeness of anything in heaven above or of the earth beneath and think that god is like that and so worship it and have other gods beside the true god and so break the first and second commandments as thousands do who fancy themselves good protestants and hate popery and idolatry and yet worship a very different sort of god from the i am who sent moses to the children of israel  remember then this at least that god was before all things and all worlds and all time so that there was a time when there were no worlds and a time when there was no timenothing but god alone absolute eternal neither made nor created the same that he is now and will be for ever  when i say god is that is a very different thing from god himself saying i am  a different thing  oh my friends here is the root of the whole gospel the root of all our hope for this world and for the world to comefor ourselves for our own future and the future of all the world  do you not see how  then i will try to explain  many heathen men have known that there was one eternal god and that god is  but they did not know that god himself had said so and that made them anxious puzzled almost desperate so that the wiser they were the unhappier they were  for what use is it merely knowing that god is the question for poor human creatures is but what sort of a being is god  is he far off  millions of miles from this earth  does he care nothing about us  does he let the world go its own way right or wrong is he proud and careless  a selfglorifying deity whose mercy is not over all his works or even over any of them  or does he care for us does he see us  will he speak to us  has he ever spoken to any one  has he ever told any one about himself  there is the questionthe question of all questions  and if a man once begins thinking about his own soul and this world and godtill he gets that question answered he can have no comfort about himself or the world or anythingtill in fact he knows whether god has ever spoken to men or not  and the glory of the bible the power of god revealed in the bible is that it answers the question and says god does care for men god does see men god is not far off from any one of us  ay god speaks to mengod spoke to moses and said not god is but i am  god in sundry times and in divers manners spoke to our fathers by the prophets and said i am  but moremoses said i am hath sent me  god does not merely love us and yet leave us to ourselves  he sends after us  he sends to us  in old times he sent prophets and wise men one after the other to preach repentance and righteousness and to teach men all that was good for them and when men would not listen to them but shut their ears to them and drove them out killing some and beating some god was so determined to send to men so unwearied so patient so earnest so loving still that he said i will send now my own son surely they will hear him  yes my friends this is the i am  this is godthis is our godthis is our heavenly father not a proud and selfish being who looks down haughtily from afar off on all the misery and ignorance of the world but as a wise man of old said a most merciful god a revealer of secrets who showeth to man the things which he knew not  this is our godnot a tyrant but a deliverernot a condemning god but a saving god who wills that none should perish who sends to seek and to save those who are lost who sends his sun to shine on the just and the unjust and is good to the unthankful and the evil  a god who so loved the world which he had made in spite of all its sin and follies that he spared not his only begotten son but freely gave him for it  a god who sits on his throne for ever judging right and ministering true judgment among the people who from his throne beholds all those who dwell upon the earth and fashions the hearts of them and understandeth all their works  a god who comes out of his place to visit the wrong done on the earth and be a refuge for the oppressed and a help in time of trouble to help the fatherless and poor unto their right that the men of this world be no more exalted against them  this is our god  this is our fatheralways condescending always patient always loving always just  and always active always working to do good to all his creatures like that exact pattern and copy of himself the lord jesus christ who said my father worketh hitherto and i work  john v 17  but again i am hath sent me unto you  unto whom  who was moses sent to  to the children of israel in egypt and what sort of people were they  were they wise and learned  on the contrary they were stupid ignorant and brutish  were they pious and godly  on the contrary they were worshipping the foolish idols of the egyptiansso fond of idolatry that they must needs make a golden calf and worship it  were they respectable and cleanly livers  were they teachable and obedient  on the contrary they were profligate stiff necked murmurers disobedient unwilling to trust gods goodness though he had shown them all those glorious signs and wonders for their sakes and brought them out of egypt with a mighty hand and a stretchedout arm were they highspirited and brave  on the contrary they were meanspirited and cowards murmuring against moses and against god if anything went wrong for setting them free ready to go back and be slaves to the egyptians rather than face danger and fight looking back and longing after the fleshpots of egypt where they eat bread to the full and willing to be slaves again and have all their men children drowned in the river and themselves put to hard labour in the brick kilns if they could only fill their stomachs  and even at best when moses had brought them to the very edge of that rich land of canaan which god had promised them they were afraid to go into it and win it for themselves and god had to send them back again to wander forty years in the wilderness till all that cowardly base first generation who came up out of egypt was dead and a new generation had grown up made brave and hardy by their long training in the deserts and taught to trust and obey god from their youth and so able and willing to conquer the good land which god had promised them  altogether the children of israel to whom god sent moses were plainly an ignorant brutish cowardly set of people fallen lower far than the negroes of south america fit to be slaves and nothing better  then why did god take such trouble for them  why did god care for them and help them and work wonders for them  why  exactly because they were so bad  he that hath ears to hear let him hear and understand by this example of all examples what manner of god our god is  just because they were so bad his goodness yearned over them all the more and longed to make them good  just because they were so unclean and brutish his holiness longed all the more to cleanse them  because they were so stupid and ignorant his wisdom longed to make them wise  because they were so miserable his pity yearned over them as a father over a child fallen into danger  because they were sick they had all the more need of a physician  because they were lost there was all the more reason for seeking and saving them  because they were utterly weak god desired all the more to put his strength into them that his strength might be made perfect in weakness  true gods goodness seemed of little use to too many of them  their history during the next forty years was a very sad one  with many of them god was not well pleased the bible tells us and their carcases fell in the wilderness  a sad forty years they were for moses also as he says in that sad and glorious psalm of his ps xc 7 8 we consume away in thy displeasure and are afraid of thy wrathful indignation  thou hast set our misdeeds before us our secret sins in the light of thy countenance for when thou art angry our days are gone we bring our years to an end as a tale that is told  but that was all their own fault  god never left them for all those forty years  he fed them with manna in the wilderness and the angel of his presence preserved them  and now my friends remember what i have said of god in this text i am hath sent me unto you and see how it preaches to you an almighty unchangeable father whose mercy is over all his works full of love and care for all longing and labouring for ever by his son jesus christ to raise us from the death of sin which is the only death we need to be afraid of to the life of righteousnessthe only life worth living here the only life which we can live beyond the grave  a just god a merciful god a patient god a generous god a gracious god a god whose glory is to savea god who is utterly worthy of our love and respecta god whom we can trusta god whom it is worth while to obeya god who deserves our thanks from our cradle to our gravea god to whom we ought honestly and from the bottom of our hearts to say now and for ever  we worship thee we bless thee we praise thee we magnify thee we give thanks to thee for thy great glory oh lord god heavenly king god the father almighty     vi  the englishman trained by toil      all the commandments which i command thee this day shall ye observe    to do that ye may live and multiply and go in and possess the land    which the lord sware unto your fathers  and thou shalt remember all    the way which the lord thy god led thee these forty years in the    wilderness to humble thee and to prove thee to know what was in    thine heart whether thou wouldest keep his commandments or no  and    he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger and fed thee with manna    which thou knewest not neither did thy fathers know that he might    make thee know that man doth not live by bread only but by every word    that proceedeth out of the mouth of the lord doth man live    thou    shall also consider in thine heart that as a man chasteneth his son    so the lord thy god chasteneth theedeut viii 1 2 3 5  as god led the jews through the wilderness so he leads us through the journey of life  as god called on the jews to rejoice in him and to bless him for going with them and teaching and training them by dangers and sorrows so he calls on us to lift up our hearts and bless him for teaching and training us in the battle of life  but some of you may say why do you ask us to thank god for lessons which we have bought by labour and sorrow  are not our sorrows more than our joys  our labour far heavier than our rest can be sweet  you tell us to be joyful and thank god for his mercies but why all this toil  why must we work on and on and on all our days in weariness and anxiety why must we only toil toil till we die and lie down fairly conquered and worn out on that stern mother earth from whom we have been wringing our paltry livelihood from our boyhood to our grave  what is our life but labour and sorrow  are not some of you thinking in this way today  have i not guessed the hearts of some of you at least  and is not this a strange way of making you joyful to remind you of these thoughts  my friends be sure i only remind you of these sad thoughts because they are true thoughts because god meant you to bear them and face them like men because you must have these thoughts and let them make you sad and make up your minds to face them again and again before even you can thank god really like redeemed immortal christian men and women  and believe me i would not mention these sad thoughts if i had not a remedy for them  if i had not a message to you from the living god and christ the king of the earth whereby i tell you now to rejoice and give thanks to him in spite of all your labour and sorrow  ay more i say rejoice and give thanks on account of all your labour and sorrow and count it all joy when ye fall into divers tribulations  it is true my friends we are a hard working and a somewhat sad race of men we english  the life of the working man is labour and sorrow and so is the life of the scholar and so is the life of even many a rich man  all things are full of labour in england  man cannot utter it the eye is not satisfied with seeing nor the ear with hearing we are the wisest of all nations and yet as solomon says behold in much wisdom is much grief and in increasing knowledge we still increase sorrow  truly i may say of us englishmen as paul said of the christians of his time that if christ be not raised from the dead and if in this life only we have hope in him we are of all nations one of the most unhappy  when we look at all the hundreds of thousands pent up in our great cities among filth and smoke toiling in factories in workshops in dark mines under groundwhen we think of the soldier on the march under the sultry sun of india the sailor on the stormy seawhen we think of this our bleak inclement climate our five months of winter every yearno mans food and clothing to be gained but by bitter toil either of himself or of othersand then when we compare our lot with that of the dwellers in hot countries in india and in africa and the islands of the south seas where men live with no care no labourwhere clothes and fire are never neededwhere every tree bears delicious food and man lives in perpetual summer in careless health and beauty among continual mirth and ease like the birds which know no carethen it seems at moments as if god had been unfair in giving so much more to the savage than he has to us of the blessings of this earthly life and we are led to long that our lot was cast in those fruitful and delicious climates of the south in a continual paradise of mirth and plenty and beauty and sunshine  but no my friends we are more blest than the careless indian who never knows what labour is his life is but the life of the butterfly which flutters from flower to flower and sports in the sunshine and sucks sweets for a brief hour and then perishes without hope  his life is a dream he sees no heaven before him he knows no glorious god with the sight of whom he is to be blest for ever  his body may be in perpetual ease and health and beauty for a few short years but what care has he for his undying spirit that is blind and dead within him  but to bring a mans soul to life to train and educate a mans soul that it may go on from strength to strength and glory to glory till it appears in the presence of godthat wants a stern and a severe training of sorrow and labour of which the poor pampered luxurious savage knows nothing  this is why christ brought our forefathers into this bleak cold northern land and forced them to gain their bread by the sweat of their brows and the sorrows of their hearts and to keep their land by many wars  now this is the reason of our carefulness of our many troubles that god is educating and training us english that he will not have us be savages but christian citizens he will have us not merely happy but blessed through all eternity  he will not have us to be like the poor indians slaves to our flesh and our appetitesslaves to the pleasant things around us but he will have us fill the earth and subdue it he will have england the light of the nationsand englishmen preach freedom and wisdom and prudence and the gospel of jesus christ to all the nations of the earth  therefore christ afflicts us because he loves us because whom he loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son whom he receiveth  because he has ordained england to preach the cross therefore he will have england bear the cross  it has often struck me my friends as a beautiful and a deep sign a blessed ordinance of the great and wise god that the flag of england and especially the flag of our navythe flag which is loved and reverenced through all the world as the bringer of free communion between nation and nation the bringer of order and equal justice and holy freedom and the divine majesty of law and the light of the blessed gospel wherever it goes that this flag i say should be the redcross flag the flag of the cross of christa double signa sign to all men that we are a christian nation a gospel people and a sign too to ourselves that we are meant to bear christs crossto bear the afflictions which he lays upon usto be made perfect through sufferings to crucify the flesh with its affections and lusts that we may be brave and selfdenying going forth in christs strength remembering that it is he who gives us power to get wealth that we ought to fight his battles that we ought to spread his name at home and abroad and rejoice in every sorrow which teaches us more and more the blessed meaning of his saving name and the share which we have in it  i have said that we are a melancholy people  foreigners all say of us that we are the saddest of all people that when they come to england they are struck with our silence and gloominess and careworn faces and our want of merriment and cheerfulness  and yet with all this we are the greatest of nations at this daythe strongest and the most industrious and the wisest  the gospel of jesus christ is preached oftener and more simply and more fully here in england than in any nation and i dare to say it that in spite of all our sins there are as many or more of gods true saints more holy men and women among english people at this moment than among any people of the earth  and why because there are so many among us who have hope in christ beyond this life who look for everlasting salvation through all eternity to his name  if in this life only we have hope in christ truly of all people we should be most miserable but christ is risen from the dead and he has ascended up on high and led captivity captive and received gifts for men  he sits even now at gods right hand praying for us  to him all power is given in heaven and earth and he is our covenant god and saviour he is our king  he is ours and he will have us put on his likeness and with him be made perfect through sufferingsthrough sufferings for sorrow is the gate of life  through much tribulation we enter into the kingdom of god without weary pain none of us is born into the world without weary labour not a harvest in england is grown and reaped without weary thought and teaching and correction not a child among us is educated to be a man without weary thought and weary labour not one of us can do his duty in that station of life to which christ has called him  not without weary struggles and arguings and contentions by martyrdoms by desperate wars our forefathers won for us our religion our freedom and our laws which make england the wonder of the world this is the great law of our lifeto be made perfect through sufferings as our lord and master was before us  he has dealt with us as my text tells you he dealt with the jews his chosen people of old as he deals with every soul of man on whom he sets his love  all the commandments which i command thee this day shall ye observe to do that ye may live and multiply and go in and possess the land which the lord sware unto your fathers  and thou shalt remember all the way which the lord thy god led thee these forty years in the wilderness to humble thee and to prove thee to know what was in thine heart whether thou wouldest keep his commandments or no  and he humbled thee and suffered thee to hunger and fed thee with manna which thou knewest not neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee know that man doth not live by bread only but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the lord doth man live    thou shalt also consider in thine heart that as a man chasteneth his son so the lord thy god chasteneth thee  for believe me my friends whatever nation or whatever man christ chooses to be his own and to be holy and noble and glorious with him he makes them perfect through suffering  first he stirs up in them strange longings after what is great and good  he makes them hunger and thirst after righteousness and then he lets them see how nothing on this earth nothing beautiful or nothing pleasant which they can get or invent for themselves will satisfy and so he teaches them to look to him to look for peace and salvation from heaven and not from earth  then he leads them as he led the jews of old through the wilderness and through the sea through strange afflictions through poverty and war and labour that they may learn to know that he is leading them and not themselves that they may learn to trust not in themselves but in him not in their own strength but in the bread which cometh down from heaven not in their own courage but in him and just when all seems most hopeless he makes one of them chase a thousand and by strange and unexpected providences and the courage which a just cause inspires brings his people triumphant through temptation and danger and puts to flight the armies of the heathen and the inventions of the evil fiend and glorifies his name in his chosen people  so he calls out in the heart of men and of the heart of nations the two great twin virtues which always go hand in handfaith in god and faith in themselves  he lets them feel themselves foolish that they may learn how to be wise in his wisdom  he lets them find themselves weak that they may learn how to be strong in his strength  then sometimes he lets them follow their own devices and be filled with the fruits of their own inventions  he lets their sinful hearts have free course down into the depths of idolatry and covetousness and filthy pleasure and mad self conceit that they may learn to know the bitter fruit that springs from the accursed root of sin and come back to him in shame and repentance entreating him to inform their thoughts and guide their wills and gather them to him as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wing that they may never more wander from him their life their light and their saviour  then sometimes if his children forsake his laws and break his covenant he visits their offences with the rod and their sin with the stripes of the children of men  that is he punishes them as he punishes the heathen if they sin as the heathen sin  he lets loose upon them his wrath war disease or scarcity that he may drive them back to him  and all the while he will have them labour  he will make them try their strength and use their strength and improve their strength of soul and body  by making them labour christ teaches his people industry order selfcommand selfdenial patience courage endurance foresight thoughtfulness earnestness  all these blessed virtues come out of holy labour by working in welldoing we learn lessons which the savage among his delicious fruits and flowers in his life of golden ease and luxurious laziness can never learn  and all this christ teaches us because he loves us because he would have us perfect  his love is unchangeable  as he swore by himself that he would never fail david so he has sworn that he will never fail any one of his churches or any one of us  lo said he i am with you always even to the end of the world  nothing shall separate us from the love of christ neither battle nor famine nor anything else in heaven or earth all he wants is to educate us because he loves us  he doth not afflict willingly nor grieve the children of men  and because he is a god of love he proves his love to us every now and then by blessing us as well as by correcting us else our spirits would fail before him and the souls which he has made  when he sees our adversity he hears our complaint he thinks upon his covenant and pities us according to the multitude of his mercies  a fruitful land maketh he barren for the wickedness of them that dwell therein yet when they cry unto the lord in their trouble he delivereth them out of their distress  he maketh the wilderness standing water and water springs of dry ground and there he setteth the hungry that they may build them a city that they may sow their lands and plant vineyards to yield them fruits of increase  he blesseth them so that they multiply exceedingly and suffereth not their cattle to decrease and again when they are diminished or brought low through affliction through any plague or trouble though he suffer them to be evil entreated by tyrants and let them wander out of the way in the wilderness yet helpeth he the poor out of misery and maketh them households like a flock of sheep ps cvii  o my friends have not these words ever been wonderfully fulfilled to some of you  then see how true it is that god will not always be chiding neither keepeth he his anger for ever but he knoweth our frame he remembereth that we are but dust and like as a father pitieth his children so does he pity those who fear him and oftentimes too in his great condescension those who fear him not  my friends i have been trying in this sermon to make you feel that you are under gods guidance that his providence is trying to train and educate you  i have told you that there is a blessed use and meaning in your very sorrows and in this life of continual toil which god has appointed for you i have told you that you ought to thank god for those sorrows how much more then ought you to thank him for your joys  if you should thank him for want surely you should thank him for plenty  o thank him earnestlynot only with your lips but in your lives  if you believe that he has redeemed you with his precious blood show your thankfulness by living as redeemed men holy to godwho are not your own but bought with a price therefore show forth gods glory the power of his grace in your bodies and your spirits which are his  if you feel that it is a noble thing to be an englishmanespecially an english soldier or an english sailora noble and honourable privilege to be allowed to do your duty in the noblest nation and the noblest church which the world ever sawthen live as englishmen in covenant with god faithful to him who has redeemed you and washed you from your sins in his own blood  do you be faithful and obedient to christs spirit and he will be faithful to those promises of his  though a thousand fall at thy right hand yet the evil shall not come nigh thee  blessed are all they that fear the lord and walk in his ways  for thou shalt eat the labours of thine hand  o well art thou and happy shalt thou be  the lord out of heaven shall so bless thee that thou shalt see england in prosperity all thy life long  yea thou shalt see thy childrens children and peace upon thy native land  oh remember how god fulfilled that promise to england seventy years ago when the french swept in fire and slaughter and horrors worse than either over almost every nation in europe while england remained safe in peace and plenty and an enemy never set foot on gods chosen english soil  remember the french war and our salvation in it and then believe and take comfort  trust in the lord and be doing good dwell in the land and verily thou shalt be fed     vii  higher or lower which shall win      therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after    the flesh  for if ye live after the flesh ye shall die but if ye    through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live    for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god    for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but ye    have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry abba    fatherromans viii 1215  let us try to understand these words  they are of quite infinite importance to us all  we shall all agree all of us at least who have thought at all about right and wrong and tried to do right and avoid wrongthat there goes on in us at times a strange struggle  we wish to do a right thing and at the very same time long to do a wrong one  we are pulled as it were two different ways by two different feelings feel as if we were two men at once a better man and a worse man struggling for the mastery  one may conquer or the other  we may be like the confirmed drunkard who cannot help draining off his liquor though he knows that it is going to kill him or we may be like the man who conquers his love for drink and puts the liquor away because he knows that he ought not to take it  we know too well many of us how painful this inward struggle is between our better selves and our worse selves  how discontented with ourselves it makes us how ashamed of ourselves how angry with ourselves  we all understand too wellor ought to understand st pauls words how often the good which he wished to do he did not do but the evil which he did not wish to do he did  how he delighted in the law of god in his inward man but he found another law in him in his body warring against the law of his mindthat is his conscience and reason and making a slave of him till he was ready at times to cry oh wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death  we can understand too surely the famous parable of plato the greatest of heathen philosophers who says that the soul of man is like a chariot guided by a mans will but drawn by two horses  the one horse he says is white beautiful and noble wellbroken and winged too always trying to rise and fly upward with the chariot toward heaven  but the other horse is black evil and unmanageable always trying to rush downward and drag the chariot and the driver into hell  ah my friends that is but too true a picture of most of us and god grant that in our souls the better horse may win that our nobler and purer desires may lift us up and leave behind those lower and fouler desires which try to drag us down  but to drag us down whither  to hell at last says plato the heathen  to destruction and death in the meanwhile says st paul  now in the text st paul explains this strugglethis continual war which goes on within us  he says that there are two parts in usthe flesh and the spiritand that the flesh lusts that is longs and struggles to have its own way against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh first there is a flesh in usthat is a carnal animal nature  of that there can be no doubt we are animals we come into the world as animals doeat drink sleep as they dohave the same passions as they haveand our carnal mortal bodies die at last exactly as the animals die  but are we nothing more  god forbid  st paul tells us that we are something moreand our own conscience and reason tell us that we are something more  we know that to be a man we must be something more than an animala mere brutefor when we call any one a brute what do we mean  that he has lost his humanity his sense of justice mercy and decency and given himself up to his fleshhis animal nature till the man in him is dead and only the brute remains  mind i do not say that we are right in calling any human being a brute for no one i believe is sunk so low but there is some spark of humanity some spark of what st paul calls the spirit left in him which may be fanned into a flame and conquer and raise and save the man at lastunless he be a mere idiotor that most unhappy and brutal of all beings a confirmed drunkard  but our giving way to the same selfish shameless passions which we see in the lower animals is letting the brute in us conquer is giving way to the works of the flesh  the shameless and profligate person gives way to the brute within himthe man who beats his wifeor illtreats his childrenor in any wise tyrannises over those who are weaker than himself he too gives way to the brute within him  he who grudges envies tries to aggrandise himself at his neighbours expensehe too gives way to the brute within him and puts on the likeness of the dog which snatches and snarls over his bone  he who spends his life in cunning plots and mean tricks stealthy crafty silent false he gives way to the brute in him just as much as the fox or ferret  and those let me say who without giving way to those grosser vices let their minds be swallowed up with vanity love of admiration always longing to be seen and looked at and wondering what folks will say of them they too give way to the flesh and lower themselves to the likeness of animals  as vain as a peacock says the old proverb  and shame it is to any human being so far to forget his true humanity as to have that said of him  and what shall we say of them who like the swine live only for eating and drinking and enjoyment  or what of those who like the butterflies spend all their time in frivolous amusement fluttering in the sunshine silly and helpless without a sense of duty or usefulness without forethought for the coming frosts of winter against which their gay feathers would be no protection  do not all these in some way or other give way to the animal within them and live after the flesh  and do they not all of them of the flesh reap corruption and fulfil st pauls words if ye live after the flesh ye shall die  but some one will saydieof course we shall all diegood and bad alike  is it so my friends  then why does our lord say he that liveth and believeth in me shall never die  and why does st paul say if ye through the spirit do mortify that is crush and as it were kill the deeds of the body all those low animal passions and vices ye shall live  let us look at the text again  if ye live after the flesh ye shall die  if you give way to those animal passions and viceslow and cruelor even merely selfish and frivolous you shall die not merely your bodiesthey will die in any casethe animals dofor animals they are and as animals die they must  but over and above thatyou yourselves shall dieyour character will die your manhood or your womanhood will die your immortal soul will die  the likeness of god in you will die  oh my friends there is a second death to which that first death of the body is a mere trivial and harmless accidentthe death of sin which kills the true man and true woman within you  and that second death may begin in this life and if it be not stopped and cured in time may go on for ever  the black horse of which i spoke just now may get the mastery and drag us down down into bogs out of which we can never riseover cliffs which we can never climb againdown lower and lowermore and more foolish more and more reckless more and more base more and more wretched  and then there will be no more use in saying the lord have mercy on my soul for we shall have no soul left to have mercy on  this is the dark side of the mattera very dark one but it has to be spoken of because it is true and what is more it comes true only too often in this world  god grant my dear friends that it may not come true of any of you  but there is also a bright side to the matterand on that i will speak now in order that this sermon may end as such gospel sermons surely should end not with threats and fear but with hope and comfort  if ye through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body ye shall live  if you will be true to your better selves if you will listen to and obey the spirit of god when he puts into your hearts good desires and makes you long to be just and true pure and sober kind and useful if you will cast away and trample under foot animal passions low vices you shall live  you shall live  your very soul and self shall live and live for ever  your humanity your human nature shall live  all that is humane in you shall live  all that is merciful and kind in you all that is pure and graceful all that is noble and generous all that is useful  all in you that is pleasant to yourselves shall live  all in you that is pleasant to your neighbours  all in you that is pleasant to god shall live  in one word all in you that is like christall in you that is like godall in you that is spirit and not flesh shall live and live for ever  so it must be for what says st paul  as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god  those who let the spirit of god lead them upward instead of letting their own animal nature drag them downward they are the sons of god  and how can a son of god perish  how can that which is like god and like christ perish how can he perish who like christ is full of the fruits of the spirit of love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance  the world did not give them to him and the world cannot take them from him  they were not bestowed on him at his bodily birthneither shall they be taken from him at his bodily deathfor those blessed fruits of the spirit belong neither to the flesh nor to the world but to christs spirit and to heavento that heaven in which they dwell before the throne of godyea rather in the mind of god himself the eternal forms of the truth the beauty the goodnesswhich were before all worldsand shall be after all worlds have passed away  oh choose my friends especially you who are young and entering into life  remember the parable of the old heathen about the two horses who draw your soul  choose in time whether the better horse shall win or the worse whether your better self or your worse the spirit of god or your own flesh shall be your masterwhether you will rise step by step to heaven or sink step by step to death and hell  and let no one tell you  that is not the question  that is not what we care about  we know we shall do a great many wrong things before we die  every one does that but we hope we shall be able to make our peace with god before we die and so be forgiven at last  my dear friends that kind of religion has done more harm than most kinds of irreligion  it tells you to take your chance of beginning at the endthat is just before you die  common sense tells you that the only way to get to the end is by beginning at the beginning which is now now is the accepted time  now is the day of salvation and you are accepted now already long ago  what do you or any man want with making your peace with god  you are at peace with god already  he has made his peace with you  an infinitely better peace than any priest or preacher can make for you  you are gods child  he looks down on you with boundless love  the great heart of christ your king your redeemer your elder brother yearns over you with boundless longing to draw you up to him that you may be noble as he is noble pure as he is pure loving as he is loving just as he is just try to be that  god will at the last day take you as he finds you  let him find you such as thatwalking not after the flesh but after the spirit and then and then only there will be no condemnation for you for you will be in christ jesus  do notdo not talk about making your peace with god some daylike a naughty child playing truant till the last moment and hoping that the schoolmaster may forget to punish it no i trust you have received the spirit  if you have then look facts in the face  i trust that none of you have received the spirit of bondage which is slavery again unto fear  if you have gods spirit you will see who you are and where you are and act accordinglyyou will see that you are gods children who are meant to be educated by the son of god and led by the spirit of god and raised day by day year by year from the death of sin to the life of righteousness from the likeness of the brute animal to the likeness of christ the son of man     viii  st peter or true courage      now when they saw the boldness of peter and john and perceived that    they were unlearned and ignorant men they marvelled and they took    knowledge of them that they had been with jesus  and they called    them and commanded them not to speak at all nor teach in the name of    jesus  but peter and john answered and said unto them whether it be    right in the sight of god to hearken unto you more than unto god    judge yeacts iv 13 18 19  i think that the quality the grace of god which st peters character and story specially forces on our notice is couragethe true courage which comes by faith  the courage which comes by faith i say  there is a courage which does not come by faith  there is a brute courage which comes from hardness of heart from obstinacy or anger or stupidity which does not see danger or does not feel pain  that is the courage of the brute  one does not blame it or call it wrong  it is good in its place as all natural things are which god has made  it is good enough for the brute but it is not good enough for man  you cannot trust it in man  and the more a man is what a man should be the less he can trust it  the more mind and understanding a man has so as to be able to foresee danger and measure it the more chance there is of his brute courage giving way  the more feeling a man has the more keen he is to feel pain of body or pain of mind such as shame loneliness the dislike of ridicule and the contempt of his fellowmen in a word the more of a man he is the more chance there is of his brute courage breaking down just when he wants it more to keep him up and leaving him to play the coward and come to shame  yes to go through with a difficult or dangerous undertaking a man wants more than brute courage  he wants spiritual courage the courage which comes by faith  he needs to have faith in what he is doing to be certain that he is doing his dutyto be certain that he is in the right  to give one example  look at the class of men who in all england in times of peace undergo the most fearful dangers who know not at what hour of any night they may not be called up to the most serious and hard labour and responsibility with the chance of a horrible and torturing death  i mean the firemen of our great cities than whom there are no steadier braver noblerhearted men  not a week passes without one or more of those firemen in trying to save life and property doing things which are altogether heroic  what do you fancy keeps them up to their work high pay  the amusement and excitement of the fires  the vanity of being praised for their courage  my friends those would be but weak and paltry motives which would not keep a mans heart calm and his head clear under such responsibility and danger as theirs  no it is the sense of duty  the knowledge that they are doing a good and a noble work in saving the lives of human beings and the wealth of the nationthe knowledge that they are in gods hands and that no evil can happen to him who is doing rightthat to him even death at his post is not a loss but a gain  in short faith in god more or less clear is what gives those men their strong and quiet courage  god grant that you and i if ever we have dangerous work to do may get true courage from the same fountain of ghostly strength  yes it is the courage which comes by faith which makes truly brave men men like st peter and st john who can say if i am right god is on my side i will not fear what men can do unto me  i will not fear said david though the earth be moved and the mountains carried into the midst of the sea  the just man who holds firm to his duty will not says a wise old writer be shaken from his solid mind by the rage of the mob bidding him do base things or the frown of the tyrant who persecutes him  though the world were to crumble to pieces round him its ruins would strike him without making him tremble  such courage has made men shut up in prison for long weary years for doing what was right endure manfully for the sake of some great cause and say     stone walls do not a prison make       nor iron bars a cage    minds innocent and quiet take       that for an hermitage    if i have freedom in my thought       and in my soul am free    angels alone that soar above       enjoy such liberty  yes settle it in your hearts all of you  there is but one thing you have to fear in heaven or earthbeing untrue to your better selves and therefore untrue to god  if you will not do the thing you know to be right and say the thing you know to be true then indeed you are weak you are a coward and sin against god  and you will suffer the penalty of your cowardice  you desert god and therefore you cannot expect him to stand by you  but who will harm you if you be followers of that which is right  what does david saylord who shall abide in thy tabernacle who shall dwell in thy holy hill  he that walketh uprightly and worketh righteousness and speaketh the truth in his heart  he that backbiteth not with his tongue nor doeth evil to his neighbour nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour  in whose eyes a vile person is contemned but he honoureth them that fear the lord  he that sweareth to his own hurt and changeth not  he that putteth not out his money to usury nor taketh reward against the innocent  he that doeth these things shall never be movedpsalm xv 15  yes my friends there is a tabernacle of god in which even in this life he will hide us from strife  there is a hill of god in which even in the midst of danger and labour and anxiety we may rest both day and nighteven jesus christ the rock of ageshe who is the righteousness itself the truth itself  and whosoever does righteousness and speaks truth dwells in christ in this life as well as in the life to come  and christ will give him courage to strengthen him by his holy spirit to stand in the evil day the day of danger if it shall comeand having done all to stand  pray you then for the spirit of faith to believe really in god and for the spirit of ghostly strength to obey god honestly  no man ever asked honestly for that spirit but what he gained it at last  and no man ever gained it but what he found the truth of st peters own wordswho will harm you if you be followers of what is good     ix  the story of joseph      i fear god  genesis xlii 18  did it ever seem remarkable to you as it has seemed to me how many chapters of the bible are taken up with the history of josepha young man who on the most memorable occasion in his life said i fear god and had no other argument to use  thirteen chapters of the book of genesis are mainly devoted to the tale of this one young man  doubtless his father jacobs going down into egypt was one of the most important events in the history of the jews we might expect therefore to hear much about it  but what need was there to spend four chapters at least in detailing josephs meeting with his brethren even to minute accounts of the speeches on both sides  those who will may suppose that this is the effect of mere chance  let us have no such fancy  if we believe that a divine providence watched over the composition of those old scriptures if we believe that they were meant to teach not only the jews but all mankind if we believe that they reveal not merely some special god in whom the jews believed but the true and only god maker of heaven and earth if we believe with st paul that every book of the old testament is inspired by god and profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of god may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good worksif we believe this i say it must be worth our while to look carefully and reverently at a story which takes up so large a part of the bible and expect to find in it something which may help to make us perfect and thoroughly furnish us unto all good works  now surely when we look at this history of joseph we ought to see at the first glance that it is not merely a story about a young man but about the common human relationsthe ties which bind any and every man to other human beings round him  for is it not a story about a brother and brothers about a son and a father about a master and a servant about a husband and a wife about a subject and a sovereign and how they all behaved to each othersome well and some illin these relations  surely it is so and surely this is why the story of joseph has been always so popular among innocent children and plain honest folk of all kinds because it is so simply human and humane and therefore it taught them far more than they could learn from many a lofty or seemingly lofty book of devotion when it spoke to them of the very duties they had to fulfil and the very temptations they had to fight against as members of a family or as members of society  one touch of nature says the poet makes the whole world kin and the touches of nature in this story of joseph make us feel that he and his brethren and all with whom he had to do are indeed kin to us that their duty is our duty tootheir temptations oursthat where they fell we may fallwhere they conquered we may conquer  for what is the story  a young lad is thrown into every temptation possible for him  joseph is very handsome  the bible says so expressly so we may believe it  he has every gift of body and mind  he is as his story proves plainly a very clever person with a strange power of making every one whom he deals with love him and obey hima terrible temptation as all gods gifts are if abused by a mans vanity or covetousness or ambition  he is an injured man too  he has been basely betrayed by his brothers he is under a terrible temptation to which ninetynine men out of one hundred would have yieldeddo yield alas to this day to revenge himself if he ever has an opportunity  he is an injured man in egypt for he is a slave to a foreigner who has no legal or moral right over him  if ever there was a man who might be excused for cherishing a burning indignation against his oppressors for brooding over his own wrongs for despairing of gods providence it is joseph in egypt  what could we do but pity him if he had said to himself as thousands in his place have said since there is no god or if there is he does not care for mehe does not care what men do  he looks on unmoved at wrong and cruelty and lets man do even as he will  then why should not i do as i will  what are these laws of god of which men talk  what are these sacred bonds of family and society  every one for himself is the rule of the world and it shall be my rule  every mans hand has been against me why should not my hand be against every man i have been betrayed why should not i betray  i have been opprest why should not i oppress  i have a lucky chance too of enjoying and revenging myself at the same time why should i not take my good luck and listen to the words of the tempter  my dear friends this is the way in which thousands have talked in which thousands talk to this day  this is the spirit which ends in breaking up society as happened in france eighty years ago in the inward corruption of a nation and at last in outward revolution and anarchy from which may god in his mercy deliver us and our fellowcountrymen and the generations yet to come  but any nation or any man will only be delivered from it as joseph was delivered from it by saying i fear god  no doubt it is most natural for a man who is injured and opprest to think in that way  most naturaljust as it is most natural for the trapped dog to struggle vainly and in his blind rage bite at everything around him even at his own masters hand when it offers to set him free  and if men are to be mere children of nature like the animals and not children of grace and sons of god like joseph and like one greater than joseph then i suppose they must needs tear each other to pieces in envy and revenge for there is nought better to be done  but if they wish to escape from the misery and ruin which envy and revenge bring with them then they had better recollect that they are not children of nature but children of godthey had best follow josephs example and say i fear god  for this poor betrayed enslaved lad had got into his heart something above naturesomething which nature cannot give but only the inspiration of the spirit of god gives  he had got into his heart the belief that gods laws were sacred things and must not be broken and that whatever befel him he must fear god  however unjust and lawless the world looked gods laws were still in it and over it and would avenge themselves and he must obey them at all risks  and what were gods laws in josephs opinion  thesethe common relations of humanity between master to servant and servant to master between parent to child and child to parent brother to brother and sister to sister and between the man who is trusted and the man who trusts him  these laws were sacred and if all the rest of the world broke them he joseph must not  he was bound to his master not only by any law of man but by the law of god  his master trusted him and left all that he had in his hand and to joseph the law of honour was the law of god  then he must be justly faithful to his master  a sacred trust was laid on him and to be true to it was to fear god  after a while his masters wife tempts him  he refuses not merely out of honour to his master but from fear of god  how can i do this great wickedness says joseph and sin against god  his master and his mistress are heathen but their marriage is of god nevertheless the vow is sacred and he must deny himself anything endure anything dare any danger of a dreadful death and a prison almost as horrible probably as death itself rather than break it  so again in the prison  if ever man had excuse for despairing of gods providence for believing that rightdoing did not pay it was poor joseph in that prison  but no  god is with him still  he believes still in the justice of god the providence of god and therefore he is cheerful activehe can make the best even of a dungeon  he can find a duty to do even there he can make himself useful helpful till the keeper of the prison too leaves everything in his hand  what a gallant man you say  yes my friends but what makes him gallant  that which st paul says in hebrews xi made all the old jewish heroes gallantfaith in god real and living belief that god isand that he is the rewarder of them that diligently seek him  at last josephs triumph comes  he has his reward  god helps himbecause he will help himself  he is made a great officer of state married to a woman of high rank probably a princess and he sees his brothers who betrayed him at his mercy  their lives are in his hand at last  what will he do  will he be a bad brother because they were bad or will he keep to his old watchword i fear god  if he is tempted to revenge himself he crushes the temptation down  he will bring his brothers to repentance  he will touch their inward witness and make them feel that they have been wicked men  that is for their good  and strangely but most naturally their guilty consciences go back to the great sin of their livesto josephs wrong though they have no notion that joseph is alive much less near them  did i not tell you says reuben sin not against the lad and ye would not hearken  therefore is this distress come upon us  joseph punishes simeon by imprisonment  it may be that he had reasons for it which we are not told  but when his brothers have endured the trial and he finds that benjamin is safe he has nothing left but forgiveness  they are his brethren stillhis own flesh and blood  and he fears god  he dare not do anything but forgive them  he forgives them utterly and welcomes them with an agony of happy tears  he will even put out of their minds the very memory of their baseness  now therefore be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that ye sold me hither he says for god sent me before you to save your lives with a great deliverance  is not that divine  is not that the spirit of god and of christ  i say it is  for what is it but the likeness of christ who says for ever out of heaven to all mankind be not grieved nor angry with yourselves that ye crucified me  for god my father sent me to save your souls by a great salvation  my friends learn from this story of joseph and the prominent place in the bible which it occupieslearn i say how hateful to god are family quarrels how pleasant to god are family unity and peace and mutual trust and duty and helpfulness  and if you think that i speak too strongly on this point recollect that i do no more than st paul does when he sums up the most lofty and mystical of all his epistles the epistle to the ephesians by simple commands to husbands and wives parents and children masters and servants as if he should sayyou wish to be holy you wish to be spiritual  then fulfil these plain family duties for they too are sacred and divine and he who despises them despises the ordinances of god  and if you despise the laws of god they will surely avenge themselves on you  if you are bad husbands or bad wives bad parents or bad children bad brothers or sisters bad masters or servants you will smart for it according to the eternal laws of god which are at work around you all day long making the sinner punish himself whether he likes or not  examine yourselvesask yourselves each of you have i been a good brother have i been a good son have i been a good husband have i been a good father have i been a good servant  if not all professions of religion will avail me nothing  if not let me confess my sins to god and repent and amend at once whatever it may cost me  the fulfilling these plain duties is the true test of my faith the true sign and test whether i really believe in god and in jesus christ our lord  do i believe that the world is christs making and that christ is governing it  do i believe that these plain family relationships are christs sacred appointments  do i believe that our lord jesus was made very man of the substance of his mother to sanctify these family relationships and claim them as the ordinances of god his father  in one wordcopy joseph and when you are tempted say with joseph can i do this great wickedness and sinnot against this man or this woman but againstgod  take home these plain practical words  take them home and fear god at your own firesides  for at the last day the bible tells us the lord jesus christ will not reward you and me according to the opinions we held while in this mortal body whether they were quite right or quite wrong but according to the deeds which we did in the body whether they were good or bad     x  slaves of free      fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the lord which he    will show to you today for the egyptians whom ye have seen to day    ye shall see them again no more for ever  the lord shall fight for    you and ye shall hold your peaceexodus xiv 13 14  why did god bring the jews out of egypt  god himself told them why  to fulfil the promise which he made to abraham their forefather that of his children he would make a great nation  now the jews in egypt were not a nation at all  a nation is free governed by its own laws one body of people held together by one fellow feeling one language one blood one religion as we english are  we are a nation  the jews were none in egypt no more than negro slaves in america were a nation  they served a people of a different blood as the jews did in egypt  they had no laws of their own they had no fellow feeling with each other which enabled them to make common cause together and help each other and free each other  selfishness and cowardice make some men slaves  above all ungodliness makes men slaves  for when men do not fear and obey god they are sure to obey their own lusts and passions and become slaves to them  they become ready to sell themselves soul and body for money or pleasure or food  and their fleshly lusts their animal appetites keep them down selfish divided greedy and needy at the mercy of those who are stronger and cunninger than themselves just as the jews were kept down by the strong and cunning egyptians  they had slavish hearts in them and as long as they had god could not make them into a nation  the jews had slaves hearts in them  they were glad enough to get free out of egypt to escape from their heavy labour in brick and mortar from being oppressed beaten killed at the will and fancy of the egyptians from having their male children thrown into the river as soon as they were born to keep them from becoming too numerous  they were glad enough poor wretches to escape from all their misery and oppression of which we read in the first three chapters of exodus  but if they could do that that was all they cared for  they did not want to be made wise righteous strong freeheartedthey did not care about being made into a nation  we read that when by the red sea shore exodus xiv they saw themselves in great danger the army of pharaoh king of egypt following close upon them to attack them they lost heart at once and were sore afraid and cried unto moses is not this the word which we did tell thee in egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the egyptians  for it had been better for us to serve the egyptians than to die in the wilderness  cowards and slaves  the thing they feared above all you see was death if they could but keep the miserable life in their miserable bodies they cared for nothing beyond  they were willing to see their children taken from them and murdered willing to be beaten worked like dumb beasts for other mens profit willing to be idolaters heathens worshipping the false gods of egypt dumb beasts and stocks and stones willing to be despised wretched helpless slavesif they could but keep the dear life in them  god knows there are plenty like them nowadaysplenty who do not care how mean helpless wicked contemptible they are if they can but get their living by their meanness  but a man must live says some one  how often one hears that made the excuse for all sorts of meanness dishonesty grasping tyranny  a man must live  who told you that  it is better to die like a man than to live like a slave and a wretch and a sinner  who told you that i ask again  not gods bible surely  not the example of great and good men  if moses had thought that do you think he would have gone back from midian when he was in safety and comfort with a wife and home and children at his knee and leave all he had on earth to face pharaoh and the egyptians to face danger perhaps a cruel death in shame and torture and all to deliver his countrymen out of egypt  moses would sooner die like a man helping his countrymen than live on the fat of the land while they were slaves  and forty years before he had shown the same spirit too when though he was rich and prosperous and high in the world the adopted son of king pharaohs daughter exodus ii 11 he disdained to be a slave and to see his countrymen slaves round him  we read how he killed an egyptian who was illtreating one of his brothers the jewsand how he then fled out of egypt into midian houseless and friendless esteeming as st paul says the reproach of christthat is the affliction and illwill which came on him for doing right better than all the treasures of egypt heb xi 2427  a man must live  the valiant tyrolese of old did not say that more than seventy years ago when they fought to the last drop of their blood to defend their country against the french invaders  they were not afraid to die for liberty and therefore they won honour from all honourable men praise from all whose praise is worth having for ever  a man must live  the old greeks and romans heathens though they were were above so mean a speech as that  they used to say it was the noblest thing that can befall a man to dienot to live in clover eating and drinking at his easeto die among the foremost fighting for wife and child and home  a man must live  the martyrs of old did not say that when they endured the prison and the scourge the sword and the fire and chose rather to die in torments unspeakable than deny the lord jesus who bought them with his blood rather than do what they knew to be wrong hebrews xi  they were not afraid of torture and death but of doing wrong they were unspeakably afraid  they were free those holy men of old truly freefree from their own love of ease and cowardice and selfishness and all that drags a man down and makes a slave of him  they knew that life is more than meat and the body more than raiment  what matter if a man gain the whole world and lose his own soul  their souls were free whatever happened to their bodiesthe tormentor could not touch them because they believed in god because they did not fear those who could kill the body and after that had no more that they could do  and do you not see that a coward can never be free never be godly never be like christ  for by a coward i mean not merely a man who is afraid of pain and trouble  every one is that more or less  jesus himself was afraid when he cried in agony father if thou be willing remove this cup from me nevertheless not my will but thine be done luke xxii 42  but a coward is a man who is so much afraid that to escape pain and danger he will do what he ought notdo what he is ashamed of doingdo what lowers him and therefore our lord jesus had perfect courage when he tasted death for all men and endured the very agony from which he shrank and while he said father if it be possible let this cup pass said also nevertheless not my will but thine be done  the jews were cowards when they cried let us alone that we may serve the egyptians  while a man is in that pitiful mood he cannot rise he cannot serve godfor he must remain the slave of his own body of which he is so mightily careful the slave of his own fears the slave of his own love of bodily comfort  such a man does not dare serve god  he dare not obey god when obeying god is dangerous and unpleasant  he dare not claim his heavenly birthright his share in gods spirit his share in christs kingdom because that would bring discomfort on him because he will have to give up the sins he loves because he will have to endure the insults and illwill of wicked men  thus cowards can never be free for it is only where the spirit of god is that there is liberty  but the jews were not yet fit to be made soldiers of  god would not teach them at once not to be afraid of men  he did not command them to turn again and fight these egyptians neither did he lead them into the land of canaan the strait and short road through the country of the philistines lest they should be discouraged when they saw war  now what was gods plan for raising the jews out of this cowardly slavish state  first and above all to make them trust in him  while they were fearing the egyptians they could never fear him  while they were fearing the egyptians they were ready to do every base thing to keep their masters in good humour with them  god determined to teach them to fear him more than they feared the egyptians  god taught them that he was stronger than the egyptians for all their civilisation and learning and armies chariots and horsemen swords and spears  he would not let the jews fight the egyptians  he told them by the mouth of moses stand you still and the lord shall fight for you and he commanded moses to stretch out his rod over the sea exodus xiv  the egyptians were stronger than the jewsthey would have cut them to pieces if they had come to a battle  for free civilised men like the egyptians are always stronger than slaves like the jews they respect themselves more they hold together better they have order and discipline and obedience to their generals which slaves have not  god intended to teach the jews that also in his good time  but not yet  they were not fit yet to be made soldiers  they were not even men yet but miserable slaves  a man is only a true man when he trusts in god and none but godwhen he fears god and nothing but god  and that was the lesson which god had to teach them  that was the lesson which he taught them by bringing them up out of egypt by signs and wonders that god was the lord god was their deliverer god was their kingthat let them be as weak as they might he was strongthat if they could not fight the egyptians god could overwhelm themthat if they could not cross the sea god could open the sea to let them pass through  if they dreaded the waste howling wilderness of sand with its pillars of cloud and fire its stifling winds which burn the life out of man and beast god could make the sand storms and the fire pillars and the deadly east wind of the desert work for their deliverance  and so he taught them to fear himself to trust in him to look up to him as their deliverer whose strength was shown most gloriously when they were weakest and most despairing  this was the great lesson which god meant to teach the children of israel that the root and ground of all other lessons is that this earth belongs to the lord alone  that had been what god had been teaching them already by the plagues of egypt  the egyptians worshipped their great river nile and thought it was a god and the lord turned the nile water into blood and showed that he could do what he liked with it  the egyptians worshipped dumb beasts and insects and fancied in their folly that they were gods  the lord sent plagues of frogs and flies and locusts and took them away again when he liked to show them that the beasts and creeping things were his also  the egyptians worshipped false gods who as they fancied managed the seasons and the weather  god sent them thunder and hail when it pleased him and showed the jews that he not these false gods of egypt ruled the heavens  the egyptians and many other heathen nations of the earth used to offer their children to false gods  i do not mean by killing them in sacrifice but by naming them after some idol and then expecting that the idol would ever afterwards prosper and strengthen them  thus the kings were called after the sun  pharaoh means the sunking for they fancied that the sun was a god and protected their kings one after the other  and god slew all the firstborn of egypt even the firstborn of king pharaoh on his throne  the sungod could not help him  the idols of egypt could not take care of their worshippersonly the children of the jews escaped exodus xii  what a lesson for the jews and they needed it for during the four hundred years that they had been in egypt they had almost forgotten the one true god the god of their forefathers abraham isaac and jacob at least they thought him no better than the false gods of egypt  after all these wondrous proofs of gods almighty power and his jealousy for his own name they fell away to idols again and again  they worshipped a golden calf in horeb exodus xxxii they turned aside to worship the idols of the nations whom they passed through on their way to canaan  idolatry had been rooted in their hearts and it took many years of severe training and teaching on gods part to drive it out of themto make them feel that the one god who made heaven and earth had delivered themthat they belonged to him that they had a share in himto make them join with one heart and voice in the glorious song of moses  i will sing unto the lord for he hath triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea  the lord is my strength and song and he is become my salvation he is my god and i will prepare him an habitation my fathers god and i will exalt him  the lord is a man of war the lord is his name  pharaohs chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea his chosen captains also are drowned in the red sea the depths have covered them they sank into the bottom as a stone  thy right hand o lord is become glorious in power thy right hand o lord hath dashed in pieces the enemy  and in the greatness of thine excellency thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee thou sentest forth thy wrath which consumed them as stubble  and with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were gathered together the floods stood upright as an heap and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea  the enemy said i will pursue i will overtake i will divide the spoil my lust shall be satisfied upon them i will draw my sword my hand shall deliver them  thou didst blow with thy wind the sea covered them they sank as lead in the mighty waters  who is like unto thee o lord among the gods who is like thee glorious in holiness fearful in praises doing wonders  thou stretchedst out thy right hand the earth swallowed them  thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation  the people shall hear and be afraid sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of palestina  then the dukes of edom shall be amazed the mighty men of moab trembling shall take hold upon them all the inhabitants of canaan shall melt away  fear and dread shall fall upon them by the greatness of thine arm they shall be as still as a stone till thy people pass over o lord till the people pass over which thou hast purchased  thou shalt bring them in and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance in the place o lord which thou hast made for thee to dwell in in the sanctuary o lord which thy hands have established the lord shall reign for ever and ever  for the horse of pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea and the lord brought again the waters of the sea upon them but the children of israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea exodus xv 119  this was gods first lesson to the jews the first step towards making them a free nation  for believe me my friends the only thought which can make men feel free and strong the only thought which can keep them from being afraid of each other afraid of the seasons and the elements and the chances and changes of this mortal life the only thought which can teach them that they are brothers bound together to help and love each other in short the only thought which can make men citizensis the thought that the one god is their father and that they are all his childrenthat they have one god one religion one baptism one lord and saviour who has delivered them and will deliver them again and again from all their sins and miseries one god and father of all who is in all and for all and over all to whom they all owe equal duty in whom they all have an equal share  that lesson god began to teach the jews by the red sea  that lesson god has taught our english forefathers again and again and that lesson he will teach us their children as often as we forget it by signs and wonders by chastisements and by mercies till we all learn to trust in him and him only and know that there is none other name under heaven by which we can be saved from evil in this life or in the life to come but the name of jesus christ the son of god the angel of the covenant who led the jews up out of the land of egypt     xi  dangersand the litany      then they cried unto the lord in their trouble and he delivered them    out of their distresses  and he led them forth by the right way that    they might go to a city of habitation  oh that men would praise the    lord for his goodness and for his wonderful works to the children of    menpsalm cvii 68  this 107th psalm is a noble psalma psalm which has given comfort to thousands in suffering and in danger even in the sorrows which they have brought on themselves by their own folly  for it tells them of a lord who hears them when they cry to him in their trouble and who delivers them from their distress  it was written on a special occasion as all the most important words of the bible are writtenwritten seemingly after some band of jews struggling across the desert on their return from the captivity in babylon had been in great danger of death  they went astray in the wilderness out of their way and found no city to rest in hungry and thirsty their soul fainted in them so they cried unto the lord in their trouble and he delivered them from their distress  he led them forth by the right way that they might go to the city where they dwelt  that was the plain fact on which the psalmist built up this noble psalm  in the blazing sandy desert without water food or shade they had lost their path and were at their wits end  and they cried unto the lord their god for guidance for they could not guide themselves  and the lord answered their prayer and guided them  we do not read that god worked a miracle for them or sent an angel to lead them  simply somehow or other they found their way after all and got safe out of the desert and they believed that it was god who enabled them to find their way and praised the lord for his goodness and for his goodness not only to them but to the children of mento all men who had the sense to call on him in trouble and to put themselves in their right place as mengods children calling for help to their father in heaven  therefore the psalmist goes on to speak of the cases of gods goodness which he seems to have seen or at least heard of  of wretched prisoners bound fast in misery and iron and that through their own fault and folly who had cried unto the lord in their trouble and been delivered by him from the darkness of the dungeon  of foolish men who had ruined their health or at least their prospects in life by their own sin and folly till their soul abhorred all manner of meat and they were hard at deaths door  but of them too he says when they cried unto the lord in their trouble he delivered them from their distress  he sent his wordwhat we now foolishly call the laws of nature but which the psalmist knew to be the everworking power and providence of godand healed them and they were saved from their destruction  then he goes on to speak of the dangers of the sea which were especially strange and terrible to hima jew  for the jews were no sailors and if they went to sea would go as merchants or supercargoes in ships manned by heathens and the danger was really great  the ships were clumsy navigation was illunderstood the storms of the mediterranean sea were then as now sudden and furious and when one came on the heathen sailors would i doubt not be at their wits end their courage melting away because of the trouble and call on all their gods and idols to help them but the men of whom the psalmist speaks though they were no seamen knew on whom to call  it was by the word of the lord that the stormy wind arose which lifted up the billows  he could quell the storm if he would and when he would and to him they cried and not in vain and he made the storm to cease so that the waves thereof were still then were they glad because they were at rest and so he brought them to the haven where they would be  my friends this was the simple faith of the old jews  and this was the simple faith of our forefathers by land and sea  and this faith as i believe made england great  the faith that there was a living god a living lord who would hear the cry of poor creatures in their trouble even when they had brought their trouble on themselves  our forefathers were not mere landsmen like the jews but the finest seamen the world has ever seen  and yet they were not ashamed in storm and danger to cry like the jews unto the lord that he might make the storm to cease and bring them to the haven where they would be  yes faith in god did not make them the less brave skilful cautious scientific and it need not make us so  skill and science need not take away our faith in god  i trust it will not take it away and i believe it will not take it away as long as we can hear what i once heard on board of one of the finest men of war 80a in the british navythe ship in which and from which all british sailors may learn their dutywhen i saw some six or eight hundred men mustered on the deck for daily morning prayer and heard the noble old prayer which our forefathers have handed down to us to be said every day in her majestys navy 80b  o eternal god who alone spreadest out the heavens and rulest the raging of the sea who hast compassed the waters with bounds until day and night come to an end be pleased to receive into thy almighty and most gracious protection the persons of us thy servants and the fleet in which we serve  preserve us from the dangers of the sea and from the violence of the enemy that we may be a safeguard unto our most gracious sovereign lady queen victoria and her dominions and a security for such as pass on the seas upon their lawful occasions that the inhabitants of our island may in peace and quietness serve thee our god and that we may return in safety to enjoy the blessings of the land with the fruits of our labours and with a thankful remembrance of thy mercies to praise and glorify thy holy name through jesus christ our lord  amen  then as i stood upon that deck and heard that solemn appeal to god before each man went about his appointed duty for the day said i to myself the ancient spirit is not dead  it may be that it is sleeping in these prosperous times  but it is not dead as long as this nation by those prayers confesses that we ought at least to believe in a god who hears our prayers by land and sea  those grand words were perhaps nothing but a form to most of the men who heard them  but they were a form which bore witness to a truth which was true even if they forgot ita truth which they might need some day and feel the need of and cling to as the sailors of old time clung to it  those words would surely sink into the mens ears and some day it might be bear fruit in their hearts  in storm in wreck in battle and in the hour of death and in the day of judgment these words would surely rise in many a brave fellows memory and help him to do his duty like a man because there was a living lord and god above him who knew his weakness and would hear his prayers  and we my friends here safe on land we have a national prayer or rather a series of prayers to christ as god which ought to remind us of that noble truth which the 107th psalm is meant to teach  you hear it all of you every sunday morning  i mean the litany  that noble composition which seems to me more wise as a work of theology more beautiful as a work of art the oftener i use itthat litany i say is modelled on the 107th psalm and it expresses the very heart and spirit of our forefathers three hundred years ago  it bids us pray to be delivered from every conceivable harm to father son and holy spirit and then it prays for every conceivable blessing not only for each of us separately but for this whole nation of england great britain and ireland and for all the nations on earth and for the heathen and the savage  of course just because it is a national prayer and meant for all englishmen alike all of it does not suit each and every one of us at the same time  each heart knows its own bitterness  each soul has its own special mercy to ask  but there is a word in the litany here and another there which will fit each of us in turn if we will but follow it  one may have to pray to be delivered from pride vainglory and hypocrisyanother to be delivered from foul living and deadly sinanother to be delivered or to have those whom he loves delivered from battle murder and sudden death  another to be delivered from the dangers of affliction and tribulation another from the far worse danger of wrath but all have to pray to be delivered from something  and all have to pray to the same delivererchrist who was born a man died a man and rose again a man that he might know what was in man and be able to succour those who are tempted seeing that he was tempted in all things like as we are yet without sin  but there is a partthe latter partof that litany which i think many do not understand or feel  perhaps they have reason to thank god that they do not understand or feel it yet the day may comea day of sadness fear perplexity sorrow when they will understand it and thank god that their forefathers placed it in the prayerbook for them to fall back upon as comfort and hope in the day of trouble putting words into their mouths and thoughts into their hearts which they perhaps never would have found out for themselves  i mean that latter part of the litany which talks of the evils which the craft and subtilty of the devil or men work against us that they may be brought to nought and by the providence of gods goodness be dispersed that we may be hurt by no persecutionswhich calls on christ to arise and deliver us for his names sake and his honour which pleads before god the noble works which he did in the days of our forefathers and which continues with short prayers almost cries which have something in them of terror almost of agony  what have such words to do with us  why are they put into the mouths of us english safe comfortable prosperous above almost all the nations upon earth  ah my friends those prayers when they were first put into our prayer book were spoken for the hearts of englishmen  they were not prayers for one afflicted person here and another therethey too were national prayers  they were the cries of the english nation in agonyin the time when three hundred years ago the mightiest nations and powers of europe temporal and spiritual were set against this little isle of england and we expected not merely to be invaded and conquered but destroyed utterly and horribly with sword and fire by the fleets and armies of the king of spain  in that great danger and war our forefathers cried to god and they cried all the more earnestly because they felt that their hands were not clean that they had plenty and too many sins to be mercifully forgiven and that at best they could but ask god mercifully to look upon their infirmities and for the glory of his name turn from them those evils which they most righteously had deserved  but nevertheless they cried unto god in their great agony because they had the spirit of the old psalmist who said they cried unto the lord in their trouble and he delivered them out of their distress  and what answer god made to their prayers all the world knows or should know  for if he had not answered their prayer we should not be here this day a great and strong and prosperous nation with a pure church and a free gospel and the holy bible if he wills in the hands of the poorest child  unless prayer be a dream and there be no god in heaven worth calling a godthen did god answer the prayers of our forefathers three hundred years ago when they cried unto him as one nation in their utter need  but some will saythis may be all very true and very fine but we are in no such utter need now  why should we use those prayers  my dear friends let me say if you are not now in utter need in terror anxiety danger if you have no need to cry to christ graciously look upon our afflictions pitifully behold the sorrows of our hearts how do you know that there is not some one in any and every congregation who is and you and i if we have said the litany in spirit and in truth have been praying for them  the litany bids us speak as members of a church as citizens of a nation bound together by the ties of blood and of laws as well as selfinterest  the litany bids us say not selfishly and apart graciously look on my afflictions but on our afflictionsthe afflictions of every english man and woman and child who is in trouble or ever will be in trouble hereafter  oh remember this last word  generations long since dead and buried have prayed for you and god has heard their prayers and now you have been praying for your children and your childrens children and generations yet unborn that if ever a dark day should come over england a time of want and danger and perplexity and misery god would deliver them in their turn out of their distress  and more you have been teaching your children that they may teach their children in turn and pray and cry to god in their trouble and thus this grand old litany is to us and to those we shall leave behind us a precious national heirloom teaching us and them the lesson of the 107th psalmthat there is a lord in heaven who hears the prayers of men the sinful as well as the sorrowful that when they cry unto the lord in their trouble he delivers them out of their distress and that men should therefore praise the lord for his goodness and declare the wonders which he doeth for the children of men     xii  wild times or davids faith in a living god      david therefore departed thence and escaped to the cave adullam and    when his brethren and all his fathers house heard it they went down    thither to him  and every one that was in distress and every one    that was in debt and every one that was discontented gathered    themselves unto him and he became a captain over them and there were    with him about four hundred men1 sam xxii 1 2  in every country at some time or other there have been evil daysdays of violence tyranny misrule war invasion when men are too apt for want of settled law to take the law into their own hands and the land is full of robbers outlaws bands of partizans and irregular soldierswild times in which wild things are done  of such times we here in england have had no experience and we forget how common they are we forget that many great nations have been in this state again and again  we forget that almost all europe was in that wild and lawless state in our fathers times and therefore we forget that the bible which tells man his whole duty must needs tell men about such times as those and how a man may do his duty and save his soul therein for the bible is every mans book and has its lesson for every man  it is meant not merely for comfortable english folk who sit at home at ease under just laws and a good government  it is meant just as much for the opprest for the persecuted for the man who is fighting for his country for the man who has been found fighting in vain and is simply waiting for gods help and crying lord how long how long ere thou avenge the blood that is shed  it is meant as much for such as for you and me that every man in whatever fearful times he may live and whatever fearful trials he may go through and whatever fearful things he may be tempted to do and indeed may have to do in selfdefence may still be able to go to the bible there to find light for his feet and a lantern for his path and so that he may steer through the worst of times by faith in the living god  again such lawless times are certain to raise up bold and adventurous men more or less like david  men of bloodwho are yet not altogether bad menwho are forced to take the law into their own hands to try and keep their countrymen together to put down tyrants and robbers and to drive out invaders  and men too suffering from deep and cruel wrongs who are forced for their lives sake and their honours sake to escapeto flee to the mountains and the forests and to foreign lands and there live as they can till times shall be better  there have been such men in all wild timesoutlaws chiefs of armed bands like our robin hood whose name was honoured in england for hundreds of years as the protector of the poor and the opprest and the punisher of the norman tyrants a man made up of much good and much evil whom we must not judge but when we think of him only thank god that we do not live in such times now when no mans life or property or the honour of his family was safe  such men too in our fathers days were the tyrolese heroes hofer and the good monk who left the one his farm and the other his cloister to lead their countrymen against the invading french men of blood who were none the less men of god  and such is in our own days that famous garibaldi whose portrait hangs in many an english cottage for a proof that though we thank god do not need such men in peaceful england our hearts bid us to love and honour them wherever they be  there have been such men in all bad times and there will be till the worlds end and they will do great deeds and their names will be famous and often honoured and adored by men  now what does the bible say of such men  does it give any rule by which we may judge them any rule which they ought to obey  can gods blessing be on them  can they obey god in that wild and dark and dangerous station to which he seems to have called themto which god certainly called hofer and the good monk  i think if the bible did not answer that question it would not be a complete bookif it spoke only of peaceful folk and peaceful times when alas from the beginning of the world the earth has been but too full of violence and misrule war and desolation  but the bible does answer that question  a large portion of one whole book is actually taken up with the history of a young outlawof david the shepherd boy who rises through strange temptations and dangers to be a great king the first man who since moses formed the jews into one strong united nation  it does not hide his faults even his fearful sins but it shows us that he had a right road to follow though he often turned aside from it  it shows us that he could be a good man if he chose though he was an outlaw at the head of a band of ruffians and it shows us the secret of his power and of his successfaith in the living god  therefore it is that after the bible has shown us in the book of ruth worthy boaz standing among his reapers in the barley field it goes on to show us boazs greatgrandson david a worthy man likewise but of a very different life marked out by god from his youth for strange and desperate deeds killing as a mere boy a lion and a bear overthrowing the philistine giant with a sling and a stone captain of a band of outlaws in the wilderness fighting battles upon battles and at last a king storming the mountain fortress of jerusalem and setting up upon mount zion which shall never be removed the throne of david  a strange man and born into a strange time  you all know the first part of davids historyhow samuel secretly anoints david king over israel and how the spirit of the lord comes from that day forward upon the young lad 1 samuel xvi 12  how king saul meanwhile fell into dark and bad humours  how the spirit of the lordof goodness and peace of mindgoes from him and an evil spirit from the lord troubles him  then how young david is sent for to play to him on his harp 1 samuel xvi and soothe his distempered mind  already we hear of david as a remarkable person we hear of his extraordinary beauty his skill in music we hear too how he is already a man of war and a mighty valiant man and prudent in matters and the lord is with him  then follows the famous story of his killing goliath the philistine 1 samuel xvii  poor distempered saul it seems had forgotten him though david had cured his melancholy with his harpplaying and had actually been for a while his armourbearer for when he comes back with the giants head saul has to ask abner who he is but after that he will let him go no more home to his father  then follows the beautiful story of jonathan sauls gallant son 1 samuel xviii and his love for david  then of sauls envy of david and how in a sudden fit of hatred he casts his javelin at him  then how he grows afraid of him and makes him captain of a thousand men and gives him his daughter on condition of davids killing him two hundred philistines  and how he goes on capriciously honouring david one day and trying to kill him the next  while david rises always and all israel and judah love him and he behaves himself more wisely than all the servants of saul  at last comes the open rupture  saul after trying to murder david sends assassins to his house and david flees for his life once and for all  he has served his master saul loyally and faithfully  there is no word of his having opposed saul set himself up against him boasted of himself or in any way brought his anger down upon him  saul is his king and david has been loyal and true to him but sauls envy has grown to hatred and that to murder  he murders the priests with all their wives and children for having given bread and shelter to david  and now david must flee into the wilderness and set up for himself and he flees to the cave of adullam 1 samuel xxii and there you see the bible does not try to hide what davids position was and what sort of men he had about himhis brethren and his fathers house who were afraid that saul would kill them instead of him after the barbarous eastern fashion and among them the three sons of zeruiah his sister and everyone who was discontented and everyone who was in debt all the most desperate and needyone can conceive what sort of men they must have been  the bible tells us afterwards of the wicked men and men of belial who were among themwild men with weapons in their hands and nothing to prevent their becoming a band of brutal robbers if they had not had over them a man in whom in spite of all his faults was the spirit of god  we must remember meanwhile that david had his temptations  he had been grievously wronged  saul had returned him evil for good  all davids services and loyalty to saul had been repaid with ingratitude and accusations of conspiracy against him  what terrible struggles of rage and indignation must have passed through davids heart  what a longing to revenge himself  he knew too for samuel the prophet had told him that he should be king one day  what a temptation then to make himself king at once  it was no secret either  the people knew of it  jonathan sauls son knew of it and in his noble selfsacrificing way makes no secret of it 1 samuel xx  what a temptation to follow the fashion which is too common in the east to this day and strike down his tyrant at one blow as many a man has done since and to proclaim himself king of the jews  yes david had heavy temptationstemptations which he could only conquer by faith in the living god  and because he masters himself and remains patient and loyal to his king under every insult and wrong he is able to master that wild and desperate band of men and set them an example of patience and chivalry loyalty and justice to train them to be not a terror and a scourge to the yeomen and peasants round but a protection and a guard against the philistines and amalekites and in due time his trusty bodyguard of warriorsmen who have grown grey beside him through a hundred battles who are to be the foundation of his national army and help him to make the jews one strong and united prosperous kingdom  all this the shepherd lad has to do and he does it by faith in the living god and so makes himself for all ages to come the pattern of perfect loyalty  and now let us take home this one lessonthat the secret of davids success is not his beauty his courage his eloquence his genius other men have had gifts from god as great as davids and have misused them to their own ruin and to the misery of their fellow men  no the secret of davids success is his faith in the living god and that will be the secret of our success  without faith in god the most splendid talents may lead a man to be a curse to himself and to his neighbours  with faith in god a very commonplace person without any special cleverness may do great things and make himself useful and honoured in his generation     xiii  david and nabal or selfcontrol      and david said to abigail blessed be the lord god of israel which    sent thee this day to meet me and blessed be thy advice and blessed    be thou which hast kept me this day from coming to shed blood and    from avenging myself with mine own hand1 samuel xxv 32 33  the story of david and nabal needs no explanation  it tells us of part of davids educationof a great lesson which he learntof a great lesson which we may learn  it is told with a dignity and a simplicity with a grace and liveliness which makes itself understood at once and carries its own lesson to any one who has a human heart in him  and there was a man in maon whose possessions were in carmelthe park grass upland with timber treesnot the northern carmel where elijah slew the prophets of baal but the southern one on the edge of the desert and the man was very great and he had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats and he was shearing his sheep in carmel  now the name of the man was nabal and the name of his wife abigail and she was a woman of good understanding and of a beautiful countenance but the man was churlish and evil in his doings and he was of the house of caleb  caleb was joshuas friend who had conquered all that land in joshuas time nabal therefore had all the pride of a man of most ancient and noble familyand no shame to him if he had had a noble courteous and generous heart therewith instead of being as he was a stupid and brutal person  and david heard in the wilderness that nabal did shear his sheep  and david sent out ten young men and david said unto the young men get you up to carmel and go to nabal and greet him in my name and thus shall ye say unto him that liveth in prosperity peace be to thee and peace be to thine house and peace be to all that thou hast  and now i have heard that thou hast shearers now thy shepherds which were with us we hurt them not neither was there ought missing unto them all the while they were in carmel  ask the young men and they will show thee  wherefore let the young men find favour in thine eyes for we come in a good day give i pray thee whatsoever cometh to thine hand unto thy servants and unto thy son david  and when davids young men came they spake to nabal according to all thee words of david and ceased  nabal refuses and in a way that shows as his wife says of him how well his name fits hima fool is his name and folly is with him  insolently and brutally he refuses as fools are wont to do  and nabal answered davids servants and said who is david and who is the son of jesse there be many servants nowadays that break away every man from his master  shall i then take my bread and my water and my flesh that i have killed for my shearers and give it unto men whom i know not whence they be  as slaves break away from their master  this was an intolerable insult  to taunt a freeborn man as david was with having been a slave and a runaway  it is hard to conceive how nabal dared to say such a thing of a fierce chieftain like david with six hundred armed men at his back but there is no saying what a fool will not do when the spirit of the lord is gone from him and his own fancy and passions lead him captive  so davids young men came and told david  and david said to his men gird every man on his sword  and they girded on every man his sword and david also girded on his sword and there went up after david about four hundred men and two hundred abode by the stuff  that is a grand passagegrand because it is true to human nature true to the determined prompt kingly character of david  he does not complain bluster curse over the insult as a weak man might have done he has been deeply hurt and he is too highminded to talk about it  he will do and not talk  a dark purpose settles itself instantly in his mind  perhaps he is ashamed of it and dare not speak of it even to himself  but what it was he confessed afterwards to abigail that he purposed utterly to kill nabal and all his people  david was wrong of course  but the bible makes no secret of the wrongdoings of its heroes it does not tell us that they were infallible and perfect  it tells us that they were men of like passions with ourselves in order that by seeing how they conquered their passions we may conquer ours  meanwhile nabals young men his servants and slaves see the danger and go to abigail  one of the young men told abigail saying behold david sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master and he railed on them  but the men were very good unto us and we were not hurt neither missed we any thing as long as we were conversant with them when we were in the fields they were a wall unto us both by night and day all the while we were with them keeping the sheep  now therefore know and consider what thou wilt do for evil is determined against our master and against all his household for he is such a son of belial that a man cannot speak to him  then abigail made haste and took two hundred loaves and two bottles of wine and five sheep ready dressed and five measures of parched corn and an hundred clusters of raisins and two hundred cakes of figs and laid them on asses  and she said unto her servants go on before me behold i come after you  but she told not her husband nabal  and then follows the beautiful scene which has been the subject of many a noble picture  the fair lady kneeling before the terrible outlaw in the mountain woods as she came down by the covert of the hill and softening his fierce heart with her beauty and her eloquence and her prayers and bringing him back to his true selfto forgiveness generosity and righteousness  and when abigail saw david she hasted and lighted off the ass and fell before david on her face and bowed herself to the ground and fell at his feet and said upon me my lord let this iniquity be and let thine handmaid i pray thee speak in thine audience and hear the words of thine handmaid  let not my lord i pray thee regard this man of belial even nabal for as his name is so is he nabal is his name and folly is with him but i thine handmaid saw not the young men of my lord whom thou didst send  now therefore my lord as the lord liveth and as thy soul liveth seeing the lord hath withholden thee from coming to shed blood and from avenging thyself with thine own hand now let thine enemies and they that seek evil to my lord be as nabal    i pray thee forgive the trespass of thine handmaid for the lord will certainly make my lord a sure house because my lord fighteth the battles of the lord and evil hath not been found in thee all thy days  and she conquers  the dark shadow passes off davids soul and he is again the true chivalrous godfearing david who has never drawn sword yet in his own private quarrel but has committed his cause to god who judgeth righteously and will if a man abide patiently in him make his righteousness as clear as the light and his justdealing as the noonday frankly he confesses his fault  blessed be thy advice and blessed be thou which has kept me this day from coming to shed blood and from avenging myself with mine own hand  for in very deed as the lord god of israel liveth which has kept me back from hurting thee except thou hadst hasted and come to meet me surely there had not a man been left unto nabal by the morning light  then follows the end  abigail goes back to nabal  then the bully shows himself a coward  the very thought of the danger which he has escaped is too much for him  his heart died within him  and abigail came to nabal and behold he held a feast in his house like the feast of a king and nabals heart was merry within him for he was very drunken wherefore she told him nothing less or more until the morning light  but it came to pass in the morning when the wine was gone out of nabal and his wife had told him these things that his heart died within him and he became as a stone  and it came to pass about ten days after that the lord smote nabal that he died  one can imagine the picture for oneself  the rich churl sitting there in the midst of all his slaves and his wealth as one thunderstruck helpless and speechless till one of those mysterious attacks which we still rightly call a stroke and a visitation of god ends him miserably  and when he is dead abigail becomes the wife of david and shares his fortunes and his dangers in the wilderness  now what may we learn from this story  surely what david learntthe unlawfulness of revenge  david was to be trained to be a perfect king by learning selfcontrol and therefore he has to learn that he must not punish in his own quarrel  if he must not lift up his hand against saul on the ground of loyalty neither must he lift up his hand against nabal on the deeper ground of justice and humanity  but from whom did david learn this  from himself  from his own heart and conscience enlightened by the spirit of god  abigail gave him no commandment from god in the common sense of the word  she only put david in mind of what he knew already  she appeals to his known nobleness of mind and takes for granted that he will hear reasontakes for granted that he will do rightand so brought him to himself again the lord was withholding him she says from coming to shed blood and avenging himself with his own hand  but that would have been of no avail had there not been something in davids own heart which answered to her words  for the spirit of god had not left david and it was the spirit of god which gave him nobleness of heartthe spirit of god which made him answer blessed be the lord god of israel who sent thee this day to meet me and blessed be thy advice and blessed be thou which hast kept me this day from shedding of blood  though abigail did not pretend to bring a message from god david felt that she had brought one  and she was in his eyes not merely a suppliant pleading for mercy but a prophetess declaring to him a divine law which he dare not resist  it has been said by them of old time our blessed lord tells us an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate thine enemy  this is the first natural law which a savage lays down for himself  there is a rude sense of justice in it mixed up with the same brute instinct of revenge which makes the wild beast turn in rage upon the hunter who wounds him  but our lord jesus christ brings in a higher and more spiritual law  punishment is to be left to the magistrate who punishes in gods name  and where the law cannot touch the wrongdoer god who is the author of law can and will punish  vengeance is mine i will repay saith the lord  yes if punishment must be then let god punish  let man forgive  i say unto you said our lord love your enemies  do good to them that hate youbless them that curse youpray for them that despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for he maketh his sun to shine upon the evil and the good and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust  it is a hard lesson  but we must learn it  and we shall learn it just as far as we are guided by the spirit of god who forms in us the likeness of christ  and men are learning it more and more in christian lands  wherever christs gospel is truly and faithfully preached the fashion of revenge is dying out  there are countries still in christendom in which men think nothing every day of stabbing and shooting the man who has injured them and far very far from christ and his spirit must they be still  but we may have hope for them for if we look at home it was not so very many years ago that any englishman who considered himself a gentleman was bound by public opinion to fight a duel for any slight insult  it was not so many years ago that among labouring men brutal quarrels and open fights were common and almost daily occurrences  but now men are learning more and more to control their tempers and their tongues and find it more and more easy and more pleasant and more profitable as our lord forewarned them when he said take my yoke upon you and learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest unto your souls for my yoke is easy and my burden is light  and christs easy yoke is the yoke of selfcontrol by which we bridle the passions which torment us  christs light burden is the burden and obligation laid on every one of us to forgive others even as god for christs sake has forgiven us  and the rest which shall come to our souls is the rest which david found when he listened to the voice of god speaking by the lips of abigail the true and divine rest of heart and peace of mindrest and peace from the inward storm of fretfulness suspicion jealousy pride wrath revenge which blackens the light of heaven to a man and turns to gall and wormwood every blessing which god sends  ah my friends if ever that angry storm rises in our hearts if ever we be tempted to avenge ourselves and cast off the likeness of god for that of the savage and return evil for evilmay god send to us in that day some angel of his own as he sent abigail to davidan angel though clothed in human flesh and blood with a message of peace and wisdom  and if any such should speak to us words of peace and wisdom soothing us and rebuking us at once and appealing to those feelings in us which are really the most noble just because they are the most gentle then let us not turn away in pride and wrap ourselves up in our own anger but let us receive these words as the message of godwhether they come from the lips of a woman or of a servant or even of a little child for if we resist them we surely resist godwho has also given to us his holy spirit for that very purpose that we may hear his message when he speaks  it was the spirit of god in david which made him feel that abigails message was divine  the spirit of god hidden for a while behind his dark passions like the sun by clouds shone out clear again and filled all his soul with light showing him his duty and giving back peace and brightness to his mind  god grant that whenever we are tried like david we may find that that holy spirit has not left us but that even if a first storm of anger shall burst it shall pass over quickly and the day star arise in our hearts and the lord lift up the light of his countenance upon us and give us peace     xiv  davids loyalty or temptation resisted      so david and abishai came to the people by night and behold saul    lay sleeping within the trench and his spear stuck in the ground at    his bolster but abner and the people lay round about him  then said    abishai to david god hath delivered thine enemy into thine hand this    day now therefore let me smite him i pray thee with the spear even    to the earth at once and i will not smite him the second time  and    david said to abishai destroy him not for who can stretch forth his    hand against the lords anointed and be guiltless  david said    furthermore as the lord liveth the lord shall smite him or his day    shall come to die or he shall descend into battle and perish  the    lord forbid that i should stretch forth mine hand against the lords    anointed but i pray thee take thou now the spear that is at his    bolster and the cruise of water and let us go1 sam xxvi 711  david stands for all times as the pattern of true loyaltyloyalty under the most extreme temptation  knowing that he is to be king himself hereafter he yet remains loyal to his king though unjustly persecuted to the death  loyal he is to the end because he has faith and obedience  faith tells him that if king he is to be king he will be in gods good time  if god had promised god will perform  he must not make himself king  he must not take the matter into his own hand obedience tells him that saul is still his master and he is bound to him  if saul be a bad master that does not give him leave to be a bad servant  the sacred bond still remains and he must not break it  but saul is more  he is kingthe lords anointed the general of the armies of the living god  his office is sacred his person is sacred  he is a public personage and david must not lift up his hand against him in a private quarrel  twice davids faith and obedience are tried fearfully  twice saul is in his power  twice the temptation to murder him comes before him  the first time david and his men are in one of the great branching caves of engaddi the desolate limestone cliffs two thousand feet high which overhang the dead seaand saul is hunting him as he says as a partridge on the mountains  and it came to pass when saul had returned from following the philistines that it was told him saying behold david is in the cave of engedi  and saul took three thousand chosen men out of all israel and went to seek david and his men upon the rocks of the wild goats  and he came to the sheepcotes and by the way there was a cave and saul went in and david and his men remained in the sides of the cave  and the men of david said unto him behold the day of which the lord said unto thee behold i will deliver thine enemy into thy hand and thou mayest do to him as seemeth good unto thee  then david arose and cut off the skirt of sauls robe privily  and it came to pass afterwards that davids heart smote him because he had cut off sauls skirt  and he said unto his men the lord forbid that i should do this thing unto my master the lords anointed to stretch forth mine hand against him seeing he is the anointed of the lord  so david stayed his servants  and afterwards saul rose up not knowing what had happened and david followed him  and when saul looked back david stooped down with his face to the earth and bowed himself before saul and spoke many noble words to his king 1 sam xxiv 18  and davids nobleness has its reward  it brings out nobleness in return to saul himself  it melts his heart for a time  and it came to pass that when david had made an end of speaking that saul said is this thy voice my son david  and saul lifted up his voice and wept  and he said to david thou art more righteous than ifor thou hast rewarded me good whereas i have rewarded thee evil  and thou hast shewed me this day how thou hast dealt with me for as much as when the lord delivered me into thine hand thou killedst me not  for if a man find his enemy will he let him go well away  wherefore the lord reward thee good for that thou hast done unto me this day  and now behold i know well that thou shalt surely be king and that the kingdom of israel shall be established in thine hand  and so it will be with you my friends  if thine enemy hunger feed him if he thirst give him drink for so thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head  thou shalt melt the hardness of his heart  thou shalt warm the coldness of his heart  nobleness in thee shall bring out in answer nobleness in him and if not thou hast done thy duty and the lord judge between him and thee  but sauls repentance does not last  soon after we find him again hunting david in the wilderness seemingly from mere caprice and without any fresh cause of offence  the ziphitesdwellers in the forests of the south of judeacame to saul and said doth not david hide himself in the hill of hachilah  then saul arose and went down to the wilderness having three thousand chosen men of israel with him to seek david in the wilderness of ziph  and saul pitched in the hill of hachilah  but david abode in the wilderness and he saw that saul came after him into the wilderness  again saul lies down to sleepin an entrenched camp and david and abishai his nephew go down to the camp at night as spies then comes the story of my texthow abishai would have slain saul and david forbade him to lift his hand against the lords anointed and left saul to the judgment of god which he knew must come sooner or laterand merely took the spear from his bolster and the cruse of water to show he had been there  once again sauls heart gives way at davids nobleness for when david and abishai got away while saul and his guards all slept david calls to abner verse 1425 and rebukes him for not having guarded his king better  art not thou a valiant man  wherefore then hast thou not kept thy lord the king  the thing is not good that thou hast done as the lord liveth ye are worthy to die because you have not kept your master the lords anointed  and now see where the kings spear is and the cruse of water that was at his bolster  and saul knew davids voice and said is this thy voice my son david  and david said it is my voice my lord o king  wherefore does my lord then thus pursue after his servant for what have i done  now therefore let not my blood fall to the earth for the king of israel is come out to seek a flea as when one doth hunt a partridge  then said saul i have sinned return my son david for i will no more do thee harm because my soul was precious in thine eyes  behold i have played the fool and have erred exceedingly  but david can trust him no longer  weak violent and capricious sauls repentance is real for the time but it does not last  he means what he says at the moment but when some fresh base suspicion crosses his mind his promises and his repentance are all forgotten  a terrible trial it is to david to have his noble forgiveness and forbearance again and again bring forth no fruitto have to do with a man whom he cannot trust  there are few sorer trials than that for living man  few which tempt him more to throw away faith and patience and say i cannot submit to this misconduct over and over again  it must end and i will end it by some desperate action right or wrong  and in fact it does seem as if david was very near yielding to temptation the last and worst temptation which befalls men in his situationto turn traitor and renegade to go over to the enemies of his country and fight with them against saul  that has happened too often to men in davids place who have so ended a glorious career in shame and confusion  and we find that david does at last very nearly fall into it it creeps on him little by little as it has on other men in his place but it does creep on  he loses patience and hope  he says i shall perish one day by the hand of saul and he goes down into the low country to the philistines whose champion goliath he had killed and makes friends with them  and achish king of gath gives him a town called ziklag to live in he and his men  from it he goes out and attacks the wild arabs the amalekites  and then he tells lies to achish saying that he has been attacking his own countrymen the jews and by that lie he brings himself into a very great straitas all men who tell lies are sure to do  when achish and his philistines go next to fight against the jews achish asks david and his men to go with him and his army  and then begins a very dark story  what david meant to do we are not told but one thing is clear that whatever he did he must have disgraced himself for ever if god had not had mercy on him  he is forced to go  for he can give no reason why he should not  so he goes and in the rear with the philistine king in the post of honour as his bodyguard  what is he to do  if he fights against his own people he covers himself with eternal shame and loses his chance of ever being king  if he turns against achish and his philistines in the battle he covers himself with eternal shame likewise for they had helped him in his distress and given him a home  but god has mercy on him  the lords of the philistines take offence at his being there and say that he will play traitor to them in the battle which was but too likely and force king achish to send him home to ziklag and so god delivers him out of the trap which he has set for himself by lying  but god punishes him on the spot  when he comes back to his town it is burnt with fire utterly desolate a heap of blackened ruins without a living soul therein  and now the end is coming though david thinks not of it  he had committed his cause to god  he had said when saul lay sleeping at his feet and abishai would have smitten him through who can stretch forth his hand against the lords anointed  as the lord liveth the lord shall smite him or he shall come to die or he shall go down into battle and perish  and on the third day a mana heathen amalekitecomes to ziklag to david with his clothes rent and earth upon his head  israel has been defeated in mount gilboa with a great slaughter  the people far and wide have fled from hermon across the plain and the philistines have taken possession cutting the land of israel in two  and saul and jonathan his son are dead  the amalekite has proof of it  there is the crown which was on sauls head and the bracelet that was on his arm  he has brought them to david to curry favour with him  saul he says was wounded and asked him to kill him 2 sam i 610  it is a lie  saul had killed himself falling on his own sword to escape torture and insult from the philistines and the amalekite is caught in his own trap out of his own mouth will david judge him  how dare he stretch forth his hand against the lords anointed  let one of the young men fall on him and kill him  and so the wretch dies  and then bursts forth all the nobleness of davids heart  he thinks of saul no longer as the tyrant who has hunted him for years who has put on him the last and worst insult of taking away his wife and giving her to another man  he thinks of him only as his master his king the grand and terrible warrior the terror of ammonites amalekites and philistines the deliverer of his country in many a bloody fight and he bursts out into that fine old lamentation over saul and jonathan sentences of which have been proverbs in the mouths of men to this day how are the mighty fallen  tell it not in gath publish it not in the streets of askelon lest the daughters of the philistines rejoice lest the daughters of the uncircumcised triumph  ye mountains of gilboa let there be no dew neither let there be rain upon you nor fields of offerings for there the shield of the mighty is vilely cast away the shield of saul as though he had not been anointed with oil  from the blood of the slain from the fat of the mighty the bow of jonathan turned not back and the sword of saul returned not empty  saul and jonathan were lovely and pleasant in their lives and in their death they were not divided they were swifter than eagles they were stronger than lions  ye daughters of israel weep over saul who clothed you in scarlet with other delights who put on ornaments of gold upon your apparel  how are the mighty fallen in the midst of the battle  o jonathan thou wast slain in thine high places  i am distressed for thee my brother jonathan very pleasant hast thou been unto me thy love to me was wonderful passing the love of woman  how are the mighty fallen and the weapons of war perished 2 sam i 1927  let each and every one of us my friends imitate davids loyalty and be true to our duty true to our masters true to our country and true to our queen through whatever trials and temptations  above all let us learn from david to obey and remember that to obey we need not become cringing and slavish or give up independence and high spirit  david did neither  unless you learn to obey as david did you will never learn to rule  imitate davidand so you will imitate davids greater son even our lord jesus christ  for herein david is a type of christ  one might say truly that davids spirit was in christif the very opposite was not the fact that the spirit of christ was in david even the spirit of loyalty and obedience toward god and man  the spirit which made our lord fulfil the whole law of mosesthough quite unnecessary of course for himsimply because he had chosen to be born a jew under moses law the spirit which made him obedient to the ordinance of the country in which he was born made him even pay tribute to caesar the heathen conqueror because the powers that ruled were ordained of god  and yet that same spirit kept him lofty and independent highminded and pureminded  he could tell the people to observe and to do all that the scribes and pharisees told them to do because they sat in moses seat and yet he could call those very scribes and pharisees hypocrites who made the law of no effect and were bringing on themselves utter destruction  that spirit too made him loyal and obedient to god his father in heaven  doing not his own will but the will of the father who sent him of him it is written that though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and that he received the perfect reward of perfect loyalty because he had humbled and emptied himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross therefore god highly exalted him and gave him a name which is above every name that at the name of jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven of things in the earth and things under the earth and every tongue confess that he is lord and god to the glory of god the father  this is a great mystery  how can we understand it  how can we understand the divine and eternal bond between father and son  but this at least we can understand that loyalty and obedience are divine virtues part of the likeness of jesus christ the eternal son of god and therefore divine graces the gift of gods holy spirit  may god pour out upon us that spirit as he poured it out on david and make us loyal and obedient to our queen and to all whom he has set over us and loyal and obedient above all to christ our heavenly king and to god the father in whom we live and move and have our being     xv  davids death song      and david spake unto the lord the words of this song in the day that    the lord had delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies and out    of the hand of saul and he said the lord is my rock and my fortress    and my deliverer the god of my rock in him will i trust he is my    shield and the horn of my salvation my high tower and my refuge my    saviour thou savest me from violence2 sam xxii 13  this is the death song of david the last words of the great manwarrior statesman king poet prophet  a man of many joys and many sorrows many virtues and many crimes but through them all every inch a man  a manheaped by god with every gift of body and mind and heart and especially with strong and deep intense feeling  right or wrong he is never hard never shallow never lightminded  he is in earnest whatever happens to him for good or evil goes to his heart and fills his whole soul till it comes out again in song  this it is which makes david the psalmist  this it is which makes the psalter a text book still for every soldier or sailor for all men who have human hearts in them  this it is which will make his psalms live for ever  because they are full of humanity of the spirit of man awakened and enlightened and ennobled by the spirit of god  looking through these psalms of david one is struck with astonishment at their variety  at what is called the versatility of his mind that is his ability to turn himself to every kind of subject as it comes before him and to sing of itas man has never sung since  and one is the more astonished when one remembers that many of the most beautiful of these psalms must have been written while david was still a very young man though we have them of course only in a translationthough many of the words and phrases in them are difficult sometimes impossible to understand though they were written in a kind of verse which would give our english ears no pleasure and were set to a music so utterly different from our own that it would not sound like music to us  yet with all these disadvantages they are beautiful as they stand they sink into the ear and into the heart as what they are the words of one inspired by god who found beauty in every sight which he beheld in every event which happened even in every sorrow and every struggle in his own soul and could sing of each and all of them in words and thoughts fresh from god the fountain of all beauty and all truth  but the peculiarity of davids psalms after all is from his intense faith in god  god is in all his thoughts  god is near him guiding him trying him educating him punishing him sometimes he thinks for a moment deserting him  but even then his mind is still full of god  it is god he wants and the light of gods countenance without which he cannot live and leaving him in misery and shame and darkness and out of the darkness he criesmy god my god why hast thou forsaken me  and therefore everything which happens to him shapes itself not into mere poetry but into a prayer or a hymn  it is this which has made david for christians now as well as for jews of old the great master and teacher of heart religion  in the early church in the middle ages as now catholic alike and protestant whosoever has feared god and sought after righteousness whosoever has known and sorrowed over the sinfulness and weakness of his own heart whosoever has believed that the lord god was dealing with him as with a son educating him chastening him purifying him and teaching him by the chances and changes of his mortal life whosoever i say has had any real taste of vital experimental religionto davids psalms he has gone as to a treasure house to find there his own feelings his own doubts his own joys his own thoughts of god and his providencereflected as in a glass everything which he would say said for him already in words which will never be equalled on earth  there are psalms among them of bitter agony cries as of a lost child like that 6th psalmoh lord rebuke me not in thine anger neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure c  and yet ending like that with a sudden flash of faith and hope and joy which is a peculiar mark of davids character faith in god triumphing over all the chances and changes of mortal life  the lord hath heard the voice of my weeping the lord will receive my prayer all mine enemies shall be confounded and sore vexed  they shall be turned back and put to shame  there are psalms again which are prayers for guidance and teaching like the 5th psalmlead me o lord in thy righteousness because of mine enemies make thy way plain before my face  there are psalms again of natural religion such as the 8th and the 19th and the 29th the words of a man who had watched and studied nature by day and night as he kept his sheep upon the mountains and wandered in the desert with his men  i will consider thy heavens the works of thy hand the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained    the fowls of the air and the fishes of the sea    ps viii 38  the heavens declare the glory of god and the firmament sheweth his handi work ps xix 16  it is the lord that commandeth the water it is the glorious god that maketh the thunder it is the lord that ruleth the sea the voice of the lord breaketh the cedar trees the voice of the lord divideth the flames of fire the voice of the lord shaketh the wilderness the lord sitteth above the water flood c ps xxix  there are psalms of deep religious experience like the 32dblessed is he whose unrighteousness is forgiven and whose sin is covered    thou art a place to hide me in    thy hand is heavy upon me day and night    i will acknowledge my sin unto thee  there are psalms and these are almost the most important of all such as the 9th the 24th and 36th psalms which declare the providence and the kingdom of the living god with that great and prophetic 2d psalm ver 1 5 why do the heathen so furiously rage together and the people imagine vain things  the kings of the earth stand up and the rulers take counsel together against the lord and against his anointed c  there are psalms of deep repentance of the broken and the contrite heart like that famous 51st psalm which is used in all christian churches to this day as the expression of all true repentance and which even in our translation by its awful simplicity its slow sadness expresses in its very sound the utterly crushed and broken heart  have mercy upon me o god after thy great goodness according to the multitude of thy mercies do away mine offences    behold i was shapen in iniquity and in sin did my mother conceive    the sacrifice of god is a troubled spirit a broken and a contrite heart o god thou wilt not despise     then there are psalms like the 26th of a manful and stately confidence  the words of one who is determined to do right who feels that on the whole he is doing it and is not ashamed to say so  be thou my judge for i have walked innocently    examine and prove me try out my reins and my heart  i have not dwelt with vain persons neither will i have fellowship with the deceitful    i have hated the congregation of the wicked  i have loved the habitation of thy house  there are political psalms full of weighty advice to his sons after him like the 115th psalm  there are psalms of the most exquisite tenderness like the 23d psalm written perhaps while he himself was still a shepherd boy and he looked upon his flocks feeding on the downs of bethlehem and sang the lord is my shepherd i shall not want c  and lastly though i should not say lastly for the variety of this wonderful mans psalms is past counting there are psalms of triumph and thanksgiving which are miracles of beauty and grandeur  take for instance the 34th one of the earliest when david was not more than twentyfive years old when abimelech drove him away and he departed and sang i will bless the lord at all times    my soul shall make her boast in the lord    i sought the lord and he heard me and delivered me out of all my fear  lo the poor man crieth and the lord heareth him    the angel of the lord tarrieth round about them that fear him and delivereth them  and as the grandest of all as indeed it was meant to be that wonderful 18th psalm which david the servant of the lord spake to the lord in the day when the lord delivered him out of the hand of all his enemies  i will love thee o lord my strength  the lord is my strong rock and defence my saviour my god and my might in whom i will trust my buckler the horn also of my salvation and my refuge  this is indeed davids masterpiece  the only one which comes near it is the 144th  the loftiest piece of poetry taken as mere poetry though it is more much more in the whole world  even in our translation it rushes on with a force and a swiftness which are indeed divine  thought follows thought image image verse verse before the breath of the spirit of god as wave leaps after wave before a mighty wind  even now to read that psalm rightly should stir the heart like a trumpet  what must it have been like when sung by david himself  no wonder that those brave old jews hung upon the lips of their warriorpoet and felt that the man who could sing to them of such thoughts and not only sing them but feel them likewise was indeed a king and a prophet sent to them by god  a prophet i say  they loved his songs not merely on account of the beauty of their poetry  indeed one hardly likes to talk of davids psalms as beautiful poetry  it seems unfair to them  for though they are beautiful poetry they are far more they are prophecy and preaching concerning god  they preach and declare to the jews the living god  they are the speech of a man whose thoughts and works were begun continued and ended in god  a man who knew that god was about his path and about his bed and spying out all his ways  a man whose one fixed idea was that god was leading and guiding him through life  that idea the lord leads me is the keynote of davids psalms and makes them what they are an inspired revelation of almighty god  but is that idea true  of course you answer it is true because it is in the bible  but that is not the question  that is rather putting the question aside which is do we believe it to be true and find it to be true  we believe that god was leading david because we read it in the bible  but do we believe that god is leading us  if not what is the use of our reading davids psalms either in private or publicly in church every sunday  you all know how largely we use them but why  if we are not in the same case as david was what right have we to take davids words into our mouths  we do not fancy that there is any magical virtue in repeating the same words as foolish people used to repeat charms and spells  our only right our only excuse for saying or singing davids psalms in public or in private must be that as david was so are we in this world under the continual guidance of god  and therefore it is that the church bids us to use these psalms in our devotions day by day all the year roundthat we may know that our god is davids god our temptations davids temptations our fears davids fears our hopes davids hopes our struggles and triumphs over what is wrong in our hearts and in the world around us are the same as davids that we are not to fancy because david was an inspired prophet that therefore he was in a different case from us of different passions from ours or that his words are too sacred and holy for us to use  not so we are to believe the very contrary  we are to believe that no prophecy of scripture is of any private interpretationthat ishas not merely to do with the man who spoke it firstbut that because david spoke by the spirit of god who is no respecter of persons therefore his words apply to you and to me and to every human beingthat david is revealing to us the everlasting laws of gods spirit and of gods providence whereby he works alike in every christian soul and then therefore whatever our sin may be whatever our sorrows may be whatever our station in life may be we have a right to offer up to god our repentance our doubts our fears our hopes our thanksgivings in the very words which david used two thousand years and more ago certain that they are the right words better words than we can find for ourselves exactly fitting our own souls and fitting too the mind and will of almighty god because they are inspired by the same spirit of god who descended on us when we were baptized unto christs church  and for that my friends we have an exampleas we have for everything elsein our lord jesus christ himself  for he in the hour of his darkest agony when he hung upon the cross for our sins and the sin of all mankind and when worse than all other agony or shame there came over him the deepest horror of allthe feeling but for a moment that god had forsaken himeven then he who spake as never man spake did not disdain to use the words of david and cry in the opening verse of that 22d psalm every line of which applies so strangely to him himself my god my god why hast thou forsaken me  so did our lord bequeath as it were with his dying breath to all christians for ever as the fit and true expression of all that they should ever experience the psalms of his great earthly ancestor david the sweet singer of israel  my friends neglect not that precious bequest of your dying lord  read those psalms study them tune your hearts and minds to them more and more and you will find in them an inexhaustible treasury of wisdom and comfort and of the knowledge of god wherein standeth your eternal life     xvi  ahab and micaiahthe christian dead alive foe evermore      and the king of israel said to jehosaphat there is yet one man    micaiah the son of imlah by whom we may enquire of the lord but i    hate him for he doth not prophesy good concerning me but evil      1 kings xxii 8  if you read the story of micaiah the prophet and king ahab in the 22d chapter of the 1st book of kings you will i think agree that ahab showed himself as foolish as he was wicked  he hated micaiah for telling him the truth  and when he heard the truth and was warned of his coming end he went stupidly to meet it and died as the fool dies  foolishness and wickedness often go hand in hand  certainly they did in that miserable kings case  but now my friends while we find fault with wretched ahab let us take care that we are not finding fault with ourselves also  if we do what ahab did we have no right to despise him for doing what we do  with what judgment we judge we shall be judged and the same measure which we measure out to ahab god will measure out to us  all these things are written for our example that we may see our faults in other men as in a glass and seeing how ugly sin and folly is and to what misery it leads may learn to avoid it and look at home and see that we are not treading the same path  else what use in reading these stories of good men and bad men of old times  the very use of them is to make us remember that they were men of like passions with ourselves and learn from their example as we may do easily enough from that of ahab  there remaineth yet one prophetbut i hate him  how often have we said that in our hearts  do you think not  let me show you then  how often when we are in trouble or anxiety do we go everywhere to get comfort before we go to gods word  when a young lad falls into wild ways and gets into trouble by his own folly then to whom does he go for comfort  too often to other wild lads like himself or to foolish and wicked women who will flatter him and try to make him easy in his sins and say to him as the false prophets said to ahab go on and prosperwhy be afraid  why should you not enjoy yourself  never mind what your father and mother say never mind what the parson says  you will do well enough  all will come right somehow  come and drink and drive away sorrow  and all the while the poor lad gets no comfort from these false friends he likes to listen to them because they flatter him up in his sins but all the while his heart is heavy  like ahab he has a secret fear that all will not come right he feels that he will not do well enough and he knows that there remaineth yet a prophet of the lord who will not prophesy good of him but eviland that is the bible and the prayerbook and the sermon he hears at churchand therefore he hates them  and so many a time he will not go to church for fear of hearing there that he is wrong perhaps something in the sermon which hits him hard and makes him ashamed of himself and angry with the preacher  so for fear of hearing the truth and having his sins set before his face he stays away from church and passes his sundays like a heathen because he has no mind to repent and mend and be a good christian  foolish fellow  as if he could escape gods judgment by shutting his ears to it  as well try to stop the thunder from rolling in the sky by stopping his ears to that  the thunder is there whether he choose to hear it or not  and whether he comes to church or not gods law stands sure that the wages of sin is death  does the man fancy that gods law is shut up within the church walls and that so he can keep clear of it by staying away from church  my friends gods law is over the whole country and over every cottage and field in itabout our path and about our bed and spying out all our ways  the darkness is no darkness to god  gods judgments are in all the earth and whether or not we choose to find them out they will find us out just the same as they found out ahab when his cup was full and his time was come  how many a poor lad too who has got into trouble thinks he shall escape gods judgments by going across the sea but he finds himself mistaken  he finds that the wages of sin are misery and shame and ruin in australia just as much as in england and that all the gold in the diggings cannot redeem his soul or prevent his being an unhappy self condemned man if he does wrong  how many a poor lad too who has got into trouble has fancied that he could escape gods judgments by going for a soldier and has found out that he too was mistaken  perhaps gods judgment has found him out as it found out ahab on the field of battle and a chance shot has taught him as it taught ahab that there is no hidingplace from the lord who made him  or perhaps gods judgments have come in fever and hunger and cold and weariness and miserable lonely labour and with that hunger of body has come a hunger of his soula hunger after the bread of life and the word of god  ah how many a poor fellow in his pain and misery has longed for the crumbs which used to fall from gods table when he was a boy at home for a word of good advice though it were never so sharp and plain spokenor a lesson such as he used to hear at school or a tract or a bit of a book or anybody or anything which will put his poor wandering soul in the right way  he used to hate such things when he was at home because they warned him of his bad ways but now he feels a strange longing for that very good talk which he hated once and so like david of old out of the deep he cries unto the lord  and when that cry comes up out of a sinful consciencestricken selfcondemned heart be sure it does not come up in vain  the lord hears it and the lord answers it  yes i know it for certain for many a sad and yet pleasant story i have heard how brave men who went out from england full of strength and health and full of sin and folly tooand there in that bloodstained crimea when their strength and their health had faded and there was nothing round them or before them but wounds and misery and death how there at last they found christ or rather were found by him and opened their eyes at last to see gods judgments for their sins and confessed their own sin and gods justice and received his precious promises of pardon even in the agonies of death and found amid the rage and noise of war the peace of god which this worlds pleasures never gave them and which this worlds wounds and fever and battle and sudden death cannot take away  and after that it matters little for a man what happens to him  for if he lives he lives unto the lord and if he dies he dies unto the lord he may come home well and strong once more to do his duty where god has put him a sadder man perhaps but at least a soberer and a wiser man who has learnt to endure hardship not merely as a soldier of the queen but as a good soldier of jesus christ too ready to fight against sin and wrongdoing in himself and in his neighbours  or he may come home a cripple to be honoured and to be kept too as he deserves to be at his countrys expense  but if he be a wise man he will not regret even the loss of a limb  that is a cheap price to pay for having gained what is worth all the limbs in a mans body a clear conscience and a right life  if thy hand offend thee cut it off better to enter into life halt and maimed as many a gallant man has done in war time than having two hands and two feet to be cast out  or perhaps his grave is left behind there upon those lonely crimean downs and his comrades are returning without him and all whom he knew and all whom he loved are looking for him at home  there his grave is and must be and the foe and the stranger will tread on his head and they far away on the billow  but at least he has not died like ahaba shameful and pitiable death  he has done his work and conquered  he has died like a man whom men honour  even so it is well  and if he have died in the lord a penitent christian man he is not dead at all  he does not lie in that grave in a foreign land  all of him that strangers feet can tread upon is but what we called his body and yet which was not even his body but the mere husk and shell of him the flesh and bones with which his body was clothed in this life while he he himself is nearer god than ever and nearer too than ever to his comrades who seem to have left him and to the parents and the friends who are weeping for him at home  ay nearer to them more able i firmly believe to help and comfort them now that he is alive for ever in the heaven of god than he would if he were only alive here on the earth of godmore able perhaps to help them now by his prayers than he ever would have been by the labour of his hands  be that as it may blessed are the dead who die in the lord for they rest from their labours and their works do follow them  a fearful labour is the soldiers and an ugly work and he has done it and doubt not it has followed him and is recorded for him in the book of god for ever     xvii  what is chance      by one man sin entered into the world and death by sin and so death    passed upon all men because all have sinnedromans v 12  all death is a solemn and fearful thing  when it comes to an old person one cannot help feeling it often a release and saying he has done his workhe has sorrowed out his sorrows he has struggled his last struggle and wept his last tear let him go to his rest and be peaceful at last  but when death comes suddenly to people in the prime of life who but yesterday were as busy and as lively as any of us and we are face to face with death and see the same face we knew in lifenot wasted not worn young and lusty as ever seemingly asleepsomething at our heart as well as in our eyes tells us that there is more than sleep in that strange sharp quiet smileand we know in spite of ourselves that the man is dead  and then strange questions rise in us is that he whom we knew that still piece of clay waiting only a few days before it returns to its dust  it is the face of him the shape of him it is what we knew him by  it is the very same body of which when we met it on the road we said he is coming  and yet is it he  where is he himself  can he hear us  can he see us  does he remember us as we remember him  surely he must  he cannot be gone awaythere he lies still on that bed before us  and then we are ready to say to ourselves it must be a mistake a dream  he cannot be dead  he will wake  we shall meet him tomorrow in his old place about his old work  he dead  impossible  impossible to believe that we shall never see him againnever any more till we too die  and then when such thoughts come over us we cannot help going on to say what is this death this horrible thing which takes husbands from their wives and children from their parents and those who love from those who love them  what is it  how came this same death loose in the world what right has it here under the bright sun among the pleasant fields this cruel pitiless death destroying gods handiwork gods likeness just as it is growing to its prime of beauty and usefulness  and thenthereby the bedside of the young at least we do feel that death must be gods enemythat it is a hateful cruel evil thingaccursed in the sight of a loving lifegiving god as much as it is hated by poor mortal man  and then we feel there must be something wrong between man and god  man must be fallen and corrupt must be out of his right place and state in some way or other or this horrible death would not have got power over us  what right has death in the world if man has not sinned or fallen  and then we cannot help going further and saying this cruel death it may come to me young strong and healthy as i am  it may come tomorrow it may come this minute it may come by a hundred diseases by a hundred accidents which i cannot foresee or escape and carry me off tomorrow away from all i know and all i love and all i like to see and to do  and where would it take me to if it did take me  what should i be  what should i see  what should i know after they had put this body of mine into that narrow house in the churchyard and covered it out of sight till the judgment day  oh my friends what a thought for you and me and every human being  we might die tonight even as those whom we know of died  but perhaps some of you young people are saying to yourselves you are trying to frighten us but you shall not frighten us  we know very well that it is not a common thing for a young person to dienot one in a hundred except in a war time dies in the prime of his years and therefore the chances are that we shall not die young either  the chances are that we shall live to be old men and women and we are not going to be frightened about dying forty years before our death  so in the meanwhile we will go our own way and enjoy ourselves  it will be time enough to think of death when death draws near  well then if you have these thoughts i will ask you what do you mean by chance  you say the chances are against your dying young  pray what are these wonderful things called chances which are to keep you alive for thirty or forty or fifty years more  did you ever hear a chance or see a chance  or did you ever meet with any one who had did any one ever see a great angel called chance flying about keeping people from dying  what is chance on which you depend as you say for your life  what is chance which you fancy so much stronger than god for as long as the chance is against your dying you are not afraid of neglecting god and disobeying god and therefore you must suppose that chance is stronger than god and quite able to keep gods anger off from you for thirty or forty years till you choose to repent and amend what sort of thing is this wonderful chance which is going to keep you alive  perhaps you will say all we meant when we said that the chances were against our dying was that gods will was against our dying  did you only mean that  then why put the thought of god away by foolish words about chance  for you know that it is god and god only who keeps you alive  you must look at that you must face that  if you are alive now god keeps you so  if you live forty years more god will make you live that time  and he who can make you live can also let you not live and then you will die  god can withdraw the breath of life from you or me or any one at any moment  and then where would our chances of not dying be  we should die here and now and know that god is the lord and not chance     but think again  if god makes you alive he must have some reason for making you alive  for mindit is not as you fancy that when god leaves you alone you live and when he puts forth his power and visits you you die  not that but the very opposite  for in adam all die  our bodies are dead by reason of sin and in the midst of life we are in death  there is a seed of death in you and me and every little child while we are eating and drinking and going about our business fancying that we cannot help living we carry the seeds of disease in our own bodies which will surely kill us some day even if we are not cut off before by some sudden accident  that is true physicians know that it is true  our bodies carry in them from the very cradle the seeds of death and therefore it is not because god leaves us alone that we live  we live because god our merciful heavenly father does not leave us alone but keeps down those seeds of disease and death by his spirit who is the lord and giver of life  gods spirit of life is fighting against death in our bodies from the moment we are born  and then as moses says when he withdraws that spirit of his then it is that we die and are turned again to our dust so that our living a long time or a short time does not depend on chance or on our own health or constitution but entirely on how long god may choose to keep down the death which is lying in us ready to kill us at any moment and certain to kill us sooner or later  and yet people fancy that they live because they cannot help living unless god interferes with them and makes them die  they fancy thoughtless and ignorant as they are that when they are in health god leaves them alone and that therefore when they are in health they may leave god alone  my friends i tell you that it is god and not our constitution or chance either which keeps you alive as you will surely find out the moment after the last breath has left your body  and therefore i ask you solemnly the plain question for what does god keep you alive  for what  will a man keep plants in his garden which bear neither fruit nor flowers  will a man keep stock on his farm which will only eat and never make profit or a servant in his house who will not work  much more will a man keep a servant who will not only be idle himself but quarrel with his fellow servants lead them into sin and shame and teach them to disobey their master  what man in his senses would keep such plants such stock such servants  and yet god keeps hundreds and thousands in his garden and in his house for years and years while they are doing no good to him and doing harm to those around them  how many are there who never yet did one thing to make their companions better and yet have done many a thing to make their companions worse then why are they alive still  why does not god rid himself of them at once and let them die instead of cumbering the ground  i know but one reason  if they were only gods plants or his stock or his servants he might rid himself of them  but they are something far nearer and dearer to him than that  they are his children and therefore he has mercy on them  they are redeemed by the blood of the lord jesus christ the lamb slain before the foundation of the world and therefore for the sake of the lord jesus christ god looks on them with longsuffering and tender lovingkindness  man was made in gods likeness at first and was the son of god  and therefore howsoever fallen and corrupt mans nature is now yet god loves him still even though he be a heathen or an infidel  how much more for you my friends who know that you are gods children who have been declared to be his children by holy baptism and grafted into christs church  you at least are bound to believe that god preserves you from death because he loves you  he protects you every day and every hour as a father takes care of his children and keeps them out of dangers which they cannot see or understand  yes this is plain truthyour heavenly father is keeping you alive  oh do not make that truth an excuse for forgetting and disobeying your heavenly father  why does he keep you alive  surely because he expects something of you and what does he expect of you  what does any good father expect of his children  why does he help and protect them  not from mere brute instinct as beasts take care of their young when they are little and then as soon as they are grown up cast them off and forget them  no  he takes care of his children because he wishes them to grow up like himself to be a comfort and a help and a pride to him  and god takes care of you and keeps you from death for the very same reason  god desires that you should grow up like himself godly and pure leading lives like his son jesus christ  god desires that you should grow up to the stature of perfect men and women which is the likeness of jesus christ your lord  but if you turn gods grace in keeping you alive into a cloak for licentiousness and an excuse for sinningif when god keeps you alive that you may lead good lives you take advantage of his fatherly love to lead bad livesif you go on returning god evil for good and ungratefully and basely presume on his patience and love to do the things which he hates what must you expect  god loves you and you make that an excuse for not loving him god does everything for you and you make that an excuse for doing nothing for god god gives you health and strength and you make that an excuse for using your health and strength just in the way he has forbidden  what can be more ungrateful  what can be more foolish  oh my friends if one of our children behaved to us in return for our care and love a hundredth part as shamefully as most of us behave to god our father what should we think of them  what should we say of them  oh beware beware  god is a righteous god strong and patient and god is provoked every day and bears it according to his boundless love and patience  but if a man will not turn says the same text he will whet his sword  and thenwoe to the careless and ungrateful sinner god will cut him down and bring him low  god will take from him his health or his money or his blind peace of mind and by affliction after affliction and shame after shame and disappointment after disappointment teach him that his youth and his health and his money and all that he has are his fathers gifts and not his own propertyand that his father will take them away from him till he feels his own weakness till he sees that he is really not his own but gods property body and soul and goes back to his heavenly father and cries father i have sinned against heaven and before thee and am no more worthy to be called thy son  i have taken thy gifts and gone away with them from thy house unto the far country of sin and wasted them in riotous living till i have had to fill my belly with the husks which the swine did eat i have had no profit out of all my sins of which i am now ashamed  i have robbed thee and abused thy gifts and thy love  father take me back for i have sinned and am not worthy to be called thy child     xviii  earthly and heavenly wisdom or stoop to conquer      the lord by wisdom hath founded the earth by understanding hath he    established the heavensprov iii 19  did it ever strike you as a very remarkable and important thing that after saying in proverbs iii that wisdom is this precious treasure and bidding his son seek for her because verse 16 length of days is in her right hand and in her left hand riches and honour her ways are ways of pleasantness and all her paths are peacesolomon goes on immediately to say verses 19 20 the lord by wisdom hath founded the earth and established the heavens  by wisdom by the very same wisdom solomon says which is to give men length of days and riches and honour  is not this curious at least that there is but one wisdom for god and man  that mans true wisdom is a pattern of gods wisdom  that a man to prosper in the world must get the very same wisdom by which god made and rules the world  curious  but most blessed news my friends if we will think over what it means  i will try to explain it to you first as to this world which we see next as to the heavenly world of spirits which we do not see  you have many of you heard the word science  many of you of course know what it means  that it means wisdom and learning about this earth and all things in it  many more of you of course know that in the last hundred years science has improved in a most wonderful way and is improving every day that we have now gaslights steamengines cotton mills railroads electric telegraphs iron ships and a hundred curious and useful machines and manufactures of which our greatgrandfathers never dreamed that our knowledge of different countries of medicines of the laws of health and disease and of all in short which has to do with mans bodily life is increasing day by day and that all these discoveries are very great blessings they give employment and food to millions who would otherwise have had nothing to do they bring vast wealth into this country and all the countries which trade with us  they enable this land of england to support four times as many human beings as it did two hundred years ago they make many of the necessaries of life cheaper so that in many cases a poor man may now have comforts which his grandfather never heard of  i know that there is a dark side to this picture that with all this increase of wisdom there has come conceit and trust in deceitful riches and want of trust in god and obedience to his law  i know that in some things we are not better but worse than our forefathers god forgive us for it  but the good came from god and that man is very unwise and unthankful too who despises gods great gift of science because fallen man has defiled his gift as it passed through his unclean hands  look only at this one thing as i said just now that by all these wonderful discoveries and improvements england is able to support four times as many englishmen as it used of old and that if we feared god and sought his kingdom better i believe england would support many more people yetand see if that be not a thing to thank almighty god for every day of our lives  now how did this wonderful change and improvement take placesuddenly and as it were in the course of the last hundred years  simply by mankind understanding the text prov iii 19 and by obeying it  i tell you a real truth my friends and it happened thus  for more than sixteen hundred years after our lords time mankind seem to have become hardly any wiser about earthly things nay even to have gone back  the land was no better tilled goods were no more easily made diseases were no better cured than they had been sixteen hundred years before  and if any learned men longed to become very wise and cunning and to get power over this world and the things in it they flew off to witchcraft charms and magic deceived by the devils old lie that the kingdom and the power and the glory of this world belonged to him and not to god  but about two hundred and fifty years ago it pleased god to open the eyes of one of the wisest men who ever lived who was called francis bacon lord verulam lord chancellor of england and to show him the real and right way of learning by which men can fulfil gods command to replenish the earth and subdue it  and francis bacon told all the learned men boldly that they had all been wrong together and that their wisdom was no better than a sort of madness as it is written the wisdom of man is foolishness with god that the only way for man to be wise was to get gods wisdom the wisdom with which he had founded the earth and find out gods laws by which he had made this world  and then he said if you can do that you will be able to imitate god in your own small way  if you learn the laws by which god made all things you will be able to invent new things for yourselves  for you can only subdue nature by obeying her  that was one of his greatest sayings and by it he meant that you can only subdue a thing and make it useful to you by finding out the rules by which god made that thing and by obeying them  for instance you cannot subdue and till a barren field and make it useful without knowing and obeying the laws and rules of that soil and then you can subdue and conquer that field and change and train it as i may say to grow what you like  you cannot conquer diseases without knowing and obeying the laws by which god has made mans body and the laws by which fever and cholera and other plagues come  let me give you another instance  you all have seen lightning conductors which prevent tall chimneys and steeples from being struck by storms so that the lightning runs harmless downward  now we can all see how this is conquering the force of lightning in a wonderful and beautiful way  but before you can conquer the lightning by a conductor you must obey the lightning and its laws most carefully  if you make the conductor out of your own head and fancy it will be of no use  you must observe and follow humbly the laws which god has given to the lightning you must make the conductor of metal wire or it will be useless  you must make it run through glazed rings or it will be only more dangerous than no conductor at all for god who made the lightning chose that it should be so and you must obey if you wish to conquer  man could not conquer steam and make it drive his engines and carry his ships across the seas till he found out and obeyed the laws which god had given to steam and so without breaking the laws man turned them to his own use and set the force of steam to turn his machines instead of rushing idly out into the empty air  so it is with all things whether in heaven or earth  if you want to rule you must obey  if you want to rise to be a master you must stoop to be a servant  if you want to be master of anything in earth or heaven you must as that great lord verulam used to say obey gods will revealed in that thing and the man who will go his own way and follow his own fancy will understand nothing and master nothing and get comfort out of nothing in earth or heaven  wellwhen lord verulam told men his new wisdom they laughed and scoffed as fools always will at anything new  but one by one wise men tried his plan and found him right and went on and from that time those who followed lord verulam began discovering wonders of which they had never dreamed and those who did not but kept to the old way of witchcraft and magic found out nothing and made themselves a laughing stock  and after a while witchcraft vanished out of all civilised countries and in its place came all the wonderful comforts and discoveries which we have now and which under god we owe to the wisdom of the great lord verulam  cotton mills steam engines railroads electric telegraphs sanitary reforms cheap books penny postage good medicine and surgery and a thousand blessings more  that great lord chancellor has been the father of them all  and a noble thought it is for us church people and a glorious testimony to the good training which the church of england gives that the three men who more than any others laid the foundation of all our wonderful discoveries i mean lord verulam mr boyle and sir isaac newton were all of them heart and soul members of the church of england  i said just now that the man who will not obey will never rule that the man who will not stoop to be a servant will never rise to be a master that the man who neglects gods will and mind about things and will follow his own will and fancy will understand nothing and master nothing and get comfort out of nothing either in earth or heaven  either in earth or heaven i say  for the same rule which holds good in this earthly world which we do see holds good in the heavenly world which we do not see  solomon does not part the two worlds and i cannot solomon says the same rules which hold good about mens bodies hold good about their souls  the great lord verulam used always to say the same and we must believe the same  for see solomon says that this same wisdom by which god made the worlds will help our souls as well as our bodies that it is not merely the earthly wisdom which brings a man length of life and riches but heavenly wisdom which is a tree of life to every one who lays hold of her prov iii 18  the heavenly wisdom which begins in trusting in the lord with all our heart the heavenly wisdom which is learnt by chastenings and afflictions and teaches us that we are the sons of god is the very same wisdom by which god founded the earth and makes the clouds drop down dew  strange at first sight but not strange if we remember the athanasian creed and believe that god is one god who has no parts or passions and therefore cannot change or be divided  yes my friends gods wisdom is oneunchangeable everlasting and always like itself and by the same wisdom by which he made the earth and the heavens by the same wisdom by which he made our bodies has he made our souls and therefore we can and are bound to glorify him alike in our bodies and our spirits for both are his  it may not seem easy to understand this but i will explain what i mean by an example  i just told you that in earthly matters we must stoop to conquer we must obey the laws which god has given to anything before we can master and use that thing  and in matters about our own soulabout our behaviour to godabout our behaviour to our fellowmen believe me there is no rule like the golden one of lord verulamsstoop to conquerobey if you wish to rule  for see now  what is there more common than this  it happens to each of us every day  we meet a fellow man our equal neither better nor worse than ourselves and we want to make him do something  now there are two ways in which we may set about that  we may drive our man or we may lead him  you know well enough which of those two ways is likely to succeed best  if you try to drive the man you say to yourself i know i am right  i see the thing in this light and he is a fool if he does not see it in the same light  i choose to have the thing done and done it shall be and if he is stupid enough not to take my view of it i will let him know who i am and we will see which of us is the stronger  so says many a man in his heart but what comes of it  nothing  for the other man gets angry and determines to have his way in his turn  there is a quarrel and a great deal of noise and most probably the thing is not done  instead of the man getting what he wants he has a fresh quarrel on his hands and nothing more  so his blustering is no sign that he is really strong  for the strong man is the man who can get what he wants done  is he not surely we shall all agree to that  and the proud hot positive dictatorial selfwilled man is just the man in a free country like this who does not get what he wants done  he will not stooptherefore he will not conquer  but suppose we take another plan  suppose instead of trying to drive we try to lead  suppose if we want a man to do anything we begin by obeying him and serving him that we may afterwards lead him and afterwards make use of him  there is a base mean way of doing that by flattering and fawning and cringing which are certainly the devils works  for the devil can put on the form of an angel of light but we need not do that  we may serve and obey a man honestly and honourably in order to get him to do what he ought to do  i will tell you what i mean  suppose when we have dealings with any man we begin with him as i was saying we ought to begin with earthly thingswith a field for instancewe should say before i begin to make this field bear the crop i want i must look it through and understand it  i must see what state it is inwhat its soil iswhat has been taken off it alreadywhat the weather iswhat state of drainage it is in and so forth and i must obey the rules of all these things or my crop will come to nothing  so with this man  first of all before i get anything out of the man i must understand the man  i must find out what sort of temper and character he has what his opinions are how he has been brought up how he has been accustomed to look at thingsso as to be able to make allowance for all else i shall never be able to understand how he looks at this one matter or to make him understand my way of looking at it and to do thatto understand the man or make him understand me i must begin by making a friend of him  there my friendsthere is one of the blessed laws of the kingdom of heaven that in a free country as this thank god is the only sure way to get power and influence over people is by making friends of them by behaving like christians to them making them trust you and love you by pleasing them giving way to them making yourself of service to them doing what they like whenever you can in order that they may do to you as you have done to them and measure back to you as the lord jesus promises they will with the same measure with which you have measured to them  in short serving men that you may rule them and stooping before them that you may conquer them  and if any of you are too proud to try this plan and think it fairer to drive men than to lead them i can tell you of two persons who were not as proud as you are and were not ashamed to do what you are ashamed to doand yet they are two persons before the least of whom you would hang your head and feel as i am sure i should a very small and mean and pitiful person if i met them in the road  for the first and by far the least of the two is st paul  now st paul says this was the very plan by which he got influence over men and persuaded and converted them and brought them home to god by being himself a servant to all men and pleasing all men being a jew to the jews and a greek to the greeks and all things to all men if by any means he might save some  giving up giving way taking trouble putting himself out of the way as we say here all day long to win people to love him and trust him and see that he really cared for them and therefore to be ready to listen to him  from what one can see of st pauls manners from his own epistles he must have been the most perfect gentleman a gentle man civil obliging delicate minded careful to hurt no ones feelings and when he had as he had often to say rough things and deal with rough men doing it as tenderly and carefully as he could like his master the lord jesus christ lest he should break the bruised reed or quench the smoking flax  which of us can read the epistle to philemon which to my mind is the most civil pleasant kindly gentlemanlike speech which i know on earth without saying to ourselves ah if we had but st pauls manners st pauls temper st pauls way of managing people how few quarrels there would be in this noisy troublesome world  but i said that there was one greater than st paul who was not ashamed to behave in the very same way stooping to all conciliating all  and so there isone whose shoes st paul was not worthy to stoop down and unlooseand that is the lord jesus christ himselfwho ate and drank with publicans and sinners who went out into the highways and hedges to bring home into gods kingdom poor wretches whom men despised and cast off  it was he who taught st paul to behave in the same way  may he teach us to behave in the same way also  st paul learnt to discern mens spirits and feel for them and understand them and help them and comfort them and at last to turn and change them whichever way he chose simply because he was full of the spirit of christ who is the spirit of god proceeding both from the father and the son  for st paul says positively that his reason for not pleasing himself but taking so much trouble to please other people was because christ also pleased not himself  we that are strong he says ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves  let every man please his neighbour for his good unto edification for even christ pleased not himself rom xv 13  and again we have a high priest who can be touched with the feeling of our infirmities heb iv 15 so it was by stooping to men that christ learned to understand men and by understanding men he was able to save men  and again st paul says let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus who being in the form of god and equal with god yetmade himself of no reputation but took upon him the form of a slave and was made in the likeness of man and being found in fashion as a man humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross phil ii 5 9 10  there my friendsthere was the perfect fulfilment of the great lawstoop to conquer  there was the reward of christs not pleasing himself  christ stooped lower than any man and therefore he rose again higher than all men  he did more to please men than any man and therefore god was better pleased with him than with all men and a voice came from heaven sayingthis person who stoops to the lowest depths that he may understand and help those who were in the lowest deepthis outcast who has not where to lay his head slandered blasphemed spit on scourged crucified because he will help all and feel for all and preach to all this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased matt iii 17  the brightness of my glorythe express image of my person heb i 3  my friends this may seem to you a strange sermon which began by talking of railroads and steamships and ends by talking of the death and the glory of the lord jesus christ and you may ask what has the end of it to do with the beginning  if you want to know recollect that i began by saying that there was but one wisdom for earth or heaven for man and for god and that is the wisdom which lies in stooping to conquer as the lord jesus christ did think over that and behave accordingly and be sure meanwhile that whenever you feel proud and selfwilled and dictatorial and inclined to drive men instead of leading them and to quarrel with them instead of trying to understand them and love them and bring them round gently by appealing to their reason and good feeling not to their fear of youthen you are going not gods way no nor mans way either but the devils way  you are going not the way by which the lord jesus christ rose to heaven but the way by which the devil fell from heaven as all selfwilled proud men will fall  proud and selfwilled men will not get done the things they want to be done while the meek those who are gentle and tender and try to draw men as god does with the cords of a man and the bands of love will prosper in this world and in the next they will see their hearts desire they will inherit the land and be refreshed in the multitude of peace     xix  it is good for the young to rejoice      rejoice o young man in thy youth and let thy heart cheer thee in    the days of thy youth and walk in the ways of thine heart and in the    sight of thine eyes but know thou that for all these things god will    bring thee into judgmentecclesiastes xi 9  some people fancy that in this text god forbids young people to enjoy themselves  they think that the words are spoken ironically and with a sneer as if to say  yes  enjoy yourself if you will  go your own way if you wish  make a fool of yourself if you are determined to do so  you will repent it at last  you will be caught at last and punished at last  now i cannot think that there would be in scripture or in any word of god a sneer so cruel and so unjust as that  for surely it would be unjust of god if after giving young people the power to be happy he then punished them for being happy for using the very powers which he had given them obeying the very feelings which he had implanted in them enjoying the very pleasures which he had put in their way  god cannot be a tempter my friends  he does not surely send us into a world full of traps and snares and then punish us for being caught in the very snares which he had set  god forbid  let us never fancy such things of god the heavenly father from whom comes every good and perfect gift  let us leave such fancies for soured and hardhearted persons who make a god in their own likenessa god of darkness and not of lighta grudger and not a giver  and let us take this text literally and plainly as it stands and see whether we cannot learn from it a really wholesome lesson  rejoice oh young man in thy youth  the bible tells you to rejoice therefore do so without fear  god has given you health strength spirits hope the power of enjoyment  and why save but that you may enjoy them and rejoice in your youth  he has given you more health more strength more spirits than you need to earn your daily bread or to learn your daily task  and why  to enable you to grow in body and in soul  and that you will only do if you are happy  the human soul says a wise man is like a plant and requires sunshine to make it grow and ripen  and the heavenly father has given you sunshine in your hearts that you may grow into hearty healthyminded men  if young people have not sunshine enough if they are kept down and crushed in youth by sorrow by anxiety by fear by overhard work by too much study by strict and cruel masters by dark and superstitious notions about gods anger by overscrupulousness about this and that thing being sinful then their souls and minds do not grow they become more or less stunted unhealthy unhappy slavish and mean people in afterlife because they have not rejoiced in their youth as god intended them to do  remember this you parents and be sure that all harshness and cruelty to your children all terrifying of them all overworking of them body or mind all making them unhappy by requiring of them more than the plain law of god requires or by teaching them to dread not to love their father in heavenall these will stunt and hurt their characters in after life and all are therefore sins against their heavenly father who willeth not that one little one should perish and who will require a strict account of each of us how we have brought up the children whom he has committed to our charge  let their hearts cheer them in the days of their youth  they will have trouble enough anxiety enough hereafter  do not you forestall the evil days for them  the more cheerful their growth is the more heart and spirit they will have to face the trials and sorrows of life when they come  but further the text says to the young man walk in the ways of thy heart  that is gods permission to free men in a free country  you are not slaves either to man or to god and god does not treat you as slaves but as children whom he can trust  he says walk in the ways of thine own heart  do what you will provided it be not wrong  choose your own path in life  exert yourselves boldly to better yourselves in any path you choose which is not a path of dishonesty and sin  again says the text walk in the sight of thine eyes  as your bodies are free let your minds be free likewise  see for yourselves judge for yourselves  god has given you eyes brains understanding use them  get knowledge for yourselves get experience for yourselves  educate and cultivate your own minds  live as far as you can a free reasonable cheerful happy life enjoying this world if you feel able to enjoy it but know thou that for all these things god will bring thee into judgment  ah say some there is the sting  how can we enjoy ourselves if we are to be brought into judgment after all  my friends before i answer that question let me ask one  do you look on god as a taskmaster requiring of you as the egyptians did of the jews to make bricks all day without straw and noting down secretly every moment that you take your eyes off your work that he may punish you for it years hence when you have forgotten itextreme to mark what is done amiss  or do you look on god as a father who rejoices in the happiness of his childrenwho sets them no work to do but what is good for them and requires them to do nothing without giving them first the power and the means to do ita father who knows our necessities before we ask for help and a saviour who is able and willing to give us help  if you think of god in that former way as a stern taskmaster i can tell you nothing about him  i know him not i find him neither in the bible in the world nor in my own conscience and reason  he is not the god of the bible the god of the gospel whom i am commanded to preach to you  but if you think of god as a father as your father in heaven who chastens you in his love that you may partake of his holiness and of his son jesus christ as your saviour your lord who loves you and desires your salvation body and soulof him i can speak for he is the true and only god revealed by his son jesus christ our lord and in his light i can tell you to rejoice and take comfort ever though he brings you into judgment for being your father in heaven he can mean nothing but your good and he would not bring you into judgment if that too was not good for you  now you must remember that the judgment of which solomon speaks here is a judgment in this life  the whole book of ecclesiastes from which the text is taken is about this life  solomon says so specially and carefully  he is giving here advice to his son and his doctrine all through is that a mans happiness or misery in this life his good or bad fortune in this life depend almost entirely on his own conduct and above all on his conduct in youth  as a man sows he shall reap is his doctrine  therefore he says in this very chapter do what if right just because it is right  it is sure to pay you in the long run somehow somewhere somewhen  cast thy bread on the watersthat is do a generous thing whenever you have an opportunityand thou shalt find it after many days give a portion to seven and also to eight for thou knowest not what evil shall be on the earth  every action of yours will bear fruit  every thing you do and every word you say will god bring into judgment sooner or later  it will rise up against you years afterwards to punish you or it will rise up for you years afterwards to reward you it must be so says solomon that is the necessary eternal moral law of gods world  as you do so will you be rewarded  if the clouds be full of rain they must empty themselves on the earth  where the tree falls there it will lie  as we say in england as you make your bed so you will lie on it  that does not as people are too apt to think speak of what is to happen to us after we die  it speaks expressly and only of what will happen before we die  it is the same as our english proverb  therefore he says do not look too far forward  do not be doubleminded doing things with a mean and interested afterthought plotting planning asking will this right thing pay me or not  he that observeth the wind and is too curious and anxious about the weather will not sow and he that regardeth the clouds shall not reap  no just do the right thing which lies nearest you and trust to god to prosper it  in the morning sow thy seed and in the evening withhold not thine hand for thou knowest not which shall prosper this or that or whether they shall both be alike good  thou knowest not he says the works of god who maketh all  all thou knowest is that the one only chance of success in life is to fear god and keep his commandments for this is the whole duty of man  for god shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing whether it be good or whether it be evil  whether it be good or whether it be evil  he does not say only that god will bring your evil deeds into judgment but that he will bring your good ones also and your happiness and good fortune in this life will be on the whole made up of the sumtotal of the good and harm you have done of the wisdom or the folly which you have thought and carried out  it is so  you know it is so  when you look round on other men you see that on the whole men prosper very much as they deserve  there are exceptions i know  solomon knew that well such strange and frightful exceptions that one must believe that those who have been so much wronged in this life will be righted in the life to come  children suffer for the sins of their parents  innocent people suffer with the guilty  but these are the exceptions not the rule  and these exceptions are much more rare than we choose to confess  when a man complains to you that he has been unfortunate that the world has been unjust to him that he has not had fair play in life and so forth in three cases out of four you will find that it is more or less the mans own fault that he has deserved his losses that is earned them for himself  i do not mean that the man need have been a wicked mannot in the least  but he has been imprudent perhaps weak hasty stupid or something else and his faults perhaps some one fault has hampered him thrown him back and god has brought him to judgment for it and made it punish him  and why  surely that he may see his fault and repent of it and mend it for the time to come  i say god may bring a mans fault into judgment and let it punish him without the man being a bad man  and you young people will find in afterlife that you will have earned deserved merited and worked out for yourselves a great deal of your own happiness and misery  i know this seems a hard doctrine  people are always ready to lay their misfortunes on god on the world on any and every one rather than on themselves  a bad education for instancea weakly constitution which some bring into the world with or without any fault of their own are terrible drawbacks and sore afflictions  the death of those near and dear to us of which we cannot always say i have earned this i have brought it on myself  it is the lord  let him do what seemeth him good  but because misfortunes may come upon us without our own fault that is no reason why we should not provide against the misfortunes which will be our own fault  nay is it not all the stronger reason for providing against them that there are other sorrows against which we cannot provide  alas is there not misery horrible enough hanging over our heads daily in this mortal life without our making more for ourselves by our own folly  we shall have grief enough before we die without adding to that grief the far bitterer torment of remorse  oh young people young people listen to what i say  you can be you will be you must be the builders of your own good or bad fortunes  on you it depends whether your lives shall be honourable and happy or dishonourable and sad  there is no such thing as luck or fortune in this world  what is called fortune is nothing else than the orderly and loving providence of the lord jesus christ who orders all things in heaven and earth and who will sooner or later reward every man according to his works  just in proportion as you do the will of your father in heaven just so far will doing his will bring its own blessing and its own reward  instead of hoping for good fortune which may never come or fearing bad fortune which may never come either pray each of you for the holy spirit of god the spirit of rightdoing which is good fortune in itself good fortune in this world and in the world to come everlasting life  fear god and keep his commandments and all will be well  for who is the man who is master of his own luck  the psalmist tells us in psalm xv he that leadeth an uncorrupt life and doeth the thing which is right and speaketh the truth from his heart  he that backbiteth not with his tongue nor doeth evil to his neighbour nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour  in whose eyes a vile person is contemned but he honoureth them that fear the lord he that sweareth to his own hurt and changeth not  he that putteth not out his money to usury nor taketh reward against the innocent  whoso doeth these things shall never fall  and as long as you are doing those things you may rejoice freely and heartily in your youth believing that the smile of god who gave you the power of being happy is on your happiness and that your heavenly father no more grudges harmless pleasure to you than he grudges it to the gnat which dances in the sunbeam or the bird which sings upon the bough  for he is the fatherand what greater delight to a father than to see his children happy if only while they are happy they are good     xx  gods beautiful worlda spring sermon      bless the lord o my soul  o lord my god thou art very great thou    art clothed with honour and majesty  who coverest thyself with light    as with a garment who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain who    layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters who maketh the clouds    his chariot who walketh upon the wings of the windps civ 13  at this delicious season of the year when spring time is fast ripening into summer and every hedge and field and garden is full of life and growth full of beauty and fruitfulness and we look back on the long winter and the boughs which stood bare so drearily for six months as if in a dream the blessed spring with its green leaves and gay flowers and bright suns has put the winters frosts out of our thoughts and we seem to take instinctively to the warmth as if it were our natural elementas if we were intended like the bees and butterflies to live and work only in the summer days and not to pass as we do in this climate onethird of the year onethird of our whole lives in mist cold and gloom  now there is a meaning in all thisin our love of bright warm weather a very deep and blessed meaning in it  it is a sign to us where we come fromwhere god would have us go  a sign that we came from gods heaven of light and beauty that gods heaven of light and beauty is meant for us hereafter  that love which we have for spring is a sign that we are children of the everlasting spring children of the light and of the day in body and in soul if we would but claim our birthright  for you must remember that mankind came from a warm countrya country all of sunshine and joy  adam in the garden of eden was in no cold or severe climate he had no need of clothes not even of the trouble of tilling the ground  the bountiful earth gave him all he wanted  the trees over his head stretched out the luscious fruits to himthe shady glades were his only house the mossy banks his only bed  he was bred up the child of sunshine and joy  but he was not meant to stay there  god who brings good out of evil gave man a real blessing when he drove him out of the garden of eden  men were meant to fill the earth and to conquer it as they are doing at this day  they were meant to become hardy and industriousto be forced to use their hands and their heads to the utmost stretch to call out into practice all the powers which lay ready in them  they were meant in short according to the great law of gods world to be made perfect through sufferings and therefore it was gods kindness and not cruelty to our forefathers when he sent them out into the world and that he did not send them into any exceedingly hot country where they would have become utterly lazy and profligate like the negroes and the south sea islanders who have no need to work because the perpetual summer gives them their bread readymade to their hands  and it was a kindness too that god did not send our forefathers out into any exceedingly cold country like the greenlanders and the esquimaux where the perpetual winter would have made them greedy and stunted and stupid but that he sent us into this temperate climate where there is a continual change and variety of seasons  here first stern and wholesome winter then bright cheerful summer each bringing a message and a lesson from our loving father in heaven  first comes winter to make us hardy and daring and industrious and strips the trees and bares the fields and takes away all food from the earth and cries to us with the voice of its storms he that will not work neither shall he eat  go to the ant thou sluggard consider her ways and be wise who layeth up her meat in the summer and provideth her food against the time of frosts  and then comes summer with her flowers and her fruits and brings us her message from god and says to us poor slaving hardworn children of men you are not meant to freeze and toil and ache for ever  god loves to see you happy god is willing to feed your eyes with fair sights your bodies with pleasant food to cheer your hearts with warmth and sunshine as much as is good for you  he does not grieve willingly nor afflict the children of men  see the very bees and gnats how they dance and bask in the sunbeams  see the very sparrows how they choose their mates and build their nests and enjoy themselves as if they were children of the spring  and are not ye of more value than many sparrows you who can understand and enjoy the spring you men and women who can understand and enjoy gods fair earth ten thousand times more than those dumb creatures can  it is for you god has made the spring  it is for your sakes that christ the ruler of the earth sends light and fruitfulness and beauty over the world year by year  and why  not merely to warm and feed your bodies but to stir up your hearts with grateful love to him the blessed one and to teach you what you are to expect from him hereafter  ay my friends this is the message the spring and summer bring with themthey are signs and sacraments from god earnests of the everlasting springthe world of unfading beauty and perpetual happiness which is the proper home of man which god has prepared for those that love himthe world wherein there shall be no more curse neither sorrow nor sighing but the lord god and the lamb shall be the light thereof and the rivers of that world shall be waters of life and the trees of that world shall be for the healing of the nations and the children of the lord god shall see him face to face and be kings and priests to him for ever and ever therefore i say rejoice in spring time and in the sights and sounds and scents which spring time as a rule brings and remember once for all never lose an opportunity of seeing anything beautiful  beauty is gods handwritinggods image  it is a wayside sacrament a cup of blessing welcome it in every fair landscape every fair face every fair flower and drink it in with all your eyes and thank christ for it who is himself the wellspring of all beauty who giveth all things richly to enjoy  i think this 104th psalm is a fit and proper psalm to preach on in this sweet spring time for it speaks from beginning to end of gods earth and of his glory and love and wisdom which shines forth on this earth and though at first sight it may not seem to have much to do with christianity and with the great mystery of our redemption yet i believe and know that it has at bottom all and everything to do with it that this 104th psalm is as full of comfort and instruction for christian men as any other psalm in the whole bible  i believe that without feeling rightly and healthily about this psalm we shall not feel rightly or healthily about any other part of the bible either old or new testament  at all events gods inspired psalmist was not ashamed to write this psalm  gods spirit thought it worth while to teach him to write this psalm  gods providence thought it worth while to preserve this psalm for us in his holy bible and therefore i think it must be worth while for us to understand this psalm unless we pretend to be wiser than god  i have no fancy for picking and choosing out of the holy bible all scripture is given by inspiration of godall scripture is profitable for doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness and therefore this 104th psalm is profitable as well as the rest and especially profitable to be explained in a few sermons as i said before at this season when if we have any eyes to see with or hearts to feel with we ought to be wondering at and admiring gods glorious earth and saying with the old prophet in my text praise the lord o my soul  o lord my god thou art very great thou art clothed with honour and majesty  who coverest thyself with light as with a garment who stretchest out the heavens as with a curtain who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters who maketh the clouds his chariot who walketh upon the wings of the wind    o lord how manifold are thy works in wisdom hast thou made them all the earth is full of thy riches ps civ 1 2 3 24  first then consider those wonderful words of the text how god covers himself with light as it were with a garment  truly there is something most divine in light it seems an especial pattern and likeness of god the bible uses it so continually  light is a pattern of gods wisdom for light sees into everything searches through everything and light is a pattern of gods revelation for light shows us everything without light our eyes would be uselessand so without god our souls eyes would be useless  it is god who teaches us all we know  it is god who makes us understand all we understand  he opens the meaning of everything to us just as the light shews everything to us and as in the sunlight only we see the brightness and beauty of the earth so it is written in thy light o god we shall see light  thus light is gods garment  it shows him to us and yet it hides him from us  who could dare or bear to look on god if we saw him as he is face to face  our souls would be dazzled blind as our eyes are by the sun at noonday  but now light is a pattern to us of gods glory and therefore it is written that light is gods garment that god dwells in the light which no man can approach unto  as a wise old heathen nobly said light is the shadow of god and so as the text says he stretches out those glorious blue heavens above us as a curtain and shield to hide our eyes from his unutterable splendour and yet to lift our souls up to him  the vastness and the beauty of those heavens with all their countless stars each one a sun or a world in itself should teach us how small we are how great is our father who made all these  when we see a curtain and know that it bides something beautiful behind it our curiosity and wonder is awakened and we long all the more to see what is behind that curtain  so the glory of those skies ought to make us wonder and long all the more to see the god who made the skies  but again the psalmist says that god lays the beams of his chambers in the waters and makes the clouds his chariot and walks upon the wings of the wind that he makes his angels the storms and his ministers a flaming fire  you must not suppose that the psalmist had such a poor notion of the great infinite god as to fancy that he could be in any one place  god wants no chamberseven though they were built of the clouds arched with rainbows as wide as the whole vault of heaven  he wants no wind to carry himhe carries all things and moves all things in him they live and move and have their being  yet himthe heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain him  he is everywhere and no wherefor he is a spirit he is in all things and yet he is no thingfor he was before all things and in him all things consist  he is the absolute the uncreated the infinite the one and the all  and the old psalmist knew that as well as we do perhaps better  what then did he mean by these two last verses  he meant that in all those things god was presentthat the world was not like a machine a watch which god had wound up at the creation and started off to go of itself but that his spirit his providence were guiding everything even as at the first  that those mists and rain came from him and went where he sent them that those clouds carried his blessings to mankind that when the thunder shower bursts on one parish and leaves the next one dry it is because god will have it so that he brings the blessed purifying winds out of his treasures to sweeten and fatten the earth with the fresh breath of life which they have drunk up from the great atlantic seas and from the rich forests of americathat they blow whither he thinks best that clouds and rain wind and lightning are his fruitful messengers and his wholesome ministers fulfilling his word each according to their own laws but also each according to his especial providence who has given the whole earth to the children of men  this is the meaning of the psalmist that the weather is not a dead machine but a living wonderful work of the spirit of god the lord and giver of life  therefore we may dare to pray for fair and seasonable weather we may dare to pray against blight and tempesthumbly because we know not what is altogether good for usbut boldly and freely because we know that there is a living loving god governing the weather who does know what is good for us who has given us his only begotten son and will with him also give us all things  and so ends my first sermon on the 104th psalm     xxi  wonders of the sea or daily miracles      thou coverest the earth with the deep sea as with a garmentpsalm    civ 6  when we look at a map of the world one of the first things that strikes us as curious is how little dry land there is and how much sea  more than half the world covered with deep wild raging waste salt water  it seems very strange  of what use to man can all that sea be  and yet the scripture says that the whole earth has god given to the children of men and therefore he has given to us the sea which is part of the earth  but of what use is the sea to us  we are ready to say at first sight how much better if the world had been all dry land  there would have been so much more space for men to spread onso much more land to grow corn on  what is the use of all that sea  but when we look into the matter we shall find that every word of god stands true in every jot and tittle of itthat we ought to thank god for the sea as much as for the landthat david spoke truly when he said in this psalm civ that the great and wide sea also is full of gods riches  for in the first placewhat should we do without water  not only to drink but to feed all trees and crops which grow  those who live in a dry parish know well the need of water for the crops  in fact strange as it may seem out of water is made wood  you know perhaps that plants are made out of the salts in the soilbut not only out of saltsthey are made also out of water  every leaf and flower is made up only of those two thingssalts from the soil and water from the sky most wonderful  but so it is  water is made up of several very different things  the leaves and flowers when they drink up water keep certain parts of water and turn them into wood and the part of the water which they do not want is just the part which we do want namely fresh air for water is full of fresh air  and therefore the plants breathe out the fresh air through their leaves that we may breathe it into our lungs  more and more wonders you see as we go on  but where does all the rain water and spring water come from  from the clouds  and where do the clouds come from  from the sea  the sea water is drawn up by the suns heat evaporated as we call it into the air and makes mist and that mist grows together into clouds  and these clouds empty their blessed lifegiving treasures on the landto feed man and beast and herb  but what is it which governs these clouds and makes them do their appointed work  the psalmist tells us at thy rebuke they flee at the voice of thy thunder they are afraid  he gives the same account of it which wise men nowadays give  it is god he says and the providence of god which raises the clouds and makes them water the earth  and the means which he employs is thunder  now this is strictly true  we all know that thunder gathers the clouds together and brings rain but we do not all know that the power which makes the thunder which we call electricity is working all around us everywhere  it is only when it bursts out in flame and noise which we call lightning and thunder that we perceive itbut it is still there this wonderful thing called electricity for ever at workgiving the clouds their shape making them fly with vast weights of water through the sky and then making them pour down that water in rain  but there is another deep meaning in those words of the psalmists about thunder  he tells us that at the voice of gods thunder the waters are afraidthat he has set them their bounds which they shall not pass nor turn again to cover the earth  and it is true  also that it is this same thunder power which makes dry landfor there is thunder beneath us and lightning too in the bowels of the earth  those who live near burning mountains know this well  they see not only flames but real lightning real thunder playing about the burning mouths of the fiery mountainsthey hear the roaring the thundering of the firekingdom miles beneath their feet under the solid crust of the earth  and they see too whole hills ay whole counties sometimes heaved up many feet in a single night by this thunder under groundand islands thrown up in the midst of the seaso that where there was once deep water is now dry land  now in this very way strange as it may seem almost all dry land is made  this whole country of england once lay at the bottom of the sea you may now see shells and sea fishes bedded in high rocks and hill tops but it was all heaved up by the thunder which works under ground  there are places in england where i have seen the marks of the fire on the rocks and the solid stone crushed and twisted and melted by the vast force of the fire which thrust up the land from beneathand thus the land was heaved up from under the waters and the sea fled away and left its old bed dryfirm land and high cliffsand as the psalmist says at the voice of gods thunder the waters were afraid  thou hast set them their bounds which they shall not pass neither turn again to cover the earth  wonderful as all this may seem all learned men know that it is true  and this one thing at least it ought to teach us what a wonderful and almighty god we have to deal with whose hand made all these thingsand what a loving and merciful god who makes not only the wind and the sea and the thunder and the fire kingdoms obey him but makes their violence bring blessings to mankind  the fire kingdom heaves up dry land for men to dwell onthe thunder brings mellow rainsthe winds sweep the air clean and freshen all our breathand feed the plants with rich air drawn from far forests in america and from the wild raging seasthe sea sends up its continual treasures of raineverywhere are harmony and fitness beauty and use in all gods works  he has made nothing in vain all his works praise him and surely also his saints should give thanks to him  oh my friendsevery thunder showerevery fresh southwest breeze is a miracle of gods mercy if we could but see thoroughly into it  consider again another wonderful proof of gods goodness in what we call the tides of the sea  god has made the waters so that they can never stand stillthe sea is always moving  twice a day it rises and twice a day it sinks and ebbs again all along the shore  it would take too long to explain why this isbut it is enough to say that it must be so from the way in which god has made the earth and the water  so that it did not come from accident  god planned and intended it all when he made the sea at first  his allforeseeing love settled it all  now of what use are these tides  they keep the sea from rotting by keeping it in a perpetual stir  and the sea as it ebbs and flows draws the air after it and so keeps the air continually moving and blowing therefore continually fresh and continually carrying in it rich food for plants from one country to another  there are other reasons why the winds blow which i have not time to mention now but they all go to prove the same thinghow wisely and well the psalmist said praise the lord upon earth ye rivers and all deeps  fire and hail snow and vapour wind and storm fulfilling his word ps cxlviii  another use of the sea again is the vast quantity of food which it gives  labouring men who live inland have no notion of the wonderful fruitfulness of those seemingly barren wastes of water or how many millions of human beings live mostly on fish  when we consider those great banks of newfoundland where fish enough perhaps to feed all england are caught every season and sent over the whole world our own herring fisheries where thousands of millions of fish are caught yearlyand all the treasures of food and the creeping things innumerable both small and great beasts of which the psalmist speaks when we consider all this we shall begin to bless god for the sea as much as for the land  there go the ships too says the psalmist in this 104th psalm and there goeth that leviathan whom thou hast made to take his pastime therein  this leviathan is no doubt the whalethe largest of all living thingsoften a hundred feet long and as thick as a house  and yet even of him the monster of all monsters does gods word stand true that he has put all things under mans feet that all things are in subjection to manthe fish of the sea and whatsoever walketh through the paths of the sea  for even the great whale cannot stand before the cunning of mangod has taught man the means of killing even it and turning it to his own use  the whalebone which we use the oil which we burn in lamps comes from the bodies of those enormous creatures which wander in the far seas like floating houses ten thousand miles away  but again it is promised in the bible that in the new heavens and new earth there shall be no more sea  when the sea has done its work god will have done with itand then there will be no more division between nation and nationno more long dangerous voyages from one country to another  and strange to saythe sea is even now at work bringing about this very thingdestroying itselffilling itself up  day by day the sea eats away its own shore and banks and carries down their remains to make its own bed shallower and shallower till shoals and new lands arise where there was deep sea before  so that if the world lasts long enough the sea by its own laws will be filled up and dry land appear everywhere  the bottom of the sea is full too of countless millions of strange insectsand yet even in these strange insects there is use for not only do they give food to countless millions of fishes but after a time they turn into stone and form fruitful soil  there are now in many parts of the world great beds of rock and earth many feet thick and miles long made up entirely out of the skeletons and shells of little insects which lived at the bottom of the sea thousands of years ago  are not these things wonderful  well then remember who made these wonders who keeps them working  your fatherand the son of god and the spirit of god  the son of goday think of himhe by whom all things were madehe by whom all things consisthe to whom all power is given in heaven and earth  he came down and died on the cross for you he calls to you to come and serve him loyally and gratefullydare you refuse himthe maker and king of this glorious world  he died for you he loves you  he condescends to beseech you to come to him that you may have life  alas what can you expect if you will not come to him  how will you escape if you turn your back on your maker and despise your own creator when he stoops to entreat you  oh follyoh madnessoh utter shame and ruin  there are some people who do not like science and philosophy because they say if you try to explain to people and make them understand the wonderful things around them they will stop thinking them wonderful and so you will spoil their reverence and familiarity will breed contempt now no doubt a little learning is a dangerous thing when it makes some shallow conceited fellow fancy he knows all about everything  but i can truly say that the more you really do know about this earth the more your astonishment at it will growfor the more you understand about trees and animals clouds and seas the less you will find you understand about them  the more you read about them and watch them the more infinitely and inexpressibly wonderful you find them and the more you get humbled and awestruck at the boundless wisdom and love of our father in heaven and christ the word of god who planned and made this wondrous world and the holy spirit of god who is working this wondrous world  i tell you my friends that as st paul says if a man will be wise let him become a fool that he may be wise  let him go about feeling how shortsighted and stupid and ignorant he isand how infinitely wise christ the word of god is by whom all things were made to whom all belong  let him go about wondering day and night always astonished more and more as everything he sees gives him some fresh proof of the glory of god till he falls down on his knees and cries out with the psalmist lord what is man that thou art mindful of him or the son of man that thou so regardest him  when i consider thy heavens even the work of thine hands i say what is man and yet thou madest man to have dominion over the works of thine hands and hast put all things in subjection under his feetthe fowl of the air and the fishes of the sea and whatsoever walketh through the paths of the seas o lord our governor how excellent is thy name in all the world  in comparison of thee what is mans wisdom  what is mans power  thou alone art glorious for by thee are all things and for thee they were made and are created that thou mightest rejoice in the works of thy own hands and bless the creatures which thy love has made     xxii  the sailors god  preached to sailors at a little fishing village in cornwall 1843      they that go down to the sea in ships and occupy their business in    great waters these men see the works of the lord and his wonders in    the deepps cvii 23 24  my brothersfor though i do not know most of you even by name yet you are still my brothers for his sake in whose name you were baptizedmy brothers it has been often said that seamen and fishermen ought to be the most religious men in the country  and why  because they more than any set of men see the works of the lord and his wonders in the deep  the cottonspinner who is shut up in a factory all day long with nothing before his eyes but his loom and nothing to look at beyond his own house but dingy streets and smoking furnace chimneyshe poor man sees very little of the works of the lord  man made the world of streets and shops and machinery in which that poor workman lives and dies  what wonder is it if he forgets the god who made himthe god who made the round world and set it so fast that it should not be moved and has given the sea its bounds that it should not overflow them at any time  how much better off are you seamen than such a man as that  and you are better off too even than most field labourers and farmers they are not shut up in towns it is true they have gods beautiful earth to till and keep but they are too safe on shore  yes it may seem a strange thing to say but you ought to thank god that your trade is a dangerous oneyou have more to put you in mind of god than the labouring man  and why  in the first place as i said fishermen and sailors see more of the wonderful works of god than any other set of men  man may cut and change the earthmining and quarrying and buildingtill it hardly looks like gods earth but he cannot change the sea  there it is just as god made it at first  millions of rivers have run into it yet it is not over full cliffs have been wearing away and falling into it for six thousand years yet is it not filled up  millions of vessels have been sailing over it yet they have left no mark upon it it seems unchangeable like god who made it  what is the use of my praising the sea to you  do you not all know it and fear it and love it too and does it not put you in mind of god who made it who made that mighty water for the use of men and filled it with thousands of different kinds of fishes and weeds and wonderful things for your use and comfort and who has made it so strong that it shall keep you always in awe and fear and watchfulness looking to god to save youand yet so gentle and calm that you can sail upon its bosom and there find food for your families which of you who has any godly heart in him can help feeling sometimes at least when at sea that he is seeing the wonderful works of god  i said that you ought to thank god that your trade was a dangerous one and i said that the sea should always keep you in fear and watchfulness and looking to god to preserve you  now do you not see how these two sayings go together and make each other plain  you seamen and fishermen are in continual danger your lives are in your hands every momentthe belaying of a sheet the strength of a bit of canvas the toughness of a deal board may settle your fate in a moment and make all the difference between life and death  if they are sound you may go back to a happy home and see wife and children coming to meet you when you run on shore at morning from your honest labour and if they failif that weak cordage and these planks and thinner canvas on which your lives depend do but give way what is left for you the next moment what but a grave in the deep deep sea and your wives widows and your children orphans and your bodies devoured by ugly creeping things and your souls gonegone where  my good menyou who sit around me now so strong and full of life and skill and happinesswhere would your souls be if you were drowned at sea tomorrow  what a question  oh ask it yourselves honestly  i have been out in gales myself and i cannot understand how you can go out in thirty feet of timber upon that mighty sea with the wind howling over your heads like a deathbell and the great hungry waves chasing you for miles each one able and willing to swallow you up into the deep and the gulls screaming over you as if they were waiting to feed upon your floating carcases and you alone in a tiny boat upon that waste howling wilderness of watersi cannot understand i say how when a man is in such a case as that day after day year after year he can forget his god the only friend who can save him from the sea the only friend who can send him safe out to his work in the evening and bring him home safe to his wife at morning  one would think that when you went down to the shore in the morning you would say oh god without whose help i am no stronger than a piece of seaweed floating up and down take care of me take care of my wife and my children and forgive me my sins and do not punish me by calling me away this night to answer for them all  and when you come home at night you would say oh god who hast kept me safe all this day what can i do to show how thankful i am to thee  ay what can you do to show how thankful you are to god for his care  what ought you to do to show your thankfulness to him  what must you do to show your thankfulness to him  he has told you  if you love me he says keep my commandments  do justly love mercy and walk humbly with thy god  these my friends are the holy and thankful thoughts which ought to be in your hearts every day and hour  this is the thought which god meant to put into your hearts when he made sailors of you and brought you into the world by the seaside to take up your business in great waters  you might have been born in bristol or liverpool or london and never seen anything but streets and houses and mans clumsy work  but god has been very good to you  he has brought you up here in this happy west country where you may see his wonderful works day and night where you ought never to forget that you have a father in heaven who made the sea and who keeps you safe at sea by night and day  god has given you a great deal  he has given you two books to readthe book of gods word the bible and the book of gods earth the sky and sea and land which is above you and below you and around you day and night  if you can read and understand them properly you will find in them everything which you want you may learn from them to be holy in this world and happy in the next  god has given you too fathers mothers wives children a comfortable home a holy tradethe same which the apostles followed  god has given you england for your country and the west countrythe best place in england for your home  god has given you a good queen and good magistrates and landlords  god has given you health and strength and seamanship and clear heads and stout hearts  and god has made you seamen and fishermen and given you a business in which you can see gods mighty power and wisdom day and night and feel him taking care of you when you cannot take care of yourselves  therefore you ought to thank god that yours is a dangerous business because it teaches you to trust in god alone for safety  and what are you to give him in return  what does god require of you  you cannot pay him back again for all his mercies for they are past counting but you must pay him back all you can  and what must you pay him back  first you must trust in god for he who comes to god and wishes to walk with god through life as a good man should must believe that there is a god and that he will reward those who look to him  i never heard of a sailor who did not believe in god for how can a man look at the sea and not say to himself god made the sea  but i have seen a great many sailors who did not trust in god  as long as it is fine weather and everything goes right they will forget god and fancy that it is their own seamanship and not god alone which keeps their boats afloat and their own skill in fishing and not god alone which sends the shoals of fish into their nets and so they are truly fineweather sailorsmen who are only fit for calm seas and light breezes when they can take care of themselves without gods help but when a squall comes their hearts change by gods mercy  for when a man has done all he can to save himself and all he can do is no use and his nets are adrift and his boat on her beam ends and the foaming rocks are on his lee then he comes to his senses at last and prays  why did he not pray before  why did he not save himself from all that misery and trouble and danger by thanking god for taking care of him and praying to god to take care of him still  foolish men are plagued for their offences and because of their wickedness  they that go down to the sea in ships and occupy their business on great waters these men see the works of the lord and his wonders in the deep for at his word the stormy wind ariseth which lifteth up the waves thereof they are carried up to heaven and down again into the deep their soul melteth away because of the trouble they reel to and fro and stagger like a drunken man and are at their wits end  and justly they are punished for forgetting god  god made the calm as well as the storm  could they not remember that  but look at gods mercy for when they cry unto the lord in their trouble he delivers them out of all their distress  for he makes the storm to cease so that the waves are still then are they glad because they are at rest and so god brings them to the harbour where they would be  is there an old man sitting here who has not had this happen to him  and what did you do my friend when god had saved you out of that danger it is easy to tell what you ought to have done you ought to have gone home and fallen on your knees and prayed to god you ought to have said oh lord i am a miserable foolish sinner who can only remember thee when thou art angry an ungrateful son who only thinks of his father when he beats him  oh god forgive me i ought to have trusted in thee before  i deserved all my danger and punishment and more  i did not deserve to be pardoned and saved from it  i deserve to be at the bottom of the sea at this moment  but forgive me forgive me loving and merciful father for the sake of thy dear son jesus christ who died on the cross that i might be saved from death  and when you had prayed thus the next thing you ought to have asked yourself waswhat does god require of me how can i try to pay him backhow can i show that i am thankful  my good friends what does god require of you  to do justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your god  i told you he required of you first to trust in him at all hours in all weathers  this is the next thing which he requires of youto do justly to cheat no man not in the price of a pilchard to love mercy to love your neighbours as christ loved you to help your neighbours as christ helped you and all mankind by dying to save you and as christ has helped you night after night when you might have been buried in the waves if christ had not prayed for you that you might have time to repent and bring forth fruits fit for repentance  to love mercy to forgive every man who hurts you for they are all christian men and your brothers  christ loved every one  why should not you  if your wife or friend loved anything you would be kind to it for their sakes and so if you really love god and are thankful to him for all his mercy and kindness you will love every man you meet for gods sake who loved them and gave his son for them  to walk humbly with your god  that is the beginning and end of allyou must be humble you must confess that you are foolish and god alone is wise that you are weak and god alone is strong that you are poor fishermen whom any squall may drown and that god is the great loving almighty god who made heaven and earth and the sea and all that is therein and who helps all those who put their trust in him  this is what god asks you to do in return for all he has done for you  to pray to him to praise him to put your trust in him to keep his commandments like thankful humble obedient loving children  they who do these things and only they shall never fail  by night and day in summer and winter in storm and calm in health and sickness in richness and poverty god will be with them  christ will be with them  he sat in a fishermans boat once on the sea of tiberias and he will sit in your boats if you will but ask him  he will steer you he will save you he will take care of your wives and children when you are far away and he will bring you through the troublesome waves of this mortal life so that having faith for your anchor and hope for your sail and charity for your crew you may at last land on the happy shore of everlasting life there to live with god world without end  god grant it may be so  my good brothersfor i am a christian like you and an englishman like you and a west countryman like youi thank our father in heaven that he has brought me from the other end of england and put this message into my mouth to remind you of who you arethat you are the men who see the works of the lord and his wonders in the deep and that god will say to every one of you at the day of judgmenti taught you all this i gave you all this i did all this for you what have you done for me in return  go homeread over these verses in 107th psalm and think over what i have said  do it tonight for the weather has broken upthere are gales coming  which of you can say that he will be alive next sunday     xxiii  the good soldier of jesus christ      thou therefore endure hardship as a good soldier of jesus christ2    timothy ii 3  suppose a young man went of his own will for a soldier was regularly sworn in to serve the queen took his bounty wore the queens uniform ate her bread learnt his drill and all that a soldier need learn as long as peace lasted  but suppose that as soon as war came and his regiment was ordered on active service he deserted at once and went off and hid himself  what should you call such a man  you would call him a base and ungrateful coward and you would have no pity on him if he was taken and justly punished  but suppose that he did a worse thing still  suppose that the enemy the russians say invaded england and the army was called out to fight them and suppose this man of whom i speak be he soldier or sailor instead of fighting the enemy deserted over to them and fought on their side against his own country and his own comrades and his own father and brothers what would you call that man  no name would be bad enough for him  if he was taken he would be hanged without mercy as not only a deserter but a traitor  and who would pity him or say that he had not got his just deserts  now for gods sake and your own sakes consider  are not all young people when they are old enough to choose between right and wrong if they choose what is wrong and live bad lives instead of good ones very like this same deserter and traitor  for are you not all christs soldiers every one of you  did not christ enlist every one of you into his army that as the baptism service says you might fight manfully under his banner against sin the world and the devilin one word against all that is wrong and bad  and now when you are old enough to know that you are christs soldiers what will you deserve to be called if instead of fighting on christs side against what is good you forget you are in his service  what are you but deserters from christs banner and army traitors to christs cause  but some may say my case is not like that soldiers  i did not enter christs service of my own free will  my parents put me into it when i was an infant without asking my leave  i was not christened of my own will  my parents had me christened before i knew any thing about it  i had no choice  is it so  do you know what your words mean  if they mean anything they mean that you had rather not have been christened because you are now expected to behave as a christened man should  now is there any one of you who dare say i wish i had not been christened  not one  then if you dare not say that if you are content to have been christened why are you not content to do what christened people should if you are content to have been christened you are christened people now of your own free will and are bound to act accordingly  but why were you christened not merely because your parents chose but because it was their duty  every child ought to be christened because every child belongs to christ  every child is in debt to christevery child is bound to serve christ  in debt to christ you say  certainly from the moment you are born and before that too  you are in debt to him since you were born for every good thought and feeling which ever came into your hearts and minds for he put them there  and will any of you answer then i wish he had not put them there if they are to bring me into debt to him and force me to serve him  i dont wish of course that i had been bad but i wish that i had been neither good nor bad  i wish i had had no immortal soul which is bound to serve christ  now does any man of you wish that really  dare any of you wish that you were like the beasts without conscience without honour without shame without knowing right from wrong without any life after death without being able even to talkfor mind without immortal souls men could not speak  the beasts cannot talk to each other reasonable speech belongs to our souls not to our bodies  then if you are glad that you have souls and are better than the dumb beasts you confess that you feel in debt to christ and are bound to serve him  for who gave you your souls but christ  but even if you had had no souls you would have been in debt to christ and bound to serve him  what for you ask  why for life itself  how did you come here  who gave you life  who brought you into the world who but christ by whom all things were made and you among the rest  who gave you food  who made every atom of food grow which you ate since you were born  who made the air you breathe the water which you drink the wool and cotton which clothes you  who but christ  do you not know that you cannot even breathe a breath of air unless christ first makes the air and then gives your lungs life to breathe the air and yet you cannot understand that you are in debt to christ and have been eating his bread and living on his bounty ever since you were born  and mind all this while i have not said one word about the greatest debt of all which you owe to the lord jesus christ even his own life which he gave for you  only think but once that for your sakes the lord was crucifiedfor your sakes he died the most horrible painful shameful death  and then say are you not in debt to him  greater love has no man than this that he lay down his life for his friends  if any mere man had died for your sake would you not love himwould you not feel yourself in debt to him a deeper debt than you can ever repay  then christ died for youhow can you be more deeply in debt to any one than to him  you have now no right to choose between christ and the devil because christ has chosen you alreadyno right to choose between good and bad because god the good god himself has chosen you already and has been taking care of you and heaping you with blessings ever since you were born  and why did christ choose you  as i have told you that you may fight with him against all that is bad  jesus christs work at which he works for ever in heaven and in earth is to root out all that is bad all sin all misery and he will reign and he will fight till all his enemies even death itself are put under his feet and destroyed  and christ expects you and me to help him  he has chosen you and me and all christian people to fight against what is bad and to put it down and root it out as far as we can wherever we find it and therefore first to root it out of our own hearts and lives for while we are bad ourselves we cannot make others good  but if we go on doing bad and wrong things are we fighting on christs side  no we are fighting on the devils side and helping the devil against god  do you fancy that i am saying too much  i suspect some do  i suspect some say in their hearts he is too hard on us  we are not like that traitorous soldier  if an english soldier went over to the enemy and fought against the english and killed englishmen that of course would be too bad but we do not wish to harm any one much less our neighbours if we do wrong it is ourselves at most that we harm  if we do wrong it is only we that shall suffer for it  why does he talk as if we were robbers or murderers or had a spite against our neighbours  we do not wish to hurt any one we do not want to help the devil  now my friends if any of you say that do you not say first what is not true and next do you not know that it is not true  first it is not true that by doing wrong you hurt no one but yourself every wrong thing which any man does every wrong way into which he runs is certain sooner or later to hurt his neighbours  the worse man a man is the worse for those who have to do with him  you know it is your own case  you know that bad people hurt you and make you unhappy and that good people do you good and make you happy  you know that bad example does you harm and good example does you good  think for yourselvesuse your own common sense  recollect what you know what has happened to you again and again  you know that if any one uses bad language before you you are tempted to use bad language too  if any one quarrels with you you are tempted to quarrel with him  you know that if parents do wrong things before their children the children learn to copy them  it is nonsense to talk of a man keeping his sins to himself  no man does and no man can  out of the abundance of a mans heart his mouth speaks and a bad tree will bring forth bad fruit  if there are bad thoughts in your head they will come out in bad words  if there are bad tempers in your heart they will come out in bad and unkind and dishonest actions  you may as well try to keep in fire as to keep in sin  it will break out and it will burn whatever it touches  and if you or i or any one does wrong in any thing we shall surely hurt some one or other by it  if you or i or any one is worse than he ought to be we shall make the parish we live in worse than it ought to be  you know that it is so  who made you different from the rest of the world  if any body elses sins are harmful who will make your sins harmless  not the devil for he wishes to see as much harm done as possible  and not god for he will not be so cruel as to let your sin prosper and go unpunished as it would if it did not make people hate it by feeling the bad effects of it  my good friends if you by doing wrong hurt other people and make other people unhappy are you doing christs work or the devils  are you fighting for christ who wishes to make all good or for the devil who wishes to make all bad  are you christs faithful soldier and servant or are you a traitor to christ who has gone over to the devils side and is helping the devil to make this poor world which is bad enough already worse than it is  oh think of this now while you have time before you  remember all that christ has done for you and remember that all he asks of you in return is to do for him nothing but good which is good for you as well as for your neighbours  the devils wages now are shame discontent unhappiness perhaps poverty perhaps sickness certainly punishment as traitors to christ after we die  christs wages are love joy peace the answer of a good conscience the respect and love of all good men as long as we live and after death life everlasting  choose will you be traitors or deserters and serve the worst of all masters the king of hell or be honest honourable and brave men and serve the best of all masters the king of heaven the lord of life and love and goodness without bound whose ways are ways of pleasantness and all his paths are peace     xxiv  holy communion christ and the sinner      have mercy upon me o god according to thy lovingkindness    according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my    transgressions  wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity and cleanse me    from my sin  for i acknowledge my transgressions and my sin is ever    before me  the sacrifices of god are a broken spirit a broken and a    contrite heart o god thou wilt not despisepsalm li 1 2 3 17  this psalm was written by david when he was sorrowing for sin and if there are any such among you my dear friends let me speak a few words to you  would to god that i had the tongue of st paul to speak to you withthough even when he preached some mocked as it will be to the end but if to one of you god has brought home his truth then to that one consciencestricken sinner i will say you confess with david that all your sorrows are your own fault  thank god that he has taught you so much  but what will you do to be saved from your sins  i cannot wait you say in your heart to go home and begin leading a new life  i will do that please god but i want to know at once that i am forgiven  i want to be saved  i cannot save myself  i cannot save myself from hell hereafter or from this miserable sinful life nearly as bad as hell here  oh wretched being that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death  friend dost thou not know it is written believe in the lord jesus christ and thou shalt be saved  ah yes says the sinner i have been hearing that all my life and much good it has done me  look at me i want something more than those words about christ i want christ himself to save me if he can  ah my brotherpoor sinner thou hast never believed in christ thou hast only believed about christ  there was the fault  but christ himself will save thee though thou hast been the worst of reprobates he will save thee  only one thing he will have thee answer first  dost thou wish to be saved from the punishment of thy sins or from the sins themselves  from my sinsfrom my sins says the man who truly repents  they are what i hate even while i commit them  i hate and despise myself i dare look neither god nor man in the face and yet i go on doing the very things i loathe the next minute  oh for some one to save me from my own illtemper my own bitter tongue my own laziness my own canting habits my own dishonesty my own lustfulness  but who will save me from them who will change me and make a new creature of me  oh for a sign from heaven that i can get rid of these bad habits  i hate them and yet i love them  i long to give them up and yet if some one stronger than me does not have mercy on me i shall go and do them again tomorrow  i am longing to do wrong now and yet i long not to do wrong  oh for a sign from heaven  poor sinnermy brother there is a sign from heaven for thee  on that table it stands  a sign that christs blood was shed to wash out thy sins a sign that christs blood will feed thee and give thy spirit strength to cast away and hate thy sins  come to holy communion and claim thy share in christs pardon for the past in christs strength for the future  what says the sinner i come to the sacrament  i of all men the most unfit  i who but yesterday committed such and such sins  friend as to the sin you committed yesterday confess that to god not me  and if you confess it to him he is faithful and just to forgive it but just because you think yourself the most unfit person to come to the holy sacrament for that very reason i suspect you to be fit  how then says he in his heart i have but this moment repented of my sins  i have but this moment for the first time felt that gods wrath is revealed against me that hell is open for me  for that very reason come to the holy sacrament and thou shalt hear there that not hell at all but heaven is open for thee  what with all this guilty conscience this load of sins against myself my neighbours my children my masters my servants on my back  yes bring them all and say in the words of the communion service i do earnestly repent and am heartily sorry for these my misdoings the remembrance of them is grievous unto me the burden of them is intolerable  why for whom were these words written but for you who feel that the burden of your sins is intolerable  they are there not for those who feel no burden of sin but for youfor you and for those like you who feel the burden of your sins unbearable  but how shall i dare to come to the lords table before i am sure that my sins are forgiven  come and you will hear your minister pray god to pardon and deliver you from all for christs sake  you will hear him read gods promises of free grace and mercy through jesus christ to all who truly repent  but i cannot trust your prayers or words or any mans  i want a sign that i have a share in christs death and merits  then that bread and wine is a sign  jesus himself ordained them for a sign  he himself with his dying voice declared that that bread was his body that cup the new covenant in his blood  st paul declares that it is the communion the sharing of christs body that cup the sharing of his blood  what more sign do you want  come and claim your share in christ and see if he disappoints you  ah  i believe says the poor man i believe but i am afraid afraid of partaking unworthily and so provoking god as the prayerbook says to plague me with divers diseases and sundry kinds of death  my friend if god was the devil you might be afraid indeed  but he is the loving righteous father who knows your weakness and remembers that you are but dust  can you not trust him to pardon your mistakes about the sacrament which you do not wilfully intend to commit when he has borne with and pardoned all the sins from your youth up until now which you have wilfully committed  surely you may trust him in such a thing as thishe who has had longsuffering enough to keep you alive with a chance of salvation all this time and as for sundry diseases have you avoided them  you have certainly not avoided them at least by staying away from the sacrament and breaking christs command to take it  if you are so afraid of gods anger are you more likely to provoke him by disobeying his strict commands or by obeying them  it needs no philosopher my friend to find out that  but i shall have to make good resolutions says the sinner and i am afraid of breaking them  well if you break them you can but make them again  you would call him a fool who determined never to walk because he was afraid of falling but you are to claim in that sacrament your share of christs spirit christs life and christs strength which is just what you want to enable you to keep your good resolutions  you will be no stronger no more righteous of yourself after the sacrament than before  your spirit will still be a poor weak sinful spirit but you will have claimed your share in gods strength gods righteousness gods spirit and they will make you love the good you hated and hate the evil you loved  they will make you strong to do gods will whatever it may cost you  oh believe the good news and show that you believe by coming to christ  he the blessed one died for you  for you he was born and walked this earth a poor suffering tempted sorrowstricken man  for you he hung upon the shameful cross  for you he ascended up on high  for you he sent down his spirit  for you he sits at the right hand of god praying for you at this moment  for you he gave the signs of his body and his blood that you might believe and fall on your knees and cry in spite of all i am forgiven  in spite of all god cares for me  in spite of all i have a father and a saviour who will never leave me nor forsake me wretch as i have been till they make a man of me again in this world and for ever  oh come my dear dear friends  i would give my right hand this moment if i could but see each and every one of you shewing the truth of your repentance by coming to holy communion  let this be a day of repentance and shew it thus and say we do not come to this thy table o lord trusting in our own righteousness but in thy manifold and great mercy  we are not worthy to gather up the crumbs under thy table but thou art the same lord whose property is always to have mercy  let this be a day of thanksgiving too and shew your thankfulness by coming to holy communion and lifting up your voices once for all at that table and saying  we bless thee we praise thee we glorify thee we give thanks to thee for thy great glory  these are the words for you this day  oh do not turn away  all your distress all your sorrows have come from your not having faith in god  break at once the accursed charm with which the devil has enchanted you  have faith enough to come to gods holy table and see if god does not reward you by giving you faith enough to conquer yourselves and lead new lives like redeemed men in the sunshine of his smile henceforth and forever  my friends what more can i say except once and again come ye who labour and are heavy laden and christ will give you rest  ay and he will  i speak only what i knowwhat i have felt  but before he will give you rest be you rich or poor young or old you must learn to say those simple words they are the best and only preparation for it god be merciful to me a sinner  say them then from your heart and so come to the lords supper   a prayer   o god and saviour thou hast blest me and i have cursed myself  thou didst die to deliver me from the curse of sin and i have brought it back on myself by my own folly  thou livest for ever to make me good and i ungrateful and foolish have made myself bad  in spite of my ingratitude in spite of my folly take me back into thy service  i trust utterly in thy unchangeable goodness and mercy  i trust that thy blood will still wash away the past that thy spirit will still give me a clean heart and a right spirit  i believe that though i have cursed myself yet thou wilt still bless me for thou wiliest nought but the good of every creature thou hast made  god be merciful to me a sinner amen     part ii   i  brave words for brave soldiers and sailors 199   my friendsi speak to you simply as brave men  i speak alike to roman catholic and protestant  i speak alike to godly men and ungodly  i speak alike to soldiers and sailors    if you are brave read these words  i call these brave words  they are not my own words or my own message but the message to you of the bravest man who ever lived or who ever will live and if you will read them and think over them he will not make you brave for that thank god you are already but keep you brave come victory or defeat  i speak to the brave men who have now fought three bloody battles and fought them like heroes  all england has blessed you and admired you all england has felt for you in a way that would do your hearts good to see  for you know as well as i that nothing is so comforting nothing so endearing as sympathy as to know that people feel for one  if one knows that one can dare and do anything  if one feels that nobody cares for ones suffering or ones success one is ready to lie down and die  it is so with a horse or a dog even  if there is any noble spirit in them a word of encouragement will make them go till they drop  how much more will the spirit of a man  i can well believe that the queens beautiful letter put more heart into you than the hope of all the prize money in the world would have done and that with the words of that letter ringing in your ears you will prove true to the last to the words of the grand old song     hearts of oak are our ships hearts of oak are our men    and well fight and well conquer again and again  but my friends you know as well as i that there are times when neither that letter nor the feeling of duty nor of honour nor of glory can keep your hearts from sinking  not in battle  no  only cowards hearts fail them there and there are no cowards among you  but even a brave mans heart may fail him at whiles when instead of the enemys balls and bayonets he has to face delay and disappointment and fatigue and sickness and hunger and cold and nakedness as you have my brave brothers and faced them as well as man ever did on earth  ah it must be fearful work to sit still and shiver and starve in a foreign land and to think of those who are in comfort and plenty at home and worse to think of those who even if they are in plenty cannot be in comfort because their hearts are breaking for your sake to think of brother and sister wife and child while you are pacing up and down those dreary trenches waiting for your turn of sickness perhaps of death  it must be bitter and disheartening at times you would not be men if it was not  one minute perhaps you remember that those whom you have left at home love you and pray for you and that cheers you then you remember that all england loves you and prays for you in every church throughout the land and that cheers you but even that is not enough you feel ready to say what is the use of my going through all this misery  why am i not at home ploughing the ground or keeping a shop anything rather than throwing away my life by inches thus  my people at home feel for me but they cannot know they never will know the half of what i have gone through  the nation will provide for me if i am crippled but they cannot make up to me for losing the best years of my life in such work as this and if i am killed can they make up to me for that  who can make up to me for my life  have you not had such thoughts my friends and sadder thoughts still lately  you need not be ashamed of them if you have  for hard work you have had and it must have told at times on your spirits as heavily as it has on your bodies  but my friends there is an answer for these sad thoughts  there are brave words for you and a noble message from god which will cheer you when nothing else can cheer you  if your own people cannot know all that you go through there is one who can and does if your own wives and mothers cannot feel enough for you there is one above who does and he is the lord jesus christ  you have hungered so has he  you have been weary so has he  you have felt cold and nakedness so has he  you have been houseless and sleepless so has he  while the foxes had holes and the birds of the air had nests he the maker of them all had not where to lay his head  you have felt the misery of loneliness and desolation but never so much as did he when not only every earthly friend forsook him and fled but he cried out in his very death pangs my god my god why hast thou forsaken me  above all you have felt how difficult it was to die not fighting sword in hand but slowly and idly and helplessly by cholera or fever hunger or cold  terrible it is but the lord jesus christ has felt that too for three years he looked death in the facea death of shame and misery such as you can never dieand faced it and gave himself up to it of his own free will and though he had the most horrible fear of it to the very last he determined to submit to it in spite of his own fear of it and he did submit to it and died and so showed even in his very fear the most perfect and glorious courage  so if any one of you has ever felt for a single moment afraid even in that the lord jesus christ can feel for you for he too has gone through the agony of fear when his sweat was as great drops of blood falling to the ground that he might be able to help you and every man that is tempted because he can be touched with the feeling of your infirmities having gone through every temptation which flesh is heir to and conquered them all  this then is one half and only one half of my good news that you have a friend in heaven who feels for every trouble of yours better than your own mothers can feel for you because he has been through it all already you have a friend in heaven who is praying for you day and night more earnestly lovingly wisely than your own wives and children are praying for you  but that is not all  god forbid  you have a friend in heaven for whose sake god will forgive you all your sins and weaknesses as often as you heartily confess them to him and trust in him for a full and free pardon  you have a friend in heaven who will help you day by day where you most need help in your hearts and spirits who will give you if you ask him his spirit the same spirit of duty courage endurance love selfsacrifice which made him brave to endure ten thousand times more than any soldier or sailor can endure for the sake of doing his fathers will and saving a ruined world  oh open your hearts to him my brave men in your lonely nightwatcheson your sick beds ay in the very roar of battle itself ask him to make you true and good patient calm prudent honourable obedient gentle even in the hottest of the fight  commit to him your own lives and fortunes and the lives and fortunes of those who have been left at home and be sure that he your unseen friend of friends is able and willing to help to the uttermost all that you put into his charge  but again my men if the nation cannot reward you for sacrificing your life in a just war there is one above who can and who will too for he is as just as he is loving and as loving as he is just and that is the same of whom i have spoken already the lord jesus christ  i think some of you will fancy this almost too good news to be true and yet the very news which you want to hear  i think some of you have been saying as you read this all this is blessed and comforting news for poor fellows lying wounded in a hospital or fretting their souls away about the wives and children they have left behind blessed and comforting news but we want something more than that even  we have to fight and to kill we want to be sure that gods blessing is on our fighting and our killing we have to go into battle and we want to know that there too we are doing gods work and to be sure that god is on our side  well my brave men be sure of it then  be sure that gods blessing is as much upon you be sure that you are doing gods work as much when you are handling a musket or laying a gun in your countrys battles as when you are bearing frost and hunger in the trenches and pain and weakness on a sick bed  for the lord jesus christ is not only the prince of peace he is the prince of war too  he is the lord of hosts the god of armies and whosoever fights in a just war against tyrants and oppressors he is fighting on christs side and christ is fighting on his side christ is his captain and his leader and he can be in no better service  be sure of it for the bible tells you so  the old wars of abraham against the robberkings of joshua against the canaanites of david against the philistines of hezekiah against the assyrians of the maccabees against the greeksall tell the soldier the same brave news that he is doing gods work and that gods blessing is on him when he fights in a just cause  and you are fighting in a just cause if you are fighting for freedom and law  if to you god gives the noble work of fighting for the liberty of europe god will reward you according as you do that work like men  you will be fighting in that everlasting war which is in heaven in gods everlasting war against all injustice and wrong the captain and leader whereof is the lord jesus christ himself  believe thatfor the bible tells it you  you must think of the lord jesus christ not merely as a sufferer but as a warrior not merely as the man of sorrows blessed as that thought is but as the lord of hoststhe god of armiesthe king who executes justice and judgment in the earth who has sworn vengeance against all unrighteousness and wrong and will destroy the wicked with the breath of his mouth  you must think of him as the god of the fatherless and the widow but you must think of him too as the god of the sailor and the soldier the god of duty the god of justice the god of vengeance the god to whom your colours were solemnly offered and his blessing on them prayed for when they were given to your regiment  i know that you would follow those colours into the mouth of the pit that you would die twice over sooner than let them be taken  good but remember too that those colours are a sign to you that christ is with you ready to give you courage coolness and right judgment in the charge and in the death grapple just as much as he is with those ministering angels who will nurse and tend your wounds in hospital  gods blessing is on them but do you never forget that your colours are a sign to you that christs blessing is on you  if they do not mean that to you what was the use of blessing them with prayer  it must have been a lie and a sham  but it is no lie brave men and no sham it is a glorious truth of which those noble rags inscribed with noble names of victory should remind you every day and every hour that he who fights for queen and country in a just cause is fighting not only in the queens army but in christs army and that he shall in no wise lose his reward  are not these brave words for brave soldiers  well they are not mine they are the bibles  the book of revelation tells us how st john saw a vision of the lord jesus christ and of his everlasting war against wrong of which i spoke just now  and what did the lord appear like  and i saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him is called faithful and true and in righteousness he doth judge and make war  and his eyes were as a flame of fire and he was clothed in a garment dipped in blood and his name is called the word of god  and the armies in heaven followed him riding upon white horses clothed in fine linen white and clean  and out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword that he should smite the nations and he shall rule them with a rod of iron and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and of the wrath of almighty god rev xix 11  are not these brave words my friends  are not these soldierlike words is not this a general worth following  is not this a charge of cavalry worth sharing in  then believe that that general the lord jesus christ is your general  believe that you are sharing in that everlasting charge to which the glorious charge of balaclava was as nothing the everlasting war which the lord jesus wages against all sin and cruelty and wrongin which he will never draw bridlerein or sheath his sword till he has put all enemies under his feet and swept all oppression injustice and wickedness off the face of the earth which god has given him  therefore i can say to you other brave words my friends and not my own but the words of the same lord jesus christfear not them that can kill the body and after that have no more that they can do  but i will forewarn you whom you shall fear fear him who after he has killed has power to destroy both body and soul in hell  now all england knows already that you do not fear those who can kill the body but i sometimes fear that some of you are not enough afraid of that enemy worst of all who can kill the soul too  and who is that  st paul tells us  he is the devil who has the power of death who lies in ambuscade to destroy your body and soul in hell and will and can do it but only if you let him  now who is the devil  it is worth your while to know for many a man may be as you are in the ranks of gods army and yet doing the devils work all the while  many a man may fancy himself a good soldier and forget that a soldier is a man and something more and that therefore before you can be a good soldier you must first be more or less of a good man  do you think not  look then and see whether the most upright and godfearing men in your ranks are not in the long run the best soldiers  i dont mean merely the best fightersthe bravest men in battle  there goes more than mere bull dog pluck to the making of a soldier and to make a good soldier i hold that a man though he be afraid of nothing else must be horribly afraid of the devil and that the better and braver soldier he is the more afraid of the devil he will be  of course that depends upon who the devil is  i will tell you  he is what his name means the accuser and the dividerthe evil spirit who sets men against each othermen against officers and officers against men who sets men grumbling puts hard suspicious thoughts into their minds makes them selfish and forgetful of their duty tempts them to care only for themselves and help themselves  you must see that if those tempers once got head in an army there would be an end of all disciplineof all obedience and what is more of all courage for if the devil could completely persuade every man to care only for himself the plain thing for every man to do would be to turn round and run for his life  that you will never do but you may give way to the devil in lesser matters and so do gods work ill and lose your own reward from god  all grumbling and hard speeches and talebearing is doing the devils work  all disorder and laziness is doing the devils work  all cruelty and brutality is doing the devils work  now as to cruelty and brutality some soldiers fancy when towns are taken in war that they may do things for which to speak the truth they ought to be hanged  i mean in plain english ravishing the women and illtreating unarmed men to make them give up their money  whosoever does these things gods curse is on him and his sin will surely find him out  no excuse of being in hot blood will avail him  no excuse of having fought well beforehand will avail him  such cant will no more excuse him with god than it will with truly nobleminded men  he may have been brave enough before but he is doing a cowards deed then he is doing the devils work and the devil and not god will pay him his wages to the uttermost farthing  but though i tell you to fear the devil it is only to fear his getting the command over you  the devil is a liar and a liar is always a coward  be brave in gods service  resist the devil and he will flee from you  one word more  if any of you are maddened by hearing of the enemy murdering some of your woundedrecollect that revenge is one of the devils works of which the brave men cannot be too much afraid  god forbid that you should ever be maddened into imitating such cruelty fight the enemy in gods nameand strike home but never have on your conscience the thought that you struck an unnecessary blow  you are to kill for the sake of victory but never to kill for the sake of killing  you know who it was who prayed for and excused his own murderers as he hung upon the cross  father forgive them for they know not what they do  that was the same lord jesus who as i told you is the great warrior against all wrong  if he was not ashamed to forgive do you not be ashamed either  you cannot be more brave than he is try at least to be merciful like him  overcome evil with good by returning good for evil you will not only help englands cause by softening the hearts of your enemies but you will preach christs gospel to themand in nowise lose your reward  remember then always our lord jesus christ is the pattern of a perfect warrior whether by land or sea and if you be like him and fighting not only on his side but as he likes to see you fight that is righteously and mercifully against the tyrants of the earthwhat harm can happen to you  be sure that whether you live you will live to him or whether you die you die to him that living or dying you will be his and that he is merciful the bible says in this that he rewards every man according to his work  do you your work like men and be sure that the lord jesus christ will see that you are right well paid if not in this life still in that life to come to which may he bring you and all brave men who will strive to do their duty in that station of life to which god has called them    ii  the story of cortez or pluck in the sixteenth century  a lecture delivered at aldershot camp nov 1858   it seemed to me that having to speak tonight to soldiers that i ought to speak about soldiers  some story i thought about your own profession would please you most and teach you most  some story i say for it is not my business to tell you what soldiers ought to be like that i daresay you know a great deal better than i and i only hope i may do my duty as a parson half as well as british soldiers do their duty and will always do it  so i thought of telling you tonight some sort of a storya true one of course about wars and battlessome story about the british army but then i thought there are plenty of officers who can do that far better than iso i will take some story of foreign armies and one of old times too  and though no soldier myself but only a scholar and reader of queer old books i may make my scholarship of some use to you who have to drill and fight and die too for us comfortable folks who sit at home and read our books by our fireside  then i thought of the story of cortez the spaniard and how he conquered the great empire of mexico with a handful of brave men  that i thought would be an example to you of what men can do who have stout hearts and good weapons and who have faith too in god and believe that if they do their duty god will prosper them  and i thought i could do it all the better because i like the story and enjoy reading it again and again for i know no such dashing and desperate deed of courage in history except havelocks advance upon lucknow  so now i will begin my story telling you first where mexico is and what it was like when cortez landed in it more than three hundred years ago  you all of you have heard of the west india stationsome of you have been there  beyond those west india islands lies the great gulf of mexico and beyond that the mainland of north america and mexico itself it is now thinly peopled by spaniards the descendants of settlers who came over after cortezs time and a very lazy cowardly set most of them arevery different from the old heroes their forefathers  our yankee cousins can lick them now one to five and will end i believe in conquering the whole country  but in cortezs time the place was very different  it was full of vast numbers of heathens brownish coloured people something like the red indians you see in canada but a fairer handsomer stouter heavierbodied race and much more civilised also they had great cities and idol temples aqueducts for water and all sorts of noble buildings all of most curiously carved stone which is all the more wonderful and creditable to them when we remember that they had no ironnot a knifenot a nail of iron among them  but they had found out how to make bronze by mixing tin and copper and with it could work the hardest stones as well as we can with iron  they had another stuff which was curious enough of which they made knives razors arrow heads and sawedged swords as keen as razorsand that was glass  they did not make the glassthey found it about the burning mountains of which mexico is full itztli they called it we call it obsidian  it is tougher than our glass and chips to a fine razor edge  i have seen arrows of it which i am certain would go clean through a man and knives which would take his arm off bone and all  i want you to remember these glass weapons for cortezs spaniards had cause enough to remember them when they came to fight  gunpowder of course they knew nothing of nor of horses or cattle either  they had no beasts of draught and all the stones and timber for their magnificent buildings were carried by hand but they were firstrate farmers and for handicraft work such as pottery weaving and making all kinds of ornaments i can answer for it for i have seen a good deal of their workthey had not then their equals in the world  they made the most beautiful dresses out of the feathers of birdsparrots humming birds and such like which fill the forests in hot countries  and what was more their country abounded in gold and jewels and they knew how to work them just as well as we do  they could work gold into the likeness of flowers of birds with every feather like life and into a thousand trinkets  their soil was most fruitful of all that man can wantthere was enough of the best for all to eat and altogether there never was a richer and need never have been a happier people if they had but been good  but that was just what they were not a bad lot they were cruel and bloodthirsty continually at war with each other and as for cruelty just take this one story  at the opening of a great temple to one of their idols in 1486 about thirty years before the spaniards came they sacrificed to the idol seventythousand human beings  this offering in sacrifice of human beings to their idols was their regular practice  they got these poor creatures by conquering all the nations round and carrying back their prisoners to sacrifice and if they failed they took poor people of their own for blood they and their false gods must have  men and sometimes women and children were murdered by them in their temples often with the most horrible tortures to the number i am afraid there is no doubt of it of many thousands every year and their flesh afterwards cooked delicately was eaten as a luxury by people who as far as outward show went were just as fine gentlemen and ladies as there are now  when the spaniards got into mexico they found the walls of the temples crusted inches thick in blood the altars of the idols heaped with smoking human hearts and whole houses full of skulls  they counted in one house one hundred and thirtysix thousand skulls  it was high time to get rid of those mexicans off the face of the earth and in gods good time a man was found to rid the earth of them and that man was hernando cortez  and who was cortez  he was a poor young spanish gentleman son of an infantry captain who in his youth was sickly and weakly and his father tried to make a lawyer of him and would have done it but young cortez kicked over the traces as we say right and left and turned out such a wild fellow that he would not stay at college and after getting into plenty of scrapes started as a soldier to the west indies when he was only nineteen  little did people think what stuff there was in that wild sickly lad  how he got on in the spanish west indies would be a long story  i will only tell you that he turned out a thoroughly good soldier and a very dashing smart fellow a firstrate rider and fencer a great dandy in his dress but alsoand if you go to hot climates keep this in minda particularly sober and temperate man who drank nothing and could eat anything  and he had it is said the most extraordinary power of managing his men  he was always cool and determined and what he said had to be done and they knew it but his way with them was so frank and kind and he was so ready to be the foremost in daring and enduring living worse often than his own men while he was doing every thing for their comfort that there was nothing they would not do for him as the event provedfor if those soldiers had not trusted him for life and death i should not have this grand story to tell  at last he married a very pretty woman and got an estate in the west indies and settled down there and the chances were ten to one that no one ever heard of him  however dim reports came to the west indies of this great empire of mexico and of all its wonders and wealth and that stirred up cortezs blood and nothing would serve him but that leaving wife and estate he must start out again to seek his fortune  he got a commission from the governor such as it was for they were lawless places those spanish west indies then and everybody fulfilled a certain irishmans notion of true libertyfor he did what was right in the sight of his own eyes and what was wrong tooand cortezs commission was to go and discover this country and trade with the people and make christians of themthat is if he could  so he got together a little army and sailed away with it for the unknown land  he had about one hundred sailors five hundred and fifty soldiers armed with sword and pike and among them thirtytwo crossbow men and thirteen musketeers  above all he had sixteen horses ten heavy gunsor what may be called heavy guns in those timesabout 9pounders i suppose and four smaller guns and with that he set out to conquer a new world and he conquered it  he did not know whither he was going  all he knew was that this wonderful country of mexico was somewhere and treasures inestimable in it  and one other thing he knew that if mortal man could get there he would  he landed at tabascowhere vera cruz city stands nowfought with the indians who ran away at the sight of the horses and noise of the cannon and then made friends with them  from them he got presents and among others a present which was worth more than its weight in gold to him namely a young slave girl who had been born near mexico and knew the language  she was very clever and very beautiful and soon learnt to speak spanish  she had been a princess in her own country and was sold as a slave by her cruel stepmother  they made a christian of her and called her dona marinaher indian name was malincheand she became cortezs interpreter to the indians and his secretary  and she loved him and served him as faithfully as true woman ever loved man and saved him and his from a hundred dangers  and the spaniards reverence her name still and call a mighty snow mountain after her malinche to this day  after that he marched inland hearing more and more of the wonders of mexico till he came at last after many adventures to a country called tlascala up among high mountains  the men who lived there seem to have been rough honest fellows and brave enough they showed themselves  the mexicans who lived in the plains below never could conquer them though they had been fighting with them for full two hundred years  these tlascalans turned out like men and fought cortezone hundred indians to one spaniard they fought for four mortal hours but horses and cannon were too much for them and by evening they were beaten off  they attempted to surprise him the same night and were beaten off again with great slaughter  whereon a strange thing happened  cortez through dona marina his interpreter sent them in fair terms  if they would make peace he would forget and forgive all if not he would kill every man of them and level their city to the ground  whereon after more fighting the tlascalans behaved like wise and brave men  they understood at last that cortezs point was not tlascala but mexico and the mexicans were their bitterest enemies and they had the good sense to shake hands with the spaniards and make all up  and faithful friends they were and bravely they fought side by side during all the terrible campaign that followed  meanwhile cortezs own men began to lose heart they had had terrible fighting already and no plunder  as for getting to mexico it was all a dream  but cortez and dona marina this wonderful indian girl kept them up  no doubt they were in awful dangera handful of strangers walking blindfold in a vast empire not one foot of ground of which they knew but cortez knew the further they went the further they must go for it was impossible to go back  so on and on they went and as they went they met ambassadors from montezuma the great emperor of mexico  the very sight of these men confirmed all that they had heard of the riches of that great empire for these indian lords came blazing with gold and jewels and the most magnificent dresses and of their power for at one city which had let cortez in peaceably without asking the emperors leave they demanded as a fine five and twenty indian young men and forty girls to be offered in sacrifice to their idols  cortez answered that by clapping them in irons and then sending them back to the emperor with a message that whether he liked or not he was coming to mexico  you may call that desperate rashness but like a good deal of rashness it paid  this great emperor montezuma was utterly panicstricken  there were old prophecies that white gods should come over the sea and destroy him and his empire and he took it into his head that these spaniards were the white gods and that there was no use resisting them  he had been a brave man in his youth and a great warrior but he utterly lost his head now  he sent magnificent presents to the spaniards to buy them off but that only made them the more keen to come on and come they did till they saw underneath them the city of mexico which must have been then one of the wonders of the world  it lay in the midst of a great salt lake and could only be reached from shore by long causeways beautifully built of stone  on this lake were many islands and what was most curious of all floating gardens covered with all sorts of vegetables and flowers  how big the city was no one will ever know now but the old ruins of it show how magnificent its buildings must have been full of palaces and temples of every kind of carved stone surrounded by flower gardens while the whole city was full of fountains supplied with pure water brought in pipes from the mountains round  i suppose so beautiful a sight as that city of mexico has never been seen since on earth  only one ugly feature there was in itgreat pyramids of stone hundreds of them with idol temples on the top on each of which was kept up a perpetual fire fed with the fat of human beings  to their surprise the emperor received them peaceably came out to meet them gave them such presents that the common soldiers were covered with chains of gold invited them into the city and gave them a magnificent palace to live in and endless slaves to wait upon them  it sounds all like a fairy tale but it is as true as that you and i are here  but the cunning emperor had been plotting against them all the while and no great blame to him and at last one of those plots came to light and cortez made up his mind to take the emperor prisoner  and he did it right or wrong we can hardly say now  this montezuma was a bad false man a tyrant and a cannibal but still it looks ugly to seize a man who is acting as your friend  however cortez had courage in the midst of that great city with hundreds of thousands of indians round him to go and tell the emperor that he must come with him  andso strong is a man when he chooses to be strongthe emperor actually went with cortez a prisoner  cortezand that was an unworthy actionput him in irons for an hour to show him that he was master and then took off his irons and treated him like a king  the poor emperor had all he wantedall his wives and slaves and finery and eatables and drinkables but he was a mere puppet in the spaniards hands and knew it  and strangely enough not being able to get out of his mind the fancy that these spaniards were gods or at least the children of the gods he treated them so generously and kindly that they all loved him he obeyed them in everything took up a great friendship with several and ended actually by giving them all his treasures of gold to melt down and part among themselves  as i say it sounds all like a fairy tale but it happened in this very month of november 1519  but cortez had been too prosperous not to meet with a mishap  every great man must be tried by trouble and so was cortez  news came to him that a fresh army of spaniards had landed as he thought at first to help him  they had nine hundred men eighty of whom were horse soldiers eighty musqueteers one hundred and fifty crossbow men a good train of heavy guns ammunition c  what was cortezs disgust when he found that the treacherous governor of cuba had sent them not to help him but to take him prisoner as a rebel  it was a villainous business got up out of envy of cortezs success and covetousness of his booty  but in the spanish colonies in those days so far from home there was very little law and the governors and adventurers were always quarrelling and fighting with each other  what did cortez do made up his mind as usual to do the desperate thing and marched against narvaez with only seventy men no guns and hardly any musketsseventy against nine hundred  it was fearful odds but he was forced to leave the rest to keep mexico down  and he armed his men with very long lances tipped at both ends with copperfor he had no iron with them he hoped to face narvaezs cavalry  and he did it  happily on his road he met an old friend with one hundred and twenty soldiers who had been sent off to form a colony on the coast they were as true as steel to him  and with that one hundred and ninety he surprised and defeated by night narvaezs splendid little army  and what is more after beating them made such friends with them that he engaged them all next morning to march with him wherever he wanted  the man was like a spiderwhoever fell into his net friend or foe never came out again till he had sucked him dry  now he hurried back to mexico and terribly good reason he had for alvarado whom he had left in garrison had quarrelled with the mexicans and set upon them at one of their idol feasts and massacred great numbers of their leading men  it was a bloody black business and bitterly the spaniards paid for it  cortez when he heard it actually lost his temper for once and called his lieutenantgeneral a madman and a traitor but he could not afford to cashier him for after all he was the best and bravest man he had  but the mischief was done  the whole city of mexico the whole country round had risen in fury had driven the spanish garrison into the great palace and worst of all had burnt the boats which cortez had left to get off by if the bridges were burst down  so there was alvarado shut up exactly like the english at lucknow with this difference that the spaniards deserved what they got and the english god knows did not  and there was cortez like another havelock or colin campbell marching to deliver them  but he met a very different reception  these crafty mexicans never struck a blow  all was as still as the grave  as they came over the long causeways and bridges there was not a canoe upon the lake not an indian in the floating gardens  as they marched through the streets of the glorious city the streets were as empty as a desert  and the spaniard knew that he was walking into a trap out of which none of them might come out alive but their hearts never failed them and they marched on to the sound of their bugles and were answered by joyful salutes of cannon from the relieved garrison  the mexicans had shut up the markets and no food was to be got  cortez sent to open them  he sent another messenger off to the coast to say all was safe and that he should soon conquer the rebels  but here a cleverer man than i must tell the story  but scarcely had his messenger been gone half an hour when he returned breathless with terror and covered with wounds  the city he said was all in arms the drawbridges were raised and the enemy would soon be upon them  he spoke truth  it was not long before a hoarse sullen sound became audible like that of the roaring of distant waters  it grew louder and louder till from the parapet surrounding the enclosure the great avenues which led to it might be seen dark with the masses of warriors who came rolling on in a confused tide towards the fortress  at the same time the terraces and flat roofs in the neighbourhood were thronged with combatants brandishing their missiles who seemed to have risen up as if by magic  it was a spectacle to appall the stoutest  the spanish forces were crowded into a small compact mass in the palace and the whole army could be assembled at a moments notice  no sooner therefore did the trumpet call to arms than every soldier was at his postthe cavalry mounted the artillerymen at their guns and the archers and arquebusiers stationed so as to give the assailants a warm reception  on they came with the companies or irregular masses into which the multitude was divided rushing forward each in its own dense column with many a gay banner displayed and many a bright gleam of light reflected from helmet arrow and spear head as they were tossed about in their disorderly array  as they drew near the aztecs set up a hideous yell which rose far above the sound of shell and atabat and their other rude instruments of warlike melody  they followed this by a tempest of missilesstones darts arrowswhich fell thick as rain on the besieged  the spaniards waited till the foremost column had arrived when a general discharge of artillery and arquebusses swept the ranks of the assailants and mowed them down by hundreds 222     so the fight raged on with fury for two days while the aztecs indians who only fought by day howled out to the wretched spaniards every night on the third day cortez brought out the emperor montezuma and commanded him to quiet the indians  the unhappy man obeyed him  he had made up his mind that these spaniards were the white gods who were to take his kingdom from him and he submitted to them like a sheep to the butcher he went up to a tower in all his royal robes and jewels  at the sight the indians who filled the great square below were all hushedthousands threw themselves on their faces and to their utter astonishment he asked them what they meant by rebelling  he was no prisoner he said but the spaniards guest and friend  the spaniards would go peaceably if they would let them  in any case he was the spaniards friend  the indians answered him by a yell of fury and contempt  he was a doga womanfit only to weave and spin and a volley of stones and arrows flew at him  one struck him on the head and dropped him senseless  the indians set up a howl of terror and frightened at what they had done fled away ashamed  the wretched emperor refused comfort food help tore the bandages from his wounds and died in two days  he had been a bad man a cannibal and a butcher bloodthirsty and covetous a ravisher of virgins and a tyrant to his people  but the spaniards had got to love him in spite of all for a true friend he had been to them and a fearful loss to them just now  the battle went on worse than ever  the great idol temple commanded the palace and was covered with mexican warriors  and next day cortez sent a party to storm it  they tried to get up the winding stairs and were driven back three times with fearful loss  cortez though he had but one hand to fight with sallied out and cleared the pyramid himself after a fearful handtohand fight of three hours up the winding stairs along the platforms and at last upon the great square on the top an acre in breadth  every mexican was either killed or hurled down the sides  the idol the war god with its gold disc of bleeding hearts smoking before it was hurled down and the whole accursed place set on fire and destroyed  three hundred houses round were also burnt that night but of what use  the spaniards were starving hemmed in by hundreds of thousands  they were like a single wasp inside a beehive  let him kill the bees by hundreds he must be killed himself at last  he made up his mind to evacuate the city to leave all his conquests behind him  it was a terrible disappointment but it had to be done  they marched out by night in good order with all their guns and ammunition and with immense plunder as much of poor montezumas treasures as they could carry  the old hands took very little they knew what they were about  the fresh ones from narvaezs army loaded themselves with gold and jewels and had to pay dear for them  cortez i ought to tell you took good care of dona marina  he sent her forward under a strong guard of tlascalans with all the other women  the great street was crossed by many canals  then the causeway across the lake two miles long was crossed by more canals and at every one of these the indians had taken away the bridges  cortez knew that and had made a movable bridge but he had only time to make one and that of course had to be taken up at the rear and carried forward to the front every time they crossed a dyke and that made endless delay  as long as they were in the city however all went well but the moment they came out upon the lake causeway out thundered the serpentskin drums from the top of every temple the conch shells blew and out swarmed the whole hive of bees against the one brave wasp who was struggling  the spaniards cleared the dyke by cavalry and artillery and got to the first canal laid down the bridge and over slowly but safely amid a storm of stones and arrows  they got to the second canal fifteen or twenty feet broad why in gods name was not the bridge brought on  instead of the bridge came news from the rear  the weight of the artillery had been too great for the bridge and it was jammed fast  and there they were on a narrow dyke fifty feet broad in the midst of the lake in the dark midnight with countless thousands of indians around before behind and the lord have mercy on them  what followed you may guessthough some of the brave men who fought there and who wrote the story themselveswhich i have readhardly knew  the cavalry tried to swim their horses over  some got safe others rolled into the lake  the infantry followed pell mell cut down like sheep by arrows and stones by the terrible glass swords of the indians who crowded round their canoes  the waggons prest on the men the guns on them the rear on them again till in a few minutes the canal was choked with writhing bodies of men and horses cannon gold and treasure inestimable over which the survivors scrambled to the further bank cortez who was helping the rear forded the gap on horseback and hurried on to find a third and larger canal which no one dare cross  but the indians were not so thick here and plunging into the water they got through as they could  and woe that night to the soldier who had laden himself with indian treasure  dragged to the bottom by the weight of their plunder hundreds died there drowned by that very gold to find which they had crossed the seas and fought so many a bloody battle  what is the use of making a sad story long  they reached the shore and sat down like men desperate and foredone in a great idol temple  several of their finest officers threefourths of their men were killed and missing threefourths too of their horsesall cortezs papers all their cannon all their treasure  they had not even a musket left nothing to face the indians with but twentythree crippled horses a few damaged crossbows and their good old swords  cortezs first question was for poor dona marima and strange to say she was safe  the trusty tlascalan indians had brought her through it all  alvarado the lieutenant was safe too  if he had been the cause of all that misery he did his best to make up for it  he stayed behind fighting at the last canal till all were over and the indians closing round him  then he set his long lance in the water and to the astonishment of both armies leapt the canal clean while the indians shouted this is indeed the tonatiah the child of the sun  the gap is shown now and it is called to this day alvarados leap  god forgive him for if he was a cruel man he was at least a brave one  cortez sat down a ruined man and as he looked round for his old comrades and missed one face after another he covered his face with his hands and cried like a child  and was he a ruined man  never less  no man is ruined till his pluck is gone  he got his starving and shivering men together and away for the mountains to get back to the friendly people of tlascala  the people followed them along the hills shouting go on you will soon find yourselves where you cannot escape  but he went ontill he saw what they meant  waiting for him in a pass was an army of indianstwo hundred thousand some writers sayall fresh and fully armed  what could he do  to surrender was to be sacrificed every man to the idols so he marched on he had still twenty horses and he put ten on each flank  he bade his men not strike with their sword but give the point  he made a speech to his men  they had beaten the indians he said many a time at just as fearful odds  god had brought them through so far god would not desert them for they were fighting on his side against the heathen and so he went straight at the vast army of indians  they were surrounded swallowed up by them for a few minutes  in the course of an hour the spaniards had routed them utterly with immense slaughter  of all the battles i ever read of this battle of otumba is one of the most miraculous  some say that cortez conquered mexico by gunpowder he had none then neither cannon nor musket  the sword and lance did it all and they in the hands of men worn out with famine cold and fatigue and i had said brokenhearted into the bargain  but there was no breaking those mens heartswhat won that battle what won mexico was the indomitable pluck of the white man before which the indian whether american or hindoo never has stood and never will stand to the worlds end  the spaniards proved it in america of old though they were better armed than the indian  but there are those who have proved it upon indians as well armed as themselves  ay my friends i should be no englishman if while i told this story i could help thinking all the while of our brave comrades in india who have conquered as cortez conquered and against just as fearful odds whose enemies were armed not with copper arrows and glass knives but with european muskets european cannon and most dangerous of all european discipline  i say cortez did wonders in his time but i say too that our indian heroes have done more and done it in a better cause  and that is the history of the conquest of mexico  what you may ask is that the end  when we are leaving the spaniards a wornout and starving handful struggling back for refuge to tlascala without anything but their old swords do you call that a conquest  yes i do just as i call the getting back to cawnpore after the relief of lucknow the conquest of india  it showed which was the better man englishman or sepoy just as the retreat from mexico showed which was the better man spaniard or indian  the sepoys were cowed from that day just as the mexicans were cowed after otumba  they had fought with all possible odds on their side and been licked and when men are once cowed all the rest is merely a work of time  so it was with cortez  he went back to tlascala  he got by mere accident as we say a reinforcement of spaniards  he stirred up all the indian nations round who were weary of the cruel tyranny of the mexicans he made large boats to navigate the lake and he marched back upon mexico the next year with about six hundred spaniards and nine cannonabout half the force which he had had before but with a hundred thousand indian allies who like the sturdy tlascalans proved as true to him as steel  truly if he was not a great general who is  he marched back taking city after city as he went and besieged mexico it was a long and weary siege  the indians fought like fiends  the causeways had to be taken yard by yard but cortez wise by sad experience put his cannon into the boats and swept them from the water then the city had to be taken house by house  the indians drove him back again and again till they were starved to skeletons and those who used to eat their enemies were driven to eat each other  still they would not give in  at last after many weeks of fighting it was all over  the glorious mexican empire was crumbled to dust  those proud nobles who used to fat themselves upon the bodies of all the nations round were reduced to a handful of starving beggars  the cross of christ was set up where the hearts of human creatures were offered to foul idols and mexico has been ever since the property of the spaniards a christian land  and what became of cortez  he died sadly and in disgrace  he sowed and other men reaped  if he was cruel and covetous he was punished for it in this world heavily enough  he had many noble qualities though  he was a better man than those around him and one good thing he did which was to sweep off the face of the earth as devilish a set of tyrants as ever defiled the face of the earth  give him all due honour for it and let him rest in peace  god shall judge him and not we  but take home with you soldiers all one lesson from this strange story that while a man can keep his courage and his temper he is not only never really beaten but no man can tell what great things he may not do    iii  picture galleries   picturegalleries should be the workingmans paradise 230 a garden of pleasure to which he goes to refresh his eyes and heart with beautiful shapes and sweet colouring when they are wearied with dull bricks and mortar and the ugly colourless things which fill the town the workshop and the factory  for believe me there is many a road into our hearts besides our ears and brains many a sight and sound and scent even of which we have never thought at all sinks into our memory and helps to shape our characters and thus children brought up among beautiful sights and sweet sounds will most likely show the fruits of their nursing by thoughtfulness and affection and nobleness of mind even by the expression of the countenance  the poet wordsworth talking of training up a beautiful country girl says     the floating clouds their state shall lend    to herfor her the willow bend    nor shall she fail to see    even in the motions of the storm    grace which shall mould the maidens form    by silent sympathy            and she shall bend her ear    in many a secret place    where rivulets dance their wayward round    and beauty born of murmuring sound    shall pass into her face  those who live in towns should carefully remember this for their own sakes for their wives sakes for their childrens sakes  never lose an opportunity of seeing anything beautiful  beauty is gods handwritinga wayside sacrament welcome it in every fair face every fair sky every fair flower and thank him for it who is the fountain of all loveliness and drink it in simply and earnestly with all your eyes it is a charmed draught a cup of blessing  therefore i said that picturegalleries should be the townsmans paradise of refreshment  of course if he can get the real air the real trees even for an hour let him take it in gods name but how many a man who cannot spare time for a daily country walk may well slip into the national gallery in trafalgar square or the south kensington museum or any other collection of pictures for ten minutes  that garden at least flowers as gaily in winter as in summer  those noble faces on the wall are never disfigured by grief or passion  there in the space of a single room the townsman may take his country walka walk beneath mountain peaks blushing sunsets with broad woodlands spreading out below it a walk through green meadows under cool mellow shades and overhanging rocks by rushing brooks where he watches and watches till he seems to hear the foam whisper and to see the fishes leap and his hard worn heart wanders out free beyond the grim cityworld of stone and iron smoky chimneys and roaring wheels into the world of beautiful thingsthe world which shall be hereafteray which shall be  believe it toilworn worker in spite of thy foul alley thy crowded lodging thy grimed clothing thy illfed children thy thin pale wifebelieve it thou too and thine will some day have your share of beauty  god made you love beautiful things only because he intends hereafter to give you your fill of them  that pictured face on the wall is lovely but lovelier still may the wife of thy bosom be when she meets thee on the resurrection morn  those baby cherubs in the old italian paintinghow gracefully they flutter and sport among the soft clouds full of rich young life and baby joy  yes beautiful indeed but just such a one at this very moment is that once pining deformed child of thine over whose deathcradle thou wast weeping a month ago now a childangel whom thou shalt meet again never to part  those landscapes too painted by loving wise old claude two hundred years ago are still as fresh as ever  how still the meadows are how pure and free that vault of deep blue sky  no wonder that thy worn heart as thou lookest sighs aloud oh that i had wings as a dove then would i flee away and be at rest ah but gayer meadows and bluer skies await thee in the world to comethat fairyland made realthe new heavens and the new earth which god has prepared for the pure and the loving the just and the brave who have conquered in this sore fight of life  these thoughts may seem all too farfetched to spring up in a mans head from merely looking at pictures but it is not so in practice  see now such thoughts have sprung up in my head how else did i write them down here  and why should not they and better ones too spring up in your heads friends  it is delightful to watch in a picturegallery some streetboy enjoying himself how first wonder creeps over his rough face and then a sweeter more earnest awestruck look till his countenance seems to grow handsomer and nobler on the spot and drink in and reflect unknowingly the beauty of the picture he is studying  see how some soldiers face will light up before the painting which tells him a noble story of byegone days  and why  because he feels as if he himself had a share in the story at which he looks  they may be noble and glorious men who are painted there but they are still men of like passions with himself and his mans heart understands them and glories in them and he begins and rightly to respect himself the more when he finds that he too has a fellowfeeling with noble men and noble deeds  i say pictures raise blessed thoughts in mewhy not in you my brothers  your hearts are fresh thoughtful kindly you only want to have these pictures explained to you that you may know why and how they are beautiful and what feelings they ought to stir in your minds look at the portraits on the walls and let me explain one or two  often the portraits are simpler than large pictures and they speak of real men and women who once lived on this earth of oursgenerally of remarkable and noble menand man should be always interesting to man    iv  a portrait in the national gallery   any one who goes to the national gallery in trafalgar square may see two large and beautiful picturesthe nearer of the two labelled titian representing bacchus leaping from a car drawn by leopards  the other labelled francia representing the holy family seated on a sort of throne with several figures arranged belowone of them a man pierced with arrows  between these two low down hangs a small picture about two feet square containing only the portrait of an old man in a white cap and robe and labelled on the picture itself joannes bellinus now this old man is a very ancient friend of mine and has comforted my heart and preached me a sharp sermon too many a time  i never enter that gallery without having five minutes converse with him and yet he has been dead at least three hundred years and what is more i dont even know his name  but what more do i know of a man by knowing his name  whether the mans name be brown or whether he has as many names and titles as a spanish grandee what does that tell me about the manthe spirit and character of the manwhat the man will say when he is askedwhat the man will do when he is stirred up to action  the mans name is part of his clothes his shell his husk  change his name and all his titles you dont change hima mans a man for a that as burns says and a goose a goose  other men gave him his name but his heart and his spirithis love and his hatredhis wisdom and his follyhis power to do well and ill those god and himself gave him  i must know those and then i know the man  let us see what we can make out from the picture itself about the man whom it represents  in the first place we may see by his dress that he was in his day the doge or chief magistrate of venicethe island city the queen of the seas  so we may guess that he had many a stirring time of it and many a delicate game to play among those tyrannous and covetous old merchantprinces who had elected him who were keeping up their own power at the expense of everyones liberty by spies and nameless accusers and secret councils tortures and prisons whose horrors no one ever returned to describe nay we may guess just the very men with whom he had to dealthe very battles he may have seen fought  but all these are circumstancesthings which stand round the man as the word means and not the whole man himselfnot the character and heart of the man that we must get from the portrait and if the portrait is a truly noble portrait we shall get it  if it is a merely vulgar picture we shall get the mans dress and shape of his face but little or no expression if it is a pathetic portrait or picture of passion we shall get one particular temporary expression of his faceperhaps joy sorrow anger disgustbut still one which may have passed any moment and left his face quite different but if the picture is one of the noblest kind we shall read the mans whole character there just all his strength and weakness his kindliness or his sternness his thoughtfulness or his carelessness written there once and for everwhat he would be though all the world passed away what his immortal and eternal soul will be unless god or the devil changed his heart to all eternity  we may see at once that this man has been very handsome but it is a peculiar sort of beauty  how delicate and graceful all the lines in his face arehe is a gentleman of gods own making and not of the tailors making  he is such a gentleman as i have seen among working men and nine shillingaweek labourers often and often his nobleness is in his heartit is gods gift therefore it shows in his noble looking face  no matter whether he were poor or rich all the rags in the world all the finery in the world could not have made him look like a snob or a swell he was a thoughtful man too no one with such a forehead could have been a trifler a kindly man too and honestone that may have played merrily enough with his grandchildren and put his hand in his purse for many a widow and orphan  look what a bright clear straightforward gentle look he has almost a smile but he has gone through too many sad hours to smile much he is a man of many sorrows like all true and noble rulers and like a high mountainside his face bears the furrows of many storms  he has had a stern life of it with the cares of a great nation on his shoulders  he has seen that in this world there is no rest for those who live like true men you may see it by the wrinkles in his brow and the sharpcut furrows in his cheeks and those firmset determined lips  his eyes almost show the marks of many noble tearstears such as good men shed over their nations sins but that too is past now  he has found out his path and he will keep it and he has no misgiving now about what god would have him do or about the reward which god has laid up for the brave and just and that is what makes his forehead so clear and bright while his very teeth are clenched with calm determination  and by the look of those high cheek bones and that large square jaw he is a strongwilled man enough and not one to be easily turned aside from his purpose by any man alive or by any woman either or by his own passions and tempers  one fault of character i think he may perhaps have had much trouble withi mean bitterness and contemptuousness  his lips are very thin he may have sneered many a time when he was younger at the follies of the world which that great lofty thoughtful brain and clear eye of his told him were follies but he seems to have got past that too  such is the mans character a noble simple commanding old man who has conquered many hard things and hardest of all has conquered himself and now is waiting calm for his everlasting rest  god send us all the same  now consider the deep insight of old john bellini who could see all this and put it down there for us with pencil and paint  no doubt there was something in bellinis own character which made him especially best able to paint such a man for we always understand those who are most like ourselves and therefore you may tell pretty nearly a painters own character by seeing what sort of subjects he paints and what his style of painting is  and a noble simple brave godly man was old john bellini who never lost his head though princes were flattering him and snobs following him with shouts and blessings for his noble pictures of the venetian victories as if he had been a man sent from god himself as indeed he wasall great painters are for who but god makes beauty  who gives the loving heart and the clear eye and the graceful taste to see beauty and to copy it and to set forth on canvas or in stone the noble deeds of patriots dying for their country  to paint truly patriotic pictures well a man must have his heart in his workhe must be a true patriot himself as john bellini was if i mistake not he had fought for his country himself in more than one shrewd fight  and what makes men patriots or artists or anything noble at all but the spirit of the living god  those great pictures of bellinis are no more they were burnt a few years afterwards with the magnificent national hall in which they hung but the spirit of them is not passed away  even now venice bellinis beloved motherland is rising newborn from long weary years of austrian slavery and trying to be free and great once more and young italian hearts are lighting up with the thoughts of her old fleets and her old victories her merchants and her statesmen whom john bellini drew  venice sinned and fell and sorely has she paid for her sins through two hundred years of shame and profligacy and slavery  and she has broken the oppressors yoke  god send her a new life  may she learn by her ancient sins  may she learn by her ancient glories  you will forgive me for forgetting my picture to talk of such things but we must return  look back at what i said about the old portraitthe clear calm victorious character of the old mans face and see how all the rest of the picture agrees with it in a complete harmony  the dress the scenery the light and shade the general tone of colour should all agree with the character of the faceall help to bring our minds into that state in which we may best feel and sympathise with the human beings painted  now here because the face is calm and grand the colour and the outlines are quiet and grand likewise  how different these colours are from that glorious holy family of francias next to it on the right or from that equally glorious bacchus and ariadne of titians on the left  yet all three are right each for its own subject  here you have no brilliant reds no rich warm browns no luscious greens  the white robe and cap give us the thought of purity and simplicity the very golden embroidery on them which marks his rank is carefully kept back from being too gaudy  everything is sober here and the lines of the dress how simple they all areno rich curves no fluttering drapery  they would be quite stiff if it were not for that waving line of round tassels in front which break the extreme straightness and heaviness of the splendid robe and all pointing upwards towards that solemn thin calm face with its high white cap rising like the peak of a snow mountain against the dark deep boundless blue sky beyond  that is a grand thought of bellinis  you do not see the mans hands he does not want them now his work is done  you see no landscape behindno buildings  all earths ways and sights are nothing to him now there is nothing but the old man and the skynothing between him and the heaven now and he knows it and is glad  a few months more and those wayworn features shall have crumbled to their dust and that strong meek spirit shall be in the abyss of eternity before the god from whence it came  so says john bellini with art more cunning than words  and if this paper shall make one of you look at that little picture with fresh interest and raise one strong and solemn longing in you to die the death of the righteous and let your last end be like his who is painted therethen i shall rejoice in the only payment i desire to get for this my afternoons writing    v  the british museum   nature is infinitely more wonderful than the highest art and in the commonest hedgeside leaf lies a mystery and beauty greater than that of the greatest picture the noblest statueas infinitely greater as gods work is infinitely greater than mans  but to those who have no leisure to study nature in the green fields and there are nowadays too many such though the time may come when all will have that blessing to such i say go to the british museum bloomsbury square there at least if you cannot go to natures wonders some of natures wonders are brought to you  the british museum is my glory and joy because it is one of the only places which is free to english citizens as suchwhere the poor and the rich may meet together and before those works of gods spirit who is no respecter of persons feel that the lord is the maker of them all in the british museum and the national gallery the englishman may say whatever my coat or my purse i am an englishman and therefore i have a right here  i can glory in these noble halls as if they were my own house  english commerce the joint enterprise and industry of the poor sailor as well as the rich merchant brought home these treasures from foreign lands and those glorious statuesthough it was the wealth and taste of english noblemen and gentlemen who in that proved themselves truly noble and gentle who placed them here yet it was the genius of english artistsmen at once above and below all ranksmen who have worked their way up not by money or birth but by worth and genius which taught the noble and wealthy the value of those antiques and which proclaimed their beauty to the world  the british museum is a truly equalising place in the deepest and most spiritual sense  and it gives the lie too to that common slander that the english are not worthy of free admission to valuable and curious collections because they have such a trick of seeing with their fingers such a trick of scribbling their names of defiling and disfiguring works of art  on the continent it may do but you cannot trust the english  this has been like many other untruths so often repeated that people now take it for granted but i believe that it is utterly groundless and i say so on the experience of the british museum and the national gallery  in the only two cases i believe in which injury has been done to anything in either place the destroyers were neither workingmen nor even poor reckless heathen streetboys but persons who had received what is too often miscalled a liberal education  but national property will always be respected because all will be content while they feel that they have their rights and all will be careful while they feel that they have a share in the treasure  go to the british museum in easter week and see there hundreds of thousands of every rank and age wandering past sculptures and paintings which would be ruined by a blowpast jewels and curiosities any one of which would buy many a poor soul there a months food and lodgingonly protected by a pane of glass if by that and then see not a thing disfiguredmuch less stolen  everywhere order care attention honest pride in their countrys wealth and science earnest reverence for the mighty works of god and of the godinspired  i say the people of england prove themselves worthy of free admission to all works of art and it is therefore the duty of those who can to help them to that free admission  what a noble and righteous and truly brotherly plan it would be if all classes would join to form a free national gallery of art and science which might combine the advantages of the present polytechnic society of arts and british institution gratis 243  manufacturers and men of science might send thither specimens of their new inventions  the rich might send for a few months in the yearas they do now to the british institutionancient and modern pictures and not only pictures but all sorts of curious works of art and nature which are now hidden in their drawingrooms and libraries  there might be free liberty to copy any object on the copyists name and residence being registered  and surely artists and men of science might be found with enough of the spirit of patriotism and love to explain gratuitously to all comers whatever their rank or class the wonders of the museum  i really believe that if once the spirit of brotherhood got abroad among us if men once saw that here was a vast means of educating and softening and uniting those who have no leisure for study and few means of enjoyment except the gin shop and cremorne gardens if they could but once feel that here was a project equally blessed for rich and poor the money for it would be at once forthcoming from many a rich man who is longing to do good if he could only be shown the way and from many a poor journeyman who would gladly contribute his mite to a truly national museum  all that is wanted is the spirit of selfsacrifice patriotism and brotherly lovewhich god alone can givewhich i believe he is giving more and more in these very days  i never felt this more strongly than one day as i was looking in at the windows of a splendid curiosityshop in oxford street at a case of hummingbirds  i was gloating over the beauty of those feathered jewels and then wondering what was the meaning what was the use of it all why those exquisite little creatures should have been hidden for ages in all their splendours of ruby and emerald and gold in the south american forests breeding and fluttering and dying that some dozen out of all those millions might be brought over here to astonish the eyes of men and as i asked myself why were all these boundless varieties these treasures of unseen beauty created my brain grew dizzy between pleasure and thought and as always happens when one is most innocently delighted i turned to share the joy as wordsworth says and next to me stood a huge brawny coalheaver in his shovel hat and white stockings and highlows gazing at the hummingbirds as earnestly as myself  as i turned he turned and i saw a bright manly face with a broad sootgrimmed forehead from under which a pair of keen flashing eyes gleamed wondering smiling sympathy into mine  in that moment we felt ourselves friends  if we had been frenchmen we should i suppose have rushed into each others arms and fraternised upon the spot  as we were a pair of dumb awkward englishmen we only gazed a halfminute staring into each others eyes with a delightful feeling of understanding each other and then burst out both at once with isnt that beautiful  well that is  and then both turned back again to stare at our hummingbirds  i never felt more thoroughly than at that minute though thank god i had often felt it before that all men were brothers that this was not a mere political doctrine but a blessed godordained fact that the partywalls of rank and fashion and money were but a paper prison of our own making which we might break through any moment by a single hearty and kindly feeling that the one spirit of god was given without respect of persons that the beautiful things were beautiful alike to the coal heaver and the parson and that before the wondrous works of god and of gods inspired genius the rich and the poor might meet together and feel that whatever the coat or the creed may be a mans a man for a that and one lord the maker of them all  for believe me my friends rich and poorand i beseech you to think deeply over this great truththat men will never be joined in true brotherhood by mere plans to give them a selfinterest in common as the socialists have tried to do  no to feel for each other they must first feel with each other  to have their sympathies in common they must have not one object of gain but an object of admiration in common to know that they are brothers they must feel that they have one father and one way to feel that they have one common father is to see each other wondering side by side at his glorious works
