88552833	the gem collector    by p g wodehouse  published in ainslees magazine december 1909     chapter i   the supper room of the savoy hotel was all brightness and glitter and gayety but sir james willoughby pitt baronet of the united kingdom looked round about him through the smoke of his cigarette and felt moodily that this was a flat world despite the geographers and that he was very much alone in it  he felt old  if it is ever allowable for a young man of twentysix to give himself up to melancholy reflections jimmy pitt might have been excused for doing so at that moment nine years ago he had dropped out or to put it more exactly had been kicked out and had ceased to belong to london and now he had returned to find himself in a strange city  jimmy pitts complete history would take long to write for he had contrived to crowd much into those nine years abridged it may be told as follows there were two brothers a good brother and a bad brother sir eustace pitt the latter married money john his younger brother remained a bachelor it may be mentioned to check needless sympathy that there was no rivalry between the two john pitt had not the slightest desire to marry the lady of his brothers choice or any other lady he was a selfsufficing man who from an early age showed signs of becoming some day a financial magnate  matters went on much the same after the marriage john continued to go to the city eustace to the dogs neither brother had any money of his own the fortune of the pitts having been squandered to the ultimate farthing by the sportive gentleman who had held the title in the days of the regency when whites and the cocoa tree were in their prime and fortunes had a habit of disappearing in a single evening four years after the marriage lady pitt died and the widower having spent three years and a half at monte carlo working out an infallible system for breaking the bank to the great contentment of mons blanc and the management in general proceeded to the gardens where he shot himself in the orthodox manner leaving many liabilities few assets and one son  the good brother by this time a man of substance in lombard street adopted the youthful successor to the title and sent him to a series of schools beginning with a kindergarten and ending with eton  unfortunately eton demanded from jimmy a higher standard of conduct than he was prepared to supply and a week after his seventeenth birthday his career as an etonian closed prematurely john pitt thereupon delivered an ultimatum jimmy could choose between the smallest of small posts in his uncles business and one hundred pounds in banknotes coupled with the usual handwashing and disowning jimmy would not have been his fathers son if he had not dropped at the money the world seemed full to him of possibilities for a young man of parts with a hundred pounds in his pocket  he left for liverpool that day and for new york on the morrow  for the next nine years he is off the stage which is occupied by his uncle john proceeding from strength to strength now head partner next chairman of the company into which the business had been converted and finally a member of parliament silent as a wax figure but a great comfort to the party by virtue of liberal contributions to its funds  it may be thought curious that he should make jimmy his heir after what had happened but it is possible that time had softened his resentment or he may have had a dislike for public charities the only other claimant for his wealth at any rate it came about that jimmy reading in a chicago paper that if sir james willoughby pitt baronet would call upon messrs snell hazlewood and delane solicitors of lincolns inn fields london he would hear of something to his advantage had called and heard something very much to his advantage  wherefore we find him on this night of july supping in lonely magnificence at the savoy and feeling at the moment far less conscious of the magnificence than of the loneliness  watching the crowd with a jaundiced eye jimmy had found his attention attracted chiefly by a party of three a few tables away the party consisted of a pretty girl a lady of middle age and stately demeanor plainly her mother and a lighthaired weedy young man of about twenty it had been the almost incessant prattle of this youth and the peculiarly highpitched gurgling laugh which shot from him at short intervals which had drawn jimmys notice upon them and it was the curious cessation of both prattle and laugh which now made him look again in their direction  the young man faced jimmy and jimmy looking at him could see that all was not well with him he was pale he talked at random a slight perspiration was noticeable on his forehead  jimmy caught his eye there was a hunted look in it  given the time and the place there were only two things which could have caused that look either the lighthaired young man had seen a ghost or he had suddenly realized that he had not enough money to pay the check  jimmys heart went out to the sufferer he took a card from his case scribbled the words can i help on it and gave it to a waiter to take to the young man who was now in a state bordering on collapse  the next moment the lighthaired one was at his table talking in a feverish whisper  i say he said its frightfully good of you old chap its frightfully awkward ive come out with too little money i hardly like towhat i mean to say is youve never seen me before and  thats all right said jimmy only too glad to help it might have happened to any one will this be enough  he placed a fivepound note on the table the young man grabbed at it with a rush of thanks  i say thanks fearfully he said i dont know what id have done ill let you have it back tomorrow heres my card blunts my name spennie blunt is your address on your card i cant remember oh by jove ive got it in my hand all the time the gurgling laugh came into action again freshened and strengthened by its rest savoy mansions eh ill come round tomorrow thanks frightfully again old chap i dont know what i should have done  he flitted back to his table bearing the spoil and jimmy having finished his cigarette paid his check and got up to go  it was a perfect summer night he looked at his watch there was time for a stroll on the embankment before bed  he was leaning on the balustrade looking across the river at the vague mysterious mass of buildings on the surrey side when a voice broke in on his thoughts  say boss excuse me  jimmy spun round a ragged man with a crop of fiery red hair was standing at his side the light was dim but jimmy recognized that hair  spike he cried  the other gaped then grinned a vast grin of recognition  mr chames gee dis cops de limit  three years had passed since jimmy had parted from spike mullins red spike to the new york police but time had not touched him to jimmy he looked precisely the same as in the old new york days  a policeman sauntered past and glanced curiously at them he made as if to stop then walked on a few yards away he halted jimmy could see him watching covertly he realized that this was not the place for a prolonged conversation  spike he said do you know savoy mansions  sure foist to de left across de way  come on there ill meet you at the door we cant talk here that cops got his eye on us  he walked away as he went he smiled the policemans inspection had made him suddenly alert and on his guard yet why what did it matter to sir james pitt baronet if the whole police force of london stopped and looked at him  queer thing habit he said as he made his way across the road     chapter ii   a black figure detached itself from the blacker shadows and shuffled stealthily to where jimmy stood on the doorstep  that you spike asked jimmy in a low voice  dats right mr chames  come on in  he led the way up to his rooms switched on the electric light and shut the door spike stood blinking at the sudden glare he twirled his battered hat in his hands his red hair shone fiercely  jimmy inspected him out of the corner of his eye and came to the conclusion that the mullins finances must be at a low ebb spikes costume differed in several important details from that of the ordinary wellgroomed man about town there was nothing of the flaneur about the bowery boy his hat was of the soft black felt fashionable on the east side of new york it was in poor condition and looked as if it had been up too late the night before a black tail coat burst at the elbows stained with mud was tightly buttoned across his chest this evidently with the idea of concealing the fact that he wore no shirtan attempt which was not wholly successful a pair of gray flannel trousers and boots out of which two toes peeped coyly completed the picture  even spike himself seemed to be aware that there were points in his appearance which would have distressed the editor of a mens fashion paper  scuse dese duds he said me mans bin an mislaid de trunk wit me best suit in dis is me number two  dont mention it spike said jimmy you look like a matinee idol have a drink  spikes eye gleamed as he reached for the decanter he took a seat  cigar spike  sure tanks mr chames  jimmy lit his pipe spike after a few genteel sips threw off his restraint and finished the rest of his glass at a gulp  try another suggested jimmy  spikes grin showed that the idea had been well received  jimmy sat and smoked in silence for a while he was thinking the thing over he had met spike mullins for the first time in rather curious circumstances in new york and for four years the other had followed him with a fidelity which no dangers or hardships could affect whatever mr chames did said or thought was to spike the best possible act speech or reflection of which man was capable for four years their partnership had continued and then conducting a little adventure on his own account in jimmys absence spike had met with one of those accidents which may happen to any one the police had gathered him in and he had passed out of jimmys life  what was puzzling jimmy was the problem of what to do with him now that he had reëntered it mr chames was one man sir james willoughby pitt baronet another on the other hand spike was plainly in low water and must be lent a helping hand  spike was looking at him over his glass with respectful admiration jimmy caught his eye and spoke  well spike he said curious us meeting like this  de limit agreed spike  i cant imagine you three thousand miles away from new york how do you know the cars still run both ways on broadway  a wistful look came into spikes eye  i tought it was time i give old lunnon a call de cops seemed like as if they didnt have no use for me in new york dey dont give de glad smile to a boy out of prison  poor old spike said jimmy youve had bad luck havent you  fierce agreed the other  but whatever induced you to try for that safe without me they were bound to get you you should have waited  dats right boss if i never says anudder word i was a farmer for fair at de game witout youse but i tought id try to do someting so dat id have someting to show youse when you come back so i says heres dis safe and heres me and ill get busy wit it and den mr chames will be pleased for fair when he gets back so i has a try and dey gets me while im at it well cut out dat part  well its over now at any rate what have you been doing since you came to england  gettin moved on by de cops mostly an sleepin in de park  well you neednt sleep in the park any more spike you can pitch your moving tent with me and youll want some clothes well get those tomorrow youre the sort of figure they can fit off the peg youre not too tall which is a good thing  bad ting for me mr chames if id bin taller id have stood for being a new york cop and bin buying a brownstone house on fifth avenue by this its de cops makes de big money in old manhattan dats who it is  youre right there said jimmy at least partly i suppose half the new york force does get rich by graft there are honest men among them but we didnt happen to meet them  thats right we didnt dere was old man mceachern  mceachern yes if any of them got rich he would be the man he was the worst grafter of the entire bunch i could tell you some stories about old pat mceachern spike if half those yarns were true he must be a wealthy man by now we shall hear of him running for mayor one of these days  say mr chames wasnt youse struck on de goil  what girl said jimmy quietly  old man mceacherns goil molly dey used to say dat youse was her steady  if you dont mind spike friend of my youth well cut out that said jimmy when i want my affairs discussed ill mention it till thensee  sure said spike who saw nothing beyond the fact dimly realized that he had said something which had been better left unsaid  jimmy chewed the stem of his pipe savagely spikes words seemed to have touched a spring and let loose feelings which he had kept down for three years molly mceachern so they used to say that he was engaged to molly he cursed spike mullins in his heart wellmeaning blundering spike who was now sitting on the edge of his chair drawing sorrowfully at his cigar and wondering what he had done to give offense the years fell away from jimmy and he was back in new york standing at the corner of fortysecond street with half an hour to wait because the fear of missing her had sent him there too early sitting in central park with her while the squirrels came down and begged for nuts walkingdamn spike they had been friends nothing more he had never said a word her father had warned her against him old pat mceachern knew how he got his living and could have put his hand on the author of half a dozen burglaries by which the police had been officially baffled that had been his strong point he had never left tracks there was never any evidence but mceachern knew and he had intervened stormily when he came upon them together and molly had stood up for him till her father had apologized confusedly raging inwardly the while at his helplessness it was after that  mr chames said spike  jimmys wits returned  hullo he said  mr chames whats doing here put me next to de game is it de old lay youll want me wit youse i guess  jimmy laughed and shut the door on his dreams  id quite forgotten i hadnt told you about myself spike do you know what a baronet is  search me whats de answer  a baronets the noblest work of man spike i am one let wealth and commerce laws and learningor is it art and learningdie but leave us still our old nobility im a big man now spike i can tell you  gee  my position has also the advantage of carrying a good deal of money with it  plunks  you have grasped it plunks dollars doubloons i line up with the thickwads now spike i dont have to work to turn a dishonest penny any longer  the horrid truth sank slowly into the others mind  say what mr chames youse dont need to go on de old lay no more youre cutting it out for fair  thats the idea  spike gasped his world was falling about his ears now that he had met mr chames again he had looked forward to a long and prosperous partnership in crime with always the master mind behind him to direct his movements and check him if he went wrong he had looked out upon the richness of london and he had said with blücher what a city to loot  and here was his leader shattering his visions with a word  have another drink spike said the lost leader sympathetically its a shock to you i guess  i tought mr chames  i know you did and im very sorry for you but it cant be helped noblesse oblige spike we of the old aristocracy mustnt do these things we should get ourselves talked about  spike sat silent with a long face jimmy slapped him on the shoulder  after all he said living honestly may be the limit for all we know numbers of people do it ive heard and enjoy themselves tremendously we must give it a trial spike well go out together and see life pull yourself together and be cheerful spike  after a moments reflection the other grinned howbeit faintly  thats right said jimmy pitt youll be the greatest success ever in society all you have to do is to brush your hair look cheerful and keep your hands off the spoons for in society spike they invariably count them after the departure of the last guest  sure said spike as one who thoroughly understood this sensible precaution  and now said jimmy well be turning in can you manage sleeping on the sofa for one night  gee ive bin sleepin on de embankment all de last week dis is to de good mister chames     chapter iii   in the days before the welshman began to expend his surplus energy in playing football he was accustomed whenever the monotony of his everyday life began to oppress him to collect a few friends and make raids across the border into england to the huge discomfort of the dwellers on the other side it was to cope with this habit that corven abbey in shropshire came into existence it met a longfelt want ministering to the spiritual needs of the neighborhood in times of peace it became a haven of refuge when trouble began from all sides people poured into it emerging cautiously when the marauders had disappeared  in the whole history of the abbey there is but one instance recorded of a bandit attempting to take the place by storm and the attack was an emphatic failure on receipt of one ladle full of molten lead aimed to a nicety by john the novice who seems to have been anything but a novice at marksmanship this warrior retired done to a turn to his mountain fastnesses and is never heard of again he would seem however to have passed the word round among his friends for subsequent raiding parties studiously avoided the abbey and a peasant who had succeeded in crossing its threshold was for the future considered to be home and out of the game corven abbey as a result grew in power and popularity abbot succeeded abbot the lake at the foot of the hill was restocked at intervals the lichen grew on the walls and still the abbey endured  but time assisted by his majesty king henry the eighth had done its work the monks had fled the walls had crumbled and in the twentieth century the abbey was a modern country house and the owner a rich american  of this gentleman the world knew but little that he had made money and a good deal of it was certain his name patrick mceachern suggested irish parentage and a slight brogue noticeable however only in moments of excitement supported this theory he had arrived in london some four years back taken rooms at the albany and gone into society  england still firmly believes that wealth accrues to every resident of new york by some mysterious process not understandable of the briton mceachern and his money were accepted by society without question his solecisms which at first were numerous were passed over as so quaint and refreshing people liked his rugged good humor he speedily made friends among them lady jane blunt the still youthful widow of a man about town who after trying for several years to live at the rate of ten thousand per annum with an income of two and a half had finally given up the struggle and drank himself peacefully into the tomb leaving her in sole charge of their one son spencer archbald  possibly because he was the exact antithesis of the late lamented lady jane found herself drawn to mr mceachern whatever his faults he had strength and after her experience of married life with a weak man lady jane had come to the conclusion that strength was the only male quality worth consideration when a year later mceacherns daughter molly had come over it was lady jane who took her under her wing and introduced her everywhere  in the fifth month of the second year of their acquaintance mr mceachern proposed and was accepted the bridegroom said a society paper is one of those typical captains of industry of whom our cousins across the streak can boast so many tall muscular squareshouldered with the bulldog jaw and twinkling gray eye of the born leader you look at him and turn away satisfied you have seen a man  lady jane who had fallen in love with the abbey some years before during a visit to the neighborhood had prevailed upon her squareshouldered lord to turn his twinkling gray eye in that direction and the captain of industry with the remark that here at last was a real bully old surefire english stately home had sent down builders and their like not in single spies but in battalions with instructions to get busy  the results were excellent a happy combination of deep purse on the part of the employer and excellent taste on the part of the architect had led to the erection of one of the handsomest buildings in shropshire to stand on the hill at the back of the house was to see a view worth remembering the lower portion of the hill between the house and the lake had been cut into broad terraces the lake itself with its island with the little boathouse in the centre was a glimpse of fairyland mr mceachern was not poetical but he had secured as his private sanctum a room which commanded this view  he was sitting in this room one evening about a week after the meeting between spennie and jimmy pitt at the savoy  see here jane he was saying this is my point ive been fixing up things in my mind and this is the way i make it out i reckon theres no sense in taking risks when you neednt youve a mighty hightoned bunch of guests here im not saying you havent what i say is it would make us all feel more comfortable if we knew there was a detective in the house keeping his eye skinned im not alluding to any of them in particular but how are we to know that all these social headliners are on the level  if you mean our guests pat i can assure you that they are all perfectly honest  lady jane looked out of the window as she spoke at a group of those under discussion certainly at the moment the sternest censor could have found nothing to cavil at in their movements some were playing tennis some clock golf and the rest were smoking she had frequently complained in her gentle languid way of her husbands unhappily suspicious nature she could never understand it for her part she suspected no one she liked and trusted everybody which was the reason why she was so popular and so often taken in  mr mceachern looked bovine as was his habit when he was endeavoring to gain a point against opposition  they may be on the level he said im not saying anything against any one but ive seen a lot of crooks in my time and its not the ones with the low brows and the cauliflower ears that you want to watch for its the innocent willies who look as if all they could do was to lead the cotillon and wear bangles on their ankles ive had a lot to do with them and its up to a man that dont want to be stung not to go by what a fellow looks like  really pat dear i sometimes think you ought to have been a policeman what is the matter  matter  you shouted  shouted not me spark from my cigar fell on my hand  you know you smoke too much pat said his wife seizing the opening with the instinct which makes an irishman at a fair hit every head he sees  im all right me dear faith i cud smoke wan hondred a day and no harm done  by way of proving the assertion he puffed out with increased vigor at his cigar the pause gave him time to think of another argument which might otherwise have escaped him  when we were married me dear jane he said there was a detective in the room to watch the presents two of them i remimber seeing them at once there go two of the boys i said to mysilf i mean he added hastily two of the police force  but detectives at wedding receptions are quite ordinary nobody minds them you see the presents are so valuable that it would be silly to risk losing them  and are there not valuable things here asked mceachern triumphantly which it would be silly to risk losing and sir thomas is coming today with his wife and you know what a deal of jewelry she always takes about her  oh julia said lady jane a little disdainfully her late husbands brother thomas wife was one of the few people to whom she objected and indeed she was not alone in this prejudice few who had much to do with her did like lady blunt  that rope of pearls of hers said mr mceachern cost forty thousand pounds no less so they say  so she says but if you were thinking of bringing down a detective to watch over julias necklace pat you neednt trouble i believe she takes one about with her wherever she goes disguised as thomas valet  still me dear  pat youre absurd laughed lady jane i wont have you littering up the house with great clumsy detectives you must remember that you arent in horrid new york now where everybody you meet wants to rob you who is it that you suspect who is thewhat is the word youre so fond of crook thats it who is the crook  i dont want to mention names said mceachern cautiously and i cast no suspicions but who is that pale thin willie who came yesterday the one that says the clever things that nobody understands  lulu wesson why patrick hes the most delightful boy what can you suspect him of  i dont suspect him of anything but youll remimber what i was telling about the sort of boy you want to watch thats what that boy is he may be the straightest ever but if i was told there was a crook in the company and wasnt put next who it was hes the boy that would get my vote  what dreadful nonsense you are talking pat i believe you suspect every one you meet i suppose you will jump to the conclusion that this man whom spennie is bringing down with him today is a criminal of some sort  hows that spennie bringing a friend  there was not a great deal of enthusiasm in mceacherns voice his stepson was not a young man whom he respected very highly spennie regarded his stepfather with nervous apprehension as one who would deal with his shortcomings with a vigor and severity of which his mother was incapable the change of treatment which had begun after her marriage with the american had had an excellent effect upon him but it had not been pleasant as nebuchadnezzar is reported to have said of his vegetarian diet it may have been wholesome but it was not good mceachern for his part regarded spennie as a boy who would get into mischief unless he had an eye fixed upon him so he proceeded to fix that eye  yes i must be seeing harding about getting the rooms ready spennies friend is bringing his man with him  who is his friend  he doesnt say he just says hes a man he met in london  hm  and what does that grunt mean i should like to know i believe youve begun to suspect the poor man already without seeing him  i dont say i have but a man can pick up strange people in london  pat youre perfectly awful i believe you suspect every one you meet what do you suspect me of i wonder  thats easy answered said mceachern robbery from the person  what have i stolen  me heart me dear replied mceachern gallantly with a vast grin  after that said his wife i think i had better go i had no idea you could make such pretty speeches pat  well me dear  dont send for that detective it really wouldnt do if it got about that we couldnt trust our guests we should never live it down you wont will you  very well me dear  what followed may afford some slight clue to the secret of mr patrick mceacherns rise in the world it certainly suggests singleness of purpose which is one of the essentials of success  no sooner had the door closed behind lady jane than he went to his writing table took pen and paper and wrote the following letter      to the manager wragges detective agency            holborn bars london e c      sir      with refce to my last of the 28th ult i should be glad if     you would send down immediately one of your best men am making     arrangements to receive him shall be glad if you will instruct     him as follows viz a that he shall stay at the village inn     in character of american seeing sights of england and anxious     to inspect the abbey b that he shall call and ask to see me     i shall then recognize him as old new york friend and move his     baggage from above inn to the abbey yours faithfully                                                  p mceachern      pskindly not send a rube but a real smart man  this brief but pregnant letter cost him some pains in its composition he was not a ready writer but he completed it at last to his satisfaction there was a crisp purity in the style which pleased him he read it over and put in a couple of commas then he placed it in an envelope and lit another cigar     chapter iv   jimmys acquaintance with spennie blunt had developed rapidly in the few days following their first meeting spennie had called next morning to repay the loan and two days later had invited jimmy to come down to shropshire with him which invitation jimmy bored with london had readily accepted spike he had decided to take with him in the rôle of valet the bowery boy was probably less fitted for the post than any one has ever been since the world began but it would not do to leave him at savoy mansions  it had been arranged that they should meet spennie at paddington station accompanied by spike who came within an ace of looking almost respectable in new blue serge jimmy arrived at paddington with a quarter of an hour to spare nearly all london seemed to be at the station with the exception of spennie of that lighthaired and hearted youth there were no signs but just as the train was about to start the missing one came skimming down the platform and hurled himself in for the first ten minutes he sat panting at the conclusion of that period he spoke  dash it he said ive suddenly remembered i never telegraphed home to let em know what train we were coming by now whatll happen is that there wont be anything at corven to meet us and take us up to the abbey and you cant get a cab they dont grow such things  how far is it to walk  five solid miles and uphill most of the way and ive got a bad foot  as a matter of fact said jimmy its just possible that we shall be met after all while i was waiting for you at paddington i heard a man asking if he had to change for corven he may be going to the abbey too  what sort of a looking man  tall thin rather a wreck  probably my uncle thomas frightful man always trying to roast a chap dont you know still theres one consolation if it is uncle thomas theyll have sent the automobile for him i shouldnt think hed ever walked more than a hundred yards in his natural not at a stretch he generally stays with us in the summer i wonder if hes bringing aunt julia with him you didnt see her i suppose by any chance tall and talks to beat the band he married her for her money concluded spennie charitably  isnt she attractive either  aunt julia said spennie with feeling is the absolute limit wait till you see her sort of woman who makes you feel that your hands are the color of a frightful tomato and the size of a billiard table if you know what i mean by gad though you should see her jewels its perfectly beastly the way that woman crams them on shes got one rope of pearls which is supposed to have cost forty thousand pounds look out for it tonight at dinner its worth seeing  jimmy pitt was distressed to feel distinct symptoms of a revival of the old adam as he listened to these alluring details it was trying a reformed man a little high he could not help thinking with some indignation to dangle forty thousand pounds worth of pearls before his eyes over the freshly turned sods of the grave of his past it was the sort of test which might have shaken the resolution of the oldest established brand from the burning  he could not keep his mind from dwelling on the subject even the fact thatcommerciallythere was no need for him to think of such things could not restrain him he was rich now and could afford to be honest he tried to keep that fact steadily before him but instinct was too powerful his operations in the old days had never been conducted purely with an eye to financial profit he had collected gems almost as much for what they were as for what they could bring many a time had the faithful spike bewailed the flaw in an otherwise admirable character which had induced his leader to keep a portion of the spoil instead of converting it at once into good dollar bills it had had to go sooner or later but jimmy had always clung to it as long as possible to spike a diamond brooch of cunning workmanship was merely the equivalent of so many plunks that a man otherwise more than sane should value a jewel for its own sake was to him an inexplicable thing  jimmy was still deep in thought when the train which had been taking itself less seriously for the last half hour stopping at stations of quite minor importance and generally showing a tendency to dawdle halted again a board with the legend corven in large letters showed that they had reached their destination  here we are said spennie hop out now whats the betting that there isnt room for all of us in the bubble  from farther down the train a lady and gentleman emerged  thats the man is that your uncle said jimmy  guilty said spennie gloomily i suppose wed better go and tackle them come on  they walked up the platform to where sir thomas stood smoking a meditative cigar and watching in a dispassionate way the efforts of his wife to bully the solitary porter attached to the station into a frenzy sir thomas was a very tall very thin man with cold eyes and tight thin lips his clothes fitted him in the way clothes do fit one man in a thousand they were the best part of him his general appearance gave one the idea that his meals did him little good and his meditations rather less his conversationof which there was not a great dealwas designed for the most part to sting many years patient and painstaking sowing of his wild oats had left him at fiftysix with few pleasures but among those that remained he ranked high the discomfiting of his neighbors  this is my friend pitt uncle said spennie presenting jimmy with a motion of the hand  sir thomas extended three fingers jimmy extended two and the handshake was not a success  at this point in the interview spike came up chuckling amiably with a magazine in his hand  pchee said spike say mr chames de mug what wrote dis piece must ha bin livin out in de woods for fair his stunt aint writin sure say deres a gazebo what wants to get busy wit de heroines jools whats locked in de drawer in de dressin room so dis mug what do youse tink he does why  another friend of yours spennie inquired sir thomas politely eying the redhaired speaker with interest  its  he looked appealingly at jimmy  its only my man said jimmy spike he added in an undertone to the woods chase yourself its not up to you to do stunts on this beat fade away  sure said the abashed spike restored to a sense of his position dats right ive got wheels in me coco thats what ive got comin buttin in here sorry mr chames sorry gents me for the tall grass  he trotted away  your man seems to have a pretty taste in literature said sir thomas to jimmy well my dear finished your chat with the porter  lady blunt had come up flushed and triumphant having left the solitary porter a demoralized wreck  im through she announced crisply well spencer how are you whos this dont stand gaping child whos your friend  spennie explained with some incoherence that his name was pitt his uncle had shaken him the arrival of his aunt seemed to unnerve him completely  pleased to meet you snapped lady blunt spencer where are your trunks left them behind i suppose no well thats a surprise tell that porter to look after them if you have any trouble with him mention it to me ill make him jump around wheres the automobile outside where take me to it  lady blunt when conversing resembled a maxim gun more than anything else in the world  im afraid said spennie in an abject manner as they left the station that it will be rather a bit of a frightful squashwhat i mean to say is i hardly think we shall all find room in the auto i see they have only sent the small one  lady blunt stopped short and fixed him with a glittering eye  i know what it is spencer she said you never telegraphed to your mother to tell her what time you were going to arrive  spennie opened his mouth feebly but apparently changing his mind made no reply  my dear said sir thomas smoothly we must not expect too much of spennie  pshaw this was a single shot from the maxim  the baited youth looked vainly for assistance to jimmy  buteraunt said spennie really ieri only just caught the train didnt i pitt  what oh yes got in just as it was moving  that was it i really hadnt time to telegraph had i pitt  not a minute  and how was it you were so late  spennie plunged into an explanation feeling all the time that he was making things worse for himself nobody is at his best in the matter of explanations if a lady whom he knows to be possessed of a firm belief in the incurable weakness of his intellect is looking fixedly at him during the recital a prolonged conversation with lady blunt always made him feel exactly as if he were being tied into knots  all this said sir thomas as his nephew paused for breath is very very characteristic of our dear spennie  our dear spennie broke into a perspiration  however continued sir thomas theres room for either you or  pitt said jimmy pi double t  sir thomas bowed  in front with the chauffeur if you care to take the seat  ill walk said jimmy id rather  frightfully good of you old chap whispered spennie sure you dont mind i do hate walking and my foots hurting fearfully  which is my way  straight as you can go you go to the  spennie said sir thomas suavely your aunt expresses a wish to arrive at the abbey in time for dinner if you could manage to come to some arrangement about that seat  spennie climbed hurriedly into the automobile the last jimmy saw of him was a hasty vision of him being prodded in the ribs by lady blunts parasol while its owner said something to him which judging by his attitude was not pleasant  he watched them out of sight and started to follow at a leisurely pace it certainly was an ideal afternoon for a country walk the sun was just hesitating whether to treat the time as afternoon or evening eventually it decided that it was evening and moderated its beams after london the country was deliciously fresh and cool jimmy felt as the scent of the hedges came to him that the only thing worth doing in the world was to settle down somewhere with three acres and a cow and become pastoral  there was a marked lack of traffic on the road once he met a cart and once a flock of sheep with a friendly dog sometimes a rabbit would dash out into the road stop to listen and dart into the opposite hedge all hind legs and white scut but except for these he was alone in the world  and gradually there began to be borne in upon him the conviction that he had lost his way  it is difficult to judge distance when one is walking but it certainly seemed to jimmy that he must have covered five miles by this time he must have mistaken the way he had certainly come straight he could not have come straighter on the other hand it would be quite in keeping with the cheap substitute which served spennie blunt in place of a mind that he should have forgotten to mention some important turning jimmy sat down by the roadside  as he sat there came to him from down the road the sound of a horses feet trotting he got up here was somebody at last who would direct him  the sound came nearer the horse turned the corner and jimmy saw with surprise that it bore no rider  hullo he said accident and by jove a side saddle  the curious part of it was that the horse appeared in no way a wild horse it did not seem to be running away it gave the impression of being out for a little trot on its own account a sort of equine constitutional  jimmy stopped the horse and led it back the way it had come as he turned the bend in the road he saw a girl in a riding habit running toward him she stopped running when she caught sight of him and slowed down to a walk  thank you so much she said taking the reins from him oh dandy you naughty old thing  jimmy looked at her flushed smiling face and uttered an exclamation of astonishment the girl was staring at him openeyed  molly he cried  jimmy  and then a curious feeling of constraint fell simultaneously upon them both     chapter v   how are you molly  quite well thank you jimmy  a pause  youre looking very well  im feeling very well how are you  quite well thanks very well indeed  another pause  and then their eyes met and at the same moment they burst out laughing  your manners are beautiful jimmy and im so glad youre so well what an extraordinary thing us meeting like this i thought you were in new york  i thought you were you havent altered a bit molly  nor have you how queer this is i cant understand it  nor can i i dont want to im satisfied without do you know before i met you i was just thinking i hadnt a single friend in this country im on my way to stay with a man ive only known a few days and his people whom i dont know at all and a bunch of other guests whom ive never heard of and his uncle whos a sort of human icicle and his aunt who makes you feel like thirty cents directly she starts to talk to you and the family watchdog who will probably bite me but now you must live near here or you wouldnt be chasing horses about this road  i live at a place called corven abbey  what corven abbey why thats where im going  jimmy oh i see youre spennies friend but where is spennie  at the abbey by now he went in the auto with his uncle and aunt  how did you meet spennie  oh i did a very trifling good samaritan act for which he was unduly grateful and he adopted me from that moment  how long have you been living in england then i never dreamed of you being here  ive been on this side about a week if you want my history in a nutshell its this rich uncle poor nephew deceased uncle rich nephew im a man with money now lots of money  how nice for you jimmy father came into money too thats how i come to be over here i wish you and father had got on better together  your father my dear molly has a manner with people he is not fond of which purists might call slightly abrupt perhaps things will be different now  the horse gave a sudden whinny  i wish you wouldnt do that sort of thing without warning said jimmy to it plaintively  he knows hes near home and he knows its his dinner time there now you can see the abbey how do you like it  they had reached a point in the road where the fields to the right sloped sharply downward a few hundred yards away backed by woods stood the beautiful home which expoliceman mceachern had caused to be builded for him the setting sun lit up the waters of the lake no figures were to be seen moving in the grounds the place resembled a palace of sleep  well said molly  by jove  isnt it said molly im so glad you like it i always feel as if i had invented everything round here it hurts me if people dont appreciate it once i took sir thomas blunt up here it was as much as i could do to induce him to come at all he simply wont walk when we got to where we are standing now i pointed and said there  and what did he do moan with joy  he grunted and said it struck him as rather rustic  beast i met sir thomas when we got off the train spennie blunt introduced me to him he seemed to bear it pluckily but with some difficulty i think we had better be going or they will be sending out search parties  by the way jimmy said molly as they went down the hill can you act  can i what  act in theatricals you know  ive never tried but ive played poker which i should think is much the same  we are going to do a play and we want another man the man who was going to play one of the parts has had to go back to london  poor devil fancy having to leave a place like this and go back to that dingy overrated town                                       the big drawingroom of the abbey was full when they arrived tea was going on in a desultory manner in a chair at the far end of the room sir thomas blunt surveyed the scene gloomily through the smoke of a cigarette the sound of lady blunts voice had struck their ears as they opened the door the maxim gun was in action with no apparent prospect of jamming the target of the moment was a fair tiredlooking lady with a remarkable resemblance to spennie jimmy took her to be his hostess there was a resigned expression on her face which he thoroughly understood he sympathized with her  the other occupants of the room stared for a moment at jimmy in the austere manner peculiar to the briton who sees a stranger and then resumed their respective conversations one of their number a slight pale young man as scientifically clothed as sir thomas left his group and addressed himself to molly  ah here you are miss mceachern he said at last we were all getting so anxious  really said molly thats very kind of you mr wesson  i assure you yes positively a gray gloom had settled upon us we pictured you in all sorts of horrid situations i was just going to call for volunteers to scour the country or whatever it is that one does in such circumstances i used to read about it in books but i have forgotten the technical term i am relieved to find that you are not even dusty though it would have been more romantic if you could have managed a little dust here and there but dont consider my feelings miss mceachern please  molly introduced jimmy to the newcomer they shook hands jimmy with something of the wariness of a boxer in the ring he felt an instinctive distrust of this man why he could not have said perhaps it was a certain subtle familiarity in his manner of speaking to molly that annoyed him jimmy objected strongly to any one addressing her as if there existed between them some secret understanding already the mood of the old new york days was strong upon him his instinct then had been to hate all her male acquaintances with an unreasoning hatred he found himself in much the same frame of mind now  so youre spennies friend said mr wesson the man whos going to show us all how to act what  i believe there is some idea of my being a confused noise without or something  havent they asked you to play lord algernon inquired wesson with more animation than he usually allowed himself to exhibit  who is lord algernon  only a character in the piece we are acting  what does he do  he talks to me most of the time said molly  then said jimmy decidedly i seem to see myself making a big hit  its a long part if you arent used to that sort of thing said wesson  he had hoped that the part with its wealth of opportunity would have fallen to himself  i am used to it said jimmy thanks  if that little beasts after molly thought jimmy there will be trouble  come along said molly and be introduced and get some tea  well molly dear said lady jane with a grateful smile at the interruption we didnt know what had become of you did dandy give you trouble  dandys a darling and wouldnt do anything of the sort if you asked him to hes a kind little oss as thomas says he only walked away when i got off to pick some roses and i couldnt catch him and then i met jimmy  jimmy bowed  i hope you arent tired out said lady jane to him we thought you would never arrive its such a long walk it was really too careless of spennie not to let us know when he expected you  i was telling spencer in the automobile put in lady blunt with ferocity that my father would have horsewhipped him if he had been a son of his he would  really julia protested lady jane rather faintly  thats so and i dont care who knows it a boy doesnt want to forget things if hes going to make his way in the world i told spencer so in the automobile  jimmy had noticed that spennie was not in the room he now understood his absence after the ride he had probably felt that an hour or two passed out of his aunts society would not do him any harm he was now undergoing a rest cure jimmy imagined in the billiard room  i can assure you said he by way of lending a helping hand to the absent one i really preferred to walk i have only just landed in england from new york and its quite a treat to walk on an english country road again  are you from new york i wonder if  jimmys an old friend said molly we knew him very well indeed it was such a surprise meeting him  how interesting said lady jane languidly as if the intellectual strain of the conversation had been too much for her you will have such lots to talk about wont you  i say said jimmy as they moved away who is that fellow wesson  oh a man said molly vaguely  theres no need to be fulsome said jimmy he cant hear  mother likes him i dont  mother  hullo said molly theres father  the door had opened while they were talking and mr patrick mceachern had walked solidly into the room the ornaments on the chippendale tables jingled as he came secretly he was somewhat embarrassed at finding himself in the midst of so many people he had not yet mastered the art of feeling at home in his own house at meals he did not fear his wifes guests so much their attention was in a manner distributed at such times instead of being as now focused upon himself he stood there square and massive outwardly the picture of all that was rugged and independent looking about him for a friendly face to offer a general remark or to go boldly and sit down beside one of those dazzling young ladies like some heavyweight spider beside a miss muffet was beyond him in his time he had stopped runaway horses clubbed mad dogs and helped to break up east side gang fights when the combatants on both sides were using their guns lavishly and impartially but his courage failed him here  why said jimmy is your father here too i didnt know that  to himself he reviled his luck how much would he see of molly now her fathers views on himself were no sealed book to him  molly looked at him in surprise  didnt know she said didnt i tell you the place belonged to father  what said jimmy this house  yes of course  andby gad ive got it he has married spennie blunts mother  yes  well imsurprised  suddenly he began to chuckle  what is it jimmy  whywhy ive just grasped the fact that your fatheryour father mind youis my host im the honored guest at his house  the chuckle swelled into a laugh the noise attracted mceacherns attention and looking in the direction whence it proceeded he caught sight of molly  with a grin of joy he made for the sofa  well father dear said molly nervously  mr mceachern was staring horribly at jimmy who had risen to his feet  how do you do mr mceachern  the expoliceman continued to stare  father said molly in distress father let me presenti mean dont you remember jimmy you must remember jimmy father jimmy pitt whom you used to know in new york     chapter vi   on his native asphalt there are few situations capable of throwing the new york policeman off his balance in that favored clime savoir faire is represented by a shrewd left hook at the jaw and a masterful stroke of the truncheon amounts to a satisfactory repartee thus shall you never take the policeman of manhattan without his answer in other surroundings mr patrick mceachern would have known how to deal with his young acquaintance mr jimmy pitt but another plan of action was needed here first of all the hints on etiquette with which lady jane had favored him from time to time and foremost came the mandate never make a scene scenes lady jane had explainedon the occasion of his knocking down an objectionable cabman during their honeymoon tripwere of all things what polite society most resolutely abhorred the natural man in him must be bound in chains the sturdy blow must give way to the honeyed word a cold really was the most vigorous retort that the best circles would countenance  it had cost mr mceachern some pains to learn this lesson but he had done it and he proceeded on the present occasion to conduct himself high and disposedly according to instructions from headquarters  the surprise of finding an old acquaintance in this company rendered him dumb for a brief space during which jimmy looked after the conversation  how do you do mr mceachern inquired jimmy genially quite a surprise meeting you in england a pleasant surprise by the way one generally shakes hands in the smartest circles yours seem to be down there somewhere might i trouble you right got it thanks  he bent forward possessed himself of mr mceacherns right hand which was hanging limply at its proprietors side shook it warmly and replaced it  wahye asked mr mceachern gruffly giving a pleasing air of novelty to the hackneyed salutation by pronouncing it as one word he took some little time getting into his stride when carrying on polite conversation  very well thank you youre looking as strong as ever mr mceachern  the expoliceman grunted in a conversational sense he was sparring for wind  molly had regained her composure by this time her father was taking the thing better than she had expected  its jimmy father dear she said jimmy pitt  dear old james murmured the visitor  i know me dear i know wahye  still well replied jimmy cheerfully sitting up you will notice he added waving a hand in the direction of his teacup and taking nourishment no further bulletins will be issued  jimmy is staying here father he is the friend spennie was bringing  this is the friend that spennie brought said jimmy in a rapid undertone this is the maiden all forlorn who crossed the seas and lived in the house that sheltered the friend that spennie brought  i see me dear said mr mceachern slowly wah  no ive guessed that one already said jimmy ask me another  molly looked reproachfully at him his deplorable habit of chaffing her father had caused her trouble in the old days it may be admitted that this recreation of jimmys was not in the best taste but it must also be remembered that the relations between the two had always been out of the ordinary great as was his affection for molly jimmy could not recollect a time when war had not been raging in a greater or lesser degree between the expoliceman and himself  it is very kind of you to invite me down here said he we shall be able to have some cozy chats over old times when i was a wanderer on the face of the earth and you  yis yis interrupted mr mceachern hastily somewhere ilse aftherward  you shall choose time and place of course i was only going to ask you how you liked leaving the  united states put in mr mceachern with an eagerness which broadened his questioners friendly smile as the honorable louis wesson came toward them  well im not after saying it was not a wrinch at firrst but i considered it best to lave wall streetwall street ye understand before  i see before you fell a victim to the feverish desire for reckless speculation which is so marked a characteristic of the american business man what  thats it said the other relieved  i too have been speculating said mr wesson as to whether you would care to show me the rose garden miss mceachern as you promised yesterday of all flowers i love roses best you remember bryants lines miss mceachern the rose that lives its little hour is prized beyond the sculptured flower  jimmy interposed firmly im very sorry he said but the fact is miss mceachern has just promised to take me with her to feed the fowls  i gamble on fowls he thought there must be some in a highclass establishment of this kind  id quite forgotten said molly  i thought you had wed better start at once nothing upsets a fowl more than having to wait for dinner  nonsense me dear molly said mr mceachern bluffly run along and show mr wesson the roses nobody wants to waste time over a bunch of hens  perhaps not said jimmy thoughtfully perhaps not i might be better employed here amusing the people by telling them all about our old new york days and  mr mceachern might have been observed and was so observed by jimmy to swallow somewhat convulsively  but as molly promised ye said he  just so said jimmy my own sentiments neatly expressed shall we start miss mceachern  that fellah said mr wesson solemnly to his immortal soul is a damn bounder and cad he added after a moments reflection  the fowls lived in a little world of noise and smells at the back of the stables the first half of the journey thither was performed in silence mollys cheerful little face was set in what she probably imagined to be a forbidding scowl the tilt of her chin spoke of displeasure  if a penny would be any use to you said jimmy breaking the tension  im not at all pleased with you said molly severely  how can you say such savage things and me an orphan too whats the trouble what have i done  you know perfectly well making fun of father like that  my dear girl he loved it brainy badinage of that sort is exchanged every day in the best society you should hear dukes and earls the wit the esprit the flow of soul mine is nothing to it whats this in the iron pot is this what you feed them queer birds hensi wouldnt touch the stuff for a fortune it looks perfectly poisonous flock around you pullets come in your thousands all bad nuts returned and a souvenir goes with every corpse a little more of this putrescent mixture for you sir certainly pick up your dead pick up your dead  an unwilling dimple appeared on mollys chin like a sunbeam through clouds  all the same she said you ought to be ashamed of yourself jimmy  i havent time when i find myself stopping in the same house with a girl ive been looking for for three years  molly looked away there was silence for a moment  used you ever to think of me she said quietly  that curious constraint which had fallen upon jimmy in the road came to him again now as sobering as a blow something which he could not define had changed the atmosphere suddenly in an instant like a shallow stream that runs babbling over the stones into some broad still pool the note of their talk had deepened  yes he said simply he could find no words for what he wished to say  ive thought of youoften said molly  he took a step toward her but the moment had passed her mood had changed in a flash or seemed to have changed the stream babbled on over the stones again  be careful jimmy you nearly touched me with the spoon i dont want to be covered with that horrible stuff look at that poor little chicken out there in the cold it hasnt had a morsel  jimmy responded to her lead there was nothing else for him to do  its in luck he said  give it a spoonful  it can have one if it likes but its taking big risks here you are hercules pitch in  he scraped the last spoonful out of the iron pot and they began to walk back to the house  youre very quiet jimmy said molly  i was thinking  what about  lots of things  new york  that among others  dear old new york said molly with a little sigh im not sure it wasnti mean i sometimes wishoh you know i mean its lovely here but it was nice in the old days wasnt it jimmy its a pity that things change isnt it  it depends  what do you mean  i dont mind things changing if people dont  do you think ive changed you said i hadnt when we met in the road  you havent as far as looks go  have i changed in other ways  jimmy looked at her  i dont know he said slowly  they were in the hall now keggs had just left after beating the dressing gong the echoes of it still lingered molly paused on the bottom step  i havent jimmy she said and ran on up the stairs     chapter vii   jimmy dressed for dinner in a very exalted frame of mind that night it seemed to him that he had awakened from a sort of a stupor life was so much fuller of possibilities than he had imagined a few days back the sudden acquisition of his uncles money had in a manner brought him to a halt till then the exhilarating feeling of having his hand against the world had lent a zest to life there had been no monotony there had always been obstacles one may hardly perhaps dilate on the joys of toil in connection with him considering the precise methods by which he had supported himself but nevertheless his emotions when breaking the law of the united states had been akin to those of the honest worker in so far that his operations had satisfied the desire for action which possesses every man of brains and energy they had given him something to do he had felt alive his uncles legacy had left him with a sensation of abrupt stoppage life had suddenly become aimless  but now everything was altered once more the future was a thing of importance tomorrow a day to be looked forward to with keen expectation  he tried to throw his mind back to the last occasion when he had seen molly he could not remember that he had felt any excessive emotion between camaraderie and love there is a broad gulf it had certainly never been bridged in the old new york days then the frank friendliness of which the american girl appears to have the monopoly had been mollys chief charm in his eyes it had made possible a comradeship such as might have existed between men but now there was a difference england seemed to have brought about a subtle change in her instinctively he felt that the old friendship adequate before was not enough now he wanted more the unexpected meeting following so closely upon spikes careless words in london had shown him his true feelings misgivings crept upon him had he a right was it fair he looked back at the last eight years of his life with the eye of an impartial judge he saw them stripped of the glamour which triumphant cunning had lent them saw them as they would appear to molly  he scowled at his reflection in the glass youve been a bad lot my son he said theres only one thing in your favor and that is the fact that youve cut it all out for keeps we must be content with that  there was a furtive rap at the door hullo said jimmy yes  the door opened slowly a grin surmounted by a mop of red hair appeared round the edge of it  well spike come in whats the matter  the rest of mr mullins entered the room

spike seemed to be doubtful he was silent for a moment then as if following upon a train of thoughts he said mr chames dis is a fine big house  splendid  say couldnt we  spike said jimmy warningly  well couldnt we said spike doggedly it aint often youse butts into a deadeasy proposition like dis one we shouldnt have to do a ting excep git busy de stuffs just lying about mr chames  i have noticed

but say dat must be a boid of a necklace dat one youll be seeing it at de dinner mr chames  whatever comment jimmy might have made on this insidious statement was checked by a sudden bang on the door almost simultaneously the handle turned  pchee cried spike its de cop  jimmy smiled pleasantly  come in mr mceachern he said come in journeys end in lovers meeting you know my friend mr mullins i think shut the door and sit down and lets talk of many things     chapter viii   its a conspiracy thundered mr mceachern  he stood in the doorway breathing heavily it has been shown that the expoliceman was somewhat prone to harbor suspicions of those round about him and at the present moment his mind was aflame indeed a more trusting man might have been excused for feeling a little doubtful as to the intentions of jimmy and spike when mceachern had heard that his stepson had brought home a casual london acquaintance he had suspected the existence of hidden motives on the part of the unknown spennie he had told himself was precisely the sort of youth to whom the professional bunkosteerer would attach himself with shouts of joy never he had assured himself had there been a softer proposition than his stepson since bunkosteering became a profession  when he found that the strange visitor was jimmy pitt his suspicions had increased a thousandfold  and when going to his dressing room to get ready for dinner he had nearly run into spike mullins red spike of shameful memory his frame of mind had been that of a man to whom a sudden ray of light reveals the fact that he is on the very brink of a black precipice jimmy and spike had been a firm in new york and here they were together again in his house in shropshire to say that the thing struck mceachern as sinister is to put the matter baldly there was once a gentleman who remarked that he smelt a rat and saw it floating in the air exconstable mceachern smelt a regiment of rats and the air seemed to him positively congested with them  his first impulse had been to rush to jimmys room there and then but lady jane had trained him well though the heavens might fall he must not be late for dinner so he went and dressed and an obstinate tie put the finishing touches to his wrath  jimmy regarded him coolly without moving from the chair in which he had seated himself spike on the other hand seemed embarrassed he stood first on one leg and then on the other as if he were testing the respective merits of each and would make a definite choice later on  ye scoundrels growled mceachern  spike who had been standing for a few moments on his right leg and seemed at last to have come to a decision hastily changed to the left and grinned feebly  say youse wont want me any more mr chames he whispered  no you can go spike  ye stay where yare ye redheaded limb  run along spike said jimmy  the bowery boy looked doubtfully at the huge form of the expoliceman which blocked access to the door  would you mind letting my man pass said jimmy  ye stay began mceachern  jimmy got up and walked round him to the door which he opened spike shot out like a rabbit released from a trap he was not lacking in courage but he disliked embarrassing interviews and it struck him that mr chames was the man to handle a situation of this kind he felt that he himself would only be in the way  now we can talk comfortably said jimmy going back to his chair  mceacherns deepset eyes gleamed and his forehead grew red but he mastered his feelings  an now said he perhaps yell explain  what exactly asked jimmy  what yere doin here  nothing at the moment  ye know what i mane why are ye here you and that redheaded devil  he jerked his head in the direction of the door  i am here because i was very kindly invited to come by your stepson  i know ye  you have that privilege  i know ye i say and i want to know what yere here to do  to do well i shall potter about the garden dont you know and smell the roses and look at the horses and feed the chickens and perhaps go for an occasional row on the lake nothing more oh yes i believe they want me to act in these theatricals  an ill tell ye another thing yell be wanted to do and that is to go away from here at wance  my dear old sir  ye hear me at wance  couldnt think of it said jimmy decidedly not for a moment  ill expose ye stormed mceachern ill expose ye will ye deny that ye was a crook in new york  what proofs have you  proofs will you deny it  no its quite true  i knew it  but im a reformed character now mr mceachern i have money of my own it was left me i hear you had money left you too  i did said mceachern shortly  congratulate you im glad i know because otherwise i might have formed quite a wrong impression when i came here and found you with money to burn quite the old english squire now mr mceachern what  yell lave the house tomorrow  all the more reason why we should make the most of this opportunity of talking over old times did you mind leaving the force  and yell take that blackguard mullins wid ye  judging from the stories one hears it must be a jolly sort of life what a pity so many of them go in for graft i could tell you some stories about a policeman i used to know in new york he was the champion grafter i remember hearing one yarn from a newspaper man out there this reporter chap happened to hear of the grumblings of some tenants of an apartment house uptown which led them to believe that certain noises they complained of were made by burglars who used the flat as a place to pack up the loot for shipment to other cities you know that habit of ours dont you he was quite right and when he tipped off his newspaper they reported the thing to the police now i could have gone right up and made those men show up their hands by merely asking them to  not so the police i wonder if you remember the case you look as if you were beginning to the police went blundering at wrong doors and most of the gang got away and while they were in the house after the raid a woman was able to slip in and take away on an express wagon the three trunks which were to have been held for evidence and thats not all either there was one particular policeman who held the case for the prosecution in his hands if he had played up in court next day the one man that had been captured would have got all that was coming to him what happened why his evidence broke down and the man was discharged its a long story i hope it hasnt bored you  mceachern did not look bored he was mopping his forehead and breathing quickly  it was a most interesting case said jimmy ive got all the names  its a lie  not at all true as anything ever heard of that policemanive got his name toowho made a lot of money by getting appointments in the force for men of his acquaintance he used to be paid heavily for it and youd hardly believe what a lot of scoundrels he let in in that way  see here began mceachern huskily  i wonder if you ever came across any men in the force who made anything by that dodge of arresting a person and then getting a lawyer for them ever heard of that its rather like a double ruff at bridge youim awfully sorry i shouldnt have used that word what i meant to say was the policeman makes his arrest then suggests that the person had better have a bondsman he gathers in a bondsman who charges the prisoner four dollars for bailing him out two dollars of this goes to the sergeant who accepts the bail without question and the policeman takes one then the able and intelligent officer says to the prisoner what you want is a lawyer right says the prisoner if you think so off goes the policeman and gets the lawyer five more dollars of which he gets his share its a beautiful system it might interest the people at dinner tonight to hear about it i think ill tell them  youll  and when you come to think that some policemen in new york take tribute from peddlers who obstruct the traffic tradesmen who obstruct the sidewalk restaurant keepers who keep open after one oclock in the morning drivers who exceed speed limits and keepers of pool rooms youll understand that theres a good bit to be made out of graft if you go in for it seriously its uncommonly lucky mceachern that you were left that money otherwise you might have been tempted mightnt you  there was a somewhat breathless silence in the room mr mceachern was panting slightly  you couldnt reconsider your decision about sending me away tomorrow i suppose said jimmy flicking at his shoes with a handkerchief its a lovely part of the country this i would be sorry to leave it  mr mceacherns brain was working with unwonted rapidity this man must be silenced at all costs it would be fatal to his prospects in english society if one tithe of these gruesome stories were made public and he believed jimmy capable of making them public being guilty thereby of an error of judgment jimmy though he had no respect at all for mr mceachern would have died sooner than spread any story which even in an indirect way could reflect upon molly mr mceachern however had not the advantage of knowing his antagonists feelings and the bluff was successful  ye can stay he said  thanks said jimmy  and ill beg ye not to mention the force at dinner or at any other time  i wont dream of it  they think i made me money on wall street  it would have been a slower job there you were wise in your choice shall we go down to the drawingroom now  ye say yare rich yerself said mceachern  very said jimmy so dont you worry yourself my wall street speculator  mr mceachern did not worry himself he had just recollected that in a very short time he would have a trained detective on the premises any looking after that james willoughby pitt might require might safely be left in the hands of this expert     chapter ix   it was at dinner that jimmy had his first chance of seeing the rope of pearls which had so stimulated the roving fancy of spike mullins lady blunt sat almost opposite to him her dress was of unrelieved black and formed a wonderfully effective foil to the gems it was not a rope of pearls it was a collar her neck was covered with them there was something oriental and barbaric in the overwhelming display of jewelry and this suggestion of the east was emphasized by the wearers regal carriage lady blunt knew when she looked well she did not hold herself like one apologizing for venturing to exist  jimmy stared hungrily across the table the room was empty to him but for that gleaming mass of gems he breathed softly and quickly through clinched teeth  jimmy whispered a voice  it seemed infinitely remote  a hand shook his elbow gently he started  dont stare like that please what is the matter  molly seated at his side was looking at him wideeyed jimmy smiled with an effort every nerve in his body seemed to be writhing  sorry he said im only hungry i always look like that at the beginning of a meal  well here comes keggs with some soup for you youd better not waste another moment you looked perfectly awful  no  like a starved wolf  you must look after me said jimmy see that the wolfs properly fed                                       the conversation becoming general with the fish was not of a kind to remove from jimmys mind the impression made by the sight of the pearls it turned on crime in general and burglary in particular  spennie began it  oh i say he said i forgot to tell you mother number six was burgled the other night  number sixa easton square was the familys london house  burgled  well broken into said spennie gratified to find that he had got the ear of his entire audience even lady blunt was silent and attentive chap got in through the scullery window about one oclock in the morning it was the night after you dined with me pitt  and what did our spennie do inquired sir thomas  oh ieri was out at the time said spennie but something frightened the feller he went on hurriedly and he made a bolt for it without taking anything  jimmy looking down the table became conscious that his hosts eye was fixed gloomily upon him he knew intuitively what was passing in mceacherns mind the expoliceman was feeling that his worst suspicions had been confirmed jimmy had dined with spennieobviously a mere excuse for spying out the land and the very next night the house had been burgled once more mr mceachern congratulated himself on his astuteness in engaging the detective from wragges agency with jimmy above stairs and spike mullins below that sleuthhound would have his hands full  burglary said wesson leaning back and taking advantage of a pause is the hobby of the sportsman and the life work of the avaricious  everybody seemed to have something to say on the subject one young lady gave it as her opinion that she would not like to find a burglar under her bed somebody else had known a man whose father had fired at the butler under the impression that he was a housebreaker and had broken a valuable bust of socrates spennie knew a man at oxford whose brother wrote lyrics for musical comedy and had done one about a burglars best friend being his mother  life said wesson who had had time for reflection is a house which we all burgle we enter it uninvited take all that we can lay hands on and go out again  this mans brother i was telling you about said spennie says theres only one rhyme in the english language to burglar and thats gurgler unless you count pergola he says  personally said jimmy with a glance at mceachern i have rather a sympathy for burglars after all they are one of the hardestworking classes in existence they toil while everybody else is asleep they are generally thorough sportsmen besides a burglar is only a practical socialist philosophers talk a lot about the redistribution of wealth the burglar goes out and does it i have found burglars some of the decentest criminals i have ever met out of business hours they are charming  i despise burglars ejaculated lady blunt with a suddenness which stopped jimmys eloquence as if a tap had been turned off if i found one coming after my jewels and i had a gun handy id shoot him i would  my dear julia said lady jane why suggest such dreadful things at any rate this house has never been burgled and i dont think its likely to be  beroofen said jimmy touching the back of his chair as he did so he met mceacherns eye and smiled kindly at him the expoliceman was looking at him with the gaze of a baffled but malignant basilisk  i take very good care no one gets a chance at my jewels said lady blunt ive had a steel box made for me with a special lock which would drive the cunningest burglar on this earth mad before hed been at it ten minutes it would hed go right away and reform  jimmys lips closed tightly and a combative look came into his eye at this unconscious challenge this woman was too aggressively confident a small lesson he could return the jewels by post it would give her a muchneeded jolt  then he pulled himself up  james my boy he said to himself with severity this is hypocrisy you know perfectly well that is not why you want those pearls dont try and bluff yourself because it wont do  the conversation turned to other topics jimmy was glad of it he wanted to think this thing over  from where he sat he had an excellent view of the rope of pearls which was tugging him back to his old ways and when he looked at them he could not see molly the thing was symbolical it must be one or the other he was at the crossroads the affair was becoming a civil war he felt like a rudderless boat between two currents eight years of gem collecting do not leave a man without a deeprooted passion for the sport as for that steel box that was all nonsense it was probably quite a good steel box and the lock might very well be something out of the ordinary but it could not be a harder job than some of those he had tackled  the pearls shone in the lamplight they seemed to be winking at him     chapter x   in a cozy corner of the electric flame department of the infernal regions there stands a little silver gridiron it is the private property of his satanic majesty and is reserved exclusively for the man who invented amateur theatricals it is hard to see why the amateur actor has been allowed to work his will unchecked for so long these performances of his are diametrically opposed to the true sport of civilization which insists that the good of the many should be considered as being of more importance than that of the few  in the case of amateur theatricals a large number of inoffensive people are annoyed simply in order that a mere handful of acquaintances may amuse themselves usually the whole thing can be laid at the door of the man the organizer he is the serpent in the eden before his arrival the house party were completely happy and asked for nothing else but to be left alone then he arrives at breakfast on his first morning he strikes the first blowcasually helping himself to scrambled eggs the while with the air of a man uttering some agreeable commonplace i say he remarks why not get up some theatricals eve in the person of some young lady who would be a drawingroom reciter if drawingroom reciters were allowed nowadays snatches at the apple oh yes she says it ought to be for a charity suggests somebody else of course for a charity says the serpent ten minutes later he has revealed the fact that he has brought down a little thing of his own which will just do and is casting the parts and after that the man who loves peace and quiet may as well pack up and leave he will have no more rest in that house  in the present case the serpent was a volatile young gentleman of the name of charteris this indomitable person had the love of the stage ineradicably implanted in him he wrote plays and lived in hopes of seeing them staged at the leading theatres meanwhile he was content to bring them out through the medium of amateur performances  it says much for the basic excellence of this mans character that he was popular among his fellows who liking the man overlooked the amateur stage manager  the reign of unrest at the abbey was complete by the time jimmy arrived there the preliminary rehearsals had been gone through with by the company who being inexperienced imagined the worst to be over  having hustled jimmy into the vacant part charteris gave his energy free play he conducted rehearsals with a vigor which occasionally almost welded the rabble which he was coaching into something approaching coherency he never rested he painted scenery and left it aboutwetand people sat on it he nailed up horseshoes for luck and they fell on people he distributed typed parts of the play among the company and they lost them but nothing daunted him  mr charteris said lady blunt after one somewhat energetic rehearsal is indefatigable he whirled me about  this was perhaps his greatest triumph that he had induced lady blunt to take part in the piece her first remark on being asked had been to the effect that she despised acting golden eloquence on the part of the authormanager had induced her to modify this opinion and finally she had consented on the understanding that she was not to be expected to attend every rehearsal to play a small part  the only drawback to an otherwise attractive scheme was the fact that she would not be able to wear her jewels secretly she would have given much to have done so but the scene in which she was to appear was a daylight scene in which the most expensive necklace would be out of place so she had given up the idea with a stoicism that showed her to be of the stuff of which heroines are made  these same jewels had ceased after their first imperious call to trouble jimmy to the extent he had anticipated it had been a bitter struggle during the first few days of his stay but gradually he had fought the craving down and now watched them across the dinner table at night with a calm which filled him with selfrighteousness on the other hand he was uncomfortably alive to the fact that this triumph of his might be merely temporary there the gems were winking and beckoning to him across the table at any moment when his thoughts arrived at this point he would turn theman effort was sometimes necessaryto molly thinking of her he forgot the pearls  but the process of thinking of molly was not one of unmixed comfort a great uneasiness had gripped him more than ever as the days went by he knew that he loved her that now the old easy friendship was a mockery but on her side he could see no signs that she desired a change in their relationship she was still the old molly of the new york days frank cheerful unembarrassed but he found that in this new world of hers the opportunities of getting her to himself for any space of time were infinitesimal it was her unfortunate conviction bred of her american upbringing that the duty of the hostess is to see that her guests enjoy themselves lady jane held the english view that visitors like to be left to themselves and molly noticing her stepmothers lack of enterprise and putting it down as merely another proof of her languid nature had exerted herself all the more keenly to do the honors  the consequence was that jimmy found himself one of a crowd and disliked the sensation  the thing was becoming intolerable here was he a young man in love kept from proposing simply by a series of ridiculous obstacles it could not go on he must get her away somewhere by himself not for a few minutes as he had been doing up to the present but for a solid space of time  it was after a long and particularly irritating rehearsal that the idea of the lake suggested itself to him the rehearsals took place in one of the upper rooms and through the window as he leaned gloomily against the wall listening to a homily on the drama from charteris he could see the waters of the lake lit up by the afternoon sun it had been a terribly hot oppressive day and there was thunder in the air the rehearsal had bored everybody unspeakably it would be heavenly on the lake thought jimmy there was a canadian canoe moored to that willow if he could only get molly  im awfully sorry jimmy said molly as they walked out into the garden i should love to come it would be too perfect but ive half promised to play tennis  who wants to play  mr wesson  a correspondent of a london daily paper wrote to his editor not long ago to complain that there was a wave of profanity passing over the country jimmy added a silent but heartfelt contribution to that wave  give him the slip he said earnestly it was the chance of a lifetime a unique chance perhaps his last chance and it was to be lost for the sake of an ass like wesson  molly looked doubtful  well come down to the water and have a look at it said jimmy thatll be better than nothing  they walked to the waters edge together in silence jimmy in a fever of anxiety he looked behind him no signs of wesson yet all might still be well  it does look nice jimmy doesnt it said molly placing a foot on the side of the boat and rocking it gently  come on said jimmy hoarsely give him the slip get in  molly looked round hesitatingly  welloh bother there he is and hes seen me  jimmy followed her gaze the dapper figure of mr wesson was moving down the lawn he had a tennis racquet in his hand his face wore an inviting smile  jimmy glared at him hopelessly  mr wesson had vanished now behind the great clamp of laurels which stood on the lowest terrace in another moment he would reappear round them  bother said molly again jimmy for gently but with extreme firmness and dispatch jimmy who ought to have known better had seized her hand on the other side of the waist swung her off her feet and placed her carefully on the cushions in the bow of the canoe  then he had jumped in himself with a force which made the boat rock and was now paddling with the silent energy of a dangerous lunatic into the middle of the lake while mr wesson who had by this time rounded the laurels stood transfixed gazing glassily after the retreating vessel  to the casual spectator he might have seemed stricken dumb  but at the end of the first ten seconds any fear that the casual spectator might have entertained as to the permanence of the seizure would have been relieved     chapter xi   the man who lays a hand upon a woman said jimmy paddling strongly save in the way of kindnessim very sorry molly but you didnt seem able to make up your mind you arent angry are you  there was a brief pause while molly apparently debated the matter in her mind  you wouldnt take me back even if i were angry she said  you have guessed it said jimmy approvingly do you read much poetry molly  why  i was only thinking how neatly some of these poets put a thing the chap who said distance lends enchantment to the view for instance take the case of wesson he looks quite nice when you see him at a distance like this with a good strip of water in between  mr wesson was still standing in a statuesque attitude on the bank molly gazing over the side of the boat into the lake abstained from feasting her eyes on the picturesque spectacle  jolly the water looks said jimmy  i was just thinking it looked rather dirty  beastly agreed jimmy  the water as a topic of conversation dried up mr wesson had started now to leave the stricken field there was a reproachful look about his back which harassed mollys sensitive conscience jimmy on the other handmen being of coarser fibre than women especially as to the conscienceappeared in no way distressed at the sight  you oughtnt to have done it jimmy said molly  i had to there seemed to be no other way of ever getting you by yourself for five minutes at a stretch youre always in the middle of a crowd nowadays  but i must look after my guests  not a bit of it let em rip why should they monopolize you  it will be awfully unpleasant meeting mr wesson after this  it is always unpleasant meeting wesson  i shant know what to say  dont say anything  i shant be able to look him in the face  thats a bit of luck for you  you arent much help jimmy  the subject of wesson doesnt inspire me somehowi dont know why besides youve simply got to say you changed your mind youre a woman its expected of you  i feel awfully mean  what you want to do is to take your thoughts off the business keep your mind occupied with something else then youll forget all about it keep talking to me about things thats the plan there are heaps of subjects the weather for instance as a start hot isnt it  were going to have a storm theres a sort of feel in the air wed better go back i think  tush and possibly bah said jimmy digging the paddle into the water weve only just started i say who was that man i saw you talking to after lunch  how soon after lunch  just before the rehearsal he was with your father short chap with a square face dressed in gray i hadnt seen him before  oh that was mr galer a new york friend of fathers  did you know him out in new york  i didnt but he seems to know father very well  whats his name did you say  galer samuel galer did you ever hear of him  never but there were several people in new york i didnt know how did your father meet him over here  he was stopping at the inn in the village and hed heard about the abbey being so old so he came over to look at it and the first person he met was father hes going to stay in the house now the cart was sent down for his things this afternoon did you feel a spot of rain then i wish youd paddle back  not a drop that storms not coming till tonight why its a gorgeous evening  he turned the nose of the boat toward the island which lay cool and green and mysterious in the middle of the lake the heat was intense the sun as if conscious of having only a brief spell of work before it blazed fiercely with the apparent intention of showing what it could do before the rain came the air felt curiously parched  there said molly surely you felt something then  i did  is there time to get back before it begins  no  we shall get soaked  not a bit of it on the other side of the island there is a handy little boathouse sort of place we will put in there  the boathouse was simply a little creek covered over with boards and capable of sheltering an ordinary rowing boat jimmy ran the canoe in just as the storm began and turned her broadside on so that they could watch the rain which was sweeping over the lake in sheets  just in time he said shipping the paddle snug in here isnt it  we should have got wet in another minute i hope it wont last long  i hope it will because ive got something very important to say to you and i dont want to have to hurry it are you quite comfortable  yes thanks  i dont know how to put it exactly i mean i dont want to offend you or anything what i mean to say isdo you mind if i smoke thanks i dont know why it is but i always talk easier if ive got a cigarette going  he rolled one with great deliberation and care molly watched him admiringly  youre the only man ive ever seen roll a cigarette properly jimmy she said everybody else leaves them all flabby at the ends  i learned the trick from a little italian who kept a clothing store in the bowery it was the only useful thing he could do  look at the rain  jimmy leaned forward  molly  i wonder if poor mr wesson got indoors before it began i do hope he did  jimmy sat back again he scowled every man is liable on occasion to behave like a sulky schoolboy jimmy did so  you seem to spend most of your time thinking about wesson he said savagely  molly had begun to hum a tune to herself as she watched the rain she stopped a profound and ghastly silence brooded over the canoe  molly said jimmy at last im sorry  no reply  molly  well  im sorry  molly turned  i wish you wouldnt say things like that jimmy it hurtsfrom you  he could see that there were tears in her eyes  molly dont  she turned her head away once more  i cant help it jimmy it hurts everythings so changed im miserable you wouldnt have said a thing like that in the old days  molly if you knew  its all right jimmy it was silly of me im all right now the rain has stopped lets go back shall we  not yet for gods sake not yet this is my only chance directly we get back it will be the same miserable business all over again the same that its been every day since i came to this place heavens when you first told me that you were living at the abbey i was absolutely happy like a fool i might have known how it would be every day theres a crowd round you i never get a chance of talking to you i consider myself lucky if you speak a couple of words to me if id known the slow torture it was going to be id have taken the next train back to london i cant stand it molly you remember what friends we were in the old days was it ever anything more with you was it is it now  i was very fond of you jimmy he could hardly hear the words  was it ever anything more than that is it now that was three years ago you were a child we were just good friends then i dont want friendship now its not enough i want youyou you were right a moment ago everything has changed for me at least has it for you has it for you molly  on the island a thrush had begun to sing molly raised her head as if to listen the water lapped against the sides of the canoe  has it molly  she bent over and dabbled one finger in the water  ii think it has jimmy she whispered     chapter xii   the honorable louis wesson meanwhile having left the water side lit a cigarette and proceeded to make a moody tour of the grounds he felt aggrieved with the world one is never at ones best and sunniest when a rival has performed a brilliant and successful piece of cuttingout work beneath ones very eyes something of a jaundiced tinge stains ones outlook on life in such circumstances mr wesson did not pretend to himself that he was violently in love with molly but he certainly admired her and intended unless he changed his mind later on to marry her  he walked drawing thoughtfully at his cigarette the more he reviewed the late episode the less he liked it he had not seen jimmy put molly in the canoe and her departure seemed to him a deliberate desertion she had promised to play tennis with him and at the last moment she had gone off with this fellow pitt who was pitt he was always in the wayshoving himself in  at this moment a large warm raindrop fell on his hand from the bushes all round came an everincreasing patter the sky was leaden  he looked round him for shelter he had reached the rose garden in the course of his perambulations at the far end was a summerhouse he turned up his coat collar and ran  as he drew near he heard a slow and dirgelike whistling proceeding from the interior plunging in out of breath just as the deluge began he found spennie seated at the little wooden table with an earnest expression on his face the table was covered with cards  how jim took exercise said spennie glancing up hello wesson by jove isnt it coming down  with which greeting he turned his attention to his cards once more he took one from the pack in his left hand looked at it hesitated for a moment as if doubtful whereabouts on the table it would produce the most artistic effect and finally put it down face upward  then he moved another card from the table and put it on top of the other one throughout the performance he whistled painfully  wesson regarded him with disfavor that looks damned exciting he said he reserved his more polished periods for use in public what are you playing at  whaaa said spennie abstractedly dealing another card  oh dont sit there looking like a frog said wesson irritably talk man  whats the matter what do you want hello ive done it no i havent no luck at all havent brought up a demon all day  he gathered up the cards and began to shuffle ah lov he sang sentimentally with a vacant eye on the roof of the summerhouse could i bot tell thee how moch  oh stop it said wesson  you seem depressed laddie whats the matter ah lov could i bot tell thee  spennie whos this fellow pitt  jimmy pitt pal of mine one of the absolute ay nutty to the core good my lord ah lov could i bot tell  where did you meet him  london why  he and your sister seem pretty good friends  i shouldnt wonder knew each other out in america bridge bridge berridge a capital game for two shuffle and cut and deal away and let the looser payah berridge  well lets have a game then anything for something to do curse this rain we shall be cooped up here till dinner at this rate  double dummys a frightfully rotten game said spennie ever played picquet i could teach it to you in five minutes  a look of almost awe came into wessons face the look of one who sees a miracle performed before his eyes for years he had been using all the large stock of diplomacy at his command to induce callow youths to play picquet with him and here was this admirable young man this pearl among young men positively offering to teach him it was too much happiness what had he done to deserve this he felt as a toilworn lion might have felt if an antelope instead of making its customary bee line for the horizon had expressed a friendly hope that it would be found tender and inserted its head between his jaws  iits very good of you i shouldnt mind being shown the idea  he listened attentively while spennie explained at some length the principles which govern the game of picquet every now and then he asked a question it was evident that he was beginning to grasp the idea of the game  what exactly is repicquing he asked as spennie paused  its like this said spennie returning to his lecture  yes i see now said the neophyte  they began playing spennie as was only to be expected in a contest between teacher and student won the first two hands wesson won the next  ive got the hang of it all right now he said complacently its a simple sort of game make it more exciting dont you think if we played for something  all right said spennie slowly if you like  he would not have suggested it himself but after all hang it if the man simply asked for itit was not his fault if the winning of a hand should have given the fellow the impression that he knew all that there was to be known about picquet of course picquet was a game where skill was practically bound to win butafter all wesson had plenty of money he could afford it  all right said spennie again how much  something fairly moderate ten bob a hundred  there is no doubt that spennie ought at this suggestion to have corrected the novices notion that ten shillings a hundred was fairly moderate he knew that it was possible for a poor player to lose four hundred points in a twentyminute game and usual for him to lose two hundred but he let the thing go  very well he said  twenty minutes later mr wesson was looking somewhat ruefully at the score sheet i owe you eighteen shillings he said shall i pay you now or shall we settle up in a lump after weve finished  what about stopping now said spennie its quite fine out  no lets go on ive nothing to do till dinner and im sure you havent  spennies conscience made one last effort youd much better stop you know wesson really he said you can lose a frightful lot at this game  my dear spennie said wesson stiffly i can look after myself thanks of course if you think you are risking too much by all means  oh if you dont mind said spennie outraged im only too frightfully pleased only remember i warned you  ill bear it in mind by the way before we start care to make it a sovereign a hundred  spennie could not afford to play picquet for a sovereign a hundred or anything like it but after his adversarys innuendo it was impossible for a young gentleman of spirit to admit the humiliating fact he nodded                                       its about time i fancy said mr wesson looking at his watch an hour later that we were going in to dress for dinner  spennie made no reply he was wrapped in thought  lets see thats twenty pounds you owe me isnt it continued mr wesson no hurry of course any time you like shocking bad luck you had  they went out into the rose garden  jolly everything smells after the rain said mr wesson freshened everything up  spennie did not appear to have noticed it he seemed to be thinking of something else his air was pensive and abstracted     chapter xiii   the emotions of a man who has just proposed and been accepted are complex and overwhelming a certain stunned sensation is perhaps predominant blended with this is relief the relief of a general who has brought a difficult campaign to a successful end or of a member of a forlorn hope who finds that the danger is over and he is still alive to this must be added a newly born sense of magnificence of finding oneself to be without having known it the devil of a fellow we have dimly suspected perhaps from time to time that we were something rather out of the ordinary run of men but there has always been a haunting fear that this view was to be attributed to a personal bias in our own favor when however our suspicion is suddenly confirmed by the only judge for whose opinion we have the least respect our bosom heaves with complacency and the world has nothing more to offer  with some accepted suitors there is an alloy of apprehension in the metal of their happiness and the strain of an engagement sometimes brings with it even a faint shadow of regret she makes me buy new clothes one swain in the third quarter of his engagement was overheard to moan to a friend two new ties only yesterday he seemed to be debating within himself whether human nature could stand the strain  but whatever tragedies may cloud the end of the period its beginning at least is bathed in sunshine jimmy regarding his lathered face in the glass as he dressed for dinner that night called himself the luckiest man on earth and wondered if he were worthy of such happiness thinking it over he came to the conclusion that he was not but that all the same he meant to have it  no doubt distressed him it might have occurred to him that the relations between mr mceachern and himself offered a very serious bar to his prospects but in his present frame of mind he declined to consider the existence of the exconstable at all in a world that contained molly there was no room for other people they were not in the picture they did not exist  there are men in the world who through long custom can find themselves engaged without any particular whirl of emotion king solomon probably belonged to this class and even henry the eighth must have become a trifle blasé in time but to the average man the novice the fact of being accepted seems to divide existence into two definite parts before and after a sensitive conscience goads some into compiling a full and unexpurgated autobiography the edition limited to one copy which is presented to the lady most interested some men find a melancholy pleasure in these confessions they like to draw the girl of their affections aside and have a long cozy chat about what scoundrels they were before they met her  but after all the past is past and cannot be altered and it is to be supposed that whatever we may have done in that checkered period we intend to behave ourselves for the future so why harp on it  jimmy acted upon this plan many men in his place no doubt would have steered the conversation skillfully to the subject of the eighth commandment and then said talking about stealing did i ever tell you that i was a burglar myself for about six years jimmy was reticent all that was over he told himself he had given it up he had buried the past why exhume it it did not occur to him to confess his new york crimes to molly any more than to tell her that when seven he had been caned for stealing jam  these things had happened to a man of the name of jimmy pitt it was true but it was not the jimmy pitt who had proposed to molly in the canoe on the lake  the vapid and irreflective reader may jump to the conclusion that jimmy was a casuist and ought to have been ashamed of himself  he will be perfectly right  on the other hand one excuse may urged in his favor his casuistry imposed upon himself  to jimmy shaving there entered in the furtive manner habitual to that unreclaimed buccaneer spike mullins  say mr chames he said  well said jimmy and how goes the world with young lord fitz mullins spike have you ever been best man  on your way whats that  best man at a wedding chap who stands by the bridegroom with a hand on the scruff of his neck to see that he goes through with it fellow who looks after everything crowds the crisp banknotes onto the clergyman after the ceremony and then goes off and marries the first bridesmaid and lives happily ever after  i aint got no use for gettin married mr chames  spike the misogynist you wait spike some day love will awake in your heart and youll start writing poetry  ise not dat kind of mug mr chames protested spike dere was a goil dough only i was never her steady and she married one of de odder boys  why didnt you knock him down and carry her off  he was de lightweight champion of de woild  that makes a difference doesnt it but away with melancholy spike im feeling as if somebody had given me broadway for a birthday present  youse to de good agreed spike  well any news keggs all right how are you getting on  mr chames spike sank his voice to a whisper dats what i chased meself here about deres a mug down in de soivants hall whats a detective yes dats right if i ever saw one  what makes you think so  on your way mr chames cant i tell i could pick out a fly cop out of a bunch of a thousand sure dis mugs vally to sir thomas dats him but he aint no vally hes come to see dat no one dont get

to touch a jewel again unless ive paid for it and got the receipt in my pocket  spike shuffled despondently  all the same said jimmy i shouldnt give yourself away to this detective if he tries pumping you at all give him the frozen face  sure but he aint de only one  what more detectives theyll have to put up house full boards at this rate whos the other  de mug what came dis afternoon ole man mceachern brought him i seed miss molly talking to him  the chap from the inn why thats an old new york friend of mceacherns  anyhow mr chames hes a sleut i can tell em by deir eyes and deir feet and de whole of dem  an idea came into jimmys mind  i see he said our friend mceachern has got him in to spy on us i might have known hed be up to something like that  dats right mr chames  of course you may be mistaken  not me mr chames  anyhow i shall be seeing him at dinner i can get talking to him afterward i shall soon find out what his game is  for the moment molly was forgotten the old reckless spirit was carrying him away this thing was a deliberate challenge he had been on parole he had imagined that his word was all that mceachern had to rely on but if the policeman had been working secretly against him all this time his parole was withdrawn automatically the thought that if he did nothing mceachern would put it down complacently to the vigilance of his detective and his own astuteness in engaging him stung jimmy his six years of burglary had given him an odd sort of professional pride ive half a mind he said softly the familiar expression on his face was not lost on spike  to try for de jools mr chames he asked eagerly  his words broke the spell molly resumed her place the hard look died out of jimmys eyes  no he said not that it cant be done  yes it could mr chames dead easy ive been up to de room and ive seen de box what de jools is put in at night we could get at them easy as pullin de plug out of a bottle say dis is de softest proposition dis house look what i got dis afternoon mr chames  he plunged his hand into his pocket and drew it out again as he unclosed his fingers jimmy caught the gleam of precious stones  he started as one who sees snakes in the grass  what the he gasped  spike was looking at his treasuretrove with an air of affectionate proprietorship  where on earth did you get those asked jimmy  out of one of de rooms dey belonged to one of de loidies it was de easiest old ting ever mr chames i went in when dere was nobody about and dere dey were on de toible i never butted into anyting so soft mr chames  spike  yes mr chames  do you remember the room you took them from  sure it was de foist on de  then just listen to me for a moment when were at dinner youve got to go to that room and put those things backall of them mind youjust where you found them do you understand  spikes jaw had fallen  put dem back mr chames he faltered  every single one of them  mr chames said spike plaintively  youll bear it in mind directly dinner has begun every one of those things goes back where it belongs see  very well mr chames  the dejection in his voice would have moved the sternest to pity gloom had enveloped spikes spirit the sunlight had gone out of his life     chapter xiv   spennie blunt meanwhile was not feeling happy out of his life too had the sunshine gone his assets amounted to one pound seven and fourpence and he owed twenty pounds he had succeeded after dinner in borrowing five pounds from jimmy who was in the mood when he would have lent five pounds to anybody who asked for it but beyond that he had had no successes in the course of a borrowing tour among the inmates of the abbey  in the seclusion of his bedroom he sat down to smoke a last cigarette and think the thing over in all its aspects he could see no way out of his difficulties the thought had something of the dull persistency of a toothache it refused to leave him if only this had happened at oxford he knew of twenty kindly men who would have rallied round him and placed portions of their fathers money at his disposal but this was july he would not see oxford again for months and in the meantime wesson would be pressing for his money  oh damn he said  he had come to this conclusion for the fiftieth time when the door opened and his creditor appeared in person to spennie he looked like the embodiment of fate a sort of male nemesis  i want to have a talk with you spennie said wesson closing the door  well  wesson lit a cigarette and threw the match out of the window before replying  look here spennie he said i want to marry miss mceachern  spennie was in no mood to listen to the love affairs of other men  oh he said  yes and i want you to help me  help you  you must have a certain amount of influence with her shes your sister  stepsister  same thing  well anyhow its no good coming to me nobodys likely to make molly do a thing unless she wants to i couldnt if i tried for a year were good pals and all that but shed shut me up like a knife if i went to her and said i wanted her to marry some one  not being a perfect fool said wesson impatiently i dont suggest that you should do that  whats the idea then  you can easily talk about me to her praise me and so on  spennies eyes opened wide  praise you how  thanks said wesson with a laugh if you cant think of any admirable qualities in me youd better invent some  i should feel such a silly ass  that would be a new experience for you wouldnt it and then you can arrange it so that i shall get chances of talking to her you can bring us together  spennies eyes became rounder  you seem to have mapped out quite a programme for me  shell listen to you you can help me a lot  can i  wesson threw away his cigarette  and theres another thing he said you can queer that fellow pitts game shes always with him now you must get her away from him run him down to her and get him out of this place as soon as possible you invited him here he doesnt expect to stop here indefinitely i suppose if you left hed have to too what you must do is to go back to london directly after the theatricals are over hell have to go with you then you can drop him in london and come back  it is improbable that wesson was blind to certain blemishes which could have been urged against this ingenious scheme by a critic with a nice sense of the honorable but in his general conduct of life as in his play at cards he was accustomed to ignore the rules when he felt disposed to do so he proceeded to mention in detail a few of the things which he proposed to call upon his ally to do a delicate pink flush might have been seen to spread over spennies face he began to look like an angry rabbit he had not a great deal of pride in his composition but the thought of the ignominious rôle which wesson was sketching out for him stirred what he had to its shallow depths  talking on wesson managed with his final words to add the last straw  of course he said that money you lost to me at picquetwhat was it ten twenty twenty pounds wasnt it well we could look on that as canceled of course that will be all right  spennie exploded  will it he cried pink to the ears will it by george ill pay you every frightful penny of it before the end of the week what do you take me for i should like to know  a fool if you refuse my offer  ive a fearfully good mind to give you a most frightful kicking  i shouldnt try spennie if i were you its not the form of indoor game at which youd shine better stick to picquet  if you think i cant pay you your rotten money  i do but if you can so much the better money is always useful  i may be a fool in some ways  you understate it my dear spennie  but im not a cad  youre getting quite rosy spennie wrath is good for the complexion  and if you think you can bribe me to do your dirty work you never made a bigger mistake in your life  yes i did said wesson when i thought you had some glimmerings of intelligence but if it gives you any pleasure to behave like the juvenile lead in a melodrama by all means do personally i shouldnt have thought the game would be worth the candle your keen sense of honor i understand you to say will force you to pay your debt its an expensive luxury nowadays spennie you mentioned the end of the week i believe that will suit me admirably but if you change your mind my offer is still open good night galahad     chapter xv   for pure discomfort there are few things in the world that can compete with the final rehearsals of an amateur theatrical performance at a country house every day the atmosphere becomes more and more heavily charged with restlessness and irritability the producer of the piece especially if he is also the author of it develops a sort of intermittent insanity he plucks at his mustache if he has one at his hair if he has not he mutters to himself he gives vent to occasional despairing cries the soothing suavity which marked his demeanor in the earlier rehearsals disappears he no longer says with a winning smile splendid old man splendid couldnt be better but i think well take that over just once more if you dont mind you missed out a few rather good lines and you forgot to give miss robinson her cue for upsetting the flowerpot instead he rolls his eyes and snaps out once more please thisll never do at this rate we might just as well cut out the show altogether for heavens sake brown do try and remember your lines its no good having the best part in the piece if you go and forget everything youve got to say whats that all right on the night no it wont be all right on the night and another thing you must remember to say how calm and peaceful the morning is or how on earth do you think miss robinson is going to know when to upset that flowerpot now then once more and do pull yourself together this time after which the scene is sulkily resumed by the now thoroughly irritated actors and conversation when the parties concerned meet subsequently is cold and strained  matters had reached this stage at the abbey everybody was thoroughly tired of the piece and but for the thought of the disappointment whichpresumablywould rack the neighboring nobility and gentry if it were not to be produced would have resigned without a twinge of regret people who had schemed to get the best and longest parts were wishing now that they had been content with first footman or giles a villager  ill never run an amateur show again as long as i live confided charteris to jimmy almost tearfully the night before the production its not good enough most of them arent wordperfect yet and weve just had the dress rehearsal  itll be all right on  oh dont say itll be all right on the night  i wasnt going to said jimmy i was going to say itll be all right after the night people will soon forget how badly the thing went  youre a nice comforting sort of man arent you said charteris  why worry said jimmy if you go on like this itll be westminster abbey for you in your prime youll be getting brain fever  jimmy himself was feeling particularly cheerful he was deriving a keen amusement at present from the manoeuvres of mr samuel galer of new york this lynxeyed man having been instructed by mr mceachern to watch jimmy was doing so with a pertinacity which would have made a man with the snowiest of consciences suspicious if jimmy went to the billiard room after dinner mr galer was there to keep him company if during the course of the day he had occasion to fetch a handkerchief or a cigarette case from his bedroom he was sure on emerging to stumble upon mr galer in the corridor the employees of wragges detective agency ltd believed in earning their salaries occasionally after these encounters jimmy would come upon sir thomas blunts valet the other man in whom spikes trained eye had discerned the distinguishing trait of the detective he was usually somewhere round the corner at these moments and when collided with apologized with great politeness it tickled jimmy to think that both these giant brains should be so greatly exercised on his account  spennie meanwhile had been doing quite an unprecedented amount of thinking quite an intellectual pallor had begun to appear on his normally pink cheeks he had discovered the profound truth that it is one thing to talk about paying ones debts another actually to do it and that this is more particularly the case when we owe twenty pounds and possess but six pounds seven shillings and fourpence spennie was acutely conscious of the fact that if he could not follow up his words to wesson with actual coin the result would be something of an anticlimax somehow or other he would have to get the moneyand at once the difficulty was that no one seemed at all inclined to lend it to him  there is a good deal to be said against stealing as a habit but it cannot he denied that in certain circumstances it offers an admirable solution of a difficulty and if the penalties were not so exceedingly unpleasant it is probable that it would become far more fashionable than it is  spennies mind did not turn immediately to this outlet from his embarrassment he had never stolen before and it did not occur to him directly to do so now there is a conservative strain in all of us but gradually as it was borne in upon him that it was the only course possible unless he applied to his stepfathera task for which his courage was not sufficienthe found himself contemplating the possibility of having to secure the money by unlawful means by lunch time on the morning of the day fixed for the theatricals he had decided definitely to do so by dinner time he had fixed upon the object of his attentions  with a vague idea of keeping the thing in the family he had resolved to make his raid upon sir thomas blunt somehow it did not seem so bad robbing ones relatives  a mans first crime is as a rule a shockingly amateurish affair now and then it is true we find beginners forging with the accuracy of old hands or breaking into houses with the finish of experts but these are isolated cases the average tyro lacks generalship altogether spennie may be cited as a typical novice it did not strike him that inquiries might be instituted by sir thomas when he found his money gone and that wesson finding a man whom he knew to be impecunious suddenly in possession of twenty pounds might have suspicions his mind was entirely filled with the thought of getting the money there was no room in it for any other reflection  his plan was simple sir thomas he knew always carried a good deal of money with him it was unlikely that he kept this on his person in the evening a man to whom the set of his clothes is as important as it was to sir thomas does not carry a pocketbook full of banknotes when he is dressed for dinner he would leave it somewhere reasoned spennie where he asked himself the answer was easy in his dressing room spennies plan of campaign was complete  the theatricals began at halfpast eight the audience had been hustled into their seats happier than is usual in such circumstances from the rumor that the proceedings were to terminate with an informal dance the abbey was singularly well constructed for such a purpose there was plenty of room and a sufficiency of retreat for those who sat out in addition to a conservatory large enough to have married off half the couples in the county the audience was in an excellent humor and the monologue the first item of the programme was received with a warmth which gave charteris whom rehearsals had turned into a pessimist a faint hope that the main item on the programme might not be the complete failure it had promised to be  spennies idea had been to get through his burglarious specialty during the monologue when his absence would not be noticed it might be that if he disappeared later in the evening people would wonder what had become of him  he lurked apart till the last of the audience had taken their seats as he was passing through the hall a hand fell on his shoulder conscience makes cowards of us all spennie bit his tongue and leaped three inches into the air  hello charteris he said gaspingly  spennie my boyhoods only friend said charteris where are you off to  whatwhat do you mean i was just going upstairs  then dont youre wanted our prompter cant be found i want you to take his place till he blows in come along  the official prompter arrived at the end of the monologue with the remark that he had been having a bit of a smoke in the garden and his watch had gone wrong leaving him to discuss the point with charteris spennie slipped quietly away and flitted up the stairs toward sir thomas dressing room at the door he stopped and listened there was no sound the house might have been deserted he opened the door and switched on the electric light  fortune was with him on the dressing table together with a bunch of keys and some small change lay a brown leather pocketbook evidently sir thomas did not share lady blunts impression that the world was waiting for a chance to rob him as soon as his back was turned  spennie opened the pocketbook and counted the contents there were two tenpound notes and four of five pounds  he took a specimen of each variety replaced the pocketbook and crept out of the door  then he walked rapidly down the corridor to his own room  just as he reached it he received a shock only less severe than the former one from the fact that this time no hand was placed on his shoulder  spennie cried a voice  he turned to see molly she wore the costume of the stage milkmaid coming out of her room after dressing for her part she had been in time to see spennie emerge through sir thomas door with a look on his face furtive enough to have made any jury bring in a verdict of guilty on any count without further evidence she did not know what he had been doing but she was very certain that it was something which he ought to have left undone  erhullo molly said spennie bonelessly  what were you doing in uncle thomas room spennie  nothing i was just looking round  just looking round  thats all  molly was puzzled  why did you look like that when you came out  like what  so guilty  guilty what are you talking about  molly suddenly saw light  spennie she said what were you putting in your pocket as you came out  putting in my pocket said spennie rallying with the desperation of one fighting a lost cause what do you mean  you were putting something  another denial was hovering on spennies lips when in a flash he saw what he had not seen before the cloud of suspicion which must hang over him when the loss of the notes was discovered sir thomas would remember that he had tried to borrow money from him wesson would wonder how he had become possessed of twenty pounds and molly had actually seen him coming out of the room putting something in his pocket  he threw himself at the mercy of the court  its like this molly he said and having prefaced his narrative with the sound remark that he had been a fool he gave her a summary of recent events  i see said molly and you must pay him at once  by the end of the week we hadwe had a bit of a row  what about  oh nothing said spennie anyhow i told him id pay him by saturday and i dont want to have to climb down  of course not jimmy shall lend you the money  who jimmy pitt  yes  but i say look here molly i mean ive been to him already he lent me a fiver he might kick if i tried to touch him again so soon  ill ask him for it  but look here molly  jimmy and i are engaged spennie  what not really i say im frightfully pleased hes one of the best im fearfully glad why thats absolutely topping itll be all right ill sweat to pay him back ill save out of my allowance i can easily do it if i cut out a few things and dont go about so much youre a frightfully good sort molly i say will you ask him tonight i want to pay wesson first thing tomorrow morning  very well youd better give me those notes spennie ill put them back  the amateur cracksman handed over his loot and retired toward the stairs molly could hear him going down them three at a time in a whirl of relief and good resolutions she went to sir thomas room and replaced the notes having done this she could not resist the temptation to examine herself in the glass for a few moments then she turned away switched off the light and was just about to leave the room when a soft footstep in the passage outside came to her ears  she shrank back she felt a curiously guilty sensation as if she had been in the room with criminal rather than benevolent intentions her motives in being where she was were excellentbut she would wait till this person had passed before coming out into the passage  then it came to her with a shock that the person was not going to pass the footsteps halted outside the door  there was a curtain at her side behind which hung certain suits of sir thomas she stepped noiselessly behind this  the footsteps passed on into the room     chapter xvi   jimmy had gone up to his room to put on the costume he was to wear in the first act at about the time when spennie was being seized upon by charteris to act as prompter as he moved toward the stairs a squarecut figure appeared  it was the faithful galer  there was nothing in his appearance to betray the detective to the unskilled eye but years of practice had left spike with a sort of sixth sense as regarded the force he could pierce the subtlest disguise jimmy had this gift in an almost equal degree and it had not needed mr galers constant shadowing of himself to prove to jimmy the correctness of spikes judgment he looked at the representative of wragges detective agency ltd as he stood before him now taking in his every detail the square unintelligent face the badly cut clothes the clumsy heels the enormous feet  and this he said to himself is the man mceachern thinks capable of tying my hands there were moments when the spectacle of mr galer filled jimmy with an odd sort of fury a kind of hurt professional pride the feeling that this espionage was a direct challenge enraged him behind this clumsy watcher he saw always the selfsatisfied figure of mr mceachern he seemed to hear him chuckling to himself  if it wasnt for molly he said to himself id teach mceachern a lesson im trying to hold myself in and he sets these fool detectives onto me i shouldnt mind if hed chosen somebody who knew the rudiments of the game but galer galer  well mr galer he said aloud you arent trying to escape are you youre coming in to see the show arent you  oh yes said the detective jest wanted to go upstairs for alf a minute you coming too  i was going to dress said jimmy as they went up see you later he added at the door hope youll like the show  he went into his room mr galer passed on                                       jimmy had finished dressing and had picked up a book to occupy the ten minutes before he would be needed downstairs when there burst into the room spike mullins in a state of obvious excitement  gee mr chames  hello spike  spike went to the door opened it and looked up and down the passage  mr chames he said in a whisper shutting the door theres bin doins tonight for fair me cocos still buzzin say i was to sir thomas dressin room  what what were you doing there  spike looked somewhat embarrassed he grinned apologetically and shuffled his feet  ive got dem mr chames he said  got them got what  dese  he plunged his hand in his pocket and drew forth a glittering mass jimmys jaw dropped as he gazed at lady blunts rope of pearls  two hundred tousand plunks murmured spike gazing lovingly at them i says to myself mr chames aint got no time to be getting after dem himself hes too busy dese days wit jollyin along the swells so its up to me i says cos mr chamesll be tickled to deat all right all right if we can git away wit dem so i  jimmy gave

little dinky tings dese poils is boids for fair  good heavens spike you must be mad cant you seeoh lord directly the loss of those pearls is discovered we shall have those detectives after us in a

gwan and off dey went and i lit me lantern again got de jools and chased meself here  jimmy stretched out his hand  all very exciting he said and now youll just hand me those pearls and ill seize the opportunity while the coast is clear to put them back where they belong  only for a moment did spike hesitate then he pulled out the jewels and placed them in jimmys hand mr chames was mr chames and what he said went but his demeanor was tragic telling eloquently of hopes blighted  jimmy took the necklace with a thrill he was an expert in jewels and a fine gem affected him much as a fine picture affects the artistic he went to the light and inspected them gloatingly  as he did so he uttered a surprised exclamation he ran the jewels through his fingers he scrutinized them again more closely this time  then he turned to spike with a curious smile  youd better be going downstairs he said ill just run along and replace them where is the box  its on de floor against de wall near de window mr chames  good better give me that lamp  there was no one in the passage he raced softly along it to sir thomas blunts dressing room  he lit his lamp and found the box without difficulty dropping the necklace in he closed down the lid  theyll want a new lock im afraid he said however  he rose to his feet  jimmy said a startled voice  he whipped round the light of the lamp fell on molly standing pale and openeyed beside the curtain by the door     chapter xvii   pressed rigid against the wall behind her curtain molly had listened in utter bewilderment to the sounds of strife in the passage outside the halfheard conversation between the detectives had done nothing toward a solution of the mystery galers voice she thought she recognized as one that she had heard before but she could not identify it  when the detectives had passed away together down the corridor she had imagined that the adventure was at an end and that she was at liberty to emergecautiouslyfrom her hiding place and follow them downstairs she had stretched out a hand to draw the curtain aside when she caught sight of the yellow ray of the lamp on the floor and shrank back again as she did so she heard the sound of breathing somebody was still in the room  her mystification deepened she had supposed that the tale of visitors to the dressing room was complete with the two who had striven in the passage yet here was another  she strained her ears to catch a sound for a while she heard nothing then came a voice that she knew well and abandoning concealment she came out into the room and found jimmy kneeling on the floor beside the rifled jewel box  for a full minute they stood staring at each other without a word the light of the lamp hurt mollys eyes she put up a hand to shade them the silence was oppressive it seemed to molly that they had been standing like this for years  jimmy had not moved there was something in his attitude which filled molly with a vague fear in the shadow behind the lamp he looked shapeless and inhuman  what are you doing here he said at last in a harsh unnatural voice  i  she stopped  youre hurting my eyes she said  im sorry i didnt think is that better  he turned the light from her face something in his voice and the apologetic haste with which he moved the lamp seemed to relax the strain of the situation the feeling of stunned surprise began to leave her she found herself thinking coherently again  the relief was but momentary why was jimmy in the room at that time why had he a lamp what had he been doing the questions shot from her brain like sparks from an anvil  the darkness began to tear at her nerves she felt along the wall for the switch and flooded the room with light  jimmy laid down the lantern and stood for a moment undecided he looked at molly and suddenly there came over him an overwhelming desire to tell her everything he had tried to stifle his conscience to assure himself that the old days were over and that there was no need to refer to them and for a while he had imposed upon himself but lately the falseness of his position had come home to him he could not allow her to marry him in ignorance of what he had been it would be a villainous thing to do often he had tried to tell her but had failed he saw that it must be done here and now  he lifted the lid of the jewel box and dangled the necklace before her eyes  she drew back  jimmy you werestealing them  no i was putting them back  putting them back  listen im going to tell you the truth mollyive been trying to for days but i never had the pluck i wasnt stealing this necklace but for seven years i lived by this sort of thing  by  by stealing by breaking into houses and stealing there it isnt nice is it but its the truth and whatever happens im glad you know  stealing said molly slowly you  he took a step forward and laid his hand on her arm she shrank away from him his hand fell to his side like lead  molly do you hate me  how could you she whispered how could you  molly i want to tell you a story are you listening its the story of a weak devil who was put up to fight the world and wasnt strong enough for it he got a bad start and he never made it up they sent him to school the best school in the country and he got expelled then they gave him a hundred pounds and told him to make out for himself he was seventeen then seventeen mind you and all he knew was a little latin and greek a very little and nothing else and they sent him out to make his fortune  he stopped  it will be much simpler to tell it in the first person he said with a short laugh i arrived in new yorki was seventeen you will rememberwith ninety pounds in my pocket it seemed illimitable wealth at the time two pounds was the most i had ever possessed before i could not imagine its ever coming to an end in dollars it seemed an inconceivable amount of money i put up at the waldorf i remember i took a cab there i gave the man three dollars  he laughed again  you can guess how long my ninety pounds lasted within a month i had begun to realize that my purse was shallower than i had thought it occurred to me that work of some sort would be an advantage i went round and tried to get some my god remember i was seventeen and absolutely ignorant of every useful trade under the sun  go on  one day i was lunching at the quentin when a man came and sat down at the same table and we got into conversation i had spent the morning answering want advertisements and i was going to break my last twentydollar bill to pay for my lunch i was in the frame of mind when i would have done anything good or bad that would have given me some money the man was very friendly after lunch he took me off to his rooms he had a couple of parlor rooms in fortyfifth street then he showed his hand he was a pretty scoundrel but i didnt care i didnt care for anything except that there seemed to be money to be had from him honesty put a man in new york with nineteen dollars and a few cents in his pockets and no friends and see what happens its a hell for the poor in new york an iron grinding city it frightens you its so big and hard and cruel it takes the fight out of you ive felt it and i know  he stopped and gave a little shiver nine years had passed since that day but a man who has all but gone under in a big city does not readily forget the nightmare horror of it  stonethat was the mans namewas running a tapless wiretapping game youve read about the trick i expect every one has known about it since larry summerfield was sent to sing sing but it was new then there are lots of ways of doing it stones was to hire a room and fix it up to look like a branch of the western union telegraph company he would bring men in there and introduce them to a man he called the manager of the branch who was supposed to get racing results ten minutes before they were sent out to the pool rooms the victim would put up the money for a bet and stone and his friends got it at once stone was looking for an assistant he wanted a man who looked like a gentleman to inspire confidence i looked older than i was and he took me on it was a filthy business but i was in a panic i was with stone eight months then i left him it was too unsavoryeven for me  it was after that that i became a cracksman i wanted money it was no use hoping for work i couldnt get it and i couldnt have done it if i had got it i was a pirate and fit for nothing except piracy one night i met a man in a broadway rathskeller i knew him by sight i had seen him about at places youre with stone arent you he said after we had talked about racing and other things for a while i stared at him in surprise i was frightened too its all right he said i know all about stone you neednt be afraid of me arent you with him i was i said you left him why i told him you seem a bright kid he said join me if you feel like it he was a cracksman i never found out his real name he was always called bob a curious man he had been at harvard and spoke half a dozen languages i think he took to burglary from sheer craving for excitement he used to speak of it as if it were an art i joined him and he taught me all he knew when he diedhe was run over by a cari went on with the thing then my uncle died and i came back to england rich  when i left the lawyers office i made up my mind that i would draw a line across my life i swore i would never crack another crib and when i met you i swore it again  and yet  no it isnt as bad as you think when i was in london i fell in with a man named mullins who used to work with me in the old days he was starving so i took him in and brought him along here with me to keep him out of mischief tonight he came to me with this necklace he had been in here and stolen it i took it from him and came to put it back you believe me dont you molly  yes said she simply  he came a step nearer  molly dont give me up i know ive been a blackguard but i swear thats all over now ive drawn a line right through it i oughtnt to have let myself love you but i couldnt help it i couldnt dear you wont give me up will you if youd only take me in hand you could make what you liked of me id do anything for you any mortal thing you wanted you can make me just anything you please will you try molly  he stopped she held out both her hands to him  the next moment she had gone     chapter xviii   with a wonderful feeling of lightheartedness jimmy turned once more to the jewel box he picked up the lamp and switched off the electric light he had dropped the necklace to the floor and had knelt to recover it when the opening of the door followed by a blaze of light and a startled exclamation brought him to his feet with a bound blinking but alert  in the doorway stood sir thomas blunt his face expressed the most lively astonishment his bulging eyes were fixed upon the pearls in jimmys hand  good evening said jimmy pleasantly  sir thomas stammered it is a disquieting experience to find the floor of ones dressing room occupied by a burglar  whatwhatwhat said sir thomas  out with it said jimmy  what  i knew a man once who stammered said jimmy he used to chew dog biscuit while he was speaking it cured him besides being nutritious  youyou blackguard said sir thomas  jimmy placed the pearls carefully on the dressing table then he turned to sir thomas with his hands in the pockets of his coat it was a tight corner but he had been in tighter in his time and in this instance he fancied that he held a winning card he found himself enjoying the interview  soso its you is it said sir thomas  who told you  so youre a thief went on the baronet viciously a low thief  dash it alli say come now protested jimmy not low you may not know me over here but ive got a big american reputation ask anybody but  and i say added jimmy i know you dont mean to be offensive but i wish you wouldnt call me a thief im a cracksman theres a world of difference between the two branches of the profession i mean well suppose you were an actormanager you wouldnt like to be called a super would you i meanwell you see dont you an ordinary thief for instance would use violence in a case like this violenceexcept in extreme cases i hope this wont be one of themis contrary to cracksmens etiquette on the other hand sir thomas i should like to say that i have you covered  there was a pipe in the pocket of his coat he thrust the stem of this earnestly against the lining sir thomas eyed the protuberance apprehensively and turned a little pale  my gun as you see is in my pocket it is loaded and cocked it is pointing straight at you at the present moment and my finger is on the trigger i may add that i am a dead shot at a yard and a half so i should recommend you not to touch that bell you are looking at  sir thomas hand wavered  do if you like of course said jimmy agreeably in any case i shant fire to kill you i shall just smash your knees beastly painful but not fatal  he waggled the pipe suggestively sir thomas blanched his hand fell to his side  how are the theatricals going asked jimmy did you like the monologue  sir thomas had backed away from the bell but the retreat was merely for the convenience of the moment he understood that it might be inconvenient to press the button just then but he had recovered his composure by this time and he saw that the game must be his jimmy was trapped and he hastened to make this clear to him  how may i ask he said do you propose to leave the abbey  i suppose theyll let me have the automobile said jimmy they can hardly ask me to walk but i wasnt thinking of leaving just yet  you mean to stop  why not its a pretty place  and what steps if i may ask do you imagine i shall take  waltz steps theyre going to have a dance after the show you know you ought to be in that  you wish me in fact to become a silent accomplice to refrain from mentioning this little matter  you put things so well  and do you propose to keep my wifes jewels or may i have them  oh you may have those said jimmy  thank you  i never touch paste  sir thomas failed to see the significance of this remark jimmy repeated it with emphasis  i never touch paste he said and lady blunts necklace is i regret to say made of that material  sir thomas grew purple  mind you said jimmy its very good paste ill say that for it i didnt see through it till i had it in my hands looking at the thingeven quite closei was taken in for a moment  the baronet made strange gurgling noises  paste he said speaking with difficulty paste paste damn your impertinence sir are you aware that that necklace cost forty thousand pounds  then whoever paid that sum for it wasted a great deal of money paste it is and paste it always will be  it cant be paste how do you know  how do i know im an expert ask a jeweler how he knows diamonds from paste he can feel them he can almost smell them  let me look its impossible  certainly i dont know the extent of your knowledge of pearls if it is even moderate i think you will admit that i am right  sir thomas snatched the necklace from the table and darted with it to the electric light he scrutinized it breathing heavily jimmys prophecy was fulfilled the baronet burst into a vehement flood of oaths and hurled the glittering mass across the room the unemotional mask of the man seemed to have been torn off him he shook with futile passion  jimmy watched him in interested silence  sir thomas ran to the jewels and would have crushed them beneath his feet had not jimmy sprang forward and jerked him away from them  be quiet he said confound you sir will you stop that noise  sir thomas unaccustomed to this style of address checked the flood for a moment  now said jimmy you see the situation at present you and i are the only persons alive to the best of our knowledge who know about this stay though there must be one other the real necklace must have been stolen it is impossible to say when years ago perhaps well that doesnt affect us the thief whoever he is is not likely to reveal what he knows so here you have it in a nutshell let me go and dont say a word about having found me here and i will do the same for you no one will know that the necklace is not genuine i shall not mention the subject and i imagine that you will not very well then now for the alternative give me up give the alarm and i getwell whatever they give me i dont know what it would be exactly something unpleasant but what do you get out of it lady blunt if i may say so is not precisely the sort of lady i should think who would bear a loss like this calmly if i know her she will shout loudly for another necklace and see that she gets it i should fancy you would find the expense unpleasantly heavy that is only one disadvantage of the alternative others will suggest themselves to you which is it to be  sir thomas suspended his operation of glaring at the paste necklace to glare at jimmy  well said jimmy i should like your decision as soon as its convenient to you they will be wanting me on the stage in a few minutes which is it to be  which snapped sir thomas why go away and go to the devil  all in good time said jimmy cheerfully i think you have chosen wisely coming downstairs  sir thomas made no response he was regarding the necklace moodily  youd better come youll enjoy the show charteris says its the best piece theres been since the magistrate and he ought to know he wrote it well goodby then see you downstairs later i suppose  for some time after he had gone sir thomas stood motionless then he went across the room and picked up the necklace it occurred to him that if lady blunt found it lying in a corner there would be questions and questions from lady blunt ranked among the keenest of his trials                                       if i had gone into the army said jimmy complacently to himself as he went downstairs i should have been a great general instead of which i go about the country scoring off dyspeptic baronets well well     chapter xix   the evenings entertainment was over the last of the nobility and gentry had departed and mr mceachern had retired to his lair to smokein his shirt sleevesthe last and best cigar of the day when his solitude was invaded by his old new york friend mr samuel galer  ive done a fair cop sir said mr galer without preamble quivering with selfcongratulation  hows that said the master of the house  a fair cop sir caught him in the very blooming act sir dark it was oo pitch fair pitch like this sir room opposite where the jewels was one of the gents bedrooms me hiding in there door on the jar waited a goodish bit footsteps hullo theyve stopped opened door a trifle and looked out couldnt see much just made out mans figure door of dressing room was open showed up against opening just see him caught you at it my beauty have i says i to myself out i jumped got hold of him being a bit to the good in strength and knowing something about the game downed him after a while and got the darbies on him took him off and locked him in the cellar thats how it was sir  good boy said mr mceachern approvingly youre no rube  no sir  put one of these cigars into your face  thank you sir very enjoyable thing a cigar sir specially a good un i have a light i thank you sir  well and who was he  not the man you told me to watch for nother chap altogether  that redheaded  no sir darkhaired chap seen him hanging about suspicious for a long time had my eye on him  mr galer chuckled reminiscently  rummest card sir i ever lagged in my natural he said  hows that inquired mr mceachern amiably  why grinned mr galer youll hardly believe it sir but he had the impudence the gall if i may use the word the sauce to tell me he was in my own line of business a detective sir said he was going into the room to keep guard i said to him at the time i said its too thin cocky thats to say  mr mceachern started  a detective  a detective sir said mr galer with a chuckle i said to him at the time  the valet cried mr mceachern  thats it sir sir thomas blunts valet he was thats how he got into the house sir  mr mceachern grunted despairingly  the man was right he is a detective sir thomas brought him down from london he niver travels without him yeve done it yeve arristed wan of the bhoys  mr galers jaw dropped slightly  he was he really was  yed better go straight to where it was ye locked him up and let him loose and id suggest ye hand him an apology gwan mister lively as you can step  i never thought  thats the trouble with you fly cops said his employer caustically ye niver do think  it never occurred to me  gwan said the master of the house up an alley  mr galer departed  and i asked them said mr mceachern i asked them particularly not to send me a rube  he lit another cigar and began to brood over the folly of mankind  he was in a very pessimistic frame of mind when jimmy curveted into the room with his head in the clouds and his feet on air  can you spare me a few minutes mr mceachern said jimmy  the policeman stared heavily  i can he said slowly what is ut  several things said jimmy sitting down ill take them in order ill start with our bright friend galer  galer  of new york according to you personally i should think that hes seen about as much of new york as i have of timbuctoo look here mceachern weve known each other some time and i ask you as man to man do you think it playing the game to set a farmer like poor old galer to watch me i put it to you  the policeman stammered the question chimed in so exactly with the opinion he had just formed on his own account of the human bloodhound who was now in the cellar making the peace with his injured fellow worker  hits you where you live that doesnt it said jimmy i wonder you didnt have more selfrespect let alone consideration for my feelings im surprised at you  yere  in fact if you werent going to be my fatherinlaw i doubt if i could bring myself to forgive you as it is i overlook it  the policemans face turned purple  only said jimmy with quiet severity taking a cigar from the box and snipping off the end dont let it occur again  he lit the cigar mr mceachern continued to stare fixedly at him so might the colonel of a regiment have looked at the latestjoined subaltern if the latter during mess had offered to teach him how to conduct himself on parade  im going to marry your daughter said jimmy  you are going to marry me daughter echoed mr mceachern as one in a trance  i am going to marry your daughter  the purple deepened on mr mceacherns face  more said jimmy blowing a smoke ring she is going to marry me we are going to marry each other he explained  mceacherns glare became frightful he struggled for speech  i must congratulate you said jimmy on the way things went off tonight it was a thorough success everybody was saying so youre the most popular man in the county what would they say of you at jefferson market if they knew by the way do you correspond with any of the old set splendid fellows they were i wish we had some of them here tonight  mr mceacherns emotions found relief in words he rose and waved a huge fist in jimmys face his great body was shaking with rage  you shouted the policeman you  the fist was within an inch of jimmys chin  outwardly calm inwardly very much alive to the fact that at any moment the primitive man in him might lead his prospective fatherinlaw beyond the confines of selfrestraint jimmy sat still in his chair his eyes fixed steadily on those of his relativetobe it was an uncomfortable moment mr mceachern if he made an assault might regret it subsequently but he would not be the first to do so the man who did that would be a certain james pitt if it came to blows the younger man could not hope to hold his own with the huge policeman  you roared mceachern jimmy fancied he could feel the wind of moving fist you marry me daughter a new york crook the sweepings of the bowery a man who ought to be in jail id like to break your face in  i noticed that said jimmy if its all the same to you will you take your fist out of my mouth it makes it a little difficult to carry on a conversation and ive several things i should like to say  yell listen to me  certainly you were saying  ye come here ye worm yourself into my house crawl into it  i came by invitation and in passing not on all fours mr mceachern may i ask one question  what is ut  if you didnt want me why did you let me stop here  the policeman stopped as if he had received a blow there came flooding back into his mind the recollection of his position in his wrath he had forgotten that jimmy knew his secret and he looked on jimmy as a man who would use his knowledge  he sat down heavily  jimmy went on smoking in silence for a while he saw what was passing in his adversarys mind and it seemed to him that it would do no harm to let the thing sink in  look here mr mceachern he said at last i wish you could listen quietly to me for a minute or two theres really no reason on earth why we should always be at one anothers throats in this way we might just a well be friends as we should be if we met now for the first time our difficulty is that we know too much about each other you knew me in new york and you know what i did there naturally you dont like the idea of my marrying your daughter you cant believe that im not simply an ordinary yegg like the rest of the crooks you used to know i promise you im not cant you see that it doesnt matter what a man has been its what he is and what he means to be that counts mr patrick mceachern of corven abbey isnt the same as constable mceachern of the new york police well then i have nothing to do with the man i was when you knew me first i have disowned him hes a back number i am an ordinary english gentleman now my uncle has left me more than well off i am a baronet and is it likely that a baronetwith money mind youis going to carry on the yegg business as a side line be reasonable theres really no possible objection to me now lets shake and call the fight off does that go  the policeman was plainly not unmoved by these arguments he drummed his fingers on the table and stared thoughtfully at jimmy  is molly he said at length does molly  yes said jimmy and i can promise you i love her come along now why wait  mceachern looked doubtfully at jimmys outstretched hand he moved his own an inch from the table then let it fall again  come on said jimmy do it now be a sport  and with a great grunt which might have meant anything from resignation to cordiality mr mceachern capitulated     chapter xx   the american liner st louis lay in the empress dock at southampton taking aboard her passengers all sorts and conditions of men flowed in an unceasing stream up the gangway  leaning over the secondclass railing jimmy pitt and spike mullins watched them thoughtfully  jimmy looked up at the blue peter that fluttered from the foremast and then at spike the bowery boys face was stolid and expressionless he was smoking a short wooden pipe with an air of detachment  well spike said jimmy your schooners on the tide now isnt it your vessels at the quay youve got some queerlooking fellow travellers dont miss the two cinghalese sports and the man in the turban and the baggy breeches i wonder if theyre airtight useful if he fell overboard  sure said spike directing a contemplative eye toward the garment in question he knows his business  i wonder what those men on the deck are writing theyve been scribbling away ever since we came here probably society journalists we shall see in next weeks sphere among the secondclass passengers we noticed mr spike mullins looking as cheery as ever its a pity youre so set on going spike why not change your mind and stop  for a moment spike looked wistful then his countenance resumed its woodenness dere aint no use for

except you youre going out on the old trail againwhich begins in third avenue and ends in sing sing why tear yourself away spike  spike concentrated his gaze on a weedy young emigrant in a blue jersey who was having his eye examined by the overworked doctor and seemed to be resenting it  deres nuttin doin dis side mr chames he said at length i want to get busy  ulysses mullins said jimmy looking at him curiously i know the feeling theres only one cure and i dont suppose youll ever take it you dont think a lot of women do you youre the rugged bachelor  goils began spike comprehensively and abandoned the topic without dilating on it further  jimmy lit his pipe and threw the match overboard the sun came out from behind a cloud and the water sparkled  dose were great jools mr chames said spike thoughtfully  i believe youre still brooding over them spike  we could have got away wit dem if youd have stood for it dead easy  you are brooding over them spike ill tell you something which

embarked the deck was full to congestion  theyll be sending us ashore in a minute said jimmy id better be moving let me know how youre making out spike from time to time you know the address and i say

softly hell find me a job  youll be a boss before you know where you are  sure said spike grinning modestly  you ought to be a thundering success in american politics said jimmy youve got all the necessary qualities  a steward passed  any more for the shore  which shore asked jimmy well spike  goodby mr chames  goodby said jimmy and good luck                                       two tugs attached themselves excitedly to the liners side the great ship began to move slowly from the shore jimmy stood at the water side and watched her the rails were lined with gesticulating figures in the front row spike waved his hat with silent vigor  the sun had gone behind the clouds as the ship slid out on its way a stray beam pierced the grayness  it shone on a red head
