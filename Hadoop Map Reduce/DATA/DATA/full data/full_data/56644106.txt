56644106	policeman bluejay  by  laura bancroft  author of the twinkle tales etc  with illustrations by maginel wright enright        frontispiece go both of you and join the bird that warned you    chicago the reilly  britton co publishers  copyright 1907 by the reilly  britton co  the lakeside press r r donnelley  sons company chicago     to the children  i must admit that the great success of the twinkle tales has astonished me as much as it has delighted the solemneyed hard working publishers therefore i have been encouraged to write a new twinkle book hoping with all my heart that my little friends will find it worthy to occupy a place beside the others on their pet bookshelves and because the children seem to especially love the story of bandit jim crow and birdlife is sure to appeal alike to their hearts and their imaginations i have again written about birds  the tale is fantastical and intended to amuse rather than instruct yet many of the traits of the feathered folk herein described are in strict accordance with natural history teachings and will serve to acquaint my readers with the habits of birds in their wildwood homes at the same time my birds do unexpected things because i have written a fairy tale and not a natural history  the question is often asked me whether twinkle and chubbins were asleep or awake when they encountered these wonderful adventures and it grieves me to reflect that the modern child has been deprived of fairy tales to such an extent that it does not knowas i did when a girl that in a fairy story it does not matter whether one is awake or not you must accept it as you would a fragrant breeze that cools your brow a draught of sweet water or the delicious flavor of a strawberry and be grateful for the pleasure it brings you without stopping to question too closely its source  for my part i am glad if my stories serve to while away a pleasant hour before bedtime or keep one contented on a rainy day in this way they are sure to be useful and if a little tenderness for the helpless animals and birds is acquired with the amusement the value of the tales will be doubled  laura bancroft   list of chapters  i     little

chub said twinkle that were lost  seems to me twink said chubbins that it isnt we thats lost its the path  it was here a minute ago declared twinkle  but it isnt here now replied the boy  thats true said the girl  it really was queer they had followed the straight path into the great forest and had only stopped for a moment to sit down and rest with the basket between them and their backs to a big tree twinkle winked just twice because she usually took a nap in the afternoon and chubbins merely closed his eyes a second to find out if he could see that long streak of sunshine through his pink eyelids yet during this second which happened while twinkle was winking the path had run away and left them without any guide or any notion which way they ought to go  another strange thing was that when they jumped up to look around them the nearest trees began sliding away in a circle leaving the little girl and boy in a clear space and the trees continued moving back and back farther and farther until all their trunks were jammed tight together and not even a mouse could have crept between them they made a solid ring around twinkle and chubbins who stood looking at this transformation with wondering eyes  its a trap said chubbins and were in it  it looks that way replied twinkle thoughtfully isnt it lucky chub we have the basket with us if it wasnt for that we might starve to death in our prison  oh well replied the little fellow the basket wont last long theres plenty of starve in the bottom of it twinkle any way you can fix it  thats so unless we can get out whatever do you suppose made the trees behave that way chubbins  dont know said the boy  just then a queer creature dropped from a tree into the ring and began moving slowly toward them it was flat in shape like a big turtle only it hadnt a turtles hard shell instead its body was covered with sharp prickers like rose thorns and it had two small red eyes that looked cruel and wicked the children could not see how many legs it had but they must have been very short because the creature moved so slowly over the ground  when it had drawn near to them it said in a pleading tone that sounded soft and rather musical  little girl pick me up in your arms and pet me  twinkle shrank back  my i couldnt think of doing such a thing she answered  then the creature said  little boy please pick me up in your arms and pet me  go way shouted chubbins i wouldnt touch you for anything  the creature turned its red eyes first upon one and then upon the other  listen my dears it continued i was once a beautiful maiden but a cruel tuxix transformed me into this awful shape and so must i remain until some child willingly takes me in its arms and pets me then and not till then will i be restored to my proper form  dont believe it dont believe it cried a high clear voice and both the boy and the girl looked quickly around to see who had spoken but no one besides themselves was in sight and they only noticed a thick branch of one of the trees slightly swaying its leaves  what is a tuxix asked twinkle who was beginning to feel sorry for the poor creature  it is a magician a sorcerer a wizard and a witch all rolled into one was the answer and you can imagine what a dreadful thing that would be  be careful cried the clear voice again it is the tuxix herself who is talking to you dont believe a word you hear  at this the red eyes of the creature flashed fire with anger and it tried to turn its clumsy body around to find the speaker twinkle and chubbins looked too but only heard a flutter and a mocking laugh coming from the trees  if i get my eye on that bird it will never speak again exclaimed the creature in a voice of fury very different from the sweet tones it had at first used and perhaps it was this fact that induced the children to believe the warning was from a friend and they would do well to heed it  whether you are the tuxix or not said twinkle i never will touch you you may be sure of that  nor i declared chubbins stoutly as he came closer to the girl and grasped her hand in his own  at this the horrid thing bristled all its sharp prickers in anger and said  then if i cannot conquer you in one way i will in another go both of you and join the bird that warned you and live in the air and the trees until you repent your stubbornness and promise to become my slaves the tuxix has spoken and her magical powers are at work go  in an instant twinkle saw chubbins shoot through the air and disappear among the leaves of one of the tall trees as he went he seemed to grow very small and to change in shape  wait she cried im coming too  she was afraid of losing chubbins so she flew after him feeling rather queer herself and a moment after was safe in the tall tree clinging with her toes to a branch and looking in amazement at the boy who sat beside her  chubbins had been transformed into a pretty little birdall that is except his head which was chubbins own head reduced in size to fit the bird body it still had upon it the straw hat which had also grown small in size and the sight that met twinkles eyes was so funny that she laughed merrily and her laugh was like the sweet warbling of a skylark  chubbins looked at her and saw almost what she saw for twinkle was a bird too except for her head with its checked sunbonnet which had grown small enough to fit the pretty glossyfeathered body of a lark  both of them had to cling fast to the branch with their toes for their arms and hands were now wings the toes were long and sharp pointed so that they could be used in the place of fingers  my exclaimed twinkle youre a queer sight chubbins  so are you answered the boy that mean old thing must have witched us  yes were chanted said twinkle and now what are we going to do about it we cant go home for our folks would be scared nearly into fits and we dont know the way home either  thats so said chubbins fluttering his little wings to keep from falling for he had nearly lost his balance  what shall we do she continued  why fly around and be gay and happy said a clear and merry voice beside them thats what birds are expected to do    chapter ii the forest guardian  twinkle and chubbins twisted their heads around on their little feathered necks and saw perched beside them a big bird of a most beautiful blue color at first they were a bit frightened for the newcomer seemed of giant size beside their little lark bodies and he was moreover quite fierce in appearance having a crest of feathers that came to a point above his head and a strong beak and sharp talons but twinkle looked full into the shrewd bright eye and found it good humored and twinkling so she plucked up courage and asked  were you speaking to us  very likely replied the blue bird in a cheerful tone theres no one else around to speak to  and was it you who warned us against that dreadful creature below in the forest she continued  it was  then said twinkle we are very much obliged to you  dont mention it said the other im the forest policeman policeman bluejay you knowand its my duty to look after everyone who is in trouble  were in trouble all right said chubbins sorrowfully  well it might have been worse remarked policeman bluejay making a chuckling sound in his throat that twinkle thought was meant for a laugh if you had ever touched the old tuxix she would have transformed you into toads or lizards that is an old trick of hers to get children into her power and then change them into things as loathsome as herself  i wouldnt have touched her anyhow said twinkle  nor i cried chubbins in his shrill birdlike voice she wasnt nice  still it was good of you to warn us twinkle added sweetly  the bluejay looked upon the fluttering little things with kind approval then he laughed outright  what has happened to your heads he asked  nothing cept theyre smaller replied chubbins  but birds shouldnt have human heads retorted the bluejay i suppose the old tuxix did that so the birds would not admit you into their society for you are neither all bird nor all human but never mind ill explain your case and you may be sure all the birds of the forest will be kind to you  must we stay like this always asked twinkle anxiously  i really cant say answered the policeman there is said to be a way to break every enchantment if one knows what it is the trouble in these cases is to discover what the charm may be that will restore you to your natural shapes but just now you must make up your minds to live in our forest for a time and to be as happy as you can under the circumstances  well well try said chubbins with a sigh  thats right exclaimed policeman bluejay nodding his crest in approval the first thing you must have is a house so if you will fly with me i will try to find you one  iim afraid said twinkle nervously  the larks declared the bluejay are almost the strongest and best flyers we have you two children have now become skylarks and may soar so high in the air that you can scarcely see the earth below you for that reason you need have no fear whatever be bold and brave and all will be well  he spoke in such a kindly and confident voice that both twinkle and chubbins gained courage and when the policeman added come on and flew straight as an arrow into the air above the treetops the two little skylarks with their girl and boy heads followed swiftly after him and had no trouble in going just as fast as their conductor  it was quite a pleasant and interesting experience to dart through the air and be in no danger of falling when they rested on their outstretched wings they floated as lightly as bubbles and soon a joyous thrill took possession of them and they began to understand why it is that the free wild birds are always so happy in their native state  the forest was everywhere under them for it was of vast extent presently the bluejay swooped downward and alighted near the top of a tall maple tree that had many thick branches  in a second twinkle and chubbins were beside him their little hearts beating fast in their glossy bosoms from the excitement of their rapid flight just in front of them firmly fastened to a crotch of a limb was a neatly built nest of a gray color lined inside with some soft substance that was as smooth as satin  here said their thoughtful friend is the nest that niddie thrush and daisy thrush built for themselves a year ago they have now gone to live in a wood across the big river so you are welcome to their old home it is almost as good as new and there is no rent to pay  its awfully small said chubbins  chutchut twittered policeman bluejay remember you are not children now but skylarks and that this is a thrushs nest try it and you are sure to find it will fit you exactly  so twinkle and chubbins flew into the house and nestled their bodies against its soft lining and found that their friend was right when they were cuddled together with their slender legs tucked into the feathers of their breasts they just filled the nest to the brim and no more room was necessary  now ill mark the nest for you so that everyone will know you claim it said the policeman and with his bill he pecked a row of small dots in the bark of the limb just beside the nest i hope you will be very happy here and this afternoon i will bring some friends to meet you so now goodbye until i see you again  wait cried chubbins what are we going to eat  eat answered the bluejay as if surprised why you may feast upon all the good things the forest offersgrubs beetles worms and butterflyeggs  ugh gasped chubbins it makes me sick to just think of it  what  you see said twinkle we are not all birds mr bluejay as you are and that makes a big difference we have no bills to pick up the things that birds like to eat and we do not care for the same sort of food either  what do you care for asked the policeman in a puzzled voice  why cake and sandwitches and pickles and cheese such as we had in our basket we couldnt eat any live things you see because we are not used to it  the bluejay became thoughtful  i understand your objection he said and perhaps you are right not having good bird sense because the brains in your heads are still human brains let me see what can i do to help you  the children did not speak but watched him anxiously  where did you leave your basket he finally asked  in the place where the old witch chanted us  then said the officer of the forest i must try to get it for you  it is too big and heavy for a bird to carry suggested twinkle  sure enough of course thats a fact he turned his crested head upward trying to think of a way and saw a black speck moving across the sky  wait a minute ill be back he called and darted upward like a flash  the children watched him mount into the sky toward the black speck and heard his voice crying out in sharp quick notes and before long policeman bluejay attracted the other birds attention causing it to pause in its flight and sink slowly downward until the two drew close together  then it was seen that the other bird was a great eagle strong and sharpeyed and with broad wings that spread at least six feet from tip to tip  good day friend eagle said the bluejay i hope you are in no hurry for i want to ask you to do me a great favor  what is it asked the eagle in a big deep voice  please go to a part of the forest with me and carry a basket to some friends of mine ill show you the way it is too heavy for me to lift but with your great strength you can do it easily  it will give me pleasure to so favor you replied the eagle politely so policeman bluejay led the way and the eagle followed with such mighty strokes of its wings that the air was sent whirling in little eddies behind him as the water is churned by a steamers paddles  it was not very long before they reached the clearing in the forest the horrid tuxix had wriggled her evil body away to soothe her disappointment by some other wicked act but the basket stood as the children had left it  the eagle seized the handle in his stout beak and found it was no trouble at all for him to fly into the air and carry the basket with him  this way pleasethis way chirped the bluejay and the eagle bore the precious burden safely to the maple tree and hung it upon a limb just above the nest  as he approached he made such a fierce fluttering that twinkle and chubbins were dreadfully scared and flew out of their nest hopping from limb to limb until they were well out of the monstrous birds way but when they saw the basket and realized the eagles kindly act they flew toward him and thanked him very earnestly for his assistance  goodness me exclaimed the eagle turning his head first on one side and then on the other that both his bright eyes might observe the childlarks what curious creatures have you here my good policeman  why it is another trick of old hautau the tuxix she found two children in the forest and enchanted them she wanted to make them toads but they wouldnt touch her so she couldnt then she got herself into a fine rage and made the little dears half birds and half children as you see them i was in a tree near by and saw the whole thing because i was sorry for the innocent victims i befriended them and as this basket belongs to them i have asked you to fetch it to their nest  i am glad to be of service replied the eagle if ever you need me and i am anywhere around he continued addressing the larks just call me and i will come at once  thank you said twinkle gratefully  were much obliged added chubbins  then the eagle flew away and when he was gone policeman bluejay also bade them goodbye  ill be back this afternoon without fail he said just now i must go and look over the forest and make sure none of the birds have been in mischief during my absence do not go very far from your nest for a time or you may get lost the forest is a big place but when you are more used to it and to your new condition you can be more bold in venturing abroad  we wont leave this tree promised twinkle in an earnest voice  and chubbins chimed in with thats right we wont leave this tree until you come back  goodbye said the policeman  goodbye responded twinkle and chubbins  so the bluejay darted away and was soon lost to sight and twinkle and chubbins were left alone to seriously consider the great misfortune that had overtaken them    chapter iii the childlarks  folks will be worried about us twink said chubbins  course they will twinkle replied theyll wonder what has become of us and try to find us  but they wont look in the treetops  no  nor think to ask the birds where we are  why should they enquired twinkle they cant talk to the birds chub  why not we talk to them dont we and they talk to us at least the pliceman and the eagle did  thats true answered twinkle and i dont understand it a bit i must ask mr bluejay to splain it to us  whats the use of a pliceman in the forest asked chubbins after a moments thought  i suppose she replied that he has to keep the birds from being naughty some birds are just awful mischiefs chub theres the magpies you know that steal and the crows that fight and the jackdaws that are saucy and lots of others that get into trouble seems to me pliceman bluejays a pretty busy bird if he looks after things as he ought  probly hes got his hands full said chubbins  not that for he hasnt any hands any more than we have perhaps you ought to say hes got his wings full suggested twinkle  that reminds me im hungry chirped the boylark  well weve got the basket she replied  but how can we eat cake and things witched up as we are  havent we mouths and teeth just the same as ever  yes but we havent any hands and theres a cloth tied over the top of the basket  dear me exclaimed twinkle i hadnt thought of that  they flew together to the basket and perched upon the edge of it it seemed astonishingly big to them now that they were so small but chubbins remarked that this fact was a pleasant one for instead of eating all the good things the basket contained at one meal as they had at first intended it would furnish them with food for many days to come  but how to get into the basket was the thing to be considered just now they fluttered around on every side of it and finally found a small place where the cloth was loose in a minute chubbins began clawing at it with his little feet and twinkle helped him so that gradually they managed to pull the cloth away far enough for one of them to crawl through the opening then the other followed and because the big basket was not quite full there was exactly room for them to stand underneath the cloth and walk around on top of a row of cookies that lay next to a row of sandwiches  the cookies seemed enormous one was lying flat and chubbins declared it seemed as big around as the diningtable at home  all the better for us said twinkle bending her head down to nibble at the edge of the cookie  if were going to be birds said chubbins who was also busily eating as best he could we ought to be reglar birds and have bills to peck with this being half one thing and half another doesnt suit me at all  the witch wasnt trying to suit us replied twinkle she was trying to get us into trouble  well she did it all right he said  it was not so hard to eat as they had feared for their slender necks enabled them to bend their heads low chubbins hat fell off a minute later and he wondered how he was going to get it on his head again  cant you stand on one foot and use the other foot like a hand asked twinkle  i dont know said he  the storks stand on one leg continued the girl ive seen em in pictures  so chubbins tried it and found he could balance his little body on one leg very nicely for if he toppled either way he had but to spread his wings and tail feathers and so keep himself from falling he picked up his hat with the claws of his other foot and managed to put it on by ducking his head  this gave the boylark a new idea he broke off a piece of the cookie and held it in his claw while he ate it and seeing his success twinkle followed his example and after a few attempts found she could eat very comfortably in that way  having had their luncheonand it amazed chubbins to see how very little was required to satisfy their hungerthe birdchildren crept out of the basket and flew down to the twig beside their nest  hello cried a strange voice newcomers eh  they were so startled that they fluttered a moment to keep from tumbling off the limb then twinkle saw a furry red head sticking out of a small hollow in the trunk of the tree the head had two round black eyes an inquisitive nose a wide mouth with sharp teeth and whiskers like those of a cat it seemed as big as the moon to the shy little childlarks until it occurred to the girl that the strange creature must be a squirrel  youyou scared us she said timidly  you scared me at first returned the squirrel in a comic tone dear me how came you birds to have childrens heads  that isnt the way to put it remarked chubbins staring back into the eyes of the squirrel you should ask how we children happened to have birds bodies  very well put the conundrum that way if you like said the squirrel what is the answer  we are enchanted replied twinkle  ah the tuxix  yes we were caught in the forest and she bewitched us  that is too bad said their new acquaintance she is a very wicked old creature for a fact and loves to get folks into trouble are you going to live here  yes answered the girl policeman bluejay gave us this nest  then its all right for policeman bluejay rules the feathered tribes of this forest about as he likes have you seen him in full uniform yet  no they replied unless his feathers are his uniform  well hes too proud of his office to be satisfied with feathers i can tell you when some folks get a little authority they want all the world to know about it and a bold uniform covers many a faint heart but as im your nearest neighbor ill introduce myself my names wisk  my name is twinkle  and mines chubbins  pleased to make your acquaintance said the squirrel nodding i live in the second flat  hows that asked the boy  why the second hollow you know theres a possum living in the hollow down below who is carrying four babies around in her pocket and mrs hootaway the gray owl lives in the hollow abovethe one you can see far over your heads so im the second flat tenant  i see said twinkle  early in the morning the possum comes growling home to go to bed late at night the owl hoots and keeps folks awake but im very quiet and well behaved and youll find me a good neighbor continued wisk  im sure of that said chubbins  as if to prove his friendship the squirrel now darted out of the hollow and sat upon a limb beside the children holding his bushy tail straight up so that it stood above his head like a big plume in a soldiers helmet  are you hungry asked the girl  not very i cannot get much food until the nuts are ripe you know and my last winters supply was gone long ago but i manage to find some bits to eat here and there  do you like cookies she asked  i really do not know answered wisk where do they grow  in baskets ill get you a piece and you can try it so twinkle flew up and crept into her basket again quickly returning with a bit of cookie in her claw it was not much more than a crumb but nevertheless it was all that she could carry  the squirrel seized the morsel in his paws examined it gravely and then took a nibble an instant later it was gone  that is very good indeed he declared where do these baskets of cookies grow  they dont grow anywhere replied twinkle with a laugh the baskets come from the grocery store and my mama makes the cookies  oh theyre human food then  yes would you like some more  not just now said wisk i dont want to rob you and it is foolish to eat more than one needs just because the food tastes good but if i get very hungry perhaps ill ask you for another bite  do said the girl you are welcome to what we have as long as it lasts  that is very kind of you returned the squirrel  they sat and talked for an hour and wisk told them stories of the forest and of the many queer animals and birds that lived there it was all very interesting to the children and they listened eagerly until they heard a rushing sound in the air that sent wisk scurrying back into his hole    chapter iv an afternoon reception  twinkle and chubbins stretched their little necks to see what was coming and a moment later beheld one of the most gorgeous sights the forest affordsa procession of all the brighthued birds that live among the trees or seek them for shelter  they flew in pairs one after the other and at the head of the procession was their good friend policeman bluejay wearing a policemans helmet upon his head and having a policemans club tucked underneath his left wing the helmet was black and glossy and had a big number 1 on the front of it and a strap that passed under the wearers bill and held it firmly in place the club was fastened around the policemans wing with a cord so that it could not get away when he was flying  the birds were of many sizes and of various colorings some were much larger than the bluejay but none seemed so proud or masterful and all deferred meekly to the commands of the acknowledged guardian of the forest  one by one the pretty creatures alighted upon the limbs of the tree and the first thing they all did was to arrange their feathers properly after their rapid flight then the bluejay who sat next to the childlarks proceeded to introduce the guests he had brought to call upon the newest inhabitants of his domain  this is mr and mrs robin redbreast one of our most aristocratic families said he swinging his club around in a circle until chubbins ducked his head for fear it might hit him  you are welcome to our forest chirped robin in a sedate and dignified tone  and here is mr goldfinch and his charming bride continued the policeman  ah it is a pleasure to meet you the goldfinch murmured eyeing the childlarks curiously but trying to be so polite that they would not notice his staring  henny wren and jenny wren proceeded the policeman  twinkle and chubbins both bowed politely  well well croaked a raven in a hoarse voice am i to wait all day while you introduce those miserable little insignificant grubeaters  be quiet cried policeman bluejay sternly  i wont snapped the raven  it happened so quickly that the children saw nothing before they heard the thump of the club against the ravens head  cawwawwawwaw murder help screamed the big bird and flew away from the tree as swiftly as his ragged wings would carry him  let him go said a sweet brown mockingbird the rowdy is always disturbing our social gatherings and no one will miss him if he doesnt come back  he is not fit for polite society added a nuthatcher pruning her scarlet wings complacently  so the policeman tucked the club under his wing again and proceeded with the introductions the pewees and the linnets being next presented to the strangers and then the comical little chicadees the orioles bobolinks thrushes starlings and whippoorwills the latter appearing sleepy because they explained they had been out late the night before  these smaller birds all sat in rows on the limbs beside twinkle and chubbins but seated upon the stouter limbs facing them were rows of bigger birds who made the childlarks nervous by the sharp glances from their round bright eyes here were blackbirds cuckoos magpies grosbeaks and woodpigeons all nearly as big and fiercelooking as policeman bluejay himself and some so rugged and strong that it seemed strange they would submit to the orders of the officer of the law but the policeman kept a sharp watch upon these birds to see that they attempted no mischievous pranks and they must have been afraid of him because they behaved very well after the saucy raven had left them even the chattering magpies tried to restrain their busy tongues and the blackbirds indulged in no worse pranks than to suddenly spread their wings and try to push the pigeons off the branch  several beautiful hummingbirds were poised in the air above this gathering their bodies being motionless but their tiny wings fluttering so swiftly that neither twinkle nor chubbins could see them at all  policeman bluejay having finally introduced all the company to the childlarks began to relate the story of their adventures telling the birds how the wicked tuxix had transformed them into the remarkable shapes they now possessed  for the honor of our race he said we must each and every one guard these little strangers carefully and see that they come to no harm in our forest you must all pledge yourselves to befriend them on all occasions and if any one dares to break his promise he must fight with me to the deathand you know very well what that means  we do said a magpie with a shrill laugh youll treat us as you did jim crow eh  the policeman did not notice this remark but the other birds all looked grave and thoughtful and began in turn to promise that they would take care to befriend the childlarks at all times this ceremony having been completed the birds began to converse in a more friendly and easy tone so that twinkle and chubbins soon ceased to be afraid of them and enjoyed very much their society and friendly chatter    chapter v the orioles story  we are really very happy in this forest said an oriole that sat next to twinkle and we would have no fears at all did not the men with guns who are called hunters come here now and then to murder us they are terribly wild and ferocious creatures who have no hearts at all  oh they must have hearts said twinkle else they couldnt live for ones heart has to beat to keep a person alive you know  perhaps its their gizzards that beat replied the oriole reflectively for they are certainly heartless and very wicked a cousin of mine susie oriole had a very brave and handsome husband they built a pretty nest together and susie laid four eggs in it that were so perfect that she was very proud of them  the eggs were nearly ready to hatch when a great man appeared in the forest and discovered susies nest her brave husband fought desperately to protect their home but the cruel man shot him and he fell to the ground dead even then susie would not leave her pretty eggs and when the man climbed the tree to get them she screamed and tried to peck out his eyes usually we orioles are very timid you know so you can well understand how terrified susie was to fight against this giant foe but he had a club in his hand with which he dealt my poor cousin such a dreadful blow that she was sent whirling through the air and sank half unconscious into a bush a few yards away  after this the man stole the eggs from the nest and also picked up the dead body of susies husband and carried it away with him susie recovered somewhat from the blow she had received and when she saw her eggs and her poor dead husband being taken away she managed to flutter along after the man and followed him until he came to the edge of the forest there he had a horse tied to a tree and he mounted upon the beasts back and rode away through the open country susie followed him just far enough away to keep the man in sight without being noticed herself  by and bye he came to a big house which he entered closing the door behind him susie flew into a tree beside the house and waited sorrowfully but in patience for a chance to find her precious ones again  the days passed drearily away one after another but in about a week my cousin noticed that one of the windows of the house had been left open so she boldly left her tree and flew in at the window and luckily none of the people who lived in the house happened to be in the room  imagine susies surprise when she saw around the sides of the room many birds sitting silently upon limbs cut from trees and among them her own husband as proud and beautiful as he had ever been before the cruel man had killed him she quickly flew to the limb and perched beside her loved one  oh my darling she cried how glad i am to have found you again and to see you alive and well when i had mourned you as dead come with me at once and we will return to our old home in the forest  but the bird remained motionless and made no reply to her loving words she thrust her bill beside his and tried to kiss him but he did not respond to the caress and his body was stiff and cold  then susie uttered a cry of grief and understood the truth her husband was indeed dead but had been stuffed and mounted upon the limb to appear as he had in life small wires had been pushed through his legs to make his poor body stand up straight and to susies horror she discovered that his eyes were only bits of glass all the other birds in the room were stuffed in the same way they looked as if they were alive at the first glance but each body was cold and every voice mute they were mere mockeries of the beautiful birds that this heartless and cruel man had deprived of their joyous lives  susies loving heart was nearly bursting with pain as she slowly fluttered toward the open window by which she had entered but on her way a new anguish overtook her for she noticed a big glass case against the wall in which were arranged clusters of eggs stolen from birds of almost every kind yes there were her own lovely eggs scarcely an inch from her face but separated from her by a stout glass that could not be broken although she madly dashed her body against it again and again  finally realizing her helplessness poor susie left the room by the open window and flew back to the forest where she told us all the terrible thing she had seen no one was able to comfort her for her loving heart was broken and after that she would often fly away to the house to peer through the window at her eggs and her beautiful husband  one day she did not return and after waiting for her nearly two weeks we sent the bluejay to see what had become of her our policeman found the house and also found the window of the room open  he boldly entered and discovered susie and her husband sitting side by side upon the dried limb their bodies both stiff and dead the man had caught the poor wife at last and the lovers were reunited in death  also policeman bluejay found his grandfathers mummy in this room and the stuffed mummies of many other friends he had known in the forest so he was very sorrowful when he returned to us and from that time we have feared the heartless men more than ever  its a sad story sighed twinkle and ive no doubt it is a true one but all men are not so bad im sure  all men who enter the forest are answered the oriole positively for they only come here to murder and destroy those who are helpless before their power but have never harmed them in the least if god loves the birds as i am sure he does why do you suppose he made their ferocious enemies the men  twinkle did not reply but she felt a little ashamed    chapter vi a merry adventure  talking about men said the cuckoo in a harsh but not very unpleasant voice reminds me of a funny adventure i once had myself i was sitting in my nest one day at the time when i was quite young when suddenly a man appeared before me you must know that this nest which was rather carelessly built by my mother was in a thick evergreen tree and not very high from the ground so that i found the mans eyes staring squarely into my own  most of you my dears have seen men but this was the strangest sort of man you can imagine there was white hair upon his face so long that it hung down to his middle and over his eyes were round plates of glass that glittered very curiously i was so astonished at seeing the queer creature that i sat still and stared and this was my undoing for suddenly there came a rapid whish through the air and a network of cords fell all around and over me then indeed i spread my wings and attempted to fly but it was too late i struggled in the net without avail and soon gave up the conflict in breathless despair  my captor did not intend to kill me however instead he tried to soothe my fright and carried me very gently for many many miles until we came to a village of houses here at the very top of a high house the man lived in one little room it was all littered with tools and bits of wood and on a broad shelf were several queer things that went ticktock ticktock every minute i was thrust gently enough into a wooden cage where i lay upon the bottom more dead than alive because the ticking things at first scared me dreadfully and i was in constant terror lest i should be tortured or killed but the glasseyed old man brought me dainty things to eat and plenty of fresh water to relieve my thirst and by the next day my heart had stopped going pittypat and i was calm enough to stand up in my cage and look around me  my whitewhiskered captor sat at a bench with his coat off and his bald head bare while he worked away busily putting little wheels and springs together and fitting them into a case of wood when one of them was finished it would sing ticktock ticktock just like the other queer things on the shelf and this constant ticking so interested me that i raised my head and called  cuckoo cuckoo  thats it cried the old man delightedly thats what i wanted to hear its the real cuckoo at last and not a bit like those cheap imitations  i didnt understand at first what he meant but he worked at his bench all day and finally brought to my cage a bird made out of wood that was carved and painted to look just as i was it seemed so natural that i flapped my wings and called cuckoo to it and the man pressed a little bellows at the bottom of the bird and made it say cuckoo in return but that cry was so false and unreal that i just shouted with laughter and the glasseyed old man shook his head sadly and said that will never do that will never do in the world  so all the next day he worked hard trying to make his wooden bird say cuckoo in the proper way and at last it really spoke quite naturally so that it startled even me when i heard it this seemed to please my captor very much so he put it inside one of the ticking things on the shelf and byandby a door opened and the wooden bird jumped out and cried cuckoo cuckoo cuckoo and then jumped back again and the door closed with a snap  bravo cried old whitehair but i was rather annoyed for i thought the wooden bird was impudent in trying to ape the ways of live cuckoos i shouted back a challenge to it but there was no reply an hour later and every hour it repeated the performance but jumped behind the door when i offered to fight it  the next day the man was absent from the room and i had nothing to eat so i became angry and uneasy i scratched away at the wooden bars of my cage and tried to twist them with my beak and at last one of them to my great joy came loose and i was able to squeeze myself out of the cage  but then i was no better off than before because the windows and the door of the room were fast shut i grew more cross and illtempered than before when i discovered this and to add to my annoyance that miserable wooden bird would every once in awhile jump out and yell cuckoo and then bounce back into its house again without daring to argue with me  this at last made me frantic with rage and i resolved to be revenged the next time the wooden bird made its appearance i new upon it in a flash and knocked it off the little platform before it had uttered its cry more than twice it fell upon the floor and broke one of its wings but in an instant i dashed myself upon it and bit and scratched the impudent thing until there was not a bit of paint left upon it its head came off too and so did its legs and the other wing and before i was done with it no one ever would have known it was once a clever imitation of myself finding that i was victorious i cried cuckoo in triumph and just then the little door of the ticking thing opened and the platform where the wooden bird had stood came out of it and remained for a time motionless i quickly flew up and perched upon it and shouted cuckoo again in great glee as i did so to my amazement the platform on which i stood leaped backward carrying me with it and the next instant the door closed with a snap and i found myself in darkness  wildly i fluttered my wings but it was of no use i was in a prison much worse than the cage and so small that i could hardly turn around in it i was about to die of terror and despair when i chanced to remember that at certain times the door would open to push out the bird and allow it to say cuckoo before it shut again so the next time it opened in this way i would be able to make my escape  very patiently i waited in the dark little hole listening to the steady ticktock of the machinery behind me and trying not to be nervous after awhile i heard the old man come into the room and exclaim sorrowfully because his captive cuckoo had escaped from its cage he could not imagine what had become of me and i kept still and laughed to myself to think how i would presently surprise him  it seemed an age before i finally heard the click that opened the door in front of me then the platform on which i sat sprang out and i fluttered my wings and yelled cuckoo cuckoo as loud as i could the old man was standing right in front of me his mouth wide open with astonishment at the wonderfully natural performance of his wooden bird as he thought me he shouted bravo again and clapped his hands and at that i flew straight into his face and clawed his white hair with all my might and screamed as loud as i could  he screamed too being taken by surprise and tumbled over backward so that he sat down upon the floor with a loud bump i flew to the workbench and then the truth dawned upon him that i was not the wooden bird but the real one  good gracious said he ive left the window open the rascal will escape  i glanced at the window and saw that it was indeed wide open the sight filled me with triumphant joy before the old man could get upon his feet and reach the window i had perched upon the sill and with one parting cry of cuckoo i spread my wings and flew straight into the air  well i never went back to enquire if he enjoyed the trick i had played upon him but ive laughed many a time when i thought of the old fellows comic expression when a real cuckoo instead of a painted one flew out of his ticking machine  as the cuckoo ended his tale the other birds joined in a chorus of shrill laughter but chubbins said to them gravely  he was a smart man though to make a cuckooclock i saw one myself one time and it was a wonderful thing the cuckoo told what time it was every hour  was it made of wood asked the bluejay  i dont know that replied the boylark but of course it wasnt a real bird  it only shows remarked the bobolink how greatly those humans admire us birds they make pictures of us and love to keep us in cages so they can hear us sing and they even wear us in their bonnets after we are dead  i think that is a dreadful thing said the goldfinch with a shudder but it only proves that men are our greatest enemies  dont forget the women said twinkle its the women that wear birds in their hats  mankind said robin redbreast gravely is the most destructive and bloodthirsty of all the brute creation they not only kill for food but through vanity and a desire for personal adornment i have even heard it said that they kill for amusement being unable to restrain their murderous desires in this they are more cruel than the serpents  there is some excuse for the poor things observed the bluejay for nature created them dependent upon the animals and birds and fishes having neither fur nor feathers to protect their poor skinny bodies they wear clothing made of the fleece of sheep and skins of seals and beavers and otters and even the humble muskrats they cover their feet and their hands with skins of beasts they sleep upon the feathers of birds their food is the flesh of beasts and birds and fishes no created thing is so dependent upon others as man therefore he is the greatest destroyer in the world but he is not alone in his murderous despoiling instinct while you rail at man my friends do not forget that birds are themselves the greatest enemies of birds  nonsense cried the magpie indignantly  perhaps the less you say about this matter the better declared the bluejay swinging his club in a suggestive manner and looking sharply at the magpie  its a slander said the blackbird im sure you cant accuse me of injuring birds in any way  if you are all innocent why are we obliged to have a policeman enquired the little wren in a nervous voice  tell me said twinkle appealing to the bluejay are the big birds really naughty to the little ones  why it is the same with us as it is with men replied the policeman there are good ones and bad ones among us and the bad ones have to be watched men destroy us wantonly other animals and the sly serpents prey upon us and our eggs for food but these are open enemies and we know how we may best avoid them our most dangerous foes are those bandits of our own race who instead of protecting their brethren steal our eggs and murder our young they are not always the biggest birds by any means that do these things the crow family is known to be treacherous and the shrike is rightly called the butcherbird but there are many others that we have reason to suspect feed upon their own race  how dreadful exclaimed the girllark  the birds all seemed restless and uneasy at this conversation and looked upon one another with suspicious glances but the bluejay soothed them by saying  after all i suppose we imagine more evil than really exists and sometimes accuse our neighbors wrongfully but the mother birds know how often their nests have been robbed in their absence and if they suspect some neighbor of the crime instead of a prowling animal it is but natural since many birds cannot be trusted there are laws in the forest of course but the guilty ones are often able to escape ill tell you of a little tragedy that happened only last week which will prove how apt we are to be mistaken    chapter vii the bluejays story  there is no more faithful mother in the forest than the blue titmouse which is a cousin to the chickadee continued the policeman and this spring tom titmouse and his wife nancy set up housekeeping in a little hollow in an elmtree about half a mile north of this spot of course the first thing nancy did was to lay six beautiful eggswhite with brown spots all over themin the nest tom was as proud of these eggs as was nancy and as the nest was hidden in a safe place they flew away together to hunt for caterpillars and had no thought of danger but on their return an hour later what was their sorrow to find the nest empty and every pretty egg gone on the ground underneath the tree were scattered a few bits of shell but the robber was nowhere to be seen  tom titmouse was very indignant at this dreadful crime and came to me at once to complain of the matter but of course i had no idea who had done the deed i questioned all the birds who have ever been known to slyly steal eggs and every one denied the robbery so nancy titmouse saw she must lay more eggs and before long had another six speckled beauties in the bottom of her nest  they were more careful now about leaving home but the danger seemed past one bright sunny morning they ventured to fly to the brook to drink and bathe themselves and on their return found their home despoiled for a second time not an egg was left to them out of the six and while nancy wept and wailed tom looked sharply around him and saw a solitary shrike sitting on a limb not far away  whats a shrike asked chubbins  it is a bird that looks a good deal like that mockingbird sitting next you but it bears a bad character in the forest and has earned the vile name of butcherbird i admit that i am always obliged to keep an eye upon the shrike for i expect it to get into mischief at any time well tom titmouse naturally thought the shrike had eaten nancys eggs so he came to me and ordered me to arrest the robber but the shrike pleaded his innocence and i had no proof against him  again nancy with true motherly courage and perseverance laid her eggs in the nest and now they were never left alone for a single minute either she or tom was always at home and for my part i watched the shrike carefully and found he did not fly near the nest of the titmice at all  the result of our care was that one fine day the eggs hatched out and six skinny little titmice with big heads and small bodies were nestling against nancys breast the mother thought they were beautiful you may be sure and many birds gathered around to congratulate her and tom and the brown thrush sang a splendid song of welcome to the little ones  when the children got a little stronger it did not seem necessary to guard the nest so closely and the six appetites required a good many insects and butterflyeggs to satisfy them so tom and nancy both flew away to search for food and when they came back they found to their horror that their six little ones had been stolen and the nest was bare and cold nancy nearly fainted with sorrow and her cries were pitiful and heartrending but tom titmouse was dreadfully angry and came to me demanding vengeance  if you are any good at all as a policeman said he you will discover and punish the murderer of my babies  so i looked all around and finally discovered not far from the nest of the titmice four of their children all dead and each one impaled upon the thorn of a bush that grew close to the ground then i decided it was indeed the shrike for he has a habit of doing just this thing killing more than he can eat and sticking the rest of his murdered victims on thorns until he finds time to come back and devour them  i was also angry by that time so i flew to the shrikes nest and found him all scratched and torn and his feathers plucked in many places  what has happened to you i asked  i had a fight with a weasel last night answered the shrike and both of us are rather used up today  still said i sternly you had strength enough to kill the six little titmice and to eat two of them  i never did said he earnestly my wings are too stiff to fly  do not lie about it i beg of you said i for we have found four of the dead titmice stuck on the thorns of a bush and your people have been known to do such things before  at this the shrike looked worried  really said he i cannot understand it but i assure you i am innocent  nevertheless i arrested him and made him fly with me to the judgment tree where all the birds had congregated he was really stiff and sore and i could see it hurt him to fly but my duty was plain we selected a jury of twelve birds and judge bullfinch took his seat on a bough and then the trial began  tom titmouse accused the shrike of murder and so did nancy who had nearly cried her eyes out i also gave my evidence but the prisoner insisted strongly that he was innocent and claimed he had not left his nest since his fight with the weasel and so was guiltless of the crime  but no one had any sympathy for him or believed what he said for it is often the case that when one has earned a bad character he is thought capable of any wickedness so the jury declared him guilty and the judge condemned him to die at sundown we were all to fall upon the prisoner together and tear him into bits with bill and claw but while we waited for the sun to sink will sparrow flew up to the judgment tree and said  hello whats going on here  we are just about to execute a criminal replied the judge  what has he been doing asked will eyeing the shrike curiously  he killed the titmice children this morning and ate two of them and stuck the other four upon a thorn bush explained the judge  oh no the shrike did not do that cried will sparrow i saw the crime committed with my own eyes and it was the cunning weaselthe one that lives in the pine stumpthat did the dreadful murder  at this all the birds set up an excited chatter and the shrike again screamed that he was innocent so the judge said gravely will sparrow always speaks the truth release the prisoner for we have misjudged him we must exact our vengeance upon the weasel  so we all flew swiftly to the pine stump which we knew well and when we arrived we found the weasel sitting at the edge of his hole and laughing at us  that is the very weasel i fought with said the shrike you can see where i tore the fur from his head and back with my sharp beak  so you did answered the weasel and in return i killed the little tomtits  did you stick them on the thorns asked judge bullfinch  yes said the weasel i hoped you would accuse the shrike of the murder and kill him to satisfy my vengeance  we nearly fell into the trap returned the judge but will sparrow saw your act and reported it just in time to save the shrikes life but tell me did you also eat nancy titmouses eggs  of course confessed the weasel and they were very good indeed  hearing this tom titmouse became so excited that he made a furious dash at the weasel who slipped within his hole and escaped  i condemn you to death cried the judge  thats all right answered the weasel sticking just the tip of his nose out of the hole but youve got to catch me before you can kill me run home my pretty birds youre no match for a weasel  then he was gone from sight and we knew he was hidden safely in the stump where we could not follow him for the weasels body is slim and slender but i have not lived in the forest all my life without learning something and i whispered a plan to judge bullfinch that met with his approval he sent messengers at once for the ivorybilled woodpeckers and soon four of those big birds appeared and agreed to help us they began tearing away at the stump with their strong beaks and the splinters flew in every direction it was not yet dark when the cunning weasel was dragged from his hole and was at the mercy of the birds he had so cruelly offended we fell upon him in a flash and he was dead almost instantly  what became of the shrike asked twinkle  he left the forest the next day answered policeman bluejay for although he was innocent of this crime he was still a butcherbird and he knew our people had no confidence in him  it was lucky will sparrow came in time said the girllark but all these stories must have made you hungry so id like to invite my guests to have some refreshments  the birds seemed much surprised by this invitation and even policeman bluejay wondered what she was going to do but twinkle whispered to chubbins and both the birdchildren flew into their basket and returned with their claws full of cookie they repeated the journey many times distributing bits of the rare food to all of the birds who had visited them and each one ate the morsel eagerly and declared that it was very good  now said the policeman when the feast was over let us all go to the brook and have a drink of its clear sweet water  so they flew away a large and merry band of all sizes and colors and the childlarks joined them skimming the air as lightly and joyously as any of their new friends it did not take them long to reach a sparkling brook that wound its way through the forest and all the feathered people drank their fill standing upon the low bank or upon stones that rose above the level of the water  at first the children were afraid they might fall into the brook but presently they gained courage and when they saw the thrush and bullfinch plunge in and bathe themselves in the cool water chubbins decided to follow their example and afterward twinkle also joined them  the birds now bade the childlarks goodbye and promised to call upon them again and soon all had flown away except the bluejay who said he would see twinkle and chubbins safe home again so that they would not get lost  they thanked him for this kindness and when they had once more settled upon the limb beside their nest the bluejay also bade them good night and darted away for one last look through the forest to see that all was orderly for the night    chapter viii mrs hootaway  as the childlarks sat side by side upon their limb with the soft gray nest near at hand the twilight fell and a shadow began to grow and deepen throughout the forest  twink said chubbins gravely how do you like it  well replied the girl it isnt so bad in the daytime but its worse at night that bunch of grass mixed up with the stems of leaves that they call a nest isnt much like my pretty white bed at home chubbins  nor mine he agreed and twink how ever can we say our prayers when we havent any hands to hold up together  prayers chub said the girl are more in our hearts than in our hands it isnt what we do that counts its what we feel but the most that bothers me is what the folks at home will think when we dont come back  theyll hunt for us chubbins suggested and they may come under this tree and call to us  if they do said twinkle well fly right down to them  i advise you not to fly much in the night said a cheery voice beside them and wisk the squirrel stuck his head out of the hollow where he lived youve had quite a party here today he continued and they behaved pretty well while the policeman was around but some of them might not be so friendly if you met them alone  would any bird hurt us asked the girl in surprise  why ive seen a magpie meet a thrush and fly away alone replied wisk and the wrens and chickadees avoid the cuckoo as much as possible because they are fond of being alive but the policeman keeps the big birds all in order when he is around and he makes them all afraid to disobey the laws hes a wonderful fellow that policeman bluejay and even we squirrels are glad he is in the forest  why asked chubbins  well we also fear some of the birds answered wisk the lady in the third flat for instance mrs hootaway is said to like a squirrel for a midnight meal now and then when mice and beetles are scarce it is almost her hour for wakening so i must be careful to keep near home  tuttuttut cried a harsh voice from above what scandal is this you are talking mr wisk  the squirrel was gone in a flash but a moment later he put out his head again and turned one bright eye toward the upper part of the tree there on a perch outside her hollow sat the gray owl pruning her feathers it was nearly dark by this time and through the dusk mrs hootaways yellow eyes could be seen gleaming bright and wide open  what nonsense are you putting into the heads of these little innocents continued the owl in a scolding tone  no nonsense at all said wisk in reply the childlarks are safe enough from you because they are under the protection of policeman bluejay and he would have a fine revenge if you dared to hurt them but my case is different the laws of the birds do not protect squirrels and when youre abroad my dear mrs hootaway i prefer to remain snugly at home  to be sure remarked the owl with a laugh you are timid and suspicious by nature my dear wisk and you forget that although i have known you for a long time i have never yet eaten you  that is my fault and not yours retorted the squirrel  well im not after you tonight neighbor nor after birds either i know where there are seven fat mice to be had and until they are all gone you may cease to worry  im glad to hear that replied wisk i wish there were seven hundred mice to feed your appetite but im not going to run into danger recklessly nevertheless and it is my bedtime so good night mrs hootaway and good night little childlarks the owl did not reply but twinkle and chubbins called good night to the friendly squirrel and then they hopped into their nest and cuddled down close together  the moon was now rising over the trees and flooding the gloom of the forest with its subdued silver radiance the children were not sleepy their new life was too strange and wonderful for them to be able to close their eyes at once so they were rather pleased when the gray owl settled on the branch beside their nest and began to talk to them  im used to slanders my dears she said in a pleasanter tone than she had used before so i dont mind much what neighbor wisk says to me but i do not wish you to think ill of the owl family and so i must assure you that we are as gentle and kindly as any feathered creatures in the forestnot excepting the birds of paradise  i am sure of that replied twinkle earnestly you are too soft and fluffy and pretty to be bad  it isnt the prettiness said the gray owl evidently pleased by the compliment it is the nature of owls to be kind and sympathetic those who do not know us very well say harsh things about us because we fly in the night when most other birds are asleep and sleep in the daytime when most other birds are awake  why do you do that asked chubbins  because the strong light hurts our eyes but although we are abroad in the night we seek only our natural prey and obey the great law of the forest more than some others do  what is the great law enquired twinkle curiously  love it is the moral law that is above all laws made by living creatures the whole forest is ruled by love more than it is by fear you may think this is strange when you remember that some animals eat birds and some birds eat animals and the dreadful creeping things eat us both but nevertheless we are so close to nature here that love and tenderness for our kind influences us even more than it does mankind the careless and unthinking race from which you came the residents of the forest are good parents helpful neighbors and faithful friends what better than this could be said of us  nothing im sure if it is true replied the girl  over in the land of paradise continued the owl thoughtfully the birds are not obliged to take life in order to live themselves so they call us savage and fierce but i believe our natures are as kindly as those of the birds of paradise  where is this land of paradise you speak of asked twinkle  directly in the center of our forest it is a magical spot protected from intrusion not by any wall or barred gates but by a strong wind that blows all birds away from that magnificent country except the birds of paradise themselves there is a legend that man once lived there but for some unknown crime was driven away but the birds have always been allowed to inhabit the place because they did no harm  id like to see it said chubbins  so would i confessed the gray owl with a sigh but there is no use of my attempting to get into the paradise of birds because the wind would blow me back but now it is getting quite dark and i must be off to seek my food mrs possum and i have agreed to hunt together tonight  who is mrs possum the girl asked  an animal living in the lowest hollow of this tree answered the owl she is a goodnatured creature and hunts by night as i do she is slow but being near the ground she can spy a mouse much quicker than i can and then she calls to me to catch it so between us we get plenty of game and are helpful to each other the only drawback is that mrs possum has four children which she carries in her pouch wherever she goes and they have to be fed as well as their mother so the possums have five mouths to my one and it keeps us busy to supply them all  its very kind of you to help her remarked twinkle  oh she helps me too returned the owl cheerfully but now good night my dears you will probably be sound asleep when i get home again  off flew mrs hootaway with these words and her wings moved so noiselessly that she seemed to fade away into the darkness like a ghost  the childlarks sat looking at the silver moon for a time but presently twinkles eyelids drooped and she fell fast asleep and chubbins was not long in following her example    chapter ix the destroyers  a loud shouting and a bang that echoed like a clap of thunder through the forest awoke the birdchildren from their dreams  opening their eyes with a start they saw that the gray dawn was breaking and a sort of morning twilight made all objects in the forest distinct yet not so brilliant as the approaching daylight would shadows still lay among the bushes and the thickest branches but between the trees the spaces were clearly visible  the children rudely awakened by the riot of noise in their ears could distinguish the barking of dogs the shouts of men calling to the brutes and the scream of an animal in deep distress immediately after there was a whirl overhead and the gray owl settled on the limb beside their nest  theyve got her she exclaimed in a trembling terrified voice the men have shot mrs possum dead and the dogs are now tearing her four babies limb from limb  where are they whispered twinkle her little heart beating as violently as if the dread destroyers had always been her mortal enemies  just below us isnt it dreadful we had such a nice night together and mrs possum was so sweet and loving in caring for her little ones and feeding them and just as we were nearly home again the dogs sprang upon my friend and the men shot her dead we had not even suspected until then that our foes were in the forest  twinkle and chubbins craned their necks over the edge of the nest and looked down on the ground stood a man and a boy and two great dogs were growling fiercely and tearing some bloody revolting object with their cruel jaws  look out cried the voice of wisk the squirrel hes aiming at youlook out  they ducked their heads again just as the gun roared and flamed fire beneath them  ohhh wailed mrs hootaway fluttering violently beside them they struck me that timethe bullet is in my heart goodbye my dears remember thatallis love all islove  her voice died away to a whisper and she toppled from the limb twinkle and chubbins tried to save their dying friend from falling but the gray owl was so much bigger than they that they could not support the weight of her body slowly she sank to the ground and fell upon the earth with a dull sound that was dreadful to hear  instantly twinkle darted from the nest and swooped downward alighting on the ground beside the owls quivering body a big dog came bounding toward her the man was reloading his gun a few paces away  call off your dog shouted twinkle wildly excited how dare you shoot the poor harmless birds call off your dog i say  but even as she spoke the words sounded in her own ears strange and unnatural and more like the chirping of a bird than the language of men the hunter either did not hear her or he did not understand her and the dog snarled and bared its wicked teeth as it sprang greedily upon the childlark  twinkle was too terrified to move she glared upon the approaching monster helplessly and it had almost reached her when a black object fell from the skies with the swiftness of a lightning streak and struck the dogs back tearing the flesh with its powerful talons and driving a stout merciless beak straight through the skull of the savage brute  the dog already dead straightened out and twitched convulsively the man shouted angrily and sprang upon the huge bird that had slain his pet at the same time swinging his gun like a club  quick said the eagle to twinkle mount with me as swiftly as you can  with the words he rose into the air and twinkle darted after him while chubbins seeing their flight from his nest joined them just in time to escape a shot from the boys deadly gun  the inquisitive squirrel however had stuck his head out to see what was happening and one of the leaden bullets buried itself in his breast chubbins saw him fall back into his hollow and heard his agonized scream but he could not stay to help his poor friend an instant later he had joined the eagle and twinkle and was flying as hard and swift as his wonderful lark wings could carry him up up into the blue sky  the sunshine touched them now while below the tragic forest still lay buried in gloom  we are quite safe here for i am sure no shot from a gun could reach us said the eagle so let us rest upon our wings for a while how lucky it was that i happened to be around in time to rescue you my little friends  i am very grateful indeed answered twinkle holding her wings outstretched so that she floated lightly in the air beside her rescuer if you had been an instant later the dog would have killed me  very true returned the eagle i saw your danger while i was in the air and determined to act quickly although i might myself have been shot by the man had his gun been loaded but i have noticed that a bold action is often successful because it causes surprise and the foe does not know what to do  im shamed of those people said chubbins indignantly what right had they to come to the forest and kill the pretty owl and the dear little squirrel and the poor mama possum and her babies  they had the right of power said the eagle calmly it would be a beautiful world were there no destroyers of life in it but the earth and air and water would then soon become so crowded that there would not be room for them all to exist dont blame the men  but they are cruel said twinkle and kill innocent harmless birds and animals instead of the wicked ones that could be better spared  cruelty is mans nature answered the eagle of all created things men tigers and snakes are known to be the most cruel from them we expect no mercy but now what shall be our next movement i suppose it will be best for you to keep away from the forest until the men are gone would you like to visit my home and meet my wife and children  yes indeed cried twinkle if you will be kind enough to let us  it will be a great pleasure to me said the eagle follow me closely please  he began flying again and they kept at his side by and by they noticed a bright rosy glow coming from a portion of the forest beneath them  what is that asked chubbins  it is the place called the paradise of birds answered their conductor it is said to be the most beautiful place in all the world but no one except the birds of paradise are allowed to live there those favored birds sometimes enter our part of the forest but we are never allowed to enter theirs  id like to see that place said twinkle  well you two childlarks are different from all other birds remarked the eagle and for that reason perhaps you would be allowed to visit the paradise that is forbidden the rest of us if ever i meet one of the beautiful birds that live there i will ask it to grant you the privilege  do said twinkle and chubbins in one eager breath they flew for a long time high in the air but neither of the birdchildren seemed to tire in the least they could not go quite as fast as the eagle however who moderated his speed so that they could keep up with him    chapter x in the eagles nest  gradually the forest passed out of sight and only bleak rugged mountains were below them one peak rose higher than the others and faced the sea and to this point the great eagle directed their flight  on a crag that jutted out from the mountain was the eagles nest made of rude sticks of wood gathered from the forest sitting beside the nest was mrs eagle larger and more pompous even than her husband while squatting upon the edge of the nest were two halfgrown eaglets with enormous claws and heads but rather skinny bodies that were covered with loose and ragged feathers neither the nest nor the eaglets appeared to be very clean and a disagreeable smell hung over the place  this is funny said mrs eagle looking at the childlarks with surprise usually you kill your game before you bring it home jonathan but today it seems our dinner has flown to us willingly  theyre for us cried one of the eaglets making a quick dash to seize twinkle who darted out of his reach  one for each of us screamed the other eaglet rushing at chubbins  peacebe quiet said the eagle sternly cannot you tell friends from food you foolish youngsters these are two little friends of mine whom i have invited to visit us so you must treat them in a civil manner  why not eat them asked one of the eaglets looking at the childlarks with hungry eyes  because i forbid you they are my guests and must be protected and well treated and even if this were not so the larks are too small to satisfy your hunger you little gluttons  jonathan said mrs eagle coldly do not reproach our offspring for their hunger we sent you out this morning to procure a supply of food and we expected you to bring us home something good to eat instead of these useless little creatures  the eagle seemed annoyed at being scolded in this manner  i had an adventure in the forest he said and came near being shot and killed by a man that is the reason i came home so soon  twinkle and chubbins were standing together at the edge of the crag when one of the eaglets suddenly spread out his wide stiff wings and pushed them over the precipice they recovered themselves before they had fallen far and flew to the ledge again just in time to see the father eagle cuff his naughty son very soundly but the mother only laughed in her harsh voice and said  it is so early in the day jonathan that i advise you to go again in search of food our sweet darlings will not be comforted until they have eaten  very well answered the eagle i am sorry you cannot treat my guests more politely for they are all unaccustomed to such rudeness but i see that it will be better for me to take them away with me at once  do said mrs eagle and the eaglets cried better let us eat em daddy they are not very big but theyre better than no breakfast at all  youre disgreeable things said twinkle indignantly and i dont like you a bit so there  come on twink said chubbins lets go away  i will take you back to the forest the eagle declared and at once rose into the air twinkle and chubbins followed him and soon the nest on the crag was left far behind and they could no longer hear the hoot of the savage young ones  for a time the eagle flew in silence then he said  you must forgive my family for not being more hospitable you must know that they live a very lonely life and have no society because every living thing fears them but i go abroad more and see more of the world so i know very well how guests ought to be treated  you have been very kind to us mr eagle replied the girllark and you saved my life when the dog would have killed me i dont blame you any for what your family did my mama says lots of people show off better abroad than they do at home and thats your case exactly if i were you i wouldnt take any more visitors to my nest  i do not intend to answered the eagle but i am glad that you think well of me personally if you do not of my family and i assure you it has been a real pleasure to me to assist you were you like ordinary birds you would be beneath my notice but i am wise enough to understand that you are very unusual and wonderful little creatures and if at any time i can serve you further you have but to call me and i will do what i can for you  thank you very much replied twinkle who realized that the great bird had acted more gently toward them than it is the nature of his wild race to do  they had just reached the edge of the forest again when they saw a bird approaching them at a great speed and soon it came near enough for them to see that it was policeman bluejay he wore his official helmet and carried his club and as soon as he came beside them he said  thank goodness ive found you at last ive been hunting for you an hour and began to fear you had met with some misfortune  weve been with the eagle said the girl he saved our lives and carried us away from where the dreadful men were  we have had sad doings in the forest todayvery sad indeed declared the bluejay in a grave voice the hunters did even more damage than usual they killed jolly joe the brown bear and sam fox and mrs possum and her babies and wisk the squirrel so that the animals are all in mourning for their friends but our birds suffered greatly also mrs hootaway is dead and three pigeons belonging to a highly respected family but the saddest of all is the murder of mr and mrs goldfinch both of whom were killed by the same shot you may remember my dears that they were at your reception yesterday and as gay and happy as any of the company present in their nest are now five little children too young and weak to fly and there is no one to feed them or look after them  oh that is dreadful exclaimed twinkle cant chubbins and i do something for the little goldfinches  why that is why i was so anxious to find you answered policeman bluejay you havent laid any eggs yet and have no one to depend upon you so i hoped you would adopt the goldfinch babies  we will said chubbins promptly we can feed them out of our basket  oh yes chimed in the girl we couldnt catch grubs for them you know  it wont be necessary observed the policeman with a sly wink at the eagle theyre too young yet to know grubs from grub    chapter xi the orphans  the eagle now bade them goodbye and flew away in search of prey while the bluejay and the childlarks directed their flight toward that part of the great forest where they lived  are you sure the men have gone asked chubbins  yes replied the policeman they left the forest as soon as they had shot jolly joe for the brown bear was so heavy that they had to carry him on a pole resting across their shoulders i hope they wont come again very soon  did they take mrs hootaway with them asked twinkle  yes she will probably be stuffed poor thing  presently they passed near the rosy glow that lighted up the center of the forest with its soft radiance and the girl said  that is the paradise land where the birds of paradise live the eagle has promised to ask one of those birds to let us visit their country  oh i can do better than that if you wish to visit the paradise responded the bluejay for the guardian of the entrance is a special friend of mine and will do whatever i ask him to  will he really asked the girl in delight  to be sure some day i will take you over there and then you will see what powerful friends policeman bluejay has  id like that declared twinkle  their swift flight enabled them to cover the remaining distance very rapidly and soon they were at home again  they first flew to the nest of the goldfinches which was in a tree not far from the maple where the larkchildren lived there they found the tiny birds who were yet so new that they were helpless indeed mrs redbreast was sitting by the nest when they arrived and she said  the poor orphans are still hungry although i have fed them all the insects i could find near but i am glad that you have come for it is time i was at home looking after my own little ones  chubbins and i have dopted the goldfinches said twinkle so we will look after them now but it was very nice of you mrs redbreast to take take care of them until we arrived  well i like to be neighborly returned the pretty bird and as long as cruel men enter our forest no mother can tell how soon her own little ones will be orphaned and left helpless  that is true said the policeman nodding gravely  so mrs redbreast flew away and now chubbins looked curiously into the nest where several fluffy heads were eagerly lifted with their bills as wide open as they could possibly stretch  they must be just awful hungry twink said the boy  oh theyre always like that observed policeman bluejay calmly when anyone is around they open their mouths to be fed whether they are hungry or not its the way with birdlets  what shall we feed them asked twinkle  oh anything at all they are not particular said the bluejay and then he flew away and left the childlarks to their new and interesting task  ill be the father and you be the mother said chubbins  all right answered twinkle  peep peep peep said the tiny goldfinches  i wonder if the luncheon in our basket would agree with them remarked the girl looking at the open mouths reflectively as she perched her own brown body upon the edge of the deep nest  might try it suggested the boy the cop says theyre not particular and whats good enough for us ought to be good enough for them  so they flew to where the basket hung among the thick leaves of the tree which had served to prevent the men from discovering it and crept underneath the cloth that covered it  which do you think theyd like best asked chubbins the pickles or the cheese  neither one twinkle replied the sandwiches will be best for them wait ill pick out some of the meat that is between the slices of bread theyll be sure to like that  of course agreed chubbins promptly theyll think its bugs  so each one dragged out a big piece of meat from a sandwich and by holding it fast in one claw they managed to fly with the burden to the nest of the goldfinch babies  dont give it to em all at once cautioned the girl it would choke em  i know said chubbins  he tore off a tiny bit of the meat and dropped it into one of the wideopen bills instantly it was gone and the mouth was open again for more they tried to divide the dinner equally among them but they all looked so alike and were so ravenous to eat everything that was dropped into their bills that it was hard work to keep track of which had been fed and which had not but the childlarks were positive that each one had had enough to keep it from starving because there was a big bunch in front of each little breast that was a certain proof of a full crop  the next task of the guardians was to give the birdlets drink so twinkle and chubbins flew to the brook and by hunting around a while they found an acorncup that had fallen from one of the oak trees this they filled with water and then twinkle who was a trifle larger than the boylark clutched the cup firmly with her toes and flew back to the orphans without spilling more than a few drops they managed to pour some of the water into each open mouth and then twinkle said  there they wont die of either hunger or thirst in a hurry chub so now we can feed ourselves  their mouths are still open returned the boy doubtfully  it must be a habit they have she answered wouldnt you think theyd get tired stretching their bills that way  peep peep peep cried the baby goldfinches  you see said the boy with a wise look they dont know any better i had a dog once that howled every time we shut him up but if we let him alone he stopped howling well go and get something to eat and let these beggars alone a while perhaps theyll shut their mouths by the time we get back again  maybe replied twinkle  they got their own luncheon from the basket and afterward perched on the tree near the nest of the little goldfinches they did not feel at all comfortable in their old nest in the maple because they could not forget the tragic deaths of the inhabitants of the three hollows in the treethe three flats as poor wisk had merrily called them  during the afternoon several of the birds came to call upon the orphans and they all nodded approval when they found the childlarks watching over the little ones twinkle questioned some of the mothers anxiously about that trick the babies had of keeping their bills open and crying for food but she was told to pay no attention to such actions  nevertheless the pleadings of the orphans who were really stuffed full of food made the childlarks so nervous that they hailed with delight the arrival of policeman bluejay in the early evening the busy officer had brought with him mrs chaffinch a widow whose husband had been killed a few days before by a savage wildcat  mrs chaffinch declared she would be delighted to become a mother to the little goldfinches and rear them properly she had always had good success in bringing up her own children she claimed and the goldfinches were first cousins to the chaffinches so she was sure to understand their ways perfectly  twinkle did not want to give up her charges at first as she had become interested in them but chubbins heaved a sigh of relief and declared he was glad the restless little beggars had a mother that knew more about them than he did the bluejay hinted that he considered the widows experience would enable her to do more for the baby goldfinches than could a childlark who had never yet laid an egg and so twinkle was forced to yield to his superior judgment  mrs chaffinch settled herself in a motherly manner upon the nest and the two birdchildren bade her goodnight and returned to their own maple tree where they had a rather wakeful night because chubbins thoughtlessly suggested that the place might be haunted by the ghosts of the gray owl wisk and mrs possum  but either the poor things had no ghosts or they were too polite to bother the little childlarks    chapter xii the guardian  the next morning ushered in a glorious day sunny and bright the sky was a clear blue and only a slight breeze ruffled the leaves of the trees even before twinkle and chubbins were awake the birds were calling merrily to one another throughout the forest and the chipmonks chirped in their own brisk businesslike way as they scuttled from tree to tree  while the childlarks were finishing their breakfast policeman bluejay came to them his feathers looking fresh and glossy and all his gorgeous colorings appearing especially beautiful in the sunshine  today will be a rare day to visit the paradise he said so i have come to escort you to the guardian of the entrance who i am sure will arrange for you to enter that wonderful country  it is very kind of you to remember our wish said twinkle we are all ready  so they flew above the treetops and began their journey toward the center of the forest  wheres your plicemans hat and club chubbins asked the bluejay  why i left them at home was the reply im not on official duty today you know and the guardian does not like to see anything that looks like a weapon in his country there are no such things as quarrels or fighting or naughtiness of any sort for as they have everything they want there is nothing to quarrel over or fight for the birds of paradise have laws i understand but they obey them because they are told to and not because they are forced to it would be a bad country for a policeman to live in  but a good place for everyone else said twinkle  perhaps so agreed the policeman reluctantly but i sometimes think the goodygoody places would get awful tiresome to live in after a time here in our part of the forest there is a little excitement for the biggest birds only obey our laws through fear of punishment and i understand it is just the same in the world of men but in the birds paradise there lives but one race every member of which is quite particular not to annoy any of his fellows in any way that is why they will admit no disturbing element into their country if you are admitted my dears you must be very careful not to offend any one that you meet  well try to be good promised chubbins  i would not dare to take any of my own people there continued the bluejay flying swiftly along as they talked together but you two are different and more like the fairy birds of paradise themselves than like our forest birds that is the reason i feel sure the guardian will admit you  im naughty sometimes and so is chubbins said twinkle honestly but we try not to be any naughtier than we can help  i am sure you will behave very nicely replied the bluejay  after a time the rosy glow appeared reflected in the blue sky and as they flew toward it the soft and delightful radiance seemed to grow and deepen in intensity it did not dazzle their eyes in the least but as the light penetrated the forest and its furthest rays fell upon the group they experienced a queer sense of elation and lighthearted joy  but now the breeze freshened and grew more strong pressing against their feathered breasts so gently yet powerfully that they soon discovered they were not advancing at all but simply fluttering in the air  drop down to the ground whispered the bluejay and they obeyed his injunction and found that close to the earth the wind was not so strong  that is a secret i learned some time ago said their friend most birds who seek to enter the paradise try to beat against the wind and are therefore always driven back but there is just one way to approach the guardian near enough to converse with him after that it depends entirely upon his goodwill whether you get any farther  the wind still blew so strongly that it nearly took their breath away but by creeping steadily over the ground they were able to proceed slowly and after a time the pressure of the wind grew less and less until it suddenly ceased altogether  then they stopped to rest and to catch their breaths but before this happened twinkle and chubbins both uttered exclamations of amazement at the sight that met their eyes  before them was a grove composed of stately trees not made of wood but having trunks of polished gold and silver and leaves of exquisite metallic colorings beneath the trees was a mass of brilliant flowers exceedingly rare and curious in form and as our little friends looked upon them these flowers suddenly began a chant of greeting and then sang a song so sweet and musical that the larkchildren were entranced and listened in rapt delight  when the song ended the flowers all nodded their heads in a pretty way and twinkle drew a long breath and murmured  isnt it odd to hear flowers sing im sure the birds themselves cannot beat that music  they wont try replied the policeman for birds of paradise do not sing  how strange exclaimed the girl  the land they live in is so full of music that they do not need to continued the bluejay but before us is the entrance leading through the limbs of that great golden tree you see at the left fly swiftly with me and perch upon the middle branch  with these words he darted toward the tree and twinkle and chubbins followed in a few seconds they alighted upon the branch and found themselves face to face with the first bird of paradise they had yet seen  he possessed a graceful carriage and a most attractive form being in size about as large as a common pigeon his eyes were shrewd but gentle in expression and his pose as he stood regarding the newcomers was dignified and impressive but the children had little time to note these things because their wondering eyes were riveted upon the birds magnificent plumage the feathers lay so smoothly against his body that they seemed to present a solid surface and in color they were a glistening emerald green upon the neck and wings shading down on the breast to a softer green and then to a pure white the main wingfeathers were white tipped with vivid scarlet and the white feathers of his crest were also tipped with specks of flame but his tail feathers were the most beautiful of all his gay uniform they spread out in the shape of a fan and every other feather was brilliant green and its alternate feather snow white  how lovely cried twinkle and the bird bowed its head and with a merry glance from its eyes responded  your admiration highly honors me little stranger  this said policeman bluejay is the important official called the guardian of the entrance of paradise sir guardian permit me to introduce to you two children of men who have been magically transformed into skylarks against their will they are not quite birds because their heads retain the human shape but whatever form they may bear their natures are sweet and innocent and i deem them worthy to associate for a brief time with your splendid and regal race therefore i have brought them here to commend them to your hospitality and goodwill and i hope you will receive them as your guests  what are your names little strangers asked the guardian  mama calls me twinkle said the girl  im chubbins said the boy  the guardian looked attentively at the bluejay  you know our regulations said he no birds of the forest are admitted to our paradise  i know replied the policeman i will await my little friends here it is pleasure enough for me to have just this glimpse of your beautiful fairyland  the guardian nodded his approval of this speech  very well he answered you shall remain and visit with me if all forest birds were like you my friend there would be little danger in admitting them into our society but they are not and the laws must be regarded as for the childlarks i will send them first to the king in charge of the royal messenger whom i will now summon  he tossed his head upward with an abrupt motion and in the treetop a chime of golden bells rang musically in the air the flowers beneath them caught up the refrain and sang it softly until another bird came darting through the air and alighted on the golden limb beside the guardian  the newcomer was differently garbed from the other his plumage was orange and white the crest and wingfeathers being tipped with bright blue nor was he so large as the guardian nor so dignified in demeanor indeed his expression was rather merry and roguish and as he saw the strangers he gave a short sharp whistle of surprise  my dear ephel said the guardian oblige me by escorting these childlarks to the presence of his majesty the king  i am delighted to obey your request answered ephel the messenger brightly then turning to twinkle and chubbins he added i trust you will find my society agreeable during our flight to the royal monarch of paradise  twinkle was too much embarrassed by this politeness to answer at once but chubbins said sure thing in a matteroffact voice and the messenger nodded gaily and continued  then we will go if it pleases you  he spread his wings in a flash of color and sped away into the paradise and the children eagerly followed him    chapter xiii the king bird  more and more magnificence was unfolded as they advanced into this veritable fairyland of the birds vines of silver climbed up the golden trunks of trees and mingled their twining threads with the brilliant leaves and now upon the trees appeared jewelled blossoms that sparkled most exquisitely in the rosyhued radiance that in this favored spot had taken the place of sunshine there were beds of plants with widespreading leaves that changed color constantly one hue slowly melting into another and no two leaves on the same plant having the same color at the same time yet in spite of the vivid coloring that prevailed everywhere each combination seemed in perfect harmony and served to delight the senses  bushes that emitted a grateful fragrance bore upon slender branches little bells that at times tinkled in the perfumed breeze and played sweet melodies while here and there were clusters of fountainlilies that shot sprays of crystal water high into the air when the water fell back again and the drops struck against the broad leaves of the plants they produced a melodious sound that was so delightful that twinkle thought she could listen to it for hours  their guide flew silently on and the two children were so much amazed by their surroundings that they had no words for questions or even remarks  the scene was ever shifting and becoming more and more lovely and fascinating and the paradise was more extensive than they had thought it  by and bye ephel the messenger approached the central part where was a great arbor thickly covered with masses of pure white flowers some of these were large like chrysanthemums and mammoth white double roses while among them were twined smaller and more delicate blossoms like the bells of liliesofthevalley  ephel entered the arch of the arbor and flew on for it was of great extent and continually enlarged from the point of entrance so that at last the childlarks found themselves in a lofty circular chamber banked on sides and roof with solid masses of the snowwhite flowers which filled the air with a sweet and agreeable perfume the floor was also a mass of white blossoms so that the place resembled the inside of a huge cornucopia  but the eyes of the little strangers were not directed so much to the arbor itself as to the group of splendid birds that occupied the flowerchamber and perched upon a widespreading bush of filigree gold that rose from the middle of the floor and spread its dainty branches in every direction  on the lower branches sat many birds of marvellous colorings some having blue the predominant tint in their feathers and others green or scarlet or brilliant yellows in strong contrast with these were a few modestlooking birds with soft brown feathers covering their graceful forms that sat silently upon the lowest and most retired branch of the golden bush but still greater was the contrast of all present with the magnificence of the one occupying the topmost branch  this gorgeous creature whose splendor dominated the white bower at once won the childrens attention and they had no doubt they were gazing upon the king bird of paradise  the feathers of his head and neck were so fine that they looked like a covering of velvet these seemed to be at first of a delicate lavender color but the children observed that they shone with a different tint at every movement the king made the body feathers also as glossy as velvet were of a rich royal purple shading to lavender and then to white upon his breast his wing plumes were white tipped with specks of lustrous gold  but by far the most astonishing part of the kings plumage was that which consisted of the dainty fernlike plumes that rose from his body and tail and spread in graceful and bewildering curves both right and left until his form seemed to be standing in a feathery bower of resplendent beauty all the colors of the rainbow were seen in these delicate feathers and against the white background of the arch this monarch of the feathered world appeared more royally magnificent than any words can describe  both twinkle and chubbins gasped with amazement and delight as at the command of ephel they alighted upon a lowly branch of the golden bush and bowed their heads before the ruler of the birds fairyland  ah whom have we here asked the king in a soft voice as he strutted and proudly turned himself upon his perch  strangers your majesty answered the messenger they are sent to you by the guardian of the entrance because they are gentle and innocent and are neither birds nor mortals but a part of both  they are certainly very curious remarked the king staring at the human heads upon the lark bodies may i ask you little strangers how you happen to exist in your present form  twinkle tossing her head to throw back a straggling lock of hair that had fallen across her eyes began in her sweet voice to tell the story of their enchantment and not only the king but all the birds of paradise present listened intently to her words  when she had finished the king exclaimed  indeed my dear childlarks you are worthy to be our guests in fairyland so it will please me if you will be as happy and comfortable as possible and enjoy your stay with us as much as you can my people will delight to honor and amuse you and ephel shall continue to guide you wherever you go  thank you returned twinkle earnestly and chubbins added in his blunt way much obliged  but before you go continued his majesty tell me what you think of my royal person am i not beautiful  you are indeed replied twinkle only  only what asked the king as she hesitated  only im sorry you are so vain and strut around so and want everyone to see how beautiful you are  why should i not is not vanity one of the great virtues asked the king in a surprised voice  my mama says people ought not to think themselves nice or pretty said the child with us to be vain is a fault and we are taught to be modest and unassuming  how remarkable exclaimed the king and how very thoughtless your mother must be here we think that if god creates us beautiful it is a sin not to glory in his work and make everyone acknowledge the kindly skill of the supreme makers hand should i try to make others think or should i myself think that i am not most gracefully formed and most gorgeously clothed i would be guilty of the sin of not appreciating the favor of god and deserve to be punished  twinkle was amazed but could find no words to contradict this astonishing idea  i had not thought of it in that way she answered perhaps i am wrong your majesty and certainly you are very beautiful  think it over said the king graciously learn to be grateful for every good thing that is yours and proud that you have been selected by nature for adornment only in this way may such rare favors be deserved and now the royal messenger will show you the sights of our paradise and try to entertain you pleasantly while you are our guests  he turned aside with these words and fluttered his waving feathers so that their changing tints might dazzle the eyes of all observers but immediately afterward he paused and cried out  dear me one of my wing plumes is disarranged help me you ladies  at once the small brown birds on the lower branches who had been modestly quiet because they had no gay plumage flew up to the king and with their bills skillfully dressed his feathers putting the wing plume into its place again and arranging it properly while the other birds looked on with evident interest  as the larkchildren turned away to follow the messenger chubbins remarked  im glad i havent got all those giddy feathers  why asked twinkle who had been rather awed by the kings splendor  because it would take all my time to keep em smooth answered the boy the poor king cant do much more than admire himself so he dont get time to have fun    chapter xiv a real fairyland  as they left the royal arbor of white flowers the messenger turned to the left and guided his guests through several bright and charming avenues to a grove of trees that had bright blue bark and yellow leaves scattered about among the branches were blossoms of a delicate pink color shaped like a cup and resembling somewhat the flower of the morningglory  are you hungry asked ephel  oh i could eat something i guess said chubbins  the messenger flew to one of the trees and alighted upon a branch where three of the pink cupshaped flowers grew in a row the children followed him and sitting one before each blossom they looked within the cups and found them filled with an unknown substance that both looked and smelled delicious and appetizing  it is royal amal said their guide busily pecking at his cup with his bill help yourselves little ones you will find it very nice indeed  well said twinkle id be glad to eat it if i could but it wouldnt do chubbins and me a bit of good to stick our noses into these cups  ephel turned to look at them  true he remarked it was very careless of me to forget that you have no bills how are you accustomed to eat  why with spoons and knives and forks said the girl  you have but to ask for what you need declared the royal messenger  twinkle hesitated scarcely knowing what to say at last she spoke boldly i wish chub and i had spoons  hardly had the words left her lips when two tiny golden spoons appeared in the flowercups twinkle seized the spoon before her in one claw and dipped up a portion of the strange food which resembled charlotte russe in appearance when she tasted it she found it delicious so she eagerly ate all that the blossom contained  when she looked around for chubbins she found he was gone he had emptied his cup and carried the golden spoon to another blossom on a higher limb where the girl discovered him eating as fast as he could dip up the food  let us go to another tree said ephel there are many excellent things to eat and a variety of food is much more agreeable than feasting upon one kind  all right called chubbins who had succeeded in emptying the second cup  as they flew on twinkle said to the guide  i should think the blossoms would all be emptied in a little while  oh they fill up again in a few moments replied ephel should we go back even now i think we would find them all ready to eat again but here are the conona bushes let us taste these favorite morsels  the bushes on which they now rested had willowgreen branches with silver balls growing thickly upon them ephel tapped lightly upon one of the balls with his bill and at once it opened by means of a hinge in the center the two halves of the ball lying flat like plates on one side twinkle found tiny round pellets of cake each one just big enough to make a mouthful for a bird on the other side was a thick substance that looked like jelly  the proper thing to do said their guide is to roll one of the pellets in the jelly and then eat it  he showed twinkle how to do this and as she had brought her golden spoon with her it was easy enough ephel opened a ball for chubbins and then one for himself and the children thought this food even nicer than the first they had eaten  now we will have some fruit declared the messenger he escorted his charges to an orchard where grew many strange and beautiful trees hanging full of fruits that were all unknown to the larkchildren they were of many odd shapes and all superbly colored some gleaming like silver and gold and others being cherryred or vivid blue or royal purple in shade a few resembled grapes and peaches and cherries but they had flavors not only varied and delicious but altogether different from the fruits that grow outside of the birds paradise  another queer thing was that as fast as the children ate one fruit another appeared in its place and they hopped from branch to branch and tree to tree trying this one and that until chubbins exclaimed  really twink i cant eat another mouthful  im afraid weve both been stuffing ourselves chub the girl replied but these things taste so good it is hard to stop at the right time  would you like to drink asked ephel  if you please twinkle answered  then follow me said the guide  he led them through lovely vistas of wonderful trees down beautiful winding avenues that excited their admiration and past clusters of flowering plants with leaves as big as umbrellas and as bright as a painters palette the paradise seemed to have been laid out according to one exquisite symmetrical plan and although the avenues or paths between the trees and plants led in every direction the ground beneath them was everywhere thickly covered with a carpet of magnificent flowers or richly tinted ferns and grasses this was because the birds never walked upon the ground but always flew through the air  often as they passed by the flowers would greet them with sweet songs or choruses and the plants would play delightful music by rubbing or striking their leaves against one another so that the childrens ears were constantly filled with harmony while their eyes were feasted on the bewildering masses of rich color and each breath they drew was fragrant with the delicious odors of the blossoms that abounded on every side  of all the fairylands ive ever heard of or read about said twinkle this certainly is the best  its just a peach of a fairyland commented chubbins approvingly  here is the nectar tree presently remarked the royal messenger and he paused to allow them to observe it  the tree was all of silversilver trunk and branches and leavesand from the end of each leaf or branch dripped sparkling drops of a pinktinted liquid these glistened brightly as they fell through the air and lost themselves in a bed of silver moss that covered all the ground beneath the tree  ephel flew to a branch and held his mouth open so that a drop from above fell into it twinkle and chubbins followed his example and found the pink liquid very delightful to drink it seemed to quench their thirst and refresh them at the same time and when they flew from the queer dripping tree they were as lighthearted and gay as any two children so highly favored could possibly have felt  havent you any water in your paradise asked the little girllark  yes of course ephel answered the fountainlilies supply what water we wish to drink and the lustrous lake is large enough for us all to bathe in besides these we have also the lake of dry water for you must know that the lustrous lake is composed of wet water  i thought all water was wet said chubbins  it may be so in your country replied the royal messenger but in our paradise we have both dry and wet water would you like to visit these lakes  if you please said twinkle    chapter xv the lake of dry water  they flew through the jewelled gardens for quite a way emerging at last from among the trees to find before them a pretty sheet of water of a greenish hue upon the shore were rushes that when swayed by the breeze sang soft strains of music  this announced their guide is the lake of dry water  it looks wet all right said chubbins in a tone of doubt  but it isnt declared ephel watch me if you please  he hovered over the lake a moment and then dove downward and disappeared beneath the surface when he came up again he shook the drops of water from his plumage and then flew back to rejoin his guests  look at me he said my feathers are not even damp they looked and saw that he spoke truly then chubbins decided to try a bath in the dry water and also plunged into the lake when he came to the surface he floated there for a time and ducked his head again and again but when he came back to the others not a hair of his head nor a feather of his little brown body was in the least moist  thats fine water said the boylark i suppose you birds of paradise bathe here all the time  no answered ephel for only wet water is cleansing and refreshing we always take our daily baths in the lustrous lake but here we usually sail and disport ourselves for it is a comfort not to get wet when you want to play in the water  how do you sail asked twinkle with interest  i will show you replied their guide  he flew to a tall tree near that had broad curling leaves and plucked a leaf with his bill the breeze caught it at once and wafted it to the lake so that it fell gently upon the water  get aboard please called ephel and alighted upon the broad surface of the floating leaf twinkle and chubbins followed one sitting in front of their guide and one behind him then ephel spread out his wings of white and orange and the breeze pushed gently against them and sent the queer boat gliding over the surface of the dry water  sometimes when the wind is strong said the royal messenger these frail craft upset and then we are dumped into the water but we never mind that because the water is dry and we are not obliged to dress our feathers again  it is very convenient observed twinkle who was enjoying the sail could one be drowned in this lake  i suppose an animal like man could for it is as impossible to breathe beneath dry water as it is beneath wet but only birds live here and they cannot drown because as soon as they come to the surface they fly into the air  i see said twinkle musingly  they sailed way across the lake and because the wind was gentle they did not upset once on reaching the farther shore they abandoned the leafboat and again took wing and resumed their flight through the avenues  there was a great variety of scenery in the paradise and wherever they went something new and different was sure to meet their view  at one place the avenue was carpeted with big pansies of every color one could imagine some of them indeed having several colors blended together upon their petals as they passed over the pansies twinkle heard a chorus of joyous laughter and looking downward she perceived that the pansies all had faces and the faces resembled those of happy children  wait a minute she cried to chubbins and the guide and then she flew downward until she could see the faces more plainly they smiled and nodded to the girllark and laughed their merry laughter but when she spoke to them twinkle found they were unable to answer a single word  many of the faces were exceedingly beautiful but others were bold and saucy and a few looked at her with eyes twinkling with mischief they seemed very gay and contented in their paradise so twinkle merely kissed one lovely face that smiled upon her and then flew away to rejoin her companions    chapter xvi the beauty dance  before long they came to another and larger sheet of water and this twinkle decided was the most beautiful lake she had ever seen its waters were mostly deep blue in color although they had a changeable effect and constantly shifted from one hue to another little waves rippled all over its surface and the edges of the waves were glistening jewels which as they scattered in spray and fell into the bosom of the lake glinted and sparkled with a thousand flashing lights here were no rushes upon the shore but instead of them banks of gorgeous flowers grew far down to the waters edge so that the last ones dipped their petals into the lake itself  nestling upon this bank of flowers the royal messenger turned to his companions and said  here let us rest for a time while i call the friendly fishes to entertain you  he ended his speech with a peculiar warble and at its sound a score of fishes thrust their heads above the surface of the water some of them were goldfish and some silverfish but others had opal tints that were very pretty their faces were jolly in expression and their eyes chubbins thought must be diamonds because they sparkled so brightly  swimming softly here and there in the lovely waters of the lustrous lake the fishes sang this song    we are the fishes of the lake   our lives are very deep   were always active when awake   and quiet when asleep    we get our fins from finland   from books we get out tales   our eyes they come from eyerland   and weighty are our scales    we love to flop and twist and turn   whenever tis our whim   yet social etiquette we learn   because were in the swim    our beds though damp are always made   we need no fires to warm us   when we swim out were not afraid   for autos cannot harm us    were independent little fish   and never use umbrellas   we do exactly as we wish   and live like jolly fellows  as the fishes concluded their song they leaped high into the air and then plunged under the water and disappeared and it was hard to tell which sparkled most brilliantly their gold and silver bodies or the spray of jewels they scattered about them as they leaped  if you should dive into this lake said ephel the messenger your feathers would be dripping wet when you came out again it is here we birds of paradise bathe each morning after which we visit the gleaming glade to perform our beauty dance  i should like to see that glade said twinkle who was determined to let nothing escape her that she could possibly see  you shall answered ephel promptly we will fly there at once  so he led the way and presently they entered a thicker grove of trees than any they had before noticed the trunks were so close together that the birds could only pass between then in single file but as they proceeded in this fashion it was not long before they came to a circular space which the childlark knew at once must be the gleaming glade  the floor was of polished gold and so bright that as they stood upon it they saw their forms reflected as in a mirror the trees surrounding them were also of gold being beautifully engraved with many attractive designs and set with rows of brilliant diamonds the leaves of the trees however were of burnished silver and bore so high a gloss that each one served as a lookingglass reproducing the images of those standing in the glade thousands of times whichever way they chanced to turn  the gleam of these mirrorlike leaves was exceedingly brilliant but ephel said this radiance was much stronger in the morning when the rosy glow of the atmosphere was not so powerful  then said he the king bird and all the nobility of paradise who rejoice in the most brilliant plumage come here from their bath and dance upon the golden floor the beauty dance which keeps their blood warm until the feathers have all dried while they dance they can admire their reflections in the mirrors which adds greatly to their pleasure  dont they have music to dance by asked chubbins  of course the messenger replied there is a regular orchestra that plays exquisite music for the dance but the musicians are the female birds of paradise who because their plumage is a modest brown are not allowed to take part in the beauty dance  i think the brown birds with the soft gray breasts are just as pretty as the gaily clothed ones said twinkle the male birds are too bright and tire my eyes  ephel did not like this speech for he was very proud of his own gorgeous coloring but he was too polite to argue with his guest so he let the remark pass  you have now witnessed the most attractive scenes in our favored land he said but there are some curious sights in the suburbs that might serve to interest you  oh have you suburbs too she asked  yes indeed we do not like to come into too close contact with the coarse outer world so we have placed the flying things that are not birds midway between our paradise and the great forest they serve us when we need them and are under our laws and regulations but they are so highly favored by being permitted to occupy the outer edge of our glorious paradise that they willingly obey their masters after all they live happy lives and their habits as i have said may amuse you  who are they enquired chubbins  come with me and you shall see for yourselves  they flew away from the grove of the gleaming glade and ephel led them by pleasant routes into a large garden with many pretty flowers in it mostly it was filled with hollyhocksyellow white scarlet and purple    chapter xvii the queen bee  as they approached they heard a low humming sound which grew louder as they advanced and aroused their curiosity  what is it asked twinkle at last  ephel answered it is the suburb devoted to the bees  but bees are not birds exclaimed twinkle  no as i have told you the suburbs contain flying things that cannot be called birds and so are unable to live in our part of the paradise but because they have wings and love all the flowers and fruits as we do ourselves we have taken them under our protection  ephel perched upon a low bush and when the childlarks had settled beside him he uttered a peculiar shrill whistle the humming sound grew louder then and presently hundreds of great bees rose above the flower tops and hovered in the air but none of them approached the bush except one monstrous bumblebee that had a body striped with black and gold and this one sailed slowly toward the visitors and alighted gracefully upon a branch in front of them  the bee was all bristling with fine hairs and was nearly half as big as twinkle herself so the girl shrank back in alarm and cried  ohhh im afraid it will sting me  how ridiculous answered the bee laughing in a small but merry voice our stings are only for our enemies and we have no enemies in this paradise so we do not use our stingers at all in fact id almost forgotten i had one until you spoke  the words were a little mumbled as if the insect had something in its mouth but otherwise they were quite easy to understand  permit me to introduce her majesty the queen bee said their guide these your highness are some little childlarks who are guests of our king i have brought them to visit you  they are very welcome returned the queen bee are you fond of honey she asked turning to the children  sometimes replied chubbins but weve just eaten and were chock full now  you see the queen remarked my people are all as busy as bees gathering the honey from every flower  what do you do with it asked twinkle  oh we eat part of it and store up the rest for a rainy day  does it ever rain here enquired chubbins  sometimes at night when we are all asleep so as to refresh and moisten the flowers and help them to grow  but if it rains at night there cant be any rainy days remarked twinkle so i cant see the use of saving your honey  nor can i responded the queen laughing again in her pleasant way out in the world people usually rob us of our stores and so keep us busy getting more but here there are not even robbers so that the honey has been accumulating until we hardly know what to do with it we have built a village of honeycombs and i have just had my people make me a splendid palace of honey but it is our way to gather the sweet stuff whether we need it or not so we have to act according to our natures i think of building a mountain of honey next  id like to see that honey palace said twinkle  then come with me answered the queen bee for it will give me pleasure to show it to you  shall we go asked the girllark turning to ephel  of course he returned it is quite a wonderful sight and may interest you  so they all flew away the queen bee taking the lead and passed directly over the bed of flowers with its swarm of buzzing busy bees  they remind me of a verse from father goose said twinkle looking curiously but half fearfully at the hundreds of big insects  what is the verse asked the queen  why it goes this way answered the girl    a bumblebee was buzzing on a yellow hollyhock   when came along a turtle who at the bee did mock   saying prithee mr bumble why make that horrid noise   its really distracting and every one annoys    im sorry said quite humble the busy droning bee   the noise is just my bumble and natural you see   and if i didnt buzz so im sure that youll agree   id only be a big fly and not a bumblebee  that is quite true said the bee and describes our case exactly but you should know that we are not named bumblebees by rights but humble bees the latter is our proper name  but why humble asked twinkle  because we are common workaday people i suppose and not very aristocratic was the reply ive never heard why they changed our name to bumble but since you recited that verse i imagine it is on account of the noise our wings make  they had now passed over the flower beds and approached a remarkable village where the houses were all formed of goldenyellow honeycombs there were many pretty shapes among these houses and some were large and many stories in height while others were small and had but one story some had spires and minarets reaching up into the air and all were laid out into streets just like a real village  but in the center stood a great honeycomb building with so many gables and roofs and peaks and towers that it was easy to guess it was the queen bees palace of which she had spoken  they flew in at a secondstory window and found themselves in a big room with a floor as smooth as glass yet it was composed of man sixsided cells filled with honey which could be seen through the transparent covering the walls and roof were of the same material and at the end of the room was a throne shaped likewise of the honey cells like everything else on a bench along the wall sat several fat and sleepylooking bumblebees who scarcely woke up when their queen entered  those are the drones she said to her visitors it is useless to chide them for their laziness because they are too stupid to pay attention to even a good scolding dont mind them in any way  after examining the beautiful throneroom they visited the sleeping chambers of which there were many and afterward the parlors and diningroom and the workrooms  in these last were many bees building the sixsided pockets or cells for storing the honey in or piling them up in readiness for the return of those who were gathering honey from the flowers  we are not really honeybees remarked the queen but gathering honey is our chief business after all and we manage to find a lot of it  wont your houses melt when it rains asked twinkle  no for the comb of the honey is pure wax the queen bee replied water does not melt it at all  where do you get all the wax chubbins enquired  from the flowers of course it grows on the stamens and is a fine dust called pollen until we manufacture it into wax each of my bees carries two sacks one in front of him to put the honey in and one behind to put the wax in  thats funny said the boylark  i suppose it may be to you answered the queen but to us it is a very natural thing    chapter xviii good news  ephel and the children now bade the goodnatured queen bee goodbye and thanked her for her kindness the messenger led them far away to another place that he called a suburb and as they emerged from a thick cluster of trees into a second flower garden they found the air filled with a great assemblage of butterflies they being both large and small in size and colored in almost every conceivable manner  twinkle and chubbins had seen many beautiful butterflies but never such magnificent ones as these nor so many together at one time some of them had wings fully as large as those of the royal messenger himself even when he spread them to their limit and the markings of these big butterfly wings were more exquisite than those found upon the tailfeathers of the proudest peacocks  the butterflies paid no attention to their visitors but continued to flutter aimlessly from flower to flower chubbins asked one of them a question but got no reply  cant they talk he enquired of ephel  yes said the messenger they all know how to talk but when they speak they say nothing that is important they are brainless silly creatures for the most part and are only interesting because they are beautiful to look at the king likes to watch the flashes of color as they fly about and so he permits them to live in this place they are very happy here in their way for there is no one to chase them or to stick pins through them when they are caught  just then a chime of bells tinkled far away in the distance and the royal messenger listened intently and then said  it is my summons to his majesty the king we must return at once to the palace  so they flew into the air again and proceeded to cross the lovely gardens and pass through the avenues of jewelled trees and the fragrant orchards and groves until they came at last to the royal bower of white flowers  the childlarks entered with their guide and found the gorgeous king bird of paradise still strutting on his perch on the golden bush and enjoying the admiring glances of his courtiers and the ladies of his family he turned as the children entered and addressed his messenger saying  well my dear ephel have you shown the strangers all the sights of our lovely land  most of them your majesty replied ephel  what do you think of us now asked the king turning his eyes upon the larkchildren  it must be the prettiest place in all the world cried twinkle with real enthusiasm  his majesty seemed much pleased i am very sorry you cannot live here always he said  im not declared chubbins its too pretty id get tired of it soon  he means said twinkle hastily for she feared the blunt remark would displease the kindly king that he isnt really a bird but a boy who has been forced to wear a birds body and your majesty is wise enough to understand that the sort of life you lead in your fairy paradise would be very different from the life that boys generally lead  of course replied the king a boys life must be a dreadful one  it suits me all right said chubbins  the king looked at him attentively  would you really prefer to resume your old shape and cease to be a bird he asked  yes if i could chubbins replied  then i will tell you how to do it said the king since you told me your strange story i have talked with my royal necromancer who knows a good deal about magic and especially about that same tuxix who wickedly transformed you in the forest and the royal necromancer tells me that if you can find a tingleberry and eat it you will resume your natural form again for it is the one antidote in all the world for the charm the tuxix worked upon you  what is a tingleberry asked twinkle anxiously for this information interested her as much as it did chubbins  i do not know said the king for it is a common forest berry and never grows in our paradise but doubtless you will have little trouble in finding the bush of the tingleberry when you return to the outside world  the children were both eager to go at once and seek the tingleberry but they could not be so impolite as to run away just then for the king announced that he had prepared an entertainment in their honor  so they sat on a branch of the golden bush beside their friend ephel while at a nod from the king a flock of the beautiful birds of paradise flew into the bower and proceeded to execute a most delightful and bewildering set of aerial evolutions they flew swiftly in circles spirals triangles and solid squares and all the time that they performed sweet music was played by some unseen band it almost dazzled the eyes of the childlarks to watch this brilliant flashing of the colored wings of the birds but the evolutions only lasted for a few minutes and then the birds flew out again in regular ranks  then the little brown ladybirds danced gracefully upon the carpet their dainty feet merely touching the tips of the lovely flowers afterward the flowers themselves took part and sang a delightful chorus and when this was finished the king said they would now indulge in some refreshment  instantly a row of bellshaped blossoms appeared upon the golden bush one for each bird present and all were filled with a delicious ice that was as cold and refreshing as if it had just been taken from a freezer twinkle and chubbins asked for spoons and received them quickly but the others all ate the ices with their bills  the king seemed to enjoy his as much as any one and twinkle noticed that as fast as a blossom was emptied of its contents it disappeared from the branch  the childlarks now thanked the beautiful but vain king very earnestly for all his kindness to them and especially for telling them about the tingleberries and when all the goodbyes had been exchanged ephel flew with them back to the tree where they had left the guardian of the entrance and their faithful comrade policeman bluejay    chapter xix the rebels  they were warmly greeted by the bluejay who asked  did you enjoy the wonderful paradise  very much indeed cried twinkle but we were sorry you could not be with us  never mind that returned the policeman cheerfully i have feasted my eyes upon all the beauties visible from this tree and my good friend the guardian has talked to me and given me much good advice that will surely be useful to me in the future so i have been quite contented while you were gone  the children now gave their thanks to ephel for his care of them and polite attention and the royal messenger said he was pleased that the king had permitted him to serve them they also thanked the greenrobed guardian of the entrance and then accompanied by policeman bluejay they quitted the golden tree and began their journey back to the forest  it was no trouble at all to return the wind caught their wings and blew against them strongly so that they had but to sail before the breeze and speed along until they were deep in the forest again then the wind moderated and presently died away altogether so that they were forced to begin flying in order to continue their journey home  it was now the middle of the afternoon and the policeman said  i hope all has been quiet and orderly during my absence there are so many disturbing elements among the forest birds that i always worry when they are left alone for many hours at a time  im sure they have behaved themselves returned twinkle they fear your power so much that the evilminded birds do not dare to offend you by being naughty  that is true said the policeman they know very well that i will not stand any nonsense and will always insist that the laws be obeyed  they were now approaching that part of the forest where they lived and as the policeman concluded his speech they were surprised to hear a great flutter of wings among the trees and presently a flock of big black rooks flew toward them  at the head of the band was a saucylooking fellow who wore upon his head a policemans helmet and carried under his wing a club  policeman bluejay gave a cry of anger as he saw this and dashed forward to meet the rooks  what does this mean you rascal he demanded in a fierce voice  easy there my fine dandy replied the rook with a hoarse laugh dont get saucy or ill give you a rap on the head  the rooks behind him shrieked with delight at this impudent speech and that made the mock policeman strut more absurdly than ever  the bluejay was not only astonished at this rebellion but he was terribly angry as well  that is my policemans helmet and club he said sternly where did you get them  at your nest of course retorted the other we made up our minds that we have had a miserable bluejay for a policeman long enough so the rooks elected me in your place and im going to make you birds stand around and obey orders i can tell you if you do as i command youll get along all right if you dont ill pound you with your own club until you obey  again the rooks screamed in an admiring chorus of delight and when the bluejay observed their great numbers and that they were all as large as he was and some even larger and stronger he decided not to risk an open fight with them just then but to take time to think over what had best be done  i will call the other birds to a meeting he said to the rook and let them decide between us  that wont do any good was the reply we rooks have decided the matter already we mean to rule the forest after this and if any one or all of the birds dare to oppose us well fight until we force them to serve us now then what do you intend to do about it  ill think it over said policeman bluejay  oho oho hes afraid hes a coward yelled the rooks and one of them added  stand up and fight if you dare  ill fight your false policeman or any one of you at a time replied the bluejay  no you wont youll fight us all together or not at all they answered  the bluejay knew it would be foolish to do that so he turned away and whispered to the larkchildren  follow me and fly as swiftly as you can  like a flash he darted high into the air with twinkle and chubbins right behind him and before the rooks could recover from their surprise the three were far away  then the big black birds gave chase uttering screams of rage but they could not fly so swiftly as the bluejay and the larks and were soon obliged to abandon the pursuit  when at last he knew that they had escaped the rooks policeman bluejay entered the forest again and went among the birds to call them all to a meeting they obeyed the summons without delay and were very indignant when they heard of the rebellion of the rooks and the insults that had been heaped upon their regularly elected officer judge bullfinch arrived with his head bandaged with soft feathers for he had met the rook policeman and when he remonstrated had been severely pounded by the wicked birds club  but what can we do he asked the rooks are a very powerful tribe and the magpies and cuckoos and blackbirds are liable to side with them if they seem to be stronger than we are  we might get all our people together and fall upon them in a great army and so defeat them suggested an oriole  the trouble with that plan decided the judge is that we can only depend upon the smaller birds the big birds might desert us and in that case we would be badly beaten  perhaps it will be better to submit to the rooks said a little chickadee anxiously we are neither warriors nor prizefighters and if we obey our new rulers they may leave us in peace  no indeed cried a linnet if we submit to them they will think we are afraid and will treat us cruelly i know the nature of these rooks and believe they can only be kept from wickedness by a power stronger than their own  hear me good friends said the bluejay who had been silent because he was seriously thinking i have a plan for subduing these rebels and it is one that i am sure will succeed but i must make a long journey to accomplish my purpose go now quietly to your nests but meet me at the judgment tree at daybreak tomorrow morning also be sure to ask every friendly bird of the forest to be present for we must insist upon preserving our liberty or else be forever slaves to these rooks  with these words he rose into the air and sped swiftly upon his errand  the other birds looked after him earnestly  i think it will be well for us to follow his advice said judge bullfinch after a pause the bluejay is an able bird and has had much experience besides we have ever found him just and honorable since the time we made him our policeman so i feel that we may depend upon him in this emergency  why it is all we can do replied a robin and this remark was so true that the birds quietly dispersed and returned to their nests to await the important meeting the next morning    chapter xx the battle  twinkle and chubbins flew slowly home to their nests in the maple tree pausing to ask every bird they met where tingleberries grew but none of them could tell  im sorry we did not ask policeman bluejay said chubbins  i intended to ask him but we hadnt time replied twinkle but he will be back tomorrow morning  i wonder what hes going to do remarked the boy  dont know chub but itll be the right thing whatever it is you may be sure of that  they visited the nest of the baby goldfinches and found the widow chaffinch still caring for the orphans in her motherly way the little ones seemed to be as hungry as ever but the widow assured the larkchildren that all five had just been fed  did you ever hear of a tingleberry asked twinkle  yes it seems to me i have heard of that berry was the reply if i remember rightly my grandmother once told me of the tingleberries and warned me never to eat one but i am quite certain the things do not grow in our forest for i have never seen one that i can recollect  where do they grow then enquired chubbins  i cant say exactly where but if they are not in the forest they must grow in the open country  the childlarks now returned to their own nest and sat snuggled up in it during the evening talking over the days experiences and the wonderful things they had seen in the fairylike paradise of the birds so much sightseeing had made them tired so when it grew dark they fell fast asleep and did not waken until the sun was peeping over the edge of the trees  good gracious exclaimed the girl we shall be late at the meeting at the judgment tree lets hurry chub  they ate a hasty breakfast from the contents of their basket and after flying to the brook for a drink and a dip in the cool water they hurried toward the judgment tree  there they found a vast assemblage of birds they were so numerous indeed that twinkle was surprised to find that so many of them inhabited the forest  but a still greater surprise was in store for her for immediately she discovered sitting upon the biggest branch of the tree twentytwo bluejays all in a row they were large splendidly plumaged birds with keen eyes and sharp bills and at their head was the childrens old friend the policeman  these are my cousins he said to the childlarks proudly and i have brought them from another forest where they live to assist me i am not afraid of the foolish rooks now and in a moment we shall fly away to give them battle  the forest birds were all in a flutter of delight at the prompt arrival of the powerful bluejays and when the word of command was given they all left the tree and flew swiftly to meet the rooks  first came the ranks of the twentytwo bluejays with the policeman at their head then followed many magpies and cuckoos who were too clever to side with the naughty rooks when they saw the powerful birds the bluejay had summoned to his assistance after these flew the smaller birds of all descriptions and they were so many and at the same time so angry that they were likely to prove stubborn foes in a fight  this vast army came upon the rooks in an open space in the forest without waiting for any words or explanations from the rebels the soldierly bluejays fell upon their enemies instantly fighting fiercely with bill and claw while the other birds fluttered in the rear awaiting their time to join in the affray  policeman bluejay singled out the rook which had stolen his helmet and club and dashed upon him so furiously that the black rebel was amazed and proved an easy victim to the others superior powers he threw down the club and helmet at once but the bluejay was not satisfied with that and attacked the thief again and again until the air was full of black feathers torn from the rooks body  after all the battle did not last long for the rooks soon screamed for mercy and found themselves badly plucked and torn by the time their assailants finally decided they had been punished enough  like all blustering evildisposed people when they found themselves conquered they whined and humbled themselves before the victors and declared they would never again rebel against policeman bluejay the regularly appointed guardian of the law of the forest and i am told that after this day the rooks who are not rightly forest birds betook themselves to the nearest villages and farm houses and contented themselves with plaguing mankind who could not revenge themselves as easily as the birds did  after the fight policeman bluejay thanked his cousins and sent them home again and then the birds all surrounded the policeman and cheered him gratefully for his cleverness and bravery so that he was the hero of the hour  judge bullfinch tried to make a fine speech but the birds were too excited to listen to his words and he soon found himself without an audience  of course twinkle and chubbins took no part in the fight but they had hovered in the background to watch it and were therefore as proud of their friend as any of the forest birds could be    chapter xxi the tingleberries  when the excitement of the morning had subsided and the forest was quiet again policeman bluejay came to the nest of the childlarks wearing his official helmet and club you may be sure that one of the first things twinkle asked him was if he knew where tingleberries grew  of course he replied promptly they grow over at the north edge of the forest in the open country but you must never eat them my dear friend because they are very bad for birds  but the royal necromancer of the king bird of paradise says the tingleberries will restore us to our proper forms explained the girl  oh did he say that then he probably knows said the bluejay and i will help you to find the berries we birds always avoid them for they give us severe pains in our stomachs  thats bad observed chubbins uneasily  well said twinkle id be willing to have a pain or two just to be myself again  so would i if it comes to that agreed the boy but id rather have found a way to be myself without getting the pain  there is usually but one thing that will overcome an enchantment remarked the bluejay seriously and if it is a tingleberry that will destroy the charm which the old tuxix put upon you then nothing else will answer the same purpose the royal necromancer is very wise and you may depend upon what he says but it is late at this season for tingleberries they do not grow at all times of the year and we may not be able to find any upon the bushes  cannot we go at once and find out asked twinkle anxiously  to be sure it will grieve me to lose you my little friends but i want to do what will give you the most happiness come with me please  they flew away through the forest and by and by came upon the open country to the north leaving all the trees behind them  why this is the place we entered the forest that day we got chanted cried twinkle  so it is said chubbins i believe we could find our way home from here twink  but we cant go home like we are replied the girllark what would our folks say to find us with birds bodies  theyd yell and run declared the boy  then said she we must find the tingleberries  the bluejay flew with them to some bushes which he said were the kind the tingleberries grew upon but they were all bare and not a single berry could be found  there must be more not far away said the policeman encouragingly let us look about us  they found several clumps of the bushes to be sure but unfortunately no berries were now growing upon them and at each failure the children grew more and more sad and despondent  if we have to wait until the bushes bear again twinkle remarked it will be nearly a year and im sure we cant live in the forest all winter  why not asked the policeman  the food in our basket would all be gone and then we would starve to death was the reply we cant eat bugs and worms you know  id rather die declared chubbins mournfully  the bluejay became very thoughtful  if we could find some of the tingle bushes growing near the shade of the forest he said at last there might still be some berries remaining on them out here in the bright sunshine the berries soon wither and drop off and disappear  then let us look near the trees suggested twinkle  they searched for a long time unsuccessfully it was growing late and they were almost in despair when a sharp cry from policeman bluejay drew the childlarks to his side  what is it enquired the girl trembling with nervous excitement  why said the policeman here is a bush at last and on it are exactly two ripe tingleberries    chapter xxii the transformation  they looked earnestly at the bush and saw that their friend spoke truly upon a high limb was one plump red berry looking much like a cranberry while lower down grew another but smaller berry which appeared to be partially withered  good the larkchildren cried joyfully and the next moment chubbins added you eat the big berry twink  why she asked hesitating  it looks as if it had more stomachache in it he replied  im not afraid of that said she but do you suppose the little berry will be enough for you one side of it is withered you see  that wont matter returned the boylark the royal necromancer said to eat one berry he didnt say a little or a big one you know or whether it should be plump or withered  that is true said the girllark shall i eat mine now  the sooner the better chubbins replied  dont forget me little friend when you are a human again said policeman bluejay sadly  i shall never forget you twinkle answered nor any part of all your kindness to us we shall be friends forever  that seemed to please the handsome blue bird and twinkle was so eager that she could not wait to say more she plucked the big plump berry put it in her mouth with her little claw and ate it as soon as possible  in a moment she said ouch oooooo but it did not hurt so badly after all her form quickly changed and grew larger and while chubbins and policeman bluejay watched her anxiously she became a girl again and the birds body with its soft gray feathers completely disappeared  as she felt herself changing she called goodbye to the bluejay but even then he could hardly understand her words  goodbye he answered and to twinkles ears it sounded like chirrripcheewee  how did it feel asked chubbins but she looked at him queerly as if his language was strange to her and seemed to be half frightened  guess ill have to eat my berry he said with a laugh and proceeded to pluck and eat it as twinkle had done he yelled once or twice at the cramp the fruit gave him but as soon as the pain ceased he began to grow and change in the same way his little comrade had  but not entirely for although he got his human body and legs back again all in their natural size his wings remained as they were and it startled him to find that the magic power had passed and he was still partly a bird  whats the matter asked twinkle  is anything wrong enquired the bluejay  the boy understood them both although they could not now understand each other he said to twinkle  i guess the berry wasnt quite big enough then he repeated the same thing in the bird language to policeman bluejay and it sounded to twinkle like  pirrrreepcheeptweet  what in the world can you do asked the girl quite distressed it will be just dreadful if you have to stay like that  the tears came to chubbins eyes he tried to restrain them but could not he flapped his little wings dolefully and said  i wish i was either one thing or the other id rather be a childlark again and nest in a tree than to go home to the folks in this way  policeman bluejay had seen his dilemma at the first and his sharp eyes had been roving over all the bushes that were within the range of his vision suddenly he uttered a chirp of delight and dashed away speedily returning with another tingleberry in his bill  its the very last one there is said he to chubbins  but it is all that i want cried the boy brightening at once and then regardless of any pain he ate the berry as greedily as if he was fond of a stomacheache  the second berry had a good effect in one way for chubbins wings quickly became arms and he was now as perfectly formed as he had been before he met with the cruel tuxix but he gave a groan every once in a while and twinkle suspected that two berries were twice as powerful as one and made a pain that lasted twice as long  as the boy and girl looked around they were astonished to find their basket standing on the ground beside them on a limb of the first tree of the forest sat silently regarding them a big blue bird that they knew must be policeman bluejay although somehow or other he had lost his glossy black helmet and the club he had carried underneath his wing  its almost dark said twinkle yawning lets go home chub  all right  he picked up the basket and for a few minutes they walked along in silence  then the boy asked  dont your legs feel heavy twink  yes said she do yours  awful said he                                          l frank baums new oz book is very ozzy  the author of the wizard of
