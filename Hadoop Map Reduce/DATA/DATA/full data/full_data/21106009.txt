21106009	home as found  sequel to homeward bound  by j fenimore cooper  complete in one volume  1871          thou art perfect                 pr hon      preface    those who have done us the favour to read homeward bound will at once perceive that the incidents of this book commence at the point where those of the work just mentioned ceased we are fully aware of the disadvantage of dividing the interest of a tale in this manner but in the present instance the separation has been produced by circumstances over which the writer had very little control as any one who may happen to take up this volume will very soon discover that there is other matter which it is necessary to know it may be as well to tell all such persons in the commencement therefore that their reading will be bootless unless they have leisure to turn to the pages of homeward bound for their cue  we remember the despair with which that admirable observer of men mr mathews the comedian confessed the hopelessness of success in his endeavours to obtain a sufficiency of prominent and distinctive features to compose an entertainment founded on american character the whole nation struck him as being destitute of salient points and as characterized by a respectable mediocrity that however useful it might be in its way was utterly without poetry humour or interest to the observer for one who dealt principally with the more conspicuous absurdities of his fellowcreatures mr mathews was certainly right we also believe him to have been right in the main in the general tenor of his opinion for this country in its ordinary aspects probably presents as barren a field to the writer of fiction and to the dramatist as any other on earth we are not certain that we might not say the most barren we believe that no attempt to delineate ordinary american life either on the stage or in the pages of a novel has been rewarded with success even those works in which the desire to illustrate a principle has been the aim when the picture has been brought within this homely frame have had to contend with disadvantages that have been commonly found insurmountable the latter being the intention of this book the task has been undertaken with a perfect consciousness of all its difficulties and with scarcely a hope of success it would be indeed a desperate undertaking to think of making anything interesting in the way of a roman de société in this country still useful glances may possibly be made even in that direction and we trust that the fidelity of one or two of our portraits will be recognized by the lookeron although they will very likely be denied by the sitters themselves  there seems to be a pervading principle in things which gives an accumulating energy to any active property that may happen to be in the ascendant at the time beingmoney produces money knowledge is the parent of knowledge and ignorance fortifies ignorancein a word like begets like the governing social evil of america is provincialism a misfortune that is perhaps inseparable from her situation without a social capital with twenty or more communities divided by distance and political barriers her people who are really more homogenous than any other of the same numbers in the world perhaps possess no standard for opinion manners social maxims or even language  every man as a matter of course refers to his own particular experience and praises or condemns agreeably to notions contracted in the circle of his own habits however narrow provincial or erroneous they may happen to be as a consequence no useful stage can exist for the dramatist who should endeavour to delineate the faults of society would find a formidable party arrayed against him in a moment with no party to defend as another consequence we see individuals constantly assailed with a wolflike ferocity while society is everywhere permitted to pass unscathed  that the american nation is a great nation in some particulars the greatest the world ever saw we hold to be true and are as ready to maintain as any one can be but we are also equally ready to concede that it is very far behind most polished nations in various essentials and chiefly that it is lamentably in arrears to its own avowed principles perhaps this truth will be found to be the predominant thought throughout the pages of home as found  home as found  chapter i    good morrow coz good morrow sweet hero    shakspeare  when mr effingham determined to return home he sent orders to his agent to prepare his townhouse in newyork for his reception intending to pass a month or two in it then to repair to washington for a few weeks at the close of its season and to visit his country residence when the spring should fairly open accordingly eve now found herself at the head of one of the largest establishments in the largest american town within an hour after she had landed from the ship fortunately for her however her father was too just to consider a wife or a daughter a mere upper servant and he rightly judged that a liberal portion of his income should be assigned to the procuring of that higher quality of domestic service which can alone relieve the mistress of a household from a burthen so heavy to be borne unlike so many of those around him who would spend on a single pretending and comfortless entertainment in which the ostentatious folly of one contended with the ostentatious folly of another a sum that properly directed would introduce order and system into a family for a twelvemonth by commanding the time and knowledge of those whose study they had been and who would be willing to devote themselves to such objects and then permit their wives and daughters to return to the drudgery to which the sex seems doomed in this country he first bethought him of the wants of social life before he aspired to its parade a man of the world mr effingham possessed the requisite knowledge and a man of justice the requisite fairness to permit those who depended on him so much for their happiness to share equitably in the good things that providence had so liberally bestowed on himself in other words he made two people comfortable by paying a generous price for a housekeeper his daughter in the first place by releasing her from cares that necessarily formed no more a part of her duties than it would be a part of her duty to sweep the pavement before the door and in the next place a very respectable woman who was glad to obtain so good a home on so easy terms to this simple and just expedient eve was indebted for being at the head of one of the quietest most truly elegant and best ordered establishments in america with no other demands on her time than that which was necessary to issue a few orders in the morning and to examine a few accounts once a week  one of the first and the most acceptable of the visits that eve received was from her cousin grace van cortlandt who was in the country at the moment of her arrival but who hurried back to town to meet her old schoolfellow and kinswoman the instant she heard of her having landed eve effingham and grace van cortlandt were sisters children and had been born within a month of each other as the latter was without father or mother most of their time had been passed together until the former was taken abroad when a separation unavoidably ensued mr effingham ardently desired and had actually designed to take his niece with him to europe but her paternal grandfather who was still living objected his years and affection and the scheme was reluctantly abandoned this grandfather was now dead and grace had been left with a very ample fortune almost entirely the mistress of her own movements  the moment of the meeting between these two warmhearted and sincerely attached young women was one of great interest and anxiety to both they retained for each other the tenderest love though the years that had separated them had given rise to so many new impressions and habits that they did not prepare themselves for the interview without apprehension this interview took place about a week after eve was established in hudson square and at an hour earlier than was usual for the reception of visits hearing a carriage stop before the door and the bell ring our heroine stole a glance from behind a curtain and recognized her cousin as she alighted  quavezvous ma chere demanded mademoiselle viefville observing that her élève trembled and grew pale  it is my cousin miss van cortlandtshe whom i loved as a sister we now meet for the first time in so many years  biencest une très jolie jeune personne returned the governess taking a glance from the spot eve had just quitted sur le rapport de la personne ma chere vous devriez être contente au moins  if you will excuse me mademoiselle i will go down alonei think i should prefer to meet grace without witnesses in the first interview  très volontiers elle est parente et cest bien naturel  eve on this expressed approbation met her maid at the door as she came to announce that mademoiselle de cortlandt was in the library and descended slowly to meet her the library was lighted from above by means of a small dome and grace had unconsciously placed herself in the very position that a painter would have chosen had she been about to sit for her portrait a strong full rich light fell obliquely on her as eve entered displaying her fine person and beautiful features to the very best advantage and they were features and a person that are not seen every day even in a country where female beauty is so common she was in a carriage dress and her toilette was rather more elaborate than eve had been accustomed to see at that hour but still eve thought she had seldom seen a more lovely young creature some such thoughts also passed through the mind of grace herself who though struck with a womans readiness in such matters with the severe simplicity of eves attire as well as with its entire elegance was more struck with the charms of her countenance and figure there was in truth a strong resemblance between them though each was distinguished by an expression suited to her character and to the habits of her mind  miss effingham said grace advancing a step to meet the lady who entered while her voice was scarcely audible and her limbs trembled  miss van cortlandt said eve in the same low smothered tone  this formality caused a chill in both and each unconsciously stopped and curtsied eve had been so much struck with the coldness of the american manner during the week she had been at home and grace was so sensitive on the subject of the opinion of one who had seen so much of europe that there was great danger at that critical moment the meeting would terminate unpropitiously  thus far however all had been rigidly decorous though the strong feelings that were glowing in the bosoms of both had been so completely suppressed but the smile cold and embarrassed as it was that each gave as she curtsied had the sweet character of her childhood in it and recalled to both the girlish and affectionate intercourse of their younger days  grace said eve eagerly advancing a step or two impetuously and blushing like the dawn  eve  each opened her arms and in a moment they were locked in a long and fervent embrace this was the commencement of their former intimacy and before night grace was domesticated in her uncles house it is true that miss effingham perceived certain peculiarities about miss van cortlandt that she had rather were absent and miss van cortlandt would have felt more at her ease had miss effingham a little less reserve of manner on certain subjects that the latter had been taught to think interdicted notwithstanding these slight separating shades in character however the natural affection was warm and sincere and if eve according to graces notions was a little stately and formal she was polished and courteous and if grace according to eves notions was a little too easy and unreserved she was feminine and delicate  we pass over the three or four days that succeeded during which eve had got to understand something of her new position and we will come at once to a conversation between the cousins that will serve to let the reader more intimately into the opinions habits and feelings of both as well as to open the real subject of our narrative this conversation took place in that very library which had witnessed their first interview soon after breakfast and while the young ladies were still alone  i suppose eve you will have to visit the greensthey are hajjis and were much in society last winter  hajjisyou surely do not mean grace that they have been to mecca  not at all only to paris my dear that makes a hajji in newyork  and does it entitle the pilgrim to wear the green turban asked eve laughing  to wear any thing miss effingham green blue or yellow and to cause it to pass for elegance  and which is the favourite colour with the family you have mentioned  it ought to be the first in compliment to the name but if truth must be said i think they betray an affection for all with not a few of the halftints in addition  i am afraid they are too prononcées for us by this description i am no great admirer grace of walking rainbows  too green you would have said had you dared but you are a hajji too and even the greens know that a hajji never puns unless indeed it might be one from philadelphia but you will visit these people  certainly if they are in society and render it necessary by their own civilities  they are in society in virtue of their rights as hajjis but as they passed three months at paris you probably know something of them  they may not have been there at the same time with ourselves returned eve quietly and paris is a very large town hundreds of people come and go that one never hears of i do not remember those you have mentioned  i wish you may escape them for in my untravelled judgment they are anything but agreeable notwithstanding all they have seen or pretend to have seen  it is very possible to have been all over christendom and to remain exceedingly disagreeable besides one may see a great deal and yet see very little of a good quality  a pause of two or three minutes followed during which eve read a note and her cousin played with the leaves of a book  i wish i knew your real opinion of us eve the last suddenly exclaimed why not be frank with so near a relative tell me honestly noware you reconciled to your country  you are the eleventh person who has asked me this question which i find very extraordinary as i have never quarrelled with my country  nay i do not mean exactly that i wish to hear how our society has struck one who has been educated abroad  you wish then for opinions that can have no great value since my experience at home extends only to a fortnight but you have many books on the country and some written by very clever persons why not consult them  oh you mean the travellers none of them are worth a second thought and we hold them one and all in great contempt  of that i can have no manner of doubt as one and all you are constantly protesting it in the highways and byeways there is no more certain sign of contempt than to be incessantly dwelling on its intensity  grace had great quickness as well as her cousin and though provoked at eves quiet hit she had the good sense and the good nature to laugh  perhaps we do protest and disdain a little too strenuously for good taste if not to gain believers but surely eve you do not support these travellers in all that they have written of us  not in half i can assure you my father and cousin jack have discussed them too often in my presence to leave me in ignorance of the very many political blunders they have made in particular  political blundersi know nothing of them and had rather thought them right in most of what they said about our politics but surely neither your father nor mr john effingham corroborates what they say of our society  i cannot answer for either on that point  speak then for yourself do you think them right  you should remember grace that i have not yet seen any society in newyork  no society dearwhy you were at the hendersons and the morgans and the drewetts three of the greatest réunions that we have had in two winters  i did not know that you meant those unpleasant crowds by society  unpleasant crowds why child that is society is it not  not what i have been taught to consider such i rather think it would be better to call it company  and is not this what is called society in paris  as far from it as possible it may be an excrescence of society one of its forms but by no means society itself it would be as true to call cards which are sometimes introduced in the world society as to call a ball given in two small and crowded rooms society they are merely two of the modes in which idlers endeavour to vary their amusements  but we have little else than these balls the morning visits and an occasional evening in which there is no dancing  i am sorry to hear it for in that case you can have no society  and is it different at parisor florence or rome  very in paris there are many houses open every evening to which one can go with little ceremony our sex appears in them dressed according to what a gentleman i overheard conversing at mrs hendersons would call their ulterior intentions for the night some attired in the simplest manner others dressed for concerts for the opera for court even some on the way from a dinner and others going to a late ball all this matter of course variety adds to the case and grace of the company and coupled with perfect good manners a certain knowledge of passing events pretty modes of expression an accurate and even utterance the women usually find the means of making themselves agreeable their sentiment is sometimes a little heroic but this one must overlook and it is a taste moreover that is falling into disuse as people read better books  and you prefer this heartlessness eve to the nature of your own country  i do not know that quiet retenue and a good tone are a whit more heartless than flirting giggling and childishness there may be more nature in the latter certainly but it is scarcely as agreeable after one has fairly got rid of the nursery  grace looked vexed but she loved her cousin too sincerely to be angry a secret suspicion that eve was right too came in aid of her affection and while her little foot moved she maintained her good nature a task not always attainable for those who believe that their own superlatives scarcely reach to other peoples positives at this critical moment when there was so much danger of a jar in the feelings of these two young females the library door opened and pierre mr effinghams own man announced  monsieur bragg  monsieur who asked eve in surprise  monsieur bragg returned pierre in french desires to see mademoiselle  you mean my fatheri know no such person  he inquired first for monsieur but understanding monsieur was out he next asked to have the honour of seeing mademoiselle  is it what they call a person in england pierre  old pierre smiled as he answered  he has the air mademoiselle though he esteems himself a personnage if i might take the liberty of judging  ask him for his cardthere must be a mistake i think  while this short conversation took place grace van cortlandt was sketching a cottage with a pen without attending to a word that was said but when eve received the card from pierre and read aloud with the tone of surprise that the name would be apt to excite in a novice in the art of american nomenclature the words aristabulus bragg her cousin began to laugh  who can this possibly be gracedid you ever hear of such a person and what right can he have to wish to see me  admit him by all means it is your fathers land agent and he may wish to leave some message for my uncle you will be obliged to make his acquaintance sooner or later and it may as well be done now as at another time  you have shown this gentleman into the front drawingroom pierre  oui mademoiselle  i will ring when you are wanted  pierre withdrew and eve opened her secretary out of which she took a small manuscript book over the leaves of which she passed her fingers rapidly  here it is she said smiling mr aristabulus bragg attorney and counsellor at law and the agent of the templeton estate this precious little work you must understand grace contains sketches of the characters of such persons as i shall be the most likely to see by john effingham am it is a sealed volume of course but there can be no harm in reading the part that treats of our present visiter and with your permission we will have it in commonmr aristabulus bragg was born in one of the western counties of massachusetts and emigrated to newyork after receiving his education at the mature age of nineteen at twentyone he was admitted to the bar and for the last seven years he has been a successful practitioner in all the courts of otsego from the justices to the circuit his talents are undeniable as he commenced his education at fourteen and terminated it at twentyone the law course included this man is an epitome of all that is good and all that is bad in a very large class of his fellow citizens he is quickwitted prompt in action enterprising in all things in which he has nothing to lose but wary and cautious in all things in which he has a real stake and ready to turn not only his hand but his heart and his principles to any thing that offers an advantage with him literally nothing is too high to be aspired to nothing too low to be done he will run for governor or for townclerk just as opportunities occur is expert in all the practices of his profession has had a quarters dancing with three years in the classics and turned his attention towards medicine and divinity before he finally settled down into the law such a compound of shrewdness impudence commonsense pretension humility cleverness vulgarity kindheartedness duplicity selfishness law honesty moral fraud and mother wit mixed up with a smattering of learning and much penetration in practical things can hardly be described as any one of his prominent qualities is certain to be met by another quite as obvious that is almost its converse mr bragg in short is purely a creature of circumstances his qualities pointing him out for either a member of congress or a deputy sheriff offices that he is equally ready to fill i have employed him to watch over the estate of your father in the absence of the latter on the principle that one practised in tricks is the best qualified to detect and expose them and with the certainty that no man will trespass with impunity so long as the courts continue to tax bills of costs with their present liberality you appear to know the gentleman grace is this character of him faithful  i know nothing of bills of costs and deputy sheriffs but i do know that mr aristabulus bragg is an amusing mixture of strut humility roguery and cleverness he is waiting all this time in the drawing room and you had better see him as he may now be almost considered part of the family you know he has been living in the house at templeton ever since he was installed by mr john effingham it was there i had the honour first to meet him  firstsurely you have never seen him any where else  your pardon my dear he never comes to town without honouring me with a call this is the price i pay for having had the honour of being an inmate of the same house with him for a week  eve rang the bell and pierre made his appearance  desire mr bragg to walk into the library  grace looked demure while pierre was gone to usher in their visiter and eve was thinking of the medley of qualities john effingham had assembled in his description as the door opened and the subject of her contemplation entered  monsieur aristabule said pierre eyeing the card but sticking at the first name  mr aristabulus bragg was advancing with an easy assurance to make his bow to the ladies when the more finished air and quiet dignity of miss effingham who was standing so far disconcerted him as completely to upset his selfpossession as grace had expressed it in consequence of having lived three years in the old residence at templeton he had begun to consider himself a part of the family and at home he never spoke of the young lady without calling her eve or eve effingham but he found it a very different thing to affect familiarity among his associates and to practise it in the very face of its subject and although seldom at a loss for words of some sort or another he was now actually dumbfounded eve relieved his awkwardness by directing pierre with her eye to hand a chair and first speaking  i regret that my father is not in she said by way of turning the visit from herself but he is to be expected every moment are you lately from templeton  aristabulus drew his breath and recovered enough of his ordinary tone of manner to reply with a decent regard to his character for selfcommand the intimacy that he had intended to establish on the spot was temporarily defeated it is true and without his exactly knowing how it had been effected for it was merely the steadiness of the young lady blended as it was with a polished reserve that had thrown him to a distance he could not explain he felt immediately and with taste that did his sagacity credit that his footing in this quarter was only to be obtained by unusually slow and cautious means still mr bragg was a man of great decision and in his way of very farsighted views and singular as it may seem at that unpropitious moment he mentally determined that at no very distant day he would make miss eve effingham his wife  i hope mr effingham enjoys good health he said with some such caution as a rebuked schoolgirl enters on the recitation of her taskhe enjoyed bad health i hear mr aristabulus bragg though so shrewd was far from critical in his modes of speech when he went to europe and after travelling so far in such bad company it would be no more than fair that he should have a little respite as he approaches home and old age  had eve been told that the man who uttered this nice sentiment and that too in accents as uncouth and provincial as the thought was finished and lucid actually presumed to think of her as his bosom companion it is not easy to say which would have predominated in her mind mirth or resentment but mr bragg was not in the habit of letting his secrets escape him prematurely and certainly this was one that none but a wizard could have discovered without the aid of a direct oral or written communication  are you lately from templeton repeated eve a little surprised that the gentleman did not see fit to answer the question which was the only one that as it seemed to her could have a common interest with them both  i left home the day before yesterday aristabulus now deigned to reply  it is so long since i saw our beautiful mountains and i was then so young that i feel a great impatience to revisit them though the pleasure must be deferred until spring  i conclude they are the handsomest mountains in the known world miss effingham  that is much more than i shall venture to claim for them but according to my imperfect recollection and what i esteem of far more importance according to the united testimony of mr john effingham and my father i think they must be very beautiful  aristabulus looked up as if he had a facetious thing to say and he even ventured on a smile while he made his answer  i hope mr john effingham has prepared you for a great change in the house  we know that it has been repaired and altered under his directions that was done at my fathers request  we consider it denationalized miss effingham there being nothing like it west of albany at least  i should be sorry to find that my cousin has subjected us to this imputation said eve smilingperhaps a little equivocally the architecture of america being generally so simple and pure mr effingham laughs at his own improvements however in which he says he has only carried out the plans of the original artiste who worked very much in what was called the composite order  you allude to mr hiram doolittle a gentleman i never saw though i hear he has left behind him many traces of his progress in the newer states ex pede herculem as we say in the classics miss effingham i believe it is the general sentiment that mr doolittles designs have been improved on though most people think that the grecian or roman architecture which is so much in use in america would be more republican but every body knows that mr john effingham is not much of a republican  eve did not choose to discuss her kinsmans opinions with mr aristabulus bragg and she quietly remarked that she did not know that the imitations of the ancient architecture of which there are so many in the country were owing to attachment to republicanism  to what else can it be owing miss eve  sure enough said grace van cortlandt it is unsuited to the materials the climate and the uses and some very powerful motive like that mentioned by mr bragg could alone overcome these obstacles  aristabulus started from his seat and making sundry apologies declared his previous unconsciousness that miss van cortlandt was present all of which was true enough as he had been so much occupied mentally with her cousin as not to have observed her seated as she was partly behind a screen grace received the excuses favourably and the conversation was resumed  i am sorry that my cousin should offend the taste of the country said eve but as we are to live in the house the punishment will fall heaviest on the offenders  do not mistake me miss eve returned aristabulus in a little alarm for he too well understood the influence and wealth of john effingham not to wish to be on good terms with him do not mistake me i admire the house and know it to be a perfect specimen of a pure architecture in its way but then public opinion is not yet quite up to it i see all its beauties i would wish you to know but then there are many a majority perhaps who do not and these persons think they ought to be consulted about such matters  i believe mr john effingham thinks less of his own work than you seem to think of it yourself sir for i have frequently heard him laugh at it as a mere enlargement of the merits of the composite order he calls it a caprice rather than a taste nor do i see what concern a majority as you term them can have with a house that does not belong to them  aristabulus was surprised that any one could disregard a majority for in this respect he a good deal resembled mr dodge though running a different career and the look of surprise he gave was natural and open  i do not mean that the public has a legal right to control the tastes of the citizen he said but in a republican government you undoubtedly understand miss eve it will rule in all things  i can understand that one would wish to see his neighbour use good taste as it helps to embellish a country but the man who should consult the whole neighbourhood before he built would be very apt to cause a complicated house to be erected if he paid much respect to the different opinions he received or what is quite as likely apt to have no house at all  i think you are mistaken miss effingham for the public sentiment just now runs almost exclusively and popularly into the grecian school we build little besides temples for our churches our banks our taverns our courthouses and our dwellings a friend of mine has just built a brewery on the model of the temple of the winds  had it been a mill one might understand the conceit said eve who now began to perceive that her visiter had some latent humour though he produced it in a manner to induce one to think him any thing but a droll the mountains must be doubly beautiful if they are decorated in the way you mention i sincerely hope grace that i shall find the hills as pleasant as they now exist in my recollection  should they not prove to be quite as lovely as you imagine miss effingham returned aristabulus who saw no impropriety in answering a remark made to miss van cortlandt or any one else i hope you will have the kindness to conceal the fact from the world  i am afraid that would exceed my power the disappointment would be so strong may i ask why you show so much interest in my keeping so cruel a mortification to myself  why miss eve said aristabulus looking grave i am afraid that our people would hardly bear the expression of such an opinion from you  from meand why not from me in particular  perhaps it is because they think you have travelled and have seen other countries  and is it only those who have not travelled and who have no means of knowing the value of what they say that are privileged to criticise  i cannot exactly explain my own meaning perhaps but i think miss grace will understand me do you not agree with me miss van cortlandt in thinking it would be safer for one who never saw any other mountains to complain of the tameness and monotony of our own than for one who had passed a whole life among the andes and the alps  eve smiled for she saw that mr bragg was capable of detecting and laughing at provincial pride even while he was so much under its influence and grace coloured for she had the consciousness of having already betrayed some of this very silly sensitiveness in her intercourse with her cousin in connexion with other subjects a reply was unnecessary however as the door just then opened and john effingham made his appearance the meeting between the two gentlemen for we suppose aristabulus must be included in the category by courtesy if not of right was more cordial than eve had expected to witness for each really entertained a respect for the other in reference to a merit of a particular sort mr bragg esteeming mr john effingham as a wealthy and caustic cynic and mr john effingham regarding mr bragg much as the owner of a dwelling regards a valuable housedog after a few moments of conversation the two withdrew together and just as the ladies were about to descend to the drawingroom previously to dinner pierre announced that a plate had been ordered for the land agent  chapter ii    i know that deformed he has been a vile thief this seven year he   goes up and down like a gentleman    much ado about nothing  eve and her cousin found sir george templemore and captain truck in the drawingroom the former having lingered in newyork with a desire to be near his friends and the latter being on the point of sailing for europe in his regular turn to these must be added mr bragg and the ordinary inmates of the house when the reader will get a view of the whole party  aristabulus had never before sat down to as brilliant a table and for the first time in his life he saw candles lighted at a dinner but he was not a man to be disconcerted at a novelty had he been a european of the same origin and habits awkwardness would have betrayed him fifty times before the dessert made its appearance but being the man he was one who overlooked a certain prurient politeness that rather illustrated his deportment might very well have permitted him to pass among the oi polloi of the world were it not for a peculiar management in the way of providing for himself it is true he asked every one near him to eat of every thing he could himself reach and that he used his knife as a coalheaver uses a shovel but the company he was in though fastidious in its own deportment was altogether above the silverforkisms and this portion of his demeanour if it did not escape undetected passed away unnoticed not so however with the peculiarity already mentioned as an exception this touch of deportment or management perhaps is the better word being characteristic of the man it deserves to be mentioned a little in detail  the service at mr effinghams table was made in the quiet but thorough manner that distinguishes a french dinner every dish was removed carved by the domestics and handed in turn to each guest but there were a delay and a finish in this arrangement that suited neither aristabuluss goaheadism nor his organ of acquisitiveness instead of waiting therefore for the more graduated movements of the domestics he began to take care of himself an office that he performed with a certain dexterity that he had acquired by frequenting ordinariesa school by the way in which he had obtained most of his notions of the proprieties of the table one or two slices were obtained in the usual manner or by means of the regular service and then like one who had laid the foundation of a fortune by some lucky windfall in the commencement of his career he began to make accessions right and left as opportunity offered sundry entremets or light dishes that had a peculiarly tempting appearance came first under his grasp of these he soon accumulated all within his reach by taxing his neighbours when he ventured to send his plate here and there or wherever he saw a dish that promised to reward his trouble by such means which were resorted to however with a quiet and unobtrusive assiduity that escaped much observation mr bragg contrived to make his own plate a sample epitome of the first course it contained in the centre fish beef and ham and around these staple articles he had arranged croquettes rognons râgouts vegetables and other light things until not only was the plate completely covered but it was actually covered in double and triple layers mustard cold butter salt and even pepper garnishing its edges these different accumulations were the work of time and address and most of the company had repeatedly changed their plates before aristabulus had eaten a mouthful the soup excepted the happy moment when his ingenuity was to be rewarded had now arrived and the land agent was about to commence the process of mastication or of deglutition rather for he troubled himself very little with the first operation when the report of a cork drew his attention towards the chaimpaigne to aristabulus this wine never came amiss for relishing its piquancy he had never gone far enough into the science of the table to learn which were the proper moments for using it as respected all the others at table this moment had in truth arrived though as respected himself he was no nearer to it according to a regulated taste than when he first took his seat perceiving that pierre was serving it however he offered his own glass and enjoyed a delicious instant as he swallowed a beverage that much surpassed any thing he had ever known to issue out of the waxed and leaded nozles that pointed like so many enemies batteries loaded with headaches and disordered stomachs garnished sundry village bars of his acquaintance  aristabulus finished his glass at a draught and when he took breath he fairly smacked his lips that was an unlucky instant his plate burthened with all its treasures being removed at this unguarded moment the man who performed the unkind office fancying that a dislike to the dishes could alone have given rise to such an omnium gatherum  it was necessary to commence de novo but this could no longer be done with the first course which was removed and aristabulus set to with zeal forthwith on the game necessity compelled him to eat as the different dishes were offered and such was his ordinary assiduity with the knife and fork that at the end of the second remove he had actually disposed of more food than any other person at table he now began to converse and we shall open the conversation at the precise point in the dinner when it was in the power of aristabulus to make one of the interlocutors  unlike mr dodge he had betrayed no peculiar interest in the baronet being a man too shrewd and worldly to set his heart on trifles of any sort and mr bragg no more hesitated about replying to sir george templemore or mr effingham than he would have hesitated about answering one of his own nearest associates with him age and experience formed no particular claims to be heard and as to rank it is true he had some vague ideas about there being such a thing in the militia but as it was unsalaried rank he attached no great importance to it sir george templemore was inquiring concerning the recording of deeds a regulation that had recently attracted attention in england and one of mr effinghams replies contained some immaterial inaccuracy which aristabulus took occasion to correct as his first appearance in the general discourse  i ask pardon sir he concluded his explanations by saying but i ought to know these little niceties having served a short part of a term as a county clerk to fill a vacancy occasioned by a death  you mean mr bragg that you were employed to write in a county clerks office observed john effingham who so much disliked untruth that he did not hesitate much about refuting it or what he now fancied to be an untruth  as county clerk sir major pippin died a year before his time was out and i got the appointment as regular a county clerk sir as there is in the fiftysix counties of newyork  when i had the honour to engage you as mr effinghams agent sir returned the other a little sternly for he felt his own character for veracity involved in that of the subject of his selection i believe indeed that you were writing in the office but i did not understand it was as the clerk  very true mr john returned aristabulus without discovering the least concern i was then engaged by my successor as a clerk but a few months earlier i filled the office myself  had you gone on in the regular line of promotion my dear sir pithily inquired captain truck to what preferment would you have risen by this time  i believe i understand you gentlemen returned the unmoved aristabulus who perceived a general smile i know that some people are particular about keeping pretty much on the same level as to office but i hold to no such doctrine if one good thing cannot be had i do not see that it is a reason for rejecting another i ran that year for sheriff and finding i was not strong enough to carry the county i accepted my successors offer to write in the office until something better might turn up  you practised all this time i believe mr bragg observed john effingham  i did a little in that way too sir or as much as i could law is flat with us of late and many of the attorneys are turning their attention to other callings  and pray sir asked sir george what is the favourite pursuit with most of them just now  some our way have gone into the horseline but much the greater portion are just now dealing in western cities  in western cities exclaimed the baronet looking as if he distrusted a mystification  in such articles and in millseats and railroad lines and other expectations  mr bragg means that they are buying and selling lands on which it is hoped all these conveniences may exist a century hence explained john effingham  the hope is for next year or next week even mr john returned aristabulus with a sly look though you may be very right as to the reality great fortunes have been made on a capital of hopes lately in this country  and have you been able yourself to resist these temptations asked mr effingham i feel doubly indebted to you sir that you should have continued to devote your time to my interests while so many better things were offering  it was my duty sir said aristabulus bowing so much the lower from the consciousness that he had actually deserted his post for some months to embark in the western speculations that were then so active in the country not to say my pleasure there are many profitable occupations in this country sir george that have been overlooked in the eagerness to embark in the towntrade  mr bragg does not mean trade in town but trade in towns explained john effingham  yes sir the traffic in cities i never come this way without casting an eye about me in order to see if there is any thing to be done that is useful and i confess that several available opportunities have offered if one had capital milk is a good business  le lait exclaimed mademoiselle viefville involuntarily  yes maam for ladies as well as gentlemen sweet potatoes i have heard well spoken of and peaches are really making some rich mens fortunes  all of which are honester and better occupations than the traffic in cities that you have mentioned quietly observed mr effingham  aristabulus looked up in a little surprise for with him every thing was eligible that returned a good profit and all things honest that the law did not actually punish perceiving however that the company was disposed to listen and having by this time recovered the lost ground in the way of food he cheerfully resumed his theme  many families have left otsego this and the last summer mr effingham as emigrants for the west the fever has spread far and wide  the fever is old otsego for so its inhabitants loved to call a county of half a centurys existence it being venerable by comparison is old otsego losing its well established character for salubrity  i do not allude to an animal fever but to the western fever  ce pays de louest estil bien malsain whispered mademoiselle viefville  apparemment mademoiselle sur plusieurs rapports  the western fever has seized old and young and it has carried off many active families from our part of the world continued aristabulus who did not understand the little aside just mentioned and who of course did not heed it most of the counties adjoining our own have lost a considerable portion of their population  and they who have gone do they belong to the permanent families or are they merely the floating inhabitants inquired mr effingham  most of them belong to the regular movers  movers again exclaimed sir georgeis there any material part of your population who actually deserve this name  as much so as the man who shoes a horse ought to be called a smith or the man who frames a house a carpenter answered john effingham  to be sure continued mr bragg we have a pretty considerable leaven of them in our political dough as well as in our active business i believe sir george that in england men are tolerably stationary  we love to continue for generations on the same spot we love the tree that our forefathers planted the roof that they built the fireside by which they sat the sods that cover their remains  very poetical and i dare say there are situations in life in which such feelings come in without much effort it must be a great check to business operations however in your part of the world sir  business operationswhat is business as you term it sir to the affections to the recollections of ancestry and to the solemn feelings connected with history and tradition  why sir in the way of history one meets with but few incumbrances in this country but he may do very much as interest dictates so far as that is concerned at least a nation is much to be pitied that is weighed down by the past in this manner since its industry and enterprize are constantly impeded by obstacles that grow out of its recollections america may indeed be termed a happy and a free country mr john effingham in this as well as in all other things  sir george templemore was too wellbred to utter all he felt at that moment as it would unavoidably wound the feelings of his hosts but he was rewarded for his forbearance by intelligent smiles from eve and grace the latter of whom the young baronet fancied just at that moment was quite as beautiful as her cousin and if less finished in manners she had the most interesting naiveté  i have been told that most old nations have to struggle with difficulties that we escape returned john effingham though i confess this is a superiority on our part that never before presented itself to my mind  the political economists and even the geographers have overlooked it but practical men see and feel its advantages every hour in the day i have been told sir george templemore that in england there are difficulties in running highways and streets through homesteads and dwellings and that even a railroad or a canal is obliged to make a curve to avoid a churchyard or a tombstone  i confess to the sin sir  our friend mr bragg put in john effingham considers life as all means and no end  an end cannot be got at without the means mr john effingham as i trust you will yourself admit i am for the end of the road at least and must say that i rejoice in being a native of a country in which as few impediments as possible exist to onward impulses the man who should resist an improvement in our part of the country on account of his forefathers would fare badly among his contemporaries  will you permit me to ask mr bragg if you feel no local attachments yourself enquired the baronet throwing as much delicacy into the tones of his voice as a question that he felt ought to be an insult to a mans heart would allowif one tree is not more pleasant than another the house you were born in more beautiful than a house into which you never entered or the altar at which you have long worshipped more sacred than another at which you never knelt  nothing gives me greater satisfaction than to answer the questions of gentlemen that travel through our country returned aristabulus for i think in making nations acquainted with each other we encourage trade and render business more secure to reply to your inquiry a human being is not a cat to love a locality rather than its own interests i have found some trees much pleasanter than others and the pleasantest tree i can remember was one of my own out of which the sawyers made a thousand feet of clear stuff to say nothing of middlings the house i was born in was pulled down shortly after my birth as indeed has been its successor so i can tell you nothing on that head and as for altars there are none in my persuasion  the church of mr bragg has stripped itself as naked as he would strip every thing else if he could said john effingham i much question if he ever knelt even much less before an altar  we are of the standing order certainly returned aristabulus glancing towards the ladies to discover how they took his wit and mr john effingham is as near right as a man need be in a matter of faith in the way of houses mr effingham i believe it is the general opinion you might have done better with your own than to have repaired it had the materials been disposed of they would have sold well and by running a street through the property a pretty sum might have been realized  in which case i should have been without a home mr bragg  it would have been no great matter to get another on cheaper land the old residence would have made a good factory or an inn  sir i am a cat and like the places i have long frequented  aristabulus though not easily daunted was awed by mr effinghams manner and eve saw that her fathers fine face had flushed this interruption therefore suddenly changed the discourse which has been recreated at some length as likely to give the reader a better insight into a character that will fill some space in our narrative than a more laboured description  i trust your owners captain truck said john effingham by way of turning the conversation into another channel are fully satisfied with the manner in which you saved their property from the hands of the arabs  men when money is concerned are more disposed to remember how it was lost than how it was recovered religion and trade being the two poles on such a point returned the old seaman with a serious face on the whole my dear sir i have reason to be satisfied however and so long as you my passengers and my friends are not inclined to blame me i shall feel as if i had done at least a part of my duty  eve rose from table went to a sideboard and returned when she gracefully placed before the master of the montauk a rich and beautifully chased punchbowl in silver almost at the same moment pierre offered a salver that contained a capital watch a pair of small silver tongs to hold a coal and a deck trumpet in solid silver  these are so many faint testimonials of our feelings said eveand you will do us the favour to retain them as evidences of the esteem created by skill kindness and courage  my dear young lady cried the old tar touched to the soul by the feeling with which eve acquitted herself of this little duty my dear young ladywell god bless yougod bless you allyou too mr john effingham for that matterand sir georgethat i should ever have taken that runaway for a gentleman and a baronetthough i suppose there are some silly baronets as well as silly lordsretain themglancing furiously at mr aristabulus bragg may the lord forget me in the heaviest hurricane if i ever forget whence these things came and why they were given  here the worthy captain was obliged to swallow some wine by way of relieving his emotions and aristabulus profiting by the opportunity coolly took the bowl which to use a word of his own he hefted in his hand with a view to form some tolerably accurate notion of its intrinsic value captain trucks eye caught the action and he reclaimed his property quite as unceremoniously as it had been taken away nothing but the presence of the ladies preventing an outbreaking that would have amounted to a declaration of war  with your permission sir said the captain drily after he had recovered the bowl not only without the others consent but in some degree against his will this bowl is as precious in my eyes as if it were made of my fathers bones  you may indeed think so returned the landagent for its cost could not be less than a hundred dollars  cost sirbut my dear young lady let us talk of the real value for what part of these things am i indebted to you  the bowl is my offering eve answered smilingly though a tear glistened in her eye as she witnessed the strong unsophisticated feeling of the old tar i thought it might serve sometimes to bring me to your recollection when it was well filled in honour of sweethearts and wives  it shallit shall by the lord and mr saunders needs look to it if he do not keep this work as bright as a cruising frigates bottom to whom do i owe the coaltongs  those are from mr john effingham who insists that he will come nearer to your heart than any of us though the gift be of so little cost  he does not know me my dear young ladynobody ever got as near my heart as you no not even my own dear pious old mother but i thank mr john effingham from my inmost spirit and shall seldom smoke without thinking of him the watch i know is mr effinghams and i ascribe the trumpet to sir george  the bows of the several gentlemen assured the captain he was right and he shook each of them cordially by the hand protesting in the fulness of his heart that nothing would give him greater pleasure than to be able to go through the same perilous scenes as those from which they had so lately escaped in their good company again  while this was going on aristabulus notwithstanding the rebuke he had received contrived to get each article in succession into his hands and by dint of poising it on a finger or by examining it to form some approximative notion of its inherent value the watch he actually opened taking as good a survey of its works as the circumstances of the case would very well allow  i respect these things sir more than you respect your fathers grave said captain truck sternly as he rescued the last article from what he thought the impious grasp of aristabulus again and cat or no cat they sink or swim with me for the remainder of the cruise if there is any virtue in a will which i am sorry to say i hear there is not any longer they shall share my last bed with me be it ashore or be it afloat my dear young lady fancy all the rest but depend on it punch will be sweeter than ever taken from this bowl and sweethearts and wives will never be so honoured again  we are going to a ball this evening at the house of one with whom i am sufficiently intimate to take the liberty of introducing a stranger and i wish gentlemen said mr effingham bowing to aristabulus and the captain by way of changing the conversation you would do me the favour to be of our party  mr bragg acquiesced very cheerfully and quite as a matter of course while captain truck after protesting his unfitness for such scenes was finally prevailed on by john effingham to comply with the request also the ladies remained at table but a few minutes longer when they retired mr effingham having dropped into the old custom of sitting at the bottle until summoned to the drawingroom a usage that continues to exist in america for a reason no better than the fact that it continues to exist in englandit being almost certain that it will cease in newyork the season after it is known to have ceased in london  chapter iii    thou art as wise as thou art beautiful    shakspeare  as captain truck asked permission to initiate the new coaltongs by lighting a cigar sir george templemore contrived to ask pierre in an aside if the ladies would allow him to join them the desired consent having been obtained the baronet quietly stole from table and was soon beyond the odours of the diningroom  you miss the censer and the frankincense said eve laughing as sir george entered the drawingroom but you will remember we have no church establishment and dare not take such liberties with the ceremonials of the altar  that is a shortlived custom with us i fancy though far from an unpleasant one but you do me injustice in supposing i am merely running away from the fumes of the dinner  no no we understand perfectly well that you have something to do with the fumes of flattery and we will at once fancy all has been said that the occasion requires is not our honest old captain a jewel in his way  upon my word since you allow me to speak of your fathers guests i do not think it possible to have brought together two men who are so completely the opposites of each other as captain truck and this mr aristabulus bragg the latter is quite the most extraordinary person in his way it was ever my good fortune to meet with  you call him a person while pierre calls him a personnage i fancy he considers it very much as a matter of accident whether he is to pass his days in the one character or in the other cousin jack assures me that while this man accepts almost any duty that he chooses to assign him he would not deem it at all a violation of the convenances to aim at the throne in the white house  certainly with no hopes of ever attaining it  one cannot answer for that the man must undergo many essential changes and much radical improvement before such a climax to his fortunes can ever occur but the instant you do away with the claims of hereditary power the door is opened to a new chapter of accidents alexander of russia styled himself un heureux accident and should it ever be our fortune to receive mr bragg as president we shall only have to term him un malheureux accident i believe that will contain all the difference  your republicanism is indomitable miss effingham and i shall abandon the attempt to convert you to safer principles more especially as i find you supported by both the mr effinghams who while they condemn so much at home seem singularly attached to their own system at the bottom  they condemn sir george templemore because they know that perfection is hopeless and because they feel it to be unsafe and unwise to eulogize defects and they are attached because near views of other countries have convinced them that comparatively at last bad as we are we are still better than most of our neighbours  i can assure you said grace that many of the opinions of mr john effingham in particular are not at all the opinions that are most in vogue here he rather censures what we like and likes what we censure even my dear uncle is thought to be a little heterodox on such subjects  i can readily believe it returned eve steadily these gentlemen having become familiar with better things in the way of the tastes and of the purely agreeable cannot discredit their own knowledge so much as to extol that which their own experience tells them is faulty or condemn that which their own experience tells them is relatively good now grace if you will reflect a moment you will perceive that people necessarily like the best of their own tastes until they come to a knowledge of better and that they as necessarily quarrel with the unpleasant facts that surround them although these facts as consequences of a political system may be much less painful than those of other systems of which they have no knowledge in the one case they like their own best simply because it is their own best and they dislike their own worst because it is their own worst we cherish a taste in the nature of things without entering into any comparisons for when the means of comparison offer and we find improvements it ceases to be a taste at all while to complain of any positive grievance is the nature of man i fear  i think a republic odious  le republique est une horreur  grace thought a republic odious without knowing any thing of any other state of society and because it contained odious things and mademoiselle viefville called a republic une horreur because heads fell and anarchy prevailed in her own country during its early struggles for liberty though eve seldom spoke more sensibly and never more temperately than while delivering the foregoing opinions sir george templemore doubted whether she had all that exquisite finesse and delicacy of features that he had so much admired and when grace burst out in the sudden and senseless exclamation we have recorded he turned towards her sweet and animated countenance which for the moment he fancied the loveliest of the two  eve effingham had yet to learn that she had just entered into the most intolerant society meaning purely as society and in connexion with what are usually called liberal sentiments in christendom we do not mean by this that it would be less safe to utter a generous opinion in favour of human rights in america than in any other country for the laws and the institutions become active in this respect but simply that the resistance of the more refined to the encroachments of the unrefined has brought about a state of feelinga feeling that is seldom just and never philosophicalwhich has created a silent but almost unanimous bias against the effects of the institutions in what is called the world in europe one rarely utters a sentiment of this nature under circumstances in which it is safe to do so at all without finding a very general sympathy in the auditors but in the circle into which eve had now fallen it was almost considered a violation of the proprieties we do not wish to be understood as saying more than we mean however for we have no manner of doubt that a large portion of the dissentients even are so idly and without reflection or for the very natural reasons already given by our heroine but we do wish to be understood as meaning that such is the outward appearance which american society presents to every stranger and to every native of the country too on his return from a residence among other people of its taste wisdom and safety we shall not now speak but content ourselves with merely saying that the effect of graces exclamation on eve was unpleasant and that unlike the baronet she thought her cousin was never less handsome than while her pretty face was covered with the pettish frown it had assumed for the occasion  sir george templemore had tact enough to perceive there had been a slight jar in the feelings of these two young women and he adroitly changed the conversation with eve he had entire confidence on the score of provincialisms and without exactly anticipating the part grace would be likely to take in such a discussion he introduced the subject of general society in newyork  i am desirous to know he said if you have your sets as we have them in london and paris whether you have your faubourg st germain and your chaussée dantin your piccadilly grosvenor and russel squares  i must refer you to miss van cortlandt for an answer to that question said eve  grace looked up blushing for there were both novelty and excitement in having an intelligent foreigner question her on such a subject  i do not know that i rightly understand the allusion she said although i am afraid sir george templemore means to ask if we have distinctions in society  and why afraid miss van cortlandt  because it strikes me such a question would imply a doubt of our civilization  there are frequently distinctions made when the differences are not obvious observed eve even london and paris are not above the imputation of this folly sir george templemore if i understand him wishes to know if we estimate gentility by streets and quality by squares  not exactly that either miss effinghambut whether among those who may very well pass for gentlemen and ladies you enter into the minute distinctions that are elsewhere found whether you have your exclusive and your élégants and élegantes or whether you deem all within the pale as on an equality  les femmes americaines sont bien jolies exclaimed mademoiselle viefville  it is quite impossible that coteries should not form in a town of three hundred thousand souls  i do not mean exactly even that is there no distinction between coteries is not one placed by opinion by a silent consent if not by positive ordinances above another  certainly that to which sir george templemore alludes is to be found said grace who gained courage to speak as she found the subject getting to be more clearly within her comprehension all the old families for instance keep more together than the others though it is the subject of regret that they are not more particular than they are  old families exclaimed sir george templemore with quite as much stress as a wellbred man could very well lay on the words in such circumstances  old families repeated eve with all that emphasis which the baronet himself had hesitated about giving as old at least as two centuries can make them and this too with origins beyond that period like those of the rest of the world indeed the american has a better gentility than common as besides his own he may take root in that of europe  do not misconceive me miss effingham i am fully aware that the people of this country are exactly like the people of all other civilized countries in this respect but my surprise is that in a republic you should have such a term even as that of old families  the surprise has arisen i must be permitted to say from not having sufficiently reflected on the real state of the country there are two great causes of distinction every where wealth and merit now if a race of americans continue conspicuous in their own society through either or both of these causes for a succession of generations why have they not the same claims to be considered members of old families as europeans under the same circumstances a republican history is as much history as a monarchical history and a historical name in one is quite as much entitled to consideration as a historical name in another nay you admit this in your european republics while you wish to deny it in ours  i must insist on having proofs if we permit these charges to be brought against us without evidence mademoiselle viefville we shall finally be defeated through our own neglect  cest une belle illustration celle de lantiquité observed the governess in a matter of course tone  if you insist on proof what answer can you urge to the capponi sonnez vos trompettes et je vais faire sonner mes clochesor to the von erlachs a family that has headed so many resistances to oppression and invasion for five centuries  all this is very true returned sir george and yet i confess it is not the way in which it is usual with us to consider american society  a descent from washington with a character and a social position to correspond would not be absolutely vulgar notwithstanding  nay if you press me so hard i must appeal to miss van cortlandt for succour  on this point you will find no support in that quarter miss van cortlandt has an historical name herself and will not forego an honest pride in order to relieve one of the hostile powers from a dilemma  while i admit that time and merit must in a certain sense place families in america in the same situation with families in europe i cannot see that it is in conformity with your institutions to lay the same stress on the circumstance  in that we are perfectly of a mind as i think the american has much the best reason to be proud of his family said eve quietly  you delight in paradoxes apparently this evening miss effingham for i now feel very certain you can hardly make out a plausible defence of this new position  if i had my old ally mr powis here said eve touching the fender unconsciously with her little foot and perceptibly losing the animation and pleasantry of her voice in tones that were gentler if not melancholy i should ask him to explain this matter to you for he was singularly ready in such replies as he is absent however i will attempt the duty myself in europe office power and consequently consideration are all hereditary whereas in this country they are not but they depend on selection now surely one has more reason to be proud of ancestors who have been chosen to fill responsible stations than of ancestors who have filled them through the accidents heureux ou malkeureux of birth the only difference between england and america as respects family is that you add positive rank to that to which we only give consideration sentiment is at the bottom of our nobility and the great seal at the bottom of yours and now having established the fact that there are families in america let us return whence we started and enquire how far they have an influence in everyday society  to ascertain which we must apply to miss van cortlandt  much less than they ought if my opinion is to be taken said grace laughing for the great inroad of strangers has completely deranged all the suitablenesses in that respect  and yet i dare say these very strangers do good rejoined eve many of them must have been respectable in their native places and ought to be an acquisition to a society that in its nature must be grace tant soit peu provincial  oh cried grace i can tolerate any thing but the hajjis  the what asked sir george eagerlywill you suffer me to ask an explanation miss van cortlandt  the hajjis repeated grace laughing though she blushed to the eyes  the baronet looked from one cousin to the other and then turned an inquiring glance on mademoiselle viefville the latter gave a slight shrug and seemed to ask an explanation of the young ladys meaning herself  a hajji is one of a class sir george templemore eve at length said to which you and i have both the honour of belonging  no not sir george templemore interrupted grace with a precipitation that she instantly regretted he is not an american  then i alone of all present have that honour it means the pilgrimage to paris instead of mecca and the pilgrim must be an american instead of a mahommedan  nay eve you are not a hajji neither  then there is some qualification with which i am not yet acquainted will you relieve our doubts grace and let us know the precise character of the animal  you stayed too long to be a hajji one must get innoculated merely not take the disease and become cured to be a true hajji  i thank you miss van cortlandt for this description returned eve in her quiet way i hope as i have gone through the malady it has not left me pitted  i should like to see one of these hajjis cried sir georgeare they of both sexes  grace laughed and nodded her head  will you point it out to me should we be so fortunate as to encounter one this evening  again grace laughed and nodded her head  i have been thinking grace said eve after a short pause that we may give sir george templemore a better idea of the sets about which he is so curious by doing what is no more than a duty of our own and by letting him profit by the opportunity mrs hawker receives this evening without ceremony we have not yet sent our answer to mrs jarvis and might very well look in upon her for half an hour after which we shall be in very good season for mrs houstons ball  surely eve you would not wish to take sir george templemore to such a house as that of mrs jarvis  i do not wish to take sir george templemore any where for your hajjis have opinions of their own on such subjects but as cousin jack will accompany us he may very well confer that important favour i dare say mrs jarvis will not look upon it as too great a liberty  i will answer for it that nothing mr john effingham can do will be thought mal à propos by mrs jared jarvis his position in society is too well established and hers is too equivocal to leave any doubt on that head  this you perceive settles the point of côteries said eve to the baronet volumes might be written to establish principles but when one can do any thing he or she pleases any where that he or she likes it is pretty safe to say that he or she is privileged  all very true as to the fact miss effingham but i should like exceedingly to know the reason  half the time such things are decided without a reason at all you are a little exacting in requiring a reason in newyork for that which is done in london without even the pretence of such a thing it is sufficient that mrs jarvis will be delighted to see you without an invitation and that mrs houston would at least think it odd were you to take the same liberty with her  it follows said sir george smiling that mrs jarvis is much the most hospitable person of the two  but eve what shall be done with captain truck and mr bragg asked grace we cannot take them to mrs hawkers  aristabulus would indeed be a little out of place in such a house but as for our excellent brave straightforward old captain he is worthy to go any where i shall be delighted to present him to mrs hawker myself  after a little consultation between the ladies it was settled that nothing should be said of the two first visits to mr bragg but that mr effingham should be requested to bring him to the ball at the proper hour and that the rest of the party should go quietly off to the other places without mentioning their projects as soon as this was arranged the ladies retired to dress sir george templemore passing into the library to amuse himself with a book the while where however he was soon joined by john effingham here the former revived the conversation on distinctions in society with the confusion of thought that usually marks a europeans notions of such matters  chapter iv    ready and i and i where shall we go    midsummernights dream  grace van cortlant was the first to make her appearance after the retreat from the drawingroom it has often been said that pretty as the american females incontestably are as a whole they appear better in demitoilette than when attired for a ball with what would be termed high dress in other parts of the world they are little acquainted but reversing the rule of europe where the married bestow the most care on their personal appearance and the single are taught to observe a rigid simplicity grace now seemed sufficiently ornamented in the eyes of the fastidious baronet while at the same time he thought her less obnoxious to the criticism just mentioned than most of her young countrywomen in general  an embonpoint that was just sufficient to distinguish her from most of her companions a fine colour brilliant eyes a sweet smile rich hair and such feet and hands as sir george templemore had somehow he scarcely knew how himselffancied could only belong to the daughters of peers and princes rendered grace so strikingly attractive this evening that the young baronet began to think her even handsomer than her cousin there was also a charm in the unsophisticated simplicity of grace that was particularly alluring to a man educated amidst the coldness and mannerism of the higher classes of england in grace too this simplicity was chastened by perfect decorum and retenue of deportment the exuberance of the new school of manners not having helped to impair the dignity of her character or to weaken the charm of diffidence she was less finished in her manners than eve certainly a circumstance perhaps that induced sir george templemore to fancy her a shade more simple but she was never unfeminine or unladylike and the term vulgar in despite of all the capricious and arbitrary rules of fashion under no circumstances could ever be applied to grace van cortlandt in this respect nature seemed to have aided her for had not her associations raised her above such an imputation no one could believe that she would be obnoxious to the charge had her lot in life been cast even many degrees lower than it actually was  it is well known that after a sufficient similarity has been created by education to prevent any violent shocks to our habits or principles we most affect those whose characters and dispositions the least resemble our own this was probably one of the reasons why sir george templemore who for some time had been well assured of the hopelessness of his suit with eve began to regard her scarcely less lovely cousin with an interest of a novel and lively nature quicksighted and deeply interested in graces happiness miss effingham had already detected this change in the young baronets inclinations and though sincerely rejoiced on her own account she did not observe it without concern for she understood better than most of her countrywomen the great hazards of destroying her peace of mind that are incurred by transplanting an american woman into the more artificial circles of the old world  i shall rely on your kind offices in particular miss van cortlandt to reconcile mrs jarvis and mrs hawker to the liberty i am about to take cried sir george as grace burst upon them in the library in a blaze of beauty that in her case was aided by her attire and coldhearted and unchristianlike women they must be indeed to resist such a mediator  grace was unaccustomed to adulation of this sort for though the baronet spoke gaily and like one half trifling his look of admiration was too honest to escape the intuitive perception of woman she blushed deeply and then recovering herself instantly said with a naiveté that had a thousand charms with her listener  i do not see why miss effingham and myself should hesitate about introducing you at either place mrs hawker is a relative and an intimatean intimate of mine at leastand as for poor mrs jarvis she is the daughter of an old neighbour and will be too glad to see us to raise objections i fancy any one of a certain grace hesitated and laughed  any one of a certain said sir george inquiringly  any one from this house resumed the young lady correcting the intended expression will be welcome in spring street  pure native aristocracy exclaimed the baronet with an air of affected triumph this you see mr john effingham is in aid of my argument  i am quite of your opinion returned the gentleman addressedas much native aristocracy as you please but no hereditary  the entrance of eve and mademoiselle viefville interrupted this pleasantry and the carriages being just then announced john effingham went in quest of captain truck who was in the drawingroom with mr effingham and aristabulus  i have left ned to discuss trespass suits and leases with his land agent said john effingham as he followed eve to the streetdoor by ten oclock they will have taxed a pretty bill of costs between them  mademoiselle viefville followed john effingham grace came next and sir george templemore and the captain brought up the rear grace wondered the young baronet did not offer her his arm for she had been accustomed to receive this attention from the other sex in a hundred situations in which it was rather an incumbrance than a service while on the other hand sir george himself would have hesitated about offering such assistance as an act of uncalledfor familiarity  miss van cortlandt being much in society kept a chariot for her own use and the three ladies took their seats in it while the gentlemen took possession of mr effinghams coach the order was given to drive to spring street and the whole party proceeded  the acquaintance between the effinghams and mr jarvis had arisen from the fact of their having been near and in a certain sense sociable neighbours in the country their town associations however were as distinct as if they dwelt in different hemispheres with the exception of an occasional morning call and now and then a family dinner given by mr effingham such had been the nature of the intercourse previously to the family of the latters having gone abroad and there were symptoms of its being renewed on the same quiet and friendly footing as formerly but no two beings could be less alike in certain essentials than mr jarvis and his wife the former was a plain painstaking sensible man of business while the latter had an itching desire to figure in the world of fashion the first was perfectly aware that mr effingham in education habits associations and manners was at least of a class entirely distinct from his own and without troubling himself to analyze causes and without a feeling of envy or unkindness of any sort while totally exempt from any undue deference or unmanly cringing he quietly submitted to let things take their course his wife expressed her surprise that any one in newyork should presume to be better than themselves and the remark gave rise to the following short conversation on the very morning of the day she gave the party to which we are now conducting the reader  how do you know my dear that any one does think himself our better demanded the husband  why do they not all visit us then  why do you not visit everybody yourself a pretty household we should have if you did nothing but visit every one who lives even in this street  you surely would not have me visiting the grocers wives at the corners and all the other rubbish of the neighbourhood what i mean is that all the people of a certain sort ought to visit all the other people of a certain sort in the same town  you surely will make an exception at least on account of numbers i saw number three thousand six hundred and fifty this very day on a cart and if the wives of all these carmen should visit one another each would have to make ten visits daily in order to get through with the list in a twelvemonth  i have always bad luck in making you comprehend these things mr jarvis  i am afraid my dear it is because you do not very clearly comprehend them yourself you first say that everybody ought to visit everybody and then you insist on it you will visit none but those you think good enough to be visited by mrs jared jarvis  what i mean is that no one in newyork has a right to think himself or herself better than ourselves  betterin what sense better  in such a sense as to induce them to think themselves too good to visit us  that may be your opinion my dear but others may judge differently you clearly think yourself too good to visit mrs onion the grocers wife who is a capital woman in her way and how do we know that certain people may not fancy we are not quite refined enough for them refinement is a positive thing mrs jarvis and one that has much more influence on the pleasures of association than money we may want a hundred little perfections that escape our ignorance and which those who are trained to such matters deem essentials  i never met with a man of so little social spirit mr jarvis really you are quite unsuited to be a citizen of a republican country  republicani do not really see what republican has to do with the question in the first place it is a droll word for you to use in this sense at least for taking your own meaning of the term you are as antirepublican as any woman i know but a republic does not necessarily infer equality of condition or even equality of rightsit meaning merely the substitution of the right of the commonwealth for the right of a prince had you said a democracy there would have been some plausibility in using the word though even then its application would have been illogical if i am a freeman and a democrat i hope i have the justice to allow others to be just as free and democratic as i am myself  and who wishes the contraryall i ask is a claim to be considered a fit associate for anybody in this countryin these united states of america  i would quit these united states of america next week if i thought there existed any necessity for such an intolerable state of things  mr jarvisand you too one of the committee of tammany hall  yes mrs jarvis and i one of the committee of tammany hall what do you think i want the three thousand six hundred and fifty carmen running in and out of my house with their tobacco saliva and pipes all day long  who is thinking of your carmen and grocersi speak now only of genteel people  in other words my dear you are thinking only of those whom you fancy to have the advantage of you and keep those who think of you in the same way quite out of sight this is not my democracy and freedom i believe that it requires two people to make a bargain and although i may consent to dine with a if a will not consent to dine with me there is an end of the matter  now you have come to a case in point you often dined with mr effingham before he went abroad and yet you would never allow me to ask mr effingham to dine with us that is what i call meanness  it might be so indeed if it were done to save my money i dined with mr effingham because i like him because he was an old neighbour because he asked me and because i found a pleasure in the quiet elegance of his table and society and i did not ask him to dine with me because i was satisfied he would be better pleased with such a tacit acknowledgement of his superiority in this respect than by any bustling and ungraceful efforts to pay him in kind edward effingham has dinners enough without keeping a debtor and credit account with his guests which is rather too newyorkish even for me  bustling and ungraceful repeated mrs jarvis bitterly i do not know that you are at all more bustling and ungraceful than mr effingham himself  no my dear i am a quiet unpretending man like the great majority of my countrymen thank god  then why talk of these sorts of differences in a country in which the law establishes none  for precisely the reason that i talk of the river at the foot of this street or because there is a river a thing may exist without there being a law for it there is no law for building this house and yet it is built there is no law for making dr verse a better preacher than dr prolix and yet he is a much better preacher neither is there any law for making mr effingham a more finished gentleman than i happen to be and yet i am not fool enough to deny the fact in the way of making out a bill of parcels i will not turn my back to him i can promise you  all this strikes me as being very spiritless and as particularly antirepublican said mrs jarvis rising to quit the room and if the effinghams do not come this evening i shall not enter their house this winter i am sure they have no right to pretend to be our betters and i feel no disposition to admit the impudent claim  before you go jane let me say a parting word rejoined the husband looking for his hat which is just this if you wish the world to believe you the equal of any one no matter whom do not be always talking about it lest they see you distrust the fact yourself a positive thing will surely be seen and they who have the highest claims are the least disposed to be always pressing them on the attention of the world an outrage may certainly be done those social rights which have been established by common consent and then it may be proper to resent it but beware betraying a consciousness of your own inferiority by letting every one see you are jealous of your station now kiss me here is the money to pay for your finery this evening and let me see you as happy to receive mrs jewett from albion place as you would be to receive mrs hawker herself  mrs hawker cried the wife with a toss of her head i would not cross the street to invite mrs hawker and all her clan which was very true as mrs jarvis was thoroughly convinced the trouble would be unavailing the lady in question being as near the head of fashion in newyork as it was possible to be in a town that in a moral sense resembles an encampment quite as much as it resembles a permanent and a longexisting capital  notwithstanding a great deal of management on the part of mrs jarvis to get showy personages to attend her entertainment the simple elegance of the two carriages that bore the effingham party threw all the other equipages into the shade the arrival indeed was deemed a matter of so much moment that intelligence was conveyed to the lady who was still at her post in the inner drawingroom of the arrival of a party altogether superior to any thing that had yet appeared in her rooms it is true this was not expressed in words but it was made sufficiently obvious by the breathless haste and the air of importance of mrs jarvis sister who had received the news from a servant and who communicated it propriâ personâ to the mistress of the house  the simple useful graceful almost indispensable usage of announcing at the door indispensable to those who receive much and where there is the risk of meeting people known to us by name and not in person is but little practised in america mrs jarvis would have shrunk from such an innovation had she known that elsewhere the custom prevailed but she was in happy ignorance on this point as on many others that were more essential to the muchcoveted social éclat at which she aimed when mademoiselle viefville appeared therefore walking unsupported as if she were out of leading strings followed by eve and grace and the gentlemen of their party she at first supposed there was some mistake and that her visitors had got into the wrong house there being an opposition party in the neighbourhood  what brazen people whispered mrs abijah gross who having removed from an interior newengland village fully two years previously fancied herself an fait of all the niceties of breeding and social tact there are positively two young ladies actually walking about without gentlemen  but it was not in the power of mrs abijah gross with her audible whisper and obvious sneer and laugh to put down two such lovely creatures as eve and her cousin the simple elegance of their attire the indescribable air of polish particularly in the former and the surpassing beauty and modesty of mien of both effectually silenced criticism after this solitary outbreaking of vulgarity mrs jarvis recognized eve and john effingham and her hurried compliments and obvious delight proclaimed to all near her the importance she attached to their visit mademoiselle viefville she had not recollected in her present dress and even she was covered with expressions of delight and satisfaction  i wish particularly to present to you a friend that we all prize exceedingly said eve as soon as there was an opportunity of speaking this is captain truck the gentleman who commands the montauk the ship of which you have heard so much ah mr jarvis offering a hand to him with sincere cordiality for eve had known him from childhood and always sincerely respected himyou will receive my friend with a cordial welcome i am certain  she then explained to mr jarvis who the honest captain was when the former first paying the proper respect to his other guests led the old sailor aside and began an earnest conversation on the subject of the recent passage  john effingham presented the baronet whom mrs jarvis out of pure ignorance of his rank in his own country received with perfect propriety and selfrespect  we have very few people of note in town at present i believe said mrs jarvis to john effingham a great traveller a most interesting man is the only person of that sort i could obtain for this evening and i shall have great pleasure in introducing you he is there in that crowd for he is in the greatest possible demand he has seen so muchmrs snow with your permissionreally the ladies are thronging about him as if he were a pawneehave the goodness to step a little this way mr effinghammiss effinghammrs snow just touch his arm and let him know i wish to introduce a couple of friendsmr dodge mr john effingham miss effingham miss van cortlandt i hope you may succeed in getting him a little to yourselves ladies for he can tell you all about europesaw the king of france riding out to nully and has a prodigious knowledge of things on the other side of the water  it required a good deal of eves habitual selfcommand to prevent a smile but she had the tact and discretion to receive steadfast as an utter stranger john effingham bowed as haughtily as man can bow and then it was whispered that he and mr dodge were rival travellers the distance of the former coupled with an expression of countenance that did not invite familiarity drove nearly all the company over to the side of steadfast who it was soon settled had seen much the most of the world understood society the best and had moreover travelled as far as timbuctoo in africa the clientèle of mr dodge increased rapidly as these reports spread in the rooms and those who had not read the delightful letters published in the active inquirer furiously envied those who had enjoyed that high advantage  it is mr dodge the great traveller said one young lady who had extricated herself from the crowd around the lion and taken a station near eve and grace and who moreover was a blue in her own set his beautiful and accurate descriptions have attracted great attention in england and it is said they have actually been republished  have you read them miss brackett  not the letters themselves absolutely but all the remarks on them in the last weeks hebdomad most delightful letters judging from those remarks full of nature and point and singularly accurate in all their facts in this respect they are invaluable travellers do fall into such extraordinary errors  i hope maam said john effingham gravely that the gentleman has avoided the capital mistake of commenting on things that actually exist comments on its facts are generally esteemed by the people of a country impertinent and unjust and your true way to succeed is to treat as freely as possible its imaginary peculiarities  miss brackett had nothing to answer to this observation the hebdomad having among its other profundities never seen proper to touch on the subject she went on praising the letters however not one of which had she read or would she read for this young lady had contrived to gain a high reputation in her own coterie for taste and knowledge in books by merely skimming the strictures of those who do not even skim the works they pretend to analyze  eve had never before been in so close contact with so much flippant ignorance and she could not but wonder at seeing a man like her kinsman overlooked in order that a man like mr dodge should be preferred all this gave john effingham himself no concern but retiring a little from the crowd he entered into a short conversation with the young baronet  i should like to know your real opinions of this set he said not that i plead guilty to the childish sensibility that is so common in all provincial circles to the judgments of strangers but with a view to aid you in forming a just estimate of the real state of the country  as i know the precise connexion between you and our host there can be no objection to giving a perfectly frank reply the women strike me as being singularly delicate and pretty well dressed too i might add but while there is a great air of decency there is very little high finish and what strikes me as being quite odd under such circumstances scarcely any downright vulgarity or coarseness  a daniel come to judgment one who had passed a life here would not have come so near the truth simply because he would not have observed peculiarities that require the means of comparison to be detected you are a little too indulgent in saying there is no downright vulgarity for some there is though surprisingly little for the circumstances but of the coarseness that would be so prominent elsewhere there is hardly any true so great is the equality in all things in this country so direct the tendency to this respectable mediocrity that what you now see here tonight may be seen in almost every village in the land with a few immaterial exceptions in the way of furniture and other city appliances and not much even in these  certainly as a mediocrity this is respectable though a fastidious taste might see a multitude of faults  i shall not say that the taste would be merely fastidious for much is wanting that would add to the grace and beauty of society while much that is wanting would be missed only by the oversophisticated those youngmen who are sniggering over some bad joke in the corner for instance are positively vulgar as is that young lady who is indulging in practical coquetry but on the whole there is little of this and even our hostess a silly woman devoured with the desire of being what neither her social position education habits nor notions fit her to be is less obtrusive bustling and offensive than a similar person elsewhere  i am quite of your way of thinking and intended to ask you to account for it  the americans are an imitative people of necessity and they are apt at this part of imitation in particular then they are less artificial in all their practices than older and more sophisticated nations and this company has got that essential part of good breeding simplicity as it were per force a step higher in the social scale you will see less of it for greater daring and bad models lead to blunders in matters that require to be exceedingly well done if done at all the faults here would be more apparent by an approach near enough to get into the tone of mind the forms of speech and the attempts at wit  which i think we shall escape tonight as i see the ladies are already making their apologies and taking leave we must defer this investigation to another time  it may be indefinitely postponed as it would scarcely reward the trouble of an inquiry  the gentlemen now approached mrs jarvis paid their parting compliments hunted up captain truck whom they tore by violence from the goodnatured hospitality of the master of the house and then saw the ladies into their carriage as they drove off the worthy mariner protested that mr jarvis was one of the honestest men he had ever met and announced that he intended giving him a dinner on board the montauk the very next day  the dwelling of mrs hawker was in hudson square or in a portion of the city that the lovers of the grandiose are endeavouring to call st johns park for it is rather an amusing peculiarity among a certain portion of the emigrants who have flocked into the middle states within the last thirty years that they are not satisfied with permitting any family or thing to possess the name it originally enjoyed if there exists the least opportunity to change it there was but a carriage or two before the door though the strong lights in the house showed that company had collected  mrs hawker is the widow and the daughter of men of long established newyork families she is childless affluent and universally respected where known for her breeding benevolence good sense and heart said john effingham while the party was driving from one house to the other were you to go into most of the sets of this town and mention mrs hawkers name not one person in ten would know there is such a being in their vicinity the pêle mêle of a migratory population keeping persons of her character and condition in life quite out of view the very persons who will prattle by the hour of the establishments of mrs peleg pond and mrs jonah twist and mrs abiram wattles people who first appeared on this island five or six years since and who having accumulated what to them are relatively large fortunes have launched out into vulgar and uninstructed finery would look with surprise at hearing mrs hawker mentioned as one having any claims to social distinction her historical names are overshadowed in their minds by the parochial glories of certain local prodigies in the townships whence they emigrated her manners would puzzle the comprehension of people whose imitation has not gone beyond the surface and her polished and simple mind would find little sympathy among a class who seldom rise above a commonplace sentiment without getting upon stilts  mrs hawker then is a lady observed sir george templemore  mrs hawker is a lady in every sense of the word by position education manners association mind fortune and birth i do not know that we ever had more of her class than exist today but certainly we once had them more prominent in society  i suppose sir said captain truck that this mrs hawker is of what is called the old school  of a very ancient school and one that is likely to continue though it may not be generally attended  i am afraid mr john effingham that i shall be like a fish out of water in such a house i can get along very well with your mrs jarvis and with the dear young lady in the other carriage but the sort of woman you have described will be apt to jam a plain mariner like myself what in nature should i do now if she should ask me to dance a minuet  dance it agreeably to the laws of nature returned john effingham as the carriages stopped  a respectable quiet and an aged black admitted the party though even he did not announce the visiters while he held the door of the drawingroom open for them with respectful attention mrs hawker arose and advanced to meet eve and her companions and though she kissed the cousins affectionately her reception of mademoiselle viefville was so simply polite as to convince the latter she was valued on account of her services john effingham who was ten or fifteen years the junior of the old lady gallantly kissed her hand when he presented his two male companions after paying the proper attention to the greatest stranger mrs hawker turned to captain truck and said  this then is the gentleman to whose skill and courage you all owe so muchwe all owe so much i might better have saidthe commander of the montauk  i have the honour of commanding that vessel maam returned captain truck who was singularly awed by the dignified simplicity of his hostess although her quiet natural and yet finished manner which extended even to the intonation of the voice and the smallest movement were as unlike what he had expected as possible and with such passengers as she had last voyage i can only say it is a pity that she is not better off for one to take care of her  your passengers give a different account of the matter but in order that i may judge impartially do me the favour to take this chair and let me learn a few of the particulars from yourself  observing that sir george templemore had followed eve to the other side of the room mrs hawker now resumed her seat and without neglecting any to attend to one in particular or attending to one in a way to make him feel oppressed she contrived in a few minutes to make the captain forget all about the minuet and to feel much more at his ease than would have been the case with mrs jarvis in a months intercourse  in the mean time eve had crossed the room to join a lady whose smile invited her to her side this was a young slightly framed female of a pleasing countenance but who would not have been particularly distinguished in such a place for personal charms still her smile was sweet her eyes were soft and the expression of her face was what might almost be called illuminated as sir george templemore followed her eve mentioned his name to her acquaintance whom she addressed as mrs bloomfield  you are bent on perpetrating further gaiety tonight said the latter glancing at the balldresses of the two cousins are you in the colours of the houston faction or in those of the peabody  not in peagreen certainly returned eve laughingas you may see but in simple white  you intend then to be led a measure at mrs houstons it were more suitable than among the other faction  is fashion then faction in newyork inquired sir george  fractions would be a better word perhaps but we have parties in almost every thing in america in politics religion temperance speculations and taste why not in fashion  i fear we are not quite independent enough to form parties on such a subject said eve  perfectly well said miss effingham one must think a little originally let it be ever so falsely in order to get up a fashion i fear we shall have to admit our insignificance on this point you are a late arrival sir george templemore  as lately as the commencement of this month i had the honour of being a fellowpassenger with mr effingham and his family  in which voyage you suffered shipwreck captivity and famine if half we hear be true  report has a little magnified our risks we encountered some serious dangers but nothing amounting to the sufferings you have mentioned  being a married woman and having passed the crisis in which deception is not practised i expect to hear truth again said mrs bloomfield smiling i trust however you underwent enough to qualify you all for heroes and heroines and shall content myself with knowing that you are here safe and happyif she added looking inquiringly at eve one who has been educated abroad can be happy at home  one educated abroad may be happy at home though possibly not in the modes most practised by the world said eve firmly  without an opera without a court almost without society  an opera would be desirable i confess of courts i know nothing unmarried females being cyphers in europe and i hope better things than to think i shall be without society  unmarried females are considered cyphers too here provided there be enough of them with a good respectable digit at their head i assure you no one quarrels with the cyphers under such circumstances i think sir george templemore a town like this must be something of a paradox to you  might i venture to inquire the reason for this opinion  merely because it is neither one thing nor another not a capital nor yet merely a provincial place with something more than commerce in its bosom and yet with that something hidden under a bushel a good deal more than liverpool and a good deal less than london better even than edinburgh in many respects and worse than wapping in others  you have been abroad mrs bloomfield  not a foot out of my own country scarcely a foot out of my own state i have been at lake george the falls and the mountain house and as one does not travel in a balloon i saw some of the intermediate places as for all else i am obliged to go by report  it is a pity mrs bloomfield was not with us this evening at mrs jarviss said eve laughing she might then have increased her knowledge by listening to a few cantos from the epic of mr dodge  i have glanced at some of that authors wisdom returned mrs bloomfield but i soon found it was learning backwards there is a neverfailing rule by which it is easy to arrive at a travellers worth in a negative sense at least  that is a rule which may be worth knowing said the baronet as it would save much useless wear of the eyes  when one betrays a profound ignorance of his own country it is a fair presumption that he cannot be very acute in his observation of strangers mr dodge is one of these writers and a single letter fully satisfied my curiosity i fear miss effingham very inferior wares in the way of manners have been lately imported in large quantities into this country as having the tower mark on them  eve laughed but declared that sir george templemore was better qualified than herself to answer such a question  we are said to be a people of facts rather than a people of theories continued mrs bloomfield without attending to the reference of the young lady and any coin that offers passes until another that is better arrives it is a singular but a very general mistake i believe of the people of this country in supposing that they can exist under the present régime when others would fail because their opinions keep even pace with or precede the actual condition of society whereas those who have thought and observed most on such subjects agree in thinking the very reverse to be the case  this would be a curious condition for a government so purely conventional observed sir george with interest and it certainly is entirely opposed to the state of things all over europe  it is so and yet there is no great mystery in it after all accident has liberated us from trammels that still fetter you we are like a vehicle on the top of a hill which the moment it is pushed beyond the point of resistance rolls down of itself without the aid of horses one may follow with the team and hook on when it gets to the bottom but there is no such thing as keeping company with it until it arrives there  you will allow then that there is a bottom  there is a bottom to every thingto good and bad happiness and misery hope fear faith and charity even to a womans mind which i have sometimes fancied the most bottomless thing in nature there may therefore well be a bottom even to the institutions of america  sir george listened with the interest with which an englishman of his class always endeavours to catch a concession that he fancies is about to favour his own political predilections and he felt encouraged to push the subject further  and you think the political machine is rolling downwards towards this bottom he said with an interest in the answer that living in the quiet and forgetfulness of his own home he would have laughed at himself for entertaining but our sensibilities become quickened by collision and opposition is known even to create love  mrs bloomfield was quickwitted intelligent cultivated and shrewd she saw the motive at a glance and notwithstanding she saw and felt all its abuses strongly attached to the governing principle of her countrys social organization as is almost universally the case with the strongest minds and most generous hearts of the nation she was not disposed to let a stranger carry away a false impression of her sentiments on such a point  did you ever study logic sir george templemore she asked archly  a little though not enough i fear to influence my mode of reasoning or even to leave me familiar with the terms  oh i am not about to assail you with sequiturs and non sequiturs dialectics and all the mysteries of denklehre but simply to remind you there is such a thing as the bottom of a subject when i tell you we are flying towards the bottom of our institutions it is in the intellectual sense and not as you have erroneously imagined in an unintellectual sense i mean that we are getting to understand them which i fear we did not absolutely do at the commencement of the experiment  but i think you will admit that as the civilization of the country advances some material changes must occur your people cannot always remain stationary they must either go backwards or forward  up or down if you will allow me to correct your phraseology the civilization of the country in one sense at least is retrogressive and the people as they cannot go up betray a disposition to go down  you deal in enigmas and i am afraid to think i understand you  i mean merely that gallowses are fast disappearing and that the peoplele peuple you will understandbegin to accept money in both particulars i think there is a sensible change for the worse within my own recollection  mrs bloomfield then changed her manner and from using that light hearted gaiety with which she often rendered her conversation piquante and even occasionally brilliant she became more grave and explicit the subject soon turned to that of punishments and few men could have reasoned more sensibly justly or forcibly on such a subject than this slight and fragilelooking young woman without the least pedantry with a beauty of language that the other sex seldom attains and with a delicacy of discrimination and a sentiment that were strictly feminine she rendered a theme interesting that however important in itself is forbidding veiling all its odious and revolting features in the refinement and finesse of her own polished mind  eve could have listened all night and at every syllable that fell from the lips of her friend she felt a glow of triumph for she was proud of letting an intelligent foreigner see that america did contain women worthy to be ranked with the best of other countries a circumstance that they who merely frequented what is called the world she thought might be reasonably justified in distrusting in one respect she even fancied mrs bloomfields knowledge and cleverness superior to those which she had so often admired in her own sex abroad it was untrammelled equally by the prejudices incident to a factitious condition of society or by their reaction two circumstances that often obscured the sense and candour of those to whom she had so often listened with pleasure in other countries the singularly feminine tone too of all that mrs bloomfield said or thought while it lacked nothing in strength added to the charm of her conversation and increased the pleasure of those that listened  is the circle large to which mrs hawker and her friends belong asked sir george as he assisted eve and grace to cloak when they had taken leave a town which can boast of halfadozen such houses need not accuse itself of wanting society  ah there is but one mrs hawker in newyork answered grace and not many mrs bloomfields in the world it would be too much to say we have even halfadozen such houses  have you not been struck with the admirable tone of this drawing room half whispered eve it may want a little of that lofty ease that one sees among the better portion of the old princesses et duchesses which is a relic of a school that it is to be feared is going out but in its place there is a winning nature with as much dignity as is necessary and a truth that gives us confidence in the sincerity of those around us  upon my word i think mrs hawker quite fit for a duchess  you mean a duchesse said eve and yet she is without the manner that we understand by such a word mrs hawker is a lady and there can be no higher term  she is a delightful old woman cried john effingham and if twenty years younger and disposed to change her condition i should really be afraid to enter the house  my dear sir put in the captain i will make her mrs truck to morrow and say nothing of years if she could be content to take up with such an offer why sir she is no woman but a saint in petticoats i felt the whole time as if talking to my own mother and as for ships she knows more about them than i do  the whole party laughed at the strength of the captains admiration and getting into the carriages proceeded to the last of the houses they intended visiting that night  chapter v    so turns she every man the wrong side out and never gives to   truth and virtue that which simpleness and merit purchaseth    much ado about nothing  mrs houston was what is termed a fashionable woman in newyork she too was of a family of local note though of one much less elevated in the olden time than that of mrs hawker still her claims were admitted by the most fastidious on such points for a few do remain who think descent indisputable to gentility and as her means were ample and her tastes perhaps superior to those of most around her she kept what was thought a house of better tone than common even in the highest circle eve had but a slight acquaintance with her but in graces eyes mrs houstons was the place of all others that she thought might make a favourable impression on her cousin her wish that this should prove to be the case was so strong that as they drove towards the door she could not forbear from making an attempt to prepare eve for what she was to meet  although mrs houston has a very large house for newyork and lives in a uniform style you are not to expect antechambers and vast suites of rooms eve said grace such as you have been accustomed to see abroad  it is not necessary my dear cousin to enter a house of four or five windows in front to see it is not a house of twenty or thirty i should be very unreasonable to expect an italian palazzo or a parisian hotel in this good town  we are not old enough for that yet eve a hundred years hence mademoiselle viefville such things may exist here  bien sûr cest naturel  a hundred years hence as the world tends grace they are not likely to exist any where except as taverns or hospitals or manufactories but what have we to do coz with a century ahead of us young as we both are we cannot hope to live that time  grace would have been puzzled to account satisfactorily to herself for the strong desire she felt that neither of her companions should expect to see such a house as their senses so plainly told them did not exist in the place but her foot moved in the bottom of the carriage for she was not half satisfied with her cousins answer  all i mean eve she said after a pause is that one ought not to expect in a town as new as this the improvements that one sees in an older state of society  and have mademoiselle viefville or i ever been so weak as to suppose that newyork is paris or rome or vienna  grace was still less satisfied for unknown to herself she had hoped that mrs houstons ball might be quite equal to a ball in either of those ancient capitals and she was now vexed that her cousin considered it so much a matter of course that it should not be but there was no time for explanations as the carriage now stopped  the noise confusion calling out swearing and rude clamour before the house of mrs houston said little for the outdoor part of the arrangements coachmen are nowhere a particularly silent and civil class but the uncouth european peasants who have been preferred to the honours of the whip in newyork to the usual feelings of competition and contention added that particular feature of humility which is known to distinguish the beggar on horseback the imposing equipages of our party however had that effect on most of these rude brawlers which a display of wealth is known to produce on the vulgarminded and the ladies got into the house through a lane of coachmen by yielding a little to a chevau de frise of whips without any serious calamity  one hardly knows which is the most terrific said eve involuntarily as soon as the door closed on themthe noise within or the noise without  this was spoken rapidly and in french to mademoiselle viefville but grace heard and understood it and for the first time in her life she perceived that mrs houstons company was not composed of nightingales the surprise is that the discovery should have come so late  i am delighted at having got into this house said sir george who having thrown his cloak to his own servant stood with the two other gentlemen waiting the descent of the ladies from the upper room where the bad arrangements of the house compelled them to uncloak and to put aside their shawls as i am told it is the best house in town to see the other sex  to hear them would be nearer the truth perhaps returned john effingham as for pretty women one can hardly go amiss in newyork and your ears now tell you that they do not come into the world to be seen only  the baronet smiled but he was too well bred to contradict or to assent mademoiselle viefville unconscious that she was violating the proprieties walked into the rooms by herself as soon as she descended followed by eve but grace shrank to the side of john effingham whose arm she took as a step necessary even to decorum  mrs houston received her guests with ease and dignity she was one of those females that the american world calls gay in other words she opened her own house to a very promiscuous society ten or a dozen times in a winter and accepted the greater part of the invitations she got to other peoples still in most other countries as a fashionable woman she would have been esteemed a model of devotion to the duties of a wife and a mother for she paid a personal attention to her household and had actually taught all her children the lords prayer the creed and the ten commandments she attended church twice every sunday and only staid at home from the evening lectures that the domestics might have the opportunity of going which by the way they never did in her stead feminine wellmannered rich pretty of a very positive social condition and naturally kindhearted and disposed to sociability mrs houston supported by an indulgent husband who so much loved to see people with the appearance of happiness that he was not particular as to the means had found no difficulty in rising to the pinnacle of fashion and of having her name in the mouths of all those who find it necessary to talk of somebodies in order that they may seem to be somebodies themselves all this contributed to mrs houstons happiness or she fancied it did and as every passion is known to increase by indulgence she had insensibly gone on in her muchenvied career until as has just been said she reached the summit  these rooms are very crowded said sir george glancing his eyes around two very pretty little narrow drawingrooms that were beautifully not to say richly furnished one wonders that the same contracted style of building should be so very general in a town that increases as rapidly as this and where fashion has no fixed abode and land is so abundant  mrs bloomfield would tell you said eve that these houses are types of the social state of the country in which no one is permitted to occupy more than his share of ground  but there are reasonably large dwellings in the place mrs hawker has a good house and your fathers for instance would be thought so too in london even and yet i fancy you will agree with me in thinking that a good room is almost unknown in newyork  i do agree with you in this particular certainly for to meet with a good room one must go into the houses built thirty years ago we have inherited these snuggeries however england not having much to boast of in the way of houses  in the way of town residences i agree with you entirely as a whole though we have some capital exceptions still i do not think we are quite as compact as thisdo you not fancy the noise increased in consequence of its being so confined  eve laughed and shook her head quite positively  what would it be if fairly let out she said but we will not waste the precious moments but turn our eyes about us in quest of the belles grace you who are so much at home must be our cicerone and tell us which are the idols we are to worship  dîtes moi premierement que veut dire une belle à newyork demanded mademoiselle viefville apparemment tout le monde est joli  a belle mademoiselle returned john effingham is not necessarily beautiful the qualifications for the character being various and a little contradictory one may be a belle by means of money a tongue an eye a foot teeth a laugh or any other separate feature or grace though no woman was ever yet a belle i believe by means of the head considered collectively but why deal in description when the thing itself confronts us the young lady standing directly before us is a belle of the most approved stamp and silvery tone is it not miss ring grace  the answer was in the affirmative and the eyes of the whole party turned towards the subject of this remark the young lady in question was about twenty rather tall for an american woman not conspicuously handsome but like most around her of delicate features and frame and with such a physique as under proper training would have rendered her the beau idéal of feminine delicacy and gentleness she had natural spirit likewise as appeared in her clear blue eye and moreover she had the spirit to be a belle  around this young creature were clustered no less than five young men dressed in the height of the fashion all of whom seemed to be entranced with the words that fell from her lips and each of whom appeared anxious to say something clever in return they all laughed the lady most and sometimes all spoke at once notwithstanding these outbreakings miss ring did most of the talking and once or twice as a young man would gape after a most exhilarating show of merriment and discover an inclination to retreat she managed to recall him to his allegiance by some remark particularly pertinent to himself or his feelings  qui est cette dame asked mademoiselle viefville very much as one would put a similar question on seeing a man enter a church during service with his hat on  elle est demoiselle returned eve  quelle horreur  nay nay mademoiselle i shall not allow you to set up france as immaculate on this point neither said john effingham looking at the last speaker with an affected frowna young lady may have a tongue and she may even speak to a young gentleman and not be guilty of felony although i will admit that five tongues are unnecessary and that five listeners are more than sufficient for the wisdom of twenty in petticoats  cest une horreur  i dare say miss ring would think it a greater horror to be obliged to pass an evening in a row of girls unspoken to except to be asked to dance and admired only in the distance but let us take seats on that sofa and then we may go beyond the pantomime and become partakers in the sentiment of the scene  grace and eve were now led off to dance and the others did as john effingham had suggested in the eyes of the belle and her admirers they who had passed thirty were of no account and our listeners succeeded in establishing themselves quietly within earshotthis was almost at duelling distance toowithout at all interrupting the regular action of the piece we extract a little of the dialogue by way of giving a more dramatic representation of the scene  do you think the youngest miss danvers beautiful asked the belle while her eye wandered in quest of a sixth gentleman to entertain as the phrase is in my opinion she is absolutely the prettiest female in mrs houstons rooms this night  the young men one and all protested against this judgment and with perfect truth for miss ring was too original to point out charms that every one could see  they say it will not be a match between her and mr egbert after every body has supposed it settled so long what is your opinion mr edson  this timely question prevented mr edsons retreat for he had actually got so far in this important evolution as to have gaped and turned his back recalled as it were by the sound of the bugle mr edson was compelled to say something a sore affliction to him always  oh im quite of your way of thinking they have certainly courted too long to think of marrying  i detest long courtships they must be perfect antidotes to love are they not mr moreland  a truant glance of mr morelands eye was rebuked by this appeal and instead of looking for a place of refuge he now merely looked sheepish he however entirely agreed with the young lady as the surer way of getting out of the difficulty  pray mr summerfield how do you like the last hajjimiss eve effingham to my notion she is prettyish though by no means as well as her cousin miss van cortlandt who is really rather good looking  as eve and grace were the two most truly lovely young women in the rooms this opinion as well as the loud tone in which it was given startled mademoiselle viefville quite as much as the subjects that the belle had selected for discussion she would have moved as listening to a conversation that was not meant for their ears but john effingham quietly assured her that miss ring seldom spoke in company without intending as many persons as possible to hear her  miss effingham is very plainly dressed for an only daughter continued the young lady though that lace of her cousins is real point ill engage it cost every cent of ten dollars a yard they are both engaged to be married i hear  ciel exclaimed mademoiselle viefville  oh that is nothing observed john effingham coolly wait a moment and youll hear that they have been privately married these six months if indeed you hear no more  of course this is but an idle tale said sir george templemore with a concern which in despite of his good breeding compelled him to put a question that under other circumstances would scarcely have been permissible  as true as the gospel but listen to the bell it is ringing for the good of the whole parish  the affair between miss effingham and mr morpeth who knew her abroad i understand is entirely broken off some say the father objected to mr morpeths want of fortune others that the lady was fickle while some accuse the gentleman of the same vice dont you think it shocking to jilt in either sex mr mosely  the retiring mr mosely was drawn again within the circle and was obliged to confess that he thought it was very shocking in either sex to jilt  if i were a man continued the belle i would never think of a young woman who had once jilted a lover to my mind it bespeaks a bad heart and a woman with a bad heart cannot make a very amiable wife  what an exceedingly clever creature she is whispered mr mosely to mr moreland and he now made up his mind to remain and be entertained some time longer  i think poor mr morpeth greatly to be pitied for no man would be so silly as to be attentive seriously to a lady without encouragement encouragement is the ne plus ultra of courtship are you not of my opinion mr walworth  mr walworth was number five of the entertainees and he did understand latin of which the young lady though fond of using scraps knew literally nothing he smiled an assent therefore and the belle felicitated herself in having entertained him effectually nor was she mistaken  indeed they say miss effingham had several affairs of the heart while in europe but it seems she was unfortunate in them all  mais ceci est trop fort je ne peux plus écouter  my dear mademoiselle compose yourself the crisis is not yet arrived by any means  i understand she still corresponds with a german baron and an italian marquis though both engagements are absolutely broken off some people say she walks into company alone unsupported by any gentleman by way of announcing a firm determination to remain single for life  a common exclamation from the young men proclaimed their disapprobation and that night three of them actually repeated the thing as a well established truth and two of the three failing of something better to talk about also announced that eve was actually engaged to be married  there is something excessively indelicate in a young ladys moving about a room without having a gentlemans arm to lean on i always feel as if such a person was out of her place and ought to be in the kitchen  but miss ring what wellbred person does it sputtered mr moreland no one ever heard of such a thing in good society tis quite shocking altogether unprecedented  it strikes me as being excessively coarse  oh manifestly quite rustic exclaimed mr edson  what can possibly be more vulgar added mr walworth  i never heard of such a thing among the right sort said mr mosely  a young lady who can be so brazen as to come into a room without a gentlemans arm to lean on is in my judgment at least but indifferently educated hajji or no hajji mr edson have you ever felt the tender passion i know you have been desperately in love once at least do describe to me some of the symptoms in order that i may know when i am seriously attacked myself by the disease  mais ceci est ridicule lenfant sest sauvée du charenton de new york  from the nursery rather mademoiselle you perceive she does not yet know how to walk alone  mr edson now protested that he was too stupid to feel a passion as intellectual as love and that he was afraid he was destined by nature to remain as insensible as a block  one never knows mr edson said the young lady encouragingly several of my acquaintances who thought themselves quite safe have been seized suddenly and though none have actually died more than one has been roughly treated i assure you  here the young men one and all protested that she was excessively clever then succeeded a pause for miss ring was inviting with her eyes a number six to join the circle her ambition being dissatisfied with five entertainees as she saw that miss trumpet a rival belle had managed to get exactly that number also in the other room all the gentlemen availed themselves of the cessation in wit to gape and mr edson took the occasion to remark to mr summerfield that he understood lots had been sold in seven hundredth street that morning as high as two hundred dollars a lot  the quadrille now ended and eve returned towards her friends as she approached the whole party compared her quiet simple feminine and yet dignified air with the restless beaucatching and worldly look of the belle and wondered by what law of nature or of fashion the one could possibly become the subject of the others comments eve never appeared better than that evening her dress had all the accuracy and finish of a parisian toilette being equally removed from exaggeration and neglect and it was worn with the ease of one accustomed to be elegantly attired and yet never decked with finery her step even was that of a lady having neither the mincing tread of a paris grisette a manner that sometimes ascends even to the bourgeoise the march of a cockneyess nor the tiptoe swing of a belle but it was the natural though regulated step of a trained and delicate woman walk alone she could certainly and always did except on those occasions of ceremony that demanded a partner her countenance across which an unworthy thought had never left a trace was an index too to the purity high principles and womanly self respect that controlled all her acts and in these particulars was the very reverse of the feverish halfhoydenish halfaffected expression of that of miss ring  they may say what they please muttered captain truck who had been a silent but wondering listener of all that passed she is worth as many of them as could be stowed in the montauks lower hold  miss ring perceiving eve approach was desirous of saying something to her for there was an éclat about a hajji after all that rendered an acquaintance or even an intimacy desirable and she smiled and curtsied eve returned the salutation but as she did not care to approach a group of six of which no less than five were men she continued to move towards her own party this reserve compelled miss ring to advance a step or two when eve was obliged to stop curtsying to her partner she thanked him for his attention relinquished his arm and turned to meet the lady at the same instant the five entertainees escaped in a body equally rejoiced at their release and proud of their captivity  i have been dying to come and speak to you miss effingham commenced miss ring but these five giants she emphasized the word we have put in italics so beset me that escape was quite impossible there ought to be a law that but one gentleman should speak to a lady at a time  i thought there was such a law already said eve quietly  you mean in good breeding but no one thinks of those antiquated laws nowadays are you beginning to be reconciled a little to your own country  it is not easy to effect a reconciliation where there has been no misunderstanding i hope i have never quarrelled with my country or my country with me  oh it is not exactly that i mean cannot one need a reconciliation without a quarrel what do you say to this mr edson  miss ring having detected some symptoms of desertion in the gentleman addressed had thrown in this question by way of recal when turning to note its effect she perceived that all of her clientelle had escaped a look of surprise and mortification and vexation it was not in her power to suppress and then came one of horror  how conspicuous we have made ourselves and it is all my fault she said for the first time that evening permitting her voice to fall to a becoming tone why here we actually are two ladies conversing together and no gentleman near us  is that being conspicuous asked eve with a simplicity that was entirely natural  i am sure miss effingham one who has seen as much of society as you can scarcely ask that question seriously i do not think i have done so improper a thing since i was fifteen and dear me dear me how to escape is the question you have permitted your partner to go and i do not see a gentleman of my acquaintance near us to give me his arm  as your distress is occasioned by my company said eve it is fortunately in my power to relieve it thus saying she quietly walked across the room and took her seat next to mademoiselle viefville  miss ring held up her hands in amazement and then fortunately perceiving one of the truants gaping at no great distance she beckoned him to her side  have the goodness to give me your arm mr summerfield she said i am dying to get out of this unpleasantly conspicuous situation but you are the first gentleman that has approached me this twelvemonth i would not for the world do so brazen a thing as miss effingham has just achieved would you believe it she positively went from this spot to her seat quite alone  the hajjis are privileged  they make themselves so but every body knows how bold and unwomanly the french females are one could wish notwithstanding that our own people would not import their audacious usages into this country  it is a thousand pities that mr clay in his compromise neglected to make an exception against that article a tariff on impudence would not be at all sectional  it might interfere with the manufacture at home notwithstanding said john effingham for the lungs were strong and the rooms of mrs houston so small that little was said that evening which was not heard by any who chose to listen but miss ring never listened it being no part of the vocation of a belle to perform that inferior office and sustained by the protecting arm of mr summerfield she advanced more boldly into the crowd where she soon contrived to catch another group of even six entertainees as for mr summerfield he lived a twelvemonth on the reputation of the exceedingly clever thing he had just uttered  there come ned and aristabulus said john effingham as soon as the tones of miss rings voice were lost in the din of fifty others pitched to the same key a present mademoiselle je vais nous venger  as john effingham uttered this he took captain truck by the arm and went to meet his cousin and the land agent the latter he soon separated from mr effingham and with this new recruit he managed to get so near to miss ring as to attract her attention although fifty john effingham was known to be a bachelor well connected and to have twenty thousand a year in addition he was well preserved and singularly handsome besides having an air that set all pretending gentility at defiance these were qualities that no belle despised and illassorted matches were moreover just coming into fashion in newyork miss ring had an intuitive knowledge that he wished to speak to her and she was not slow in offering the opportunity the superior tone of john effingham his caustic wit and knowledge of the world dispersed the five beaux incontinently these persons having a natural antipathy to every one of the qualities named  i hope you will permit me to presume on an acquaintance that extends back as far as your grandfather miss ring he said to present two very intimate friends mr bragg and mr truck gentlemen who will well reward the acquaintance  the lady bowed graciously for it was a matter of conscience with her to receive every man with a smile she was still too much in awe of the master of ceremonies to open her batteries of attack but john effingham soon relieved her by affecting a desire to speak to another lady the belle had now the two strangers to herself and having heard that the effinghams had an englishman of condition as a companion who was travelling under a false name she fancied herself very clever in detecting him at once in the person of aristabulus while by the aid of a lively imagination she thought mr truck was his travelling mentor and a divine of the church of england the incognito she was too well bred to hint at though she wished both the gentlemen to perceive that a belle was not to be mystified in this easy manner indeed she was rather sensitive on the subject of her readiness in recognizing a man of fashion under any circumstances and to let this be known was her very first object as soon as she was relieved from the presence of john effingham  you must be struck with the unsophisticated nature and the extreme simplicity of our society mr bragg she said looking at him significantly we are very conscious it is not what it might be but do you not think it pretty well for beginners  now mr bragg had an entire consciousness that he had never seen any society that deserved the name before this very night but he was supported in giving his opinions by that secret sense of his qualifications to fill any station which formed so conspicuous a trait in his character and his answer was given with an àplomb that would have added weight to the opinion of the veriest élégant of the chaussée dantin  it is indeed a good deal unsophisticated he said and so simple that any body can understand it i find but a single fault with this entertainment which is in all else the perfection of elegance in my eyes and that is that there is too little room to swing the legs in dancing  indeedi did not expect thatis it not the best usage of europe now to bring a quadrille into the very minimum of space  quite the contrary miss all good dancing requires evolutions the dancing dervishes for instance would occupy quite as much space as both of these sets that are walking before us and i believe it is now generally admitted that all good dancing needs room for the legs  we necessarily get a little behind the fashions in this distant country pray sir is it usual for ladies to walk alone in society  woman was not made to move through life alone miss returned aristabulus with a sentimental glance of the eye for he never let a good opportunity for preferment slip through his fingers and failing of miss effingham or miss van cortlandt of whose estates and connections he had some pretty accurate notions it struck him miss ring might possibly be a very eligible connection as all was grist that came to his mill this i believe is an admitted truth  by life you mean matrimony i suppose  yes miss a man always means matrimony when he speaks to a young lady  this rather disconcerted miss ring who picked her nosegay for she was not accustomed to hear gentlemen talk to ladies of matrimony but ladies to talk to gentlemen recovering her selfpossession however she said with a promptitude that did the school to which she belonged infinite credit  you speak sir like one having experience  certainly miss i have been in love ever since i was ten years old i may say i was born in love and hope to die in love  this a little outheroded herod but the belle was not a person to be easily daunted on such a subject she smiled graciously therefore and continued the conversation with renewed spirit  you travelled gentleman get odd notions she said and more particularly on such subjects i always feel afraid to discuss them with foreigners though with my own countrymen i have few reserves pray mr truck are you satisfied with americado you find it the country you expected to see  certainly marm for so they pronounced this word in the river and the captain cherished his first impressions when we sailed from portsmouth i expected that the first land we should make would be the highlands of navesink and although a little disappointed i have had the satisfaction of laying eyes on it at last  disappointment i fear is the usual fate of those who come from the other side is this dwelling of mrs houstons equal to the residence of an english nobleman mr bragg  considerably better miss especially in the way of republican comfort  miss ring like all belles detested the word republican their vocation being clearly to exclusion and she pouted a little affectedly  i should distrust the quality of such comfort sir she said with point but are the rooms at all comparable with the rooms in apsley house for instance  my dear miss apsley house is a tollgate lodge compared to this mansion i doubt if there be a dwelling in all england half as magnificentindeed i cannot imagine any thing more brilliant and rich  aristabulus was not a man to do things by halves and it was a point of honour with him to know something of every thing it is true he no more could tell where apsley house is or whether it was a tavern or a gaol than he knew half the other things on which he delivered oracular opinions but when it became necessary to speak he was not apt to balk conversation from any ignorance real or affected the opinion he had just given it is true had a little surpassed miss rings hopes for the next thing in her ambition to being a belle and of entertaining gentlemen was to fancy she was running her brilliant career in an orbit of fashion that lay parallel to that of the nobility and gentry of great britain  well this surpasses my hopes she said although i was aware we are nearly on a level with the more improved tastes of europe still i thought we were a little inferior to that part of the world yet  inferior miss that is a word that should never pass your lips you are inferior to nothing whether in europe or america asia or africa  as miss ring had been accustomed to do most of the flattering herself as behoveth a belle she began to be disconcerted with the directness of the compliments of aristabulus who was disposed to make hay while the sun shines and she turned in a little confusion to the captain by way of relief we say confusion for the young lady although so liable to be misunderstood was not actually impudent but merely deceived in the relations of things or in other words by some confusion in usages she had hitherto permitted herself to do that in society which female performers sometimes do on the stage enact the part of a man  you should tell mr bragg sir she said with an appealing look at the captain that flattery is a dangerous vice and one altogether unsuited to a christian  it is indeed marm and one that i never indulge in no one under my orders can accuse me of flattery  by under orders miss ring understood curates and deacons for she was aware the church of england had clerical distinctions of this sort that are unknown in america  i hope sir you do not intend to quit this country without favouring us with a discourse  not i marmi am discoursing pretty much from morning till night when among my own people though i own that this conversing rather puts me out of my reckoning let me get my foot on the planks i love with an attentive audience and a good cigar in my mouth and ill hold forth with any bishop in the universe  a cigar exclaimed miss ring in surprise do gentlemen of your profession use cigars when on duty  does a parson take his fees why miss there is not a man among us who does not smoke from morning till night  surely not on sundays  two for one on those days more than on any other  and your people sir what do they do all this time  why marm most of them chew and those that dont if they cannot find a pipe have a dull time of it for my part i shall hardly relish the good place itself if cigars are prohibited  miss ring was surprised but she had heard that the english clergy were more free than our own and then she had been accustomed to think every thing english of the purest water a little reflection reconciled her to the innovation and the next day at a dinner party she was heard defending the usage as a practice that had a precedent in the ancient incense of the altar at the moment however she was dying to impart her discoveries to others and she kindly proposed to the captain and aristabulus to introduce them to some of her acquaintances as they must find it dull being strangers to know no one introductions and cigars were the captains hobbies and he accepted the offer with joy aristabulus uniting cordially in the proposition as he fancied he had a right under the constitution of the united states of america to be introduced to every human being with whom he came in contact  it is scarcely necessary to say how much the party with whom the two neophytes in fashion had come enjoyed all this though they concealed their amusement under the calm exterior of people of the world from mr effingham the mystification was carefully concealed by his cousin as the former would have felt it due to mrs houston a wellmeaning but silly woman to put an end to it eve and grace laughed as merry girls would be apt to laugh at such an occurrence and they danced the remainder of the evening with lighter hearts than ever at one the company retired in the same informal manner as respects announcements and the calling of carriages as that in which they had entered most to lay their drowsy heads on their pillows and miss ring to ponder over the superior manners of a polished young englishman and to dream of the fragrance of a sermon that was preserved in tobacco  chapter vi    marry our play is the most lamentable comedy and most cruel   death of pyramus and thisby    peter quince  our task in the way of describing town society will soon be ended the gentlemen of the effingham family had been invited to meet sir george templemore at one or two dinners to which the latter had been invited in consequence of his letters most of which were connected with his pecuniary arrangements as one of these entertainments was like all the rest of the same character a very brief account of it will suffice to let the reader into the secret of the excellence of the genus  a wellspread board excellent viands highly respectable cookery and delicious wines were every where met two rows of men clad in dark dresses a solitary female at the head of the table or if fortunate with a supporter of the same sex near her invariably composed the convives the exaggerations of a province were seen ludicrously in one particular custom the host or perhaps it might have been the hostess had been told there should be a contrast between the duller light of the receptionroom and the brilliancy of the table and john effingham actually hit his legs against a stool in floundering through the obscurity of the first drawingroom he entered on one of the occasions in question  when seated at table the first great duty of restauration performed the conversation turned on the prices of lots speculations in towns or the currency after this came the regular assay of wines during which it was easy to fancy the master of the house a dealer for he usually sat either sucking a syphon or flourishing a corkscrew the discourse would now have done credit to the annual meeting and dinner of the german exporters assembled at rudesheim to bid for the article  sir george was certainly on the point of forming a very erroneous judgment concerning the country when mr effingham extricated him from this set and introduced him properly into his own here indeed while there was much to strike a european as peculiar and even provincial the young baronet fared much better he met with the same quality of table relieved by an intelligence that was always respectable and a manliness of tone which if not unmixed had the great merit of a simplicity and nature that are not always found in more sophisticated circles the occasional incongruities struck them all more than the positive general faults and sir george templemore did justice to the truth by admitting frankly the danger he had been in of forming a too hasty opinion  all this time which occupied a month the young baronet got to be more and more intimate in hudson square eve gradually becoming more frank and unreserved with him as she grew sensible that he had abandoned his hopes of success with herself and grace gradually more cautious and timid as she became conscious of his power to please and the interest he took in herself  it might have been three days after the ball at mrs houstons that most of the family was engaged to look in on a mrs legend a lady of what was called a literary turn sir george having been asked to make one of their party aristabulus was already returned to his duty in the country where we shall shortly have occasion to join him but an invitation had been sent to mr truck under the general erroneous impression of his real character  taste whether in the arts literature or any thing else is a natural impulse like love it is true both may be cultivated and heightened by circumstances but the impulses must be voluntary and the flow of feeling or of soul as it has become a law to style it is not to be forced or commanded to come and go at will this is the reason that all premeditated enjoyments connected with the intellect are apt to baffle expectations and why academies literary clubs coteries and dinners are commonly dull it is true that a body of clever people may be brought together and if left to their own impulses the characters of their mind will show themselves wit will flash and thought will answer thought spontaneously but every effort to make the stupid agreeable by giving a direction of a pretending intellectual nature to their efforts is only rendering dullness more conspicuous by exhibiting it in contrast with what it ought to be to be clever as a bad picture is rendered the more conspicuous by an elaborate and gorgeous frame  the latter was the fate of most of mrs legends literary evenings at which it was thought an illustration to understand even one foreign language but it was known that eve was skilled in most of the european tongues and the good lady not feeling that such accomplishments are chiefly useful as a means looked about her in order to collect a set among whom our heroine might find some one with whom to converse in each of her dialects little was said about it it is true but great efforts were made to cause this evening to be memorable in the annals of conversazioni  in carrying out this scheme nearly all the wits writers artists and literati as the most incorrigible members of the book clubs were styled in newyork were pressingly invited to be present aristabulus had contrived to earn such a reputation for the captain on the night of the ball that he was universally called a man of letters and an article had actually appeared in one of the papers speaking of the literary merits of the hon and rev mr truck a gentleman travelling in our country from whose liberality and just views an account of our society was to be expected that should at last do justice to our national character with such expectations then every true american and americaness was expected to be at his or her post for the solemn occasion it was a rally of literature in defence of the institutionsno not of the institutions for they were left to take care of themselvesbut of the social character of the community  alas it is easier to feel high aspirations on such subjects in a provincial town than to succeed for merely calling a place an emporium is very far from giving it the independence high tone condensed intelligence and tastes of a capital poor mrs legend desirous of having all the tongues duly represented was obliged to invite certain dealers in gin from holland a german linen merchant from saxony an italian cavaliero who amused himself in selling beads and a spanish master who was born in portugal all of whom had just one requisite for conversation in their respective languages and no more but such assemblies were convened in paris and why not in newyork  we shall not stop to dwell on the awful sensations with which mrs legend heard the first ring at her door on the eventful night in question it was the precursor of the entrance of miss annual as regular a devotee of letters as ever conned a primer the meeting was sentimental and affectionate before either had time however to disburthen her mind of one half of its prepared phrases ring upon ring proclaimed more company and the rooms were soon as much sprinkled with talent as a modern novel with jests among those who came first appeared all the foreign corps for the refreshments entered as something into the account with them every blue of the place whose social position in the least entitled her to be seen in such a house mrs legend belonging quite positively to good society  the scene that succeeded was very characteristic a professed genius does nothing like other people except in cases that require a display of talents in all minor matters he or she is sui generis for sentiment is in constant ebullition in their souls this being what is meant by the flow of that part of the human system  we might here very well adopt the homeric method and call the roll of heroes and heroines in what the french would term a catalogue raisonnée but our limits compel us to be less ambitions and to adopt a simpler mode of communicating facts among the ladies who now figured in the drawingroom of mrs legend besides miss annual were miss monthly mrs economy srp marion longinus julietta herodotus dove and mrs demonstration besides many others of less note together with at least a dozen female hajjis whose claims to appear in such society were pretty much dependent on the fact that having seen pictures and statues abroad they necessarily must have the means of talking of them at home the list of men was still more formidable in numbers if not in talents at its head stood steadfast dodge esquire whose fame as a male hajji had so far swollen since mrs jarviss réunion that for the first time in his life he now entered one of the better houses of his own country then there were the authors of lapis lazuli the aunts the reformed the conformed the transformed and the deformed with the editors of the hebdomad the night cap the chrysalis the real maggot and the seek no further as also junius junius brutus lucius junius brutus captain kant florio the author of the history of billy linkum tweedle the celebrated pottawattamie prophet single rhyme a genius who had prudently rested his fame in verse on a couplet composed of one line besides divers amateurs and connoisseurs hajjis who must be men of talents as they had acquired all they knew very much as american eclipse gained his laurels on the turf that is to say by a free use of the whip and spur  as mrs legend sailed about her rooms amid such a circle her mind expanded her thoughts diffused themselves among her guests on the principle of animal magnetism and her heart was melting with the tender sympathies of congenial tastes she felt herself to be at the head of american talents and in the secret recesses of her reason she determined that did even the fate of sodom and gomorrah menace her native town as some evil disposed persons had dared to insinuate might one day be the case here was enough to save it from destruction  it was just as the mistress of the mansion had come to this consoling conclusion that the party from hudson square rang as few of her guests came in carriages mrs legend who heard the rolling of wheels felt persuaded that the lion of the night was now indeed at hand and with a view to a proper reception she requested the company to divide itself into two lines in order that he might enter as it were between lanes of genius  it may be necessary to explain at this point of our narrative that john effingham was perfectly aware of the error which existed in relation to the real character of captain truck wherein he thought great injustice had been done the honest seaman and the old man intending to sail for london next morning had persuaded him to accept this invitation in order that the public mind might be disabused in a matter of so much importance with a view that this might be done naturally and without fuss however he did not explain the mistake to his nautical friend believing it most probable that this could be better done incidentally as it were in the course of the evening and feeling certain of the force of that wholesome apothegm which says that truth is powerful and must prevail if this be so added john effingham in his explanations to eve there can be no place where the sacred quality will be so likely to assert itself as in a galaxy of geniuses whose distinctive characteristic is an intuitive perception of things in their real colours  when the door of mrs legends drawingroom opened in the usual noiseless manner mademoiselle viefville who led the way was startled at finding herself in the precise situation of one who is condemned to run the gauntlet fortunately she caught a glimpse of mrs legend posted at the other end of the proud array inviting her with smiles to approach the invitation had been to a literary fête and mademoiselle viefville was too much of a frenchwoman to be totally disconcerted at a little scenic effect on the occasion of a fête of any sort supposing she was now a witness of an american ceremony for the first time for the want of representation in the country had been rather a subject of animadversion with her she advanced steadily towards the mistress of the house bestowing smile for smile this being a part of the programme at which a parisienne was not easily outdone eve followed as usual sola grace came next then sir george then john effingham the captain bringing up the rear there had been a friendly contest for the precedency between the two last each desiring to yield it to the other on the score of merit but the captain prevailed by declaring that he was navigating an unknown sea and that he could do nothing wiser than to sail in the wake of so good a pilot as mr john effingham  as hajjis of approved experience the persons who led the advance in this little procession were subjects of a proper attention and respect but as the admiration of mere vulgar travelling would in itself be vulgar care was taken to reserve the condensed feeling of the company for the celebrated english writer and wit who was known to bring up the rear this was not a common house in which dollars had place or belles rioted but the temple of genius and every one felt an ardent desire to manifest a proper homage to the abilities of the established foreign writer that should be in exact proportion to their indifference to the twenty thousand a year of john effingham and to the nearly equal amount of eves expectations  the personal appearance of the honest tar was well adapted to the character he was thus called on so unexpectedly to support his hair had long been getting grey but the intense anxiety of the chase of the wreck and of his other recent adventures had rapidly but effectually increased this mark of time and his head was now nearly as white as snow the hale fresh red of his features which was in truth the result of exposure might very well pass for the tint of port and his tread which had always a little of the quarterdeck swing about it might quite easily be mistaken by a tyro for the human frame staggering under a load of learning unfortunately for those who dislike mystifications the captain had consulted john effingham on the subject of the toilette and that kind and indulgent friend had suggested the propriety of appearing in black small clothes for the occasion a costume that he often wore himself of an evening reality in this instance then did not disappoint expectation and the burst of applause with which the captain was received was accompanied by a general murmur in commendation of the admirable manner in which he looked the character  what a byronic head whispered the author of the transformed to dove and was there ever such a curl of the lip before to mortal man  the truth is the captain had thrust his tobacco into an aside as a monkey is known to empocher a spare nut or a lump of sugar  do you think him byronicto my eye the cast of his head is shaksperian rather though i confess there is a little of milton about the forehead  pray said miss annual to lucius junius brutus which is commonly thought to be the best of his works that on aaaor that on e ee  now so it happened that not a soul in the room but the lion himself had any idea what books he had written and he knew only of some fifteen or twenty logbooks it was generally understood that he was a great english writer and this was more than sufficient  i believe the world generally prefers the aaa said lucius junius brutus but the few give a decided preference to the ee e  oh out of all question preferable exclaimed half a dozen in hearing  with what a classical modesty he pays his compliments to mrs legend observed s r pone can always tell a man of real genius by his tenu  he is so english cried florio ah they are the only people after all  this florio was one of those geniuses who sigh most for the things that they least possess  by this time captain truck had got through with listening to the compliments of mrs legend when he was seized upon by a circle of rabid literati who badgered him with questions concerning his opinions notions inferences experiences associations sensations sentiments and intentions in a way that soon threw the old man into a profuse perspiration fifty times did he wish from the bottom of his soul that soul which the crowd around him fancied dwelt so nigh in the clouds that he was seated quietly by the side of mrs hawker who he mentally swore was worth all the literati in christendom but fate had decreed otherwise and we shall leave him to his fortune for a time and return to our heroine and her party  as soon as mrs legend had got through with her introductory compliments to the captain she sought eve and grace with a consciousness that a few civilities were now their due  i fear miss effingham after the elaborate soirées of the literary circles in paris you will find our réunions of the same sort a little dull and yet i flatter myself with having assembled most of the talents of newyork on this memorable occasion to do honour to your friend are you acquainted with many of the company  now eve had never seen nor ever heard of a single being in the room with the exception of mr dodge and her own party before this night although most of them had been so laboriously employed in puffing each other into celebrity for many weary years and as for elaborate soirées she thought she had never seen one half as elaborate as this of mrs legends as it would not very well do however to express all this in words she civilly desired the lady to point out to her some of the most distinguished of the company  with the greatest pleasure miss effingham mrs legend taking pride in dwelling on the merits of her gueststhis heavy grand looking personage in whose air one sees refinement and modesty at a glance is captain kant the editor of one of our most decidedly pious newspapers his mind is distinguished for its intuitive perception of all that is delicate reserved and finished in the intellectual world while in opposition to this quality which is almost feminine his character is just as remarkable for its unflinching love of truth he was never known to publish a falsehood and of his foreign correspondence in particular he is so exceedingly careful that he assures me he has every word of it written under his own eye  on the subject of his religious scruples added john effingham he is so fastidiously exact that i hear he says grace over every thing that goes from his press and returns thanks for every thing that comes to it  you know him mr effingham by this remark is he not truly a man of a vocation  that indeed he is maam he may be succinctly said to have a newspaper mind as he reduces every thing in nature or art to news and commonly imparts to it so much of his own peculiar character that it loses all identity with the subjects to which it originally belonged one scarcely knows which to admire most about this man the atmospheric transparency of his motives for he is so disinterested as seldom even to think of paying for a dinner when travelling and yet so conscientious as always to say something obliging of the tavern as soon as he gets homehis rigid regard to facts or the exquisite refinement and delicacy that he imparts to every thing he touches over all this too he throws a beautiful halo of morality and religion never even prevaricating in the hottest discussion unless with the unction of a saint  do you happen to know florio asked mrs legend a little distrusting john effinghams account of captain kant  if i do it must indeed be by accident what are his chief characteristics maam  sentiment pathos delicacy and all in rhyme too you no doubt have heard of his triumph over lord byron miss effingham  eve was obliged to confess that it was new to her  why byron wrote an ode to greece commencing with the isles of greece the isles of greece a very feeble line as any one will see for it contained a useless and an unmeaning repetition  and you might add vulgar too mrs legend said john effingham since it made a palpable allusion to all those vulgar incidents that associate themselves in the mind with these said commonplace isles the arts philosophy poetry eloquence and even old homer are brought unpleasantly to ones recollection by such an indiscreet invocation  so florio thought and by way of letting the world perceive the essential difference between the base and the pure coin he wrote an ode on england which commenced as such an ode should  do you happen to recollect any of it maam  only the first line which i greatly regret as the rhyme is florios chief merit but this line is of itself sufficient to immortalize a man  do not keep us in torment dear mrs legend but let us have it of heavens sake  it began in this sublime strain sirbeyond the wavebeyond the wave now miss effingham that is what i call poetry  and well you may maam returned the gentleman who perceived eve could scarce refrain from breaking out in a very unsentimental mannerso much pathos  and so sententious and flowing  condensing a journey of three thousand miles as it might be into three words and a note of admiration i trust it was printed with a note of admiration mrs legend  yes sir with twoone behind each waveand such waves mr effingham  indeed maam you may say so one really gets a grand idea of them england lying beyond each  so much expressed in so few syllables  i think i see every shoal current ripple rock island and whale between sandy hook and the lands end  he hints at an epic  pray god he may execute one let him make haste too or he may get behind the age behind the age  here the lady was called away to receive a guest  cousin jack  eve effingham  do you not sometimes fear offending  not a woman who begins with expressing her admiration of such a sublime thing as this you are safe with such a person any where short of a tweak of the nose  mais tout ceci est bien drôle  you never were more mistaken in your life mademoiselle every body here looks upon it as a matter of life and death  the new guest was mr pindar one of those careless unsentimental fellows that occasionally throw off an ode that passes through christendom as dollars are known to pass from china to norway and yet who never fancied spectacles necessary to his appearance solemnity to his face nor soirées to his renown after quitting mrs legend he approached eve to whom he was slightly known and accosted her  this is the region of taste miss effingham he said with a shrug of the jaw if such a member can shrug and i do not wonder at finding you here  he then chatted pleasantly a moment with the party and passed on giving an ominous gape as he drew nearer to the oi polloi of literature a moment after appeared mr gray a man who needed nothing but taste in the public and the encouragement that would follow such a taste to stand at or certainty near the head of the poets of our own time he too looked shily at the galaxy and took refuge in a corner mr pith followed a man whose caustic wit needs only a sphere for its exercise manners to portray and a society with strong points about it to illustrate in order to enrol his name high on the catalogue of satirists another ring announced mr fun a writer of exquisite humour and of finished periods but who having perpetrated a little too much sentiment was instantly seized upon by all the ultra ladies who were addicted to the same taste in that way in the room  these persons came late like those who had already been too often dosed in the same way to be impatient of repetitions the three first soon got together in a corner and eve fancied they were laughing at the rest of the company whereas in fact they were merely laughing at a bad joke of their own their quick perception of the ludicrous having pointed out a hundred odd combinations and absurdities that would have escaped duller minds  who in the name of the twelve caesars has mrs legend got to lionize yonder with the white summit and the dark base asked the writer of odes  some english pamphleteer by what i can learn answered he of satire some fellow who has achieved a pert review or written a minerva pressism and who now flourishes like a bay tree among us a modern horace or a juvenal on his travels  fun is well badgered observed mr graydo you not see that miss annual miss monthly and that young alphabet dove have got him within the circle of their petticoats where he will be martyred on a sigh  he casts tanging looks this way he wishes you to go to his rescue pith  ilet him take his fill of sentiment i am no homoepathist in such matters large doses in quick succession will soonest work a cure here comes the lion and he breaks loose from his cage like a beast that has been poked up with sticks  good evening gentlemen said captain truck wiping his face intensely and who having made his escape from a throng of admirers took refuge in the first port that offered you seem to be enjoying yourselves here in a rational and agreeable way quite cool and refreshing in this corner  and yet we have no doubt that both our reason and our amusement will receive a large increase from the addition of your society sir returned mr pithdo us the favour to take a seat i beg of you and rest yourself  with all my heart gentlemen for to own the truth these ladies make warm work about a stranger i have just got out of what i call a category  you appear to have escaped with life sir observed pindar taking a cool survey of the others person  yes thank god i have done that and it is pretty much all answered the captain wiping his face i served in the french war truxtuns war as we call itand i had a touch with the english in the privateer trade between twelve and fifteen and here quite lately i was in an encounter with the savage arabs down on the coast of africa and i account them all as so much snowballing compared with the yardarm and yardarm work of this very night i wonder if it is permitted to try a cigar at these conversationonies gentlemen  i believe it is sir returned pindar coolly shall i help you to a light  oh mr truck cried mrs legend following the chafed animal to his corner as one would pursue any other runaway instinct has brought you into this good company you are now in the very focus of american talents  having just escaped from the focus of american talons whispered pith  i must be permitted to introduce you myself mr truck mr pindar mr pith mr graygentlemen you must be so happy to be acquainted being as it were engaged in the same pursuits  the captain rose and shook each of the gentlemen cordially by the hand for he had at least the consolation of a great many introductions that night mrs legend disappeared to say something to some other prodigy  happy to meet you gentlemen said the captain in what trade do you sail  by whatever name we may call it answered mr pindarwe can scarcely be said to go before the wind  not in the injee business then or the monsoons would keep the stunsails set at least  no sirbut yonder is mr moccasin who has lately set up secundum artem in the indian business having written two novels in that way already and begun a third  are you all regularly employed gentlemen  as regularly as inspiration points said mr pith men of our occupation must make fair weather of it or we had better be doing nothing  so i often tell my owners but go ahead is the order when i was a youngster a ship remained in port for a fair wind but now she goes to work and makes one the world seems to get young as i get old  this is a rum litterateur gray whispered to pindar  it is an obvious mystification was the answer poor mrs legend has picked up some straggling porpoise and converted him by a touch of her magical wand into a boanerges of literature the thing is as clear as day for the worthy fellow smells of tar and cigar smoke i perceive that mr effingham is laughing out of the corner of his eyes and will step across the room and get the truth in a minute  the rogue was as good as his word and was soon back again and contrived to let his friends understand the real state of the case a knowledge of the captains true character encouraged this trio in the benevolent purpose of aiding the honest old seaman in his wish to smoke and pith managed to give him a lighted paper without becoming an open accessary to the plot  will you take a cigar yourself sir said the captain offering his box to mr pindar  i thank you mr truck i never smoke but am a profound admirer of the flavour let me entreat you to begin as soon as possible  thus encouraged captain truck drew two or three whiffs when the rooms were immediately filled with the fragrance of a real havana at the first discovery the whole literary pack went off on the scent as for mr fun he managed to profit by the agitation that followed in order to escape to the three wags in the corner who were enjoying the scene with the gravity of so many dervishes  as i live cried lucius junius brutus there is the author of a aaactually smoking a cigarhow excessively piquant  do my eyes deceive me or is not that the writer of eee fumigating us all whispered miss annual  nay this cannot certainly be right put in florio with a dogmatical manner all the periodicals agree that smoking is ungenteel in england  you never were more mistaken dear florio replied dove in a cooing tone the very last novel of society has a chapter in which the hero and heroine smoke in the declaration scene  do they indeedthat alters the case really one would not wish to get behind so great a nation nor yet go much before it pray captain kant what do your friends in canada say is or is not smoking permitted in good society there the canadians must at least be ahead of us  not at all sir returned the editor in his softest tones it is revolutionary and jacobinical  but the ladies prevailed and by a process that is rather peculiar to what may be called a credulous state of society they carried the day this process was simply to make one fiction authority for another the fact that smoking was now carried so far in england that the clergy actually used cigars in the pulpits was affirmed on the authority of mr truck himself and coupled with his present occupation the point was deemed to be settled even florio yielded and his plastic mind soon saw a thousand beauties in the usage that had hitherto escaped it all the literati drew round the captain in a circle to enjoy the spectacle though the honest old mariner contrived to throw out such volumes of vapour as to keep them at a safe distance his four demurelooking neighbours got behind the barrier of smoke where they deemed themselves entrenched against the assaults of sentimental petticoats for a time at least  pray mr truck inquired srp is it commonly thought in the english literary circles that byron was a developement of shakspeare or shakspeare a shadowing forth of byron  both marm said the captain with a coolness that would have done credit to aristabulus for he had been fairly badgered into impudence profiting by the occasion to knock the ashes off his cigar all incline to the first opinion and most to the last  what finesse murmured one how delicate whispered a second a dignified reserve ejaculated a third so english exclaimed florio  do you think mr truck asked dove that the profane songs of little have more pathos than the sacred songs of moore or that the sacred songs of moore have more sentiment than the profane songs of little  a good deal of both marm and something to spare i think there is little in one and more in the other  pray sir said jrp do you pronounce the name of byrons lady love guykeeohly or gwykyolee  that depends on how the wind is if on shore i am apt to say oh lee and if off shore ohlie  thats capital cried florio in an extasy of admiration what man in this country could have said as crack a thing as that  indeed it is very witty added miss monthlywhat does it mean  mean more than is seen or felt by common minds ah the english are truly a great nationhow delightfully he smokes  i think he is much the most interesting man we have had out here observed miss annual since the last bust of scott  ask him dear dove whispered julietta who was timid from the circumstance of never having published which he thinks the most ecstatic feeling hope or despair  the question was put by the more experienced lady according to request though she first said in a hurried tone to her youthful sisteryou can have felt but little child or you would know that it is despair as a matter of course  the honest captain however did not treat the matter so lightly for he improved the opportunity to light a fresh cigar throwing the still smoking stump into mrs legends grate through a lane of literati as he afterwards boasted as coolly as he could have thrown it overboard under other circumstances luckily for his reputation for sentiment he mistook ecstatic a word he had never heard before for erratic and recollecting sundry roving maniacs that he had seen he answered promptly  despair out and out  i knew it said one  its in nature added a second  all can feel its truth rejoined a third  this point may now be set down as established cried florio and i hope no more will be said about it  this is encouragement to the searchers after truth put in captain kant  pray hon and rev mr truck asked lucius junius brutus at the joint suggestion of junius brutus and brutus does the princess victoria smoke  if she did not sir where would be the use in being a princess i suppose you know that all the tobacco seized in england after a deduction to informers goes to the crown  i object to this usage remarked captain kant as irreligious french and tending to sansculotteism i am willing to admit of this distinguished instance as an exception but on all other grounds i shall maintain that it savours of infidelity to smoke the prussian government much the best of our times never smokes  this man thinks he has a monopoly of the puffing himself pindar whispered into the captains ear whiff away my dear sir and youll soon throw him into the shade  the captain winked drew out his box lighted another cigar and by way of reply to the envious remark he put one in each corner of his mouth and soon had both in full blast a state in which he kept them for near a minute  this is the very picturesque of social enjoyment exclaimed florio holding up both hands in a glow of rapture it is absolutely homeric in the way of usages ah the english are a great nation  i should like to know excessively if there was really such a person as baron munchawsen said julietta gathering courage from the success of her last question  there was miss returned the captain through his teeth and nodding his head in the affirmative a regular traveller that and one who knew him well swore to me that he hadnt related one half of what befel him  how very delightful to learn this from the highest quarter exclaimed miss monthly  is gatty goethe really dead inquired longinus or is the account we have had to that effect merely a metaphysical apotheosis of his mighty soul  dead marmstone deaddead as a doornail returned the captain who saw a relief in killing as many as possible  you have been in france mr truck beyond question observed lucius junius brutus in the way one puts a question  francei was in france before i was ten years old i know every foot of the coast from havre de grace to marseilles  will you then have the goodness to explain to us whether the soul of chattobriong is more expanded than his reason or his reason more expanded than his soul  captain truck had a very tolerable notion of baron munchausen and of his particular merits but chateaubriant was a writer of whom he knew nothing after pondering a moment and feeling persuaded that a confession of ignorance might undo him for the old man had got to be influenced by the atmosphere of the place he answered coolly  oh chattobriong is it you meanas wholesouled a fellow as i know all soul sir and lots of reason besides  how simple and unaffected  crack exclaimed florio  a thorough jacobin growled captain kant who was always offended when any one but himself took liberties with the truth  here the four wags in the corner observed that head went to head in the crowd and that the rear rank of the company began to disappear while mrs legend was in evident distress in a few minutes all the romans were off florio soon after vanished grating his teeth in a poetical frenzy and even captain kant albeit so used to look truth in the face beat a retreat the alphabet followed and even the annual and the monthly retired with leavetakings so solemn and precise that poor mrs legend was in total despair  eve foreseeing something unpleasant had gone away first and in a few minutes mr dodge who had been very active in the crowd whispering and gesticulating made his bow also the envy of this man had in fact become so intolerable that he had let the cat out of the bag no one now remained but the party entrenched behind the smoke and the mistress of the house pindar solemnly proposed to the captain that they should go and enjoy an oystersupper in company and the proposal being cordially accepted they rose in a body to take leave  a most delightful evening mrs legend said pindar with perfect truth much the pleasantest i ever passed in a house where one passes so many that are agreeable  i cannot properly express my thanks for the obligation you have conferred by making me acquainted with mr truck added gray i shall cultivate it as far as in my power for a more capital fellow never breathed  really mrs legend this has been a byronic night observed pith as he made his bow i shall long remember it and i think it deserves to be commemorated in verse  fun endeavoured to look sympathetic and sentimental though the spirit within could scarcely refrain from grinning in mrs legends face he stammered out a few compliments however and disappeared  well good night marm said captain truck offering his hand cordially this has been a pleasant evening altogether though it was warm work at first if you like ships i should be glad to show you the montauks cabins when we get back and if you ever think of europe let me recommend the london line as none of the worst well try to make you comfortable and trust to me to choose a stateroom a thing i am experienced in  not one of the wags laughed until they were fairly confronted with the oysters then indeed they burst out into a general and long fit of exuberant merriment returning to it between the courses from the kitchen like the refrain of a song captain truck who was uncommonly well satisfied with himself did not understand the meaning of all this boyishness but he has often declared since that a heartier or a funnier set of fellows he never fell in with than his four companions proved to be that night  as for the literary soirée the most profound silence has been maintained concerning it neither of the wits there assembled having seen fit to celebrate it in rhyme and florio having actually torn up an impromptu for the occasion that he had been all the previous day writing  chapter vii    there is a history in all mens lives figuring the nature of the   times deceased the which observed a man may prophesy with a near   aim of the main chance of things as yet not come to life    king henry vi  the following morning the baronet breakfasted in hudson square while at table little was said concerning the events of the past night though sundry smiles were exchanged as eye met eye and the recollection of the mystification returned grace alone looked grave for she had been accustomed to consider mrs legend a very discriminating person and she had even hoped that most of those who usually figured in her rooms were really the clever persons they laid claim to be  the morning was devoted to looking at the quarter of the town which is devoted to business a party having been made for that express purpose under the auspices of john effingham as the weather was very cold although the distances were not great the carriages were ordered and they all set off about noon  grace had given up expecting a look of admiration from eve in behalf of any of the lions of newyork her cousin having found it necessary to tell her that in a comparative sense at least little was to be said in behalf of these provincial wonders even mademoiselle viefville now that the freshness of her feelings were abated had dropped quietly down into a natural way of speaking of these things and grace who was quickwitted soon discovered that when she did make any allusions to similar objects in europe it was always to those that existed in some country town a silent convention existed therefore to speak no more on such subjects or if any thing was said it arose incidentally and as inseparable from the regular thread of the discourse  when in wall street the carriages stopped and the gentlemen alighted the severity of the weather kept the ladies in the chariot where grace endeavoured to explain things as well as she could to her companions  what are all these people running after so intently inquired mademoiselle viefville the conversation being in french but which we shall render freely into english for the sake of the general reader  dollars i believe mademoiselle am i right grace  i believe you are returned grace laughing though i know little more of this part of the town than yourself  quelle foule is that building filled with dollars into which the gentlemen are now entering its steps are crowded  that is the bourse mademoiselle and it ought to be well lined by the manner in which some who frequent it live cousin jack and sir george are going into the crowd i see  we will leave the ladies in their seats a few minutes and accompany the gentlemen on their way into the exchange  i shall now show you sir george templemore said john effingham what is peculiar to this country and what if properly improved it is truly worth a journey across the ocean to see you have been at the royal exchange in london and at the bourse of paris but you have never witnessed a scene like that which i am about to introduce you to in paris you have beheld the unpleasant spectacle of women gambling publicly in the funds but it was in driblets compared to what you will see here  while speaking john effingham led the way upstairs into the office of one of the most considerable auctioneers the walls were lined with maps some representing houses some lots some streets some entire towns  this is the focus of what aristabulus bragg calls the town trade said john effingham when fairly confronted with all these wonders here then you may suit yourself with any species of real estate that heart can desire if a villa is wanted there are a dozen of farms a hundred are in market that is merely halfadozen streets and here are towns of dimensions and value to suit purchasers  explain this it exceeds comprehension  it is simply what it professes to be mr hammer do us the favour to step this way are you selling today  not much sir only a hundred or two lots on this island and some six or eight farms with one western village  can you tell us the history of this particular piece of property mr hammer  with great pleasure mr effingham we know you to have means and hope you may be induced to purchase this was the farm of old volkert van brunt five years since off of which he and his family had made a livelihood for more than a century by selling milk two years since the sons sold it to peter feeler for a hundred an acre or for the total sum of five thousand dollars the next spring mr feeler sold it to john search as keen a one as we have for twentyfive thousand search sold it at private sale to nathan rise for fifty thousand the next week and rise had parted with it to a company before the purchase for a hundred and twelve thousand cash the map ought to be taken down for it is now eight months since we sold it out in lots at auction for the gross sum of three hundred thousand dollars as we have received our commission we look at that land as out of the market for a time  have you other property sir that affords the same wonderful history of a rapid advance in value asked the baronet  these walls are covered with maps of estates in the same predicament some have risen two or three thousand per cent within five years and some only a few hundred there is no calculating in the matter for it is all fancy  and on what is this enormous increase in value foundeddoes the town extend to these fields  it goes much farther sir that is to say on paper in the way of houses it is still some miles short of them a good deal depends on what you call a thing in this market now if old volkert van brunts property had been still called a farm it would have brought a farm price but as soon as it was surveyed into lots and mapped  mapped  yes sir brought into visible lines with feet and inches as soon as it was properly mapped it rose to its just value we have a good deal of the bottom of the sea that brings fair prices in consequence of being well mapped  here the gentlemen expressed their sense of the auctioneers politeness and retired  we will now go into the salesroom said john effingham where you shall judge of the spirit or energy as it is termed which at this moment actuates this great nation  descending they entered a crowd where scores were eagerly bidding against each other in the fearful delusion of growing rich by pushing a fancied value to a point still higher one was purchasing ragged rocks another the bottom of rivers a third a bog and all on the credit of maps our two observers remained some time silent spectators of the scene  when i first entered that room said john effingham as they left the place it appeared to me to be filled with maniacs now that i have been in it several times the impression is not much altered  and all those persons are hazarding their means of subsistence on the imaginary estimate mentioned by the auctioneer  they are gambling as recklessly as he who places his substance on the cast of the die so completely has the mania seized every one that the obvious truth a truth which is as apparent as any other law of nature that nothing can be sustained without a foundation is completely overlooked and he who should now proclaim in this building principles that bitter experience will cause every man to feel within the next few years would be happy if he escaped being stoned i have witnessed many similar excesses in the way of speculations but never an instance as gross as widespread and as alarming as this  you apprehend serious consequences then from the reaction  in that particular we are better off than older nations the youth and real stamina of the country averting much of the danger but i anticipate a terrible blow and that the day is not remote when this town will awake to a sense of its illusion what you see here is but a small part of the extravagance that exists for it pervades the whole community in one shape or another extravagant issues of papermoney inconsiderate credits that commence in europe and extend throughout the land and false notions as to the value of their possessions in men who five years since had nothing has completely destroyed the usual balance of things and money has got to be so completely the end of life that few think of it as a means the history of the world probably cannot furnish a parallel instance of an extensive country that is so absolutely under this malign influence as is the fact with our own at this present instant all principles are swallowed up in the absorbing desire for gain national honour permanent security the ordinary rules of society law the constitution and every thing that is usually so dear to men are forgotten or are perverted in order to sustain this unnatural condition of things  this is not only extraordinary but it is fearful  it is both the entire community is in the situation of a man who is in the incipient stages of an exhilarating intoxication and who keeps pouring down glass after glass in the idle notion that he is merely sustaining nature in her ordinary functions this widespread infatuation extends from the coast to the extremest frontiers of the west for while there is a justifiable foundation for a good deal of this fancied prosperity the true is so interwoven with the false that none but the most observant can draw the distinction and as usual the false predominates  by your account sir the tulip mania of holland was trifling compared to this  that was the same in principle as our own but insignificant in extent could i lead you through these streets and let you into the secret of the interests hopes infatuations and follies that prevail in the human breast you as a calm spectator would be astonished at the manner in which your own species can be deluded but let us move and something may still occur to offer an example  mr effinghami beg pardonmr effingham said a very gentlemanlylooking merchant who was walking about the hall of the exchange what do you think now of our french quarrel  i have told you mr bale all i have to say on that subject when in france i wrote you that it was not the intention of the french government to comply with the treaty you have since seen this opinion justified in the result you have the declaration of the french minister of state that without an apology from this government the money will not be paid and i have given it as my opinion that the vane on yonder steeple will not turn more readily than all this policy will be abandoned should any thing occur in europe to render it necessary or could the french ministry believe it possible for this country to fight for a principle these are my opinions in all their phases and you may compare them with facts and judge for yourself  it is all general jackson sirall that monsters doings but for his message mr effingham we should have had the money long ago  but for his message or some equally decided step mr bale you would never have it  ah my dear sir i know your intentions but i fear you are prejudiced against that excellent man the king of france prejudice mr effingham is a sad innovator on justice  here mr bale shook his head laughed and disappeared in the crowd perfectly satisfied that john effingham was a prejudiced man and that he himself was only liberal and just  now that is a man who wants for neither abilities nor honesty and yet he permits his interests and the influence of this very speculating mania to overshadow all his sense of right facts plain as noonday and the only principles that can rule a country in safety  he apprehends war and has no desire to believe even facts so long as they serve to increase the danger  precisely so for even prudence gets to be a perverted quality when men are living under an infatuation like that which now exists these men live like the fool who says there is no death  here the gentlemen rejoined the ladies and the carriages drove through a succession of narrow and crooked streets that were lined with warehouses filled with the products of the civilized world  very much of all this is a part of the same lamentable illusion said john effingham as the carriages made their way slowly through the encumbered streets the man who sells his inland lots at a profit secured by credit fancies himself enriched and he extends his manner of living in proportion the boy from the country becomes a merchant or what is here called a merchant and obtains a credit in europe a hundred times exceeding his means and caters to these fancied wants and thus is every avenue of society thronged with adventurers the ephemera of the same widespread spirit of reckless folly millions in value pass out of these streets that go to feed the vanity of those who fancy themselves wealthy because they hold some ideal pledges for the payment of advances in price like those mentioned by the auctioneer and which have some such security for the eventual payment as one can find in calling a thing that is really worth a dollar worth a hundred  are the effects of this state of things apparent in your ordinary associations  in every thing the desire to grow suddenly rich has seized on all classes even women and clergymen are infected and we exist under the active control of the most corrupting of all influencesthe love of money i should despair of the country altogether did i not feel certain that the disease is too violent to last and entertain a hope that the season of calm reflection and of repentance that is to follow will be in proportion to its causes  after taking this view of the town the party returned to hudson square where the baronet dined it being his intention to go to washington on the following day the leavetaking in the evening was kind and friendly mr effingham who had a sincere regard for his late fellowtraveller cordially inviting him to visit him in the mountains in june  as sir george took his leave the bells began to ring for a fire in newyork one gets so accustomed to these alarms that near an hour had passed before any of the effingham family began to reflect on the long continuance of the cries a servant was then sent out to ascertain the reason and his report made the matter more serious than usual  we believe that in the frequency of these calamities the question lies between constantinople and newyork it is a common occurrence for twenty or thirty buildings to be burnt down in the latter place and for the residents of the same ward to remain in ignorance of the circumstance until enlightened on the fact by the daily prints the constant repetition of the alarms hardening the ear and the feelings against the appeal a fire of greater extent than common had occurred only a night or two previously to this and a rumour now prevailed that the severity of the weather and the condition of the hoses and engines rendered the present danger double on hearing this intelligence the messrs effinghams wrapped themselves up in their overcoats and went together into the streets  this seems something more than usual ned said john effingham glancing his eye upward at the lurid vault athwart which gleams of fiery light began to shine the danger is not distant and it seems serious  following the direction of the current they soon found the scene of the conflagration which was in the very heart of those masses of warehouses or stores that john effingham had commented on so lately a short street of high buildings was already completely in flames and the danger of approaching the enemy added to the frozen condition of the apparatus the exhaustion of the firemen from their previous efforts and the intense coldness of the night conspired to make the aspect of things in the highest degree alarming  the firemen of newyork have that superiority over those of other places that the veteran soldier obtains over the recruit but the best troops can be appalled and on this memorable occasion these celebrated firemen from a variety of causes became for a time little more than passive spectators of the terrible scene  there was an hour or two when all attempts at checking the conflagration seemed really hopeless and even the boldest and the most persevering scarcely knew which way to turn to be useful a failure of water the numerous points that required resistance the conflagration extending in all directions from a common centre by means of numberless irregular and narrow streets and the impossibility of withstanding the intense heat in the choked passages soon added despair to the other horrors of the scene  they who stood the fiery masses were freezing on one side with the greenland cold of the night while their bodies were almost blistered with the fierce flames on the other there was something frightful in this contest of the elements nature appearing to condense the heat within its narrowest possible limits as if purposely to increase its fierceness the effects were awful for entire buildings would seem to dissolve at their touch as the forked flames enveloped them in sheets of fire  every one being afoot within sound of the alarm though all the more vulgar cries had ceased as men would deem it mockery to cry murder in a battle sir george templemore met his friends on the margin of this sea of fire it was now drawing towards morning and the conflagration was at its height having already laid waste a nucleus of blocks and it was extending by many lines in every possible direction  here is a fearful admonition for those who set their hearts on riches observed sir george templemore recalling the conversation of the previous day what indeed are the designs of man as compared with the will of providence  i foresee that this is le commencement de la fin returned john effingham the destruction is already so great as to threaten to bring down with it the usual safeguards against such losses and one pin knocked out of so frail and delicate a fabric the whole will become loose and fall to pieces  will nothing be done to arrest the flames  as men recover from the panic their plans will improve and their energies will revive the wider streets are already reducing the fire within more certain limits and they speak of a favourable change of wind it is thought five hundred buildings have already been consumed in scarcely half a dozen hours  that exchange which had so lately resembled a bustling temple of mammon was already a dark and sheeted ruin its marble walls being cracked defaced tottering or fallen it lay on the confines of the ruin and our party was enabled to take their position near it to observe the scene all in their immediate vicinity was assuming the stillness of desolation while the flushes of fierce light in the distance marked the progress of the conflagration those who knew the localities now began to speak of the natural or accidental barriers such as the water the slips and the broader streets as the only probable means of arresting the destruction the crackling of the flames grew distant fast and the cries of the firemen were now scarcely audible  at this period in the frightful scene a party of seamen arrived bearing powder in readiness to blow up various buildings in the streets that possessed of themselves no sufficient barriers to the advance of the flame led by their officers these gallant fellows carrying in their arms the means of destruction moved up steadily to the verge of the torrents of fire and planted their kegs laying their trains with the hardy indifference that practice can alone create and with an intelligence that did infinite credit to their coolness this deliberate courage was rewarded with complete success and house crumbled to pieces after house under the dull explosions happily without an accident  from this time the flames became less ungovernable though the day dawned and advanced and another night succeeded before they could be said to be got fairly under weeks and even months passed however ere the smouldering ruins ceased to send up smoke the fierce element continuing to burn like a slumbering volcano as it might be in the bowels of the earth  the day that succeeded this disaster was memorable for the rebuke it gave the rapacious longing for wealth men who had set their hearts on gold and who prided themselves on their possession and on that only were made to feel its insanity and they who had walked abroad as gods so lately began to experience how utterly insignificant are the merely rich when stripped of their possessions eight hundred buildings containing fabrics of every kind and the raw material in various forms had been destroyed as it were in the twinkling of an eye  a faint voice was heard from the pulpit and there was a moment when those who remembered a better state of things began to fancy that principles would once more assert their ascendency and that the community would in a measure be purified but this expectation ended in disappointment the infatuation being too widespread and corrupting to be stopped by even this check and the rebuke was reserved for a form that seems to depend on a law of nature that of causing a vice to bring with it its own infallible punishment  chapter viii    first tell me have you ever been at pisa    shakspeare  the conflagration alluded to rather than described in the proceeding chapter threw a gloom over the gaieties of newyork if that ever could be properly called gay which was little more than a strife in prodigality and parade and leaves us little more to say of the events of the winter eve regretted very little the interruption to scenes in which she had found no pleasure however much she lamented the cause and she and grace passed the remainder of the season quietly cultivating the friendship of such women as mrs hawker and mrs bloomfield and devoting hours to the improvement of their minds and tastes without ever again venturing however within the hallowed precincts of such rooms as those of mrs legend  one consequence of a state of rapacious infatuation like that which we have just related is the intensity of selfishness which smothers all recollection of the past and all just anticipations of the future by condensing life with its motives and enjoyments into the present moment captain truck therefore was soon forgotten and the literati as that worthy seaman had termed the associates of mrs legend remained just as vapid as conceited as ignorant as imitative as dependent and as provincial as ever  as the season advanced our heroine began to look with longings towards the country the town life of an american offers little to one accustomed to a town life in older and more permanently regulated communities and eve was already heartily weary of crowded and noisy balls for a few were still given belles the struggles of an uninstructed taste and a representation in which extravagance was so seldom relieved by the elegance and convenience of a condition of society in which more attention is paid to the fitness of things  the american spring is the least pleasant of its four seasons its character being truly that of winter lingering in the lap of may mr effingham who the reader will probably suspect by this time to be a descendant of a family of the same name that we have had occasion to introduce into another work had sent orders to have his country residence prepared for the reception of our party and it was with a feeling of delight that eve stepped on board a steamboat to escape from a town that while it contains so much that is worthy of any capital contains so much more that is unfit for any place in order to breathe the pure air and to enjoy the tranquil pleasare of the country sir george templemore had returned from his southern journey and made one of the party by express arrangement  now eve said grace van cortlandt as the boat glided along the wharves if it were any person but you i should feel confident of having something to show that would extort admiration  you are safe enough in that respect for a more imposing object in its way than this very vessel eye of mine never beheld it is positively the only thing that deserves the name of magnificent i have yet seen since our returnunless indeed it may be magnificent projects  i am glad dear coz there is this one magnificent object then to satisfy a taste so fastidious  as graces little foot moved and her voice betrayed vexation the whole party smiled for the whole party while it felt the justice of eves observation saw the real feeling that was at the bottom of her cousins remark sir george however though he could not conceal from himself the truth of what had been said by the one party and the weakness betrayed by the other had too much sympathy for the provincial patriotism of one so young and beautiful not to come to the rescue  you should remember miss van cortlandt he said that miss effingham has not had the advantage yet of seeing the delaware philadelphia the noble bays of the south nor so much that is to be found out of the single town of newyork  very true and i hope yet to see her a sincere penitent for all her unpatriotic admissions against her own country you have seen the capitol sir george templemore is it not truly one of the finest edifices of the world  you will except st peters surely my child observed mr effingham smiling for he saw that the baronet was embarrassed to give a ready answer  and the cathedral at milan said eve laughing  et le louvre cried mademoiselle viefville who had some such admiration for every thing parisian as eve had for every thing american  and most especially the northeast corner of the southwest end of the northwest wing of versailles said john effingham in his usual dry manner  i see you are all against me grace rejoined but i hope one day to be able to ascertain for myself the comparative merits of things as nature makes rivers i hope the hudson at least will not be found unworthy of your admiration gentlemen and ladies  you are safe enough there grace observed mr effingham for few rivers perhaps no river offers so great and so pleasing a variety in so short a distance as this  it was a lovely bland morning in the last week of may and the atmosphere was already getting the soft hues of summer or assuming the hazy and solemn calm that renders the season so quiet and soothing after the fiercer strife of the elements under such a sky the palisadoes in particular appeared well for though wanting in the terrific grandeur of an alpine nature and perhaps disproportioned to the scenery they adorned they were bold and peculiar  the great velocity of the boat added to the charm of the passage the scene scarce finding time to pall on the eye for no sooner was one object examined in its outlines than it was succeeded by another  an extraordinary taste is afflicting this country in the way of architecture said mr effingham as they stood gazing at the eastern shore nothing but a grecian temple being now deemed a suitable residence for a man in these classical times yonder is a structure for instance of beautiful proportions and at this distance apparently of a precious material and yet it seems better suited to heathen worship than to domestic comfort  the malady has infected the whole nation returned his cousin like the spirit of speculation we are passing from one extreme to the other in this as in other things one such temple well placed in a wood might be a pleasant object enough but to see a river lined with them with children trundling hoops before their doors beef carried into their kitchens and smoke issuing moreover from those unclassical objects chimnies is too much even of a high taste one might as well live in a fever mr aristabulus bragg who is a wag in his way informs me that there is one town in the interior that has actually a markethouse on the plan of the parthenon  il cupo di bove would be a more suitable model for such a structure said eve smiling but i think i have heard that the classical taste of our architects is any thing but rigid  this was the case rather than is returned john effingham as witness all these temples the country has made a quick and a great pas en avant in the way of the fine arts and the fact shows what might be done with so ready a people under a suitable direction the stranger who comes among us is apt to hold the art of the nation cheap but as all things are comparative let him inquire into its state ten years since and look at it today the fault just now is perhaps to consult the books too rigidly and to trust too little to invention for no architecture and especially no domestic architecture can ever be above serious reproach until climate the uses of the edifice and the situation are respected as leading considerations nothing can be uglier per se than a swiss cottage or any thing more beautiful under its precise circumstances as regards these mushroom temples which are the offspring of mammon let them be dedicated to whom they may i should exactly reverse the opinion and say that while nothing can be much more beautiful per se nothing can be in worse taste than to put them where they are  we shall have an opportunity of seeing what mr john effingham can do in the way of architecture said grace who loved to revenge some of her fancied wrongs by turning the tables on her assailant for i understand he has been improving on the original labours of that notorious palladio master hiram doolittle  the whole party laughed and every eye was turned on the gentleman alluded to expecting his answer  you will remember good people answered the accused by implication that my plans were handed over to me from my great predecessor and that they were originally of the composite order if therefore the house should turn out to be a little complex and mixed you will do me the justice to remember this important fact at all events i have consulted comfort and that i would maintain in the face of vitruvius himself is a sine quâ non in domestic architecture  i took a run into connecticut the other day said sir george templemore and at a place called new haven i saw the commencement of a taste that bids fair to make a most remarkable town it is true you cannot expect structures of much pretension in the way of cost and magnitude in this country but so far as fitness and forms are concerned if what i hear be true and the next fifty years do as much in proportion for that little city as i understand has been done in the last five it will be altogether a wonder in its way there are some abortions it is true but there are also some little jewels  the baronet was rewarded for this opinion by a smile from grace and the conversation changed as the boat approached the mountains eve became excited a very american state of the system by the way and grace still more anxious  the view of that bluff is italian said our heroine pointing down the river at a noble headland of rock that loomed grandly in the soft haze of the tranquil atmosphere one seldom sees a finer or a softer outline on the shores of the mediterranean itself  but the highlands eve whispered the uneasy grace we are entering the mountains  the river narrowed suddenly and the scenery became bolder but neither eve nor her father expressed the rapture that grace expected  i must confess jack said the mild thoughtful mr effingham that these rocks strike my eyes as much less imposing than formerly the passage is fine beyond question but it is hardly grand scenery  you never uttered a juster opinion ned though after your eye loses some of the forms of the swiss and italian lakes and of the shores of italy you will think better of these the highlands are remarkable for their surprises rather than for their grandeur as we shall presently see as to the latter it is an affair of feet and inches and is capable of arithmetical demonstration we have often been on lakes beneath beetling cliffs of from three to six thousand feet in height whereas here the greatest elevation is materially less than two but sir george templemore and you miss effingham do me the favour to combine your cunning and tell me whence this stream cometh and whither we are to go  the boat had now approached a point where the river was narrowed to a width not much exceeding a quarter of a mile and in the direction in which it was steering the water seemed to become still more contracted until they were lost in a sort of bay that appeared to be closed by high hills through which however there were traces of something like a passage  the land in that direction looks as if it had a ravinelike entrance said the baronet and yet it is scarcely possible that a stream like this can flow there  if the hudson truly passes through those mountains said eve i will concede all in its favour that you can ask grace  where else can it pass demanded grace exultingly  sure enoughi see no other place and that seems insufficient  the two strangers to the river now looked curiously around them in every direction behind them was a broad and lakelike basin through which they had just passed on the left a barrier of precipitous hills the elevation of which was scarcely less than a thousand feet on their right a high but broken country studded with villas farm houses and hamlets and in their front the deep but equivocal bay mentioned  i see no escape cried the baronet gaily unless indeed it be by returning  a sudden and broad sheer of the boat caused him to turn to the left and then they whirled round an angle of the precipice and found themselves in a reach of the river between steep declivities running at right angles to their former course  this is one of the surprises of which i spoke said john effingham and which render the highlands so unique for while the rhine is very sinuous it has nothing like this  the other travellers agreed in extolling this and many similar features of the scenery and grace was delighted for warmhearted affectionate and true grace loved her country like a relative or a friend and took an honest pride in hearing its praises the patriotism of eve if a word of a meaning so lofty can be applied to feelings of this nature was more discriminating from necessity her tastes having been formed in a higher school and her means of comparison being so much more ample at west point they stopped for the night and here every body was in honest raptures grace who had often visited the place before being actually the least so of the whole party  now eve i know that you do love your country she said as she slipped an arm affectionately through that of her cousin this is feeling and speaking like an american girl and as eve effingham should  eve laughed but she had discovered that the provincial feeling was so strong in grace that its discussion would probably do no good she dwelt therefore with sincere eloquence on the beauties of the place and for the first time since they had met her cousin felt as if there was no longer any point of dissension between them  the following morning was the first of june and it was another of those drowsy dreamy days that so much aid a landscape the party embarked in the first boat that came up and as they entered newburgh bay the triumph of the river was established this is a spot in sooth that has few equals in any region though eve still insisted that the excellence of the view was in its softness rather than in its grandeur the countryhouses or boxes for few could claim to be much more were neat well placed and exceedingly numerous the heights around the town of newburgh in particular were fairly dotted with them though mr effingham shook his head as he saw one grecian temple appear after another  as we recede from the influence of the vulgar architects he said we find imitation taking the place of instruction many of these buildings are obviously disproportioned and then like vulgar pretension of any sort grecian architecture produces less pleasure than even dutch  i am surprised at discovering how little of a dutch character remains in this state said the baronet i can scarcely trace that people in any thing and yet i believe they had the moulding of your society having carried the colony through its infancy  when you know us better you will be surprised at discovering how little of any thing remains a dozen years returned john effingham our towns pass away in generations like their people and even the names of a place undergo periodical mutations as well as every thing else it is getting to be a predominant feeling in the american nature i fear to love change  but cousin jack do you not overlook causes in your censure that a nation advancing as fast as this in wealth and numbers should desire better structures than its fathers had either the means or the taste to build and that names should change with persons are both things quite in rule  all very true though it does not account for the peculiarity i mean take templeton for instance this little place has not essentially increased in numbers within my memory and yet fully onehalf its names are new when he reaches his own home your father will not know even the names of onehalf his neighbours not only will he meet with new faces but he will find new feelings new opinions in the place of traditions that he may love an indifference to every thing but the present moment and even those who may have better feelings and a wish to cherish all that belongs to the holier sentiments of man afraid to utter them lest they meet with no sympathy  no cats as mr bragg would say  jack is one who never paints en beau said mr effingham i should be very sorry to believe that a dozen short years can have made all these essential changes in my neighbourhood  a dozen years ned you name an age speak of three or four if you wish to find any thing in america where you left it the whole country is in such a constant state of mutation that i can only liken it to that game of children in which as one quits his corner another runs into it and he that finds no corner to get into is the laughingstock of the others fancy that dwelling the residence of one man from childhood to old age let him then quit it for a year or two and on his return he would find another in possession who would treat him as an impertinent intruder because he had been absent two years an american always in the way of usages extends no further back than eighteen months in short every thing is condensed into the present moment and services character for evil as well as good unhappily and all other things cease to have weight except as they influence the interests of the day  this is the colouring of a professed cynic observed mr effingham smiling  but the law mr john effingham eagerly inquired the baronetsurely the law would not permit a stranger to intrude in this manner on the rights of an owner  the lawbooks would do him that friendly office perhaps but what is a precept in the face of practices so ruthless les absents out toujours tort is a maxim of peculiar application in america  property is as secure in this country as in any other sir george and you will make allowances for the humours of the present annotator  well well ned i hope you will find every thing couleur de rose as you appear to expect you will get quiet possession of your house it is true for i have put a cerberus in it that is quite equal to his task difficult as it may be and who has quite as much relish for a bill of costs as any squatter can have for a trespass but without some such guardian of your rights i would not answer for it that you would not be compelled to sleep in the highway  i trust sir george templemore knows how to make allowances for mr john effinghams pictures cried grace unable to refrain from expressing her discontent any longer  a laugh succeeded and the beauties of the river again attracted their attention as the boat continued to ascend mr effingham triumphantly affirmed that the appearance of things more than equalled his expectations while both eve and the baronet declared that a succession of lovelier landscapes could hardly be presented to the eye  whited sepulchres muttered john effinghamall outside wait until you get a view of the deformity within  as the boat approached albany eve expressed her satisfaction in still stronger terms and grace was made perfectly happy by hearing her and sir george declare that the place entirely exceeded their expectations  i am glad to find eve that you are so fast recovering your american feelings said her beautiful cousin after one of those expressions of agreeable disappointment as they were seated at a late dinner in an inn you have at last found words to praise the exterior of albany and i hope by the time we return you will be disposed to see newyork with different eyes  i expected to see a capital in newyork grace and in this i have been grievously disappointed instead of finding the tastes tone conveniences architecture streets churches shops and society of a capital i found a huge expansion of commonplace things a commercial town and the most mixed and the least regulated society that i had ever met with expecting so much where so little was found disappointment was natural but in albany although a political capital i knew the nature of the government too well to expect more than a provincial town and in this respect i have found one much above the level of similar places in other parts of the world i acknowledge that albany has as much exceeded my expectations in one sense as newyork has fallen short of them in another  in this simple fact sir george templemore said mr effingham you may read the real condition of the country in all that requires something more than usual a deficiency in all that is deemed an average better than common the tendency is to raise every thing that is elsewhere degraded to a respectable height when there commences an attraction of gravitation that draws all towards the centre a little closer too than could be wished perhaps  ay ay ned this is very pretty with your attractions and gravitations but wait and judge for yourself of this average of which you now speak so complacently  nay john i borrowed the image from you if it be not accurate i shall hold you responsible for its defects  they tell me said eve that all american villages are the towns in miniature children dressed in hoops and wigs is this so grace  a little there is too much desire to imitate the towns perhaps and possibly too little feeling for country life  this is a very natural consequence after all of peoples living entirely in such places observed sir george templemore one sees much of this on the continent of europe because the country population is purely a country population and less of it in england perhaps because those who are at the head of society consider town and country as very distinct things  la campagne est vraiment délicieuse en amérique exclaimed mademoiselle viefville in whose eyes the whole country was little more than campagne  the next morning our travellers proceeded by the way of schenectady whence they ascended the beautiful valley of the mohawk by means of a canalboat the cars that now rattle along its length not having commenced their active flights at that time with the scenery every one was delighted for while it differed essentially from that the party had passed through the previous day it was scarcely less beautiful  at a point where the necessary route diverged from the direction of the canal carriages of mr effinghams were in readiness to receive the travellers and here they were also favoured by the presence of mr bragg who fancied such an attention might be agreeable to the young ladies as well as to his employer  chapter ix    tell me where is fancy bred   or in the heart or in the head   how begot how nourished    song in shakspeare  the travellers were several hours ascending into the mountains by a country road that could scarcely be surpassed by a french wheeltrack of the same sort for mademoiselle viefville protested twenty times in the course of the morning that it was a thousand pities mr effingham had not the privilege of the corvée that he might cause the approach to his terres to be kept in better condition at length they reached the summit a point where the waters began to flow south when the road became tolerably level from this time their progress became more rapid and they continued to advance two or three hours longer at a steady pace  aristabulus now informed his companions that in obedience to instructions from john effingham he had ordered the coachmen to take a road that led a little from the direct line of their journey and that they had now been travelling for some time on the more ancient route to templeton  i was aware of this said mr effingham though ignorant of the reason we are on the great western turnpike  certainly sir and all according to mr johns request there would have been a great saving in distance and agreeably to my notion in horseflesh had we quietly gone down the banks of the lake  jack will explain his own meaning returned mr effingham and he has stopped the other carriage and alighted with sir georgea hint i fancy that we are to follow their example  sure enough the second carriage was now stopped and sir george hastened to open its door  mr john effingham who acts as cicerone cried the baronet insists that every one shall put pied á terre at this precise spot keeping the important reason still a secret in the recesses of his own bosom  the ladies complied and the carriages were ordered to proceed with the domestics leaving the rest of the travellers by themselves apparently in the heart of a forest  it is to be hoped mademoiselle there are no banditti in america said eve as they looked around them at the novel situation in which they were placed apparently by a pure caprice of her cousin  ou des sauvages returned the governess who in spite of her ordinary intelligence and great good sense had several times that day cast uneasy and stolen glances into the bits of dark wood they had occasionally passed  i will ensure your purses and your scalps mesdames cried john effingham gaily on condition that you will follow me implicitly and by way of pledge for my faith i solicit the honour of supporting mademoiselle viefville on this unworthy arm  the governess laughingly accepted the conditions eve took the arm of her father and sir george offered his to grace aristabulus to his surprise being left to walk entirely alone it struck him however as so singularly improper that a young lady should be supported on such an occasion by her own father that he frankly and gallantly proposed to mr effingham to relieve him of his burthen an offer that was declined with quite as much distinctness as it was made  i suppose cousin jack has a meaning to his melodrama said eve as they entered the forest and i dare say dearest father that you are behind the scenes though i perceive determined secrecy in your face  john may have a cave to show us or some tree of extraordinary height such things existing in the country  we are very confiding mademoiselle for i detect treachery in every face around us even miss van cortlandt has the air of a conspirator and seems to be in league with something or somebody pray heaven it be not with wolves  des loups exclaimed mademoiselle viefville stopping short with a mien so alarmed as to excite a general laughest ce quil y a des loups et des sangliers dans cette forêt  no mademoiselle returned her companionthis is only barbarous america and not civilized france were we in le departement de la seine we might apprehend some such dangers but being merely in the mountains of otsego we are reasonably safe  je lespère murmured the governess as she reluctantly and distrustfully proceeded glancing her eyes incessantly to the right and left the path now became steep and rather difficult so much so indeed as to indispose them all to conversation it led beneath the branches of lofty pines though there existed on every side of them proofs of the ravages man had committed in that noble forest at length they were compelled to stop for breath after having ascended considerably above the road they had left  i ought to have said that the spot where we entered on this path is memorable in the family history observed john effingham to evefor it was the precise spot where one of our predecessors lodged a shot in the shoulder of another  then i know precisely where we are cried our heroine though i cannot yet imagine why we are led into this forest unless it be to visit some spot hallowed by a deed of natty bumppos  time will solve this mystery as well as all others let us proceed  again they ascended and after a few more minutes of trial they reached a sort of tableland and drew near an opening in the trees where a small circle had evidently been cleared of its wood though it was quite small and untilled eve looked curiously about her as did all the others to whom the place was novel and she was lost in doubt  there seems to be a void beyond us said the baronet i rather think mr john effingham has led us to the verge of a view  at this suggestion the party moved on in a body and were well rewarded for the toil of the ascent by a coup doeil that was almost swiss in character and beauty  now do i know where we are exclaimed eve clasping her hands in rapturethis is the vision and yonder indeed is our blessed home  the whole artifice of the surprise was exposed and after the first bursts of pleasure had subsided all to whom the scene was novel felt that they would not have missed this piquante introduction to the valley of the susquehannah on any account that the reader may understand the cause of so much delight and why john effingham had prepared this scene for his friends we shall stop to give a short description of the objects that first met the eyes of the travellers  it is known that they were in a small open spot in a forest and on the verge of a precipitous mountain the trees encircled them on every side but one and on that lay the panorama although the tops of tall pines that grew in lines almost parallel to the declivity rose nearly to a level with the eye hundreds of feet beneath them directly in front and stretching leagues to the right was a lake embedded in woods and hills on the side next the travellers a fringe of forest broke the line of water tree tops that intercepted the view of the shores and on the other high broken hills or low mountains rather that were covered with farms beautifully relieved by patches of wood in a way to resemble the scenery of a vast park or a royal pleasure ground limited the landscape high valleys lay among these uplands and in every direction comfortable dwellings dotted the fields the contrast between the dark hues of the evergreens with which all the heights near the water were shaded was in soft contrast to the livelier green of the other foliage while the meadows and pastures were luxuriant with a verdure unsurpassed by that of england bays and points added to the exquisite outline of the glassy lake on this shore while one of the former withdrew towards the northwest in a way to leave the eye doubtful whether it was the termination of the transparent sheet or not towards the south bold varied but cultivated hills also bounded the view all teeming with the fruits of human labour and yet all relieved by pieces of wood in the way already mentioned so as to give the entire region the character of park scenery a wide deep even valley commenced at the southern end of the lake or nearly opposite to the stand of our travellers and stretched away south until concealed by a curvature in the ranges of the mountains like all the mountaintops this valley was verdant peopled wooded in places though less abundantly than the hills and teeming with the signs of life roads wound through its peaceful retreats and might be traced working their way along the glens and up the weary ascents of the mountains for miles in every direction  at the northern termination of this lovely valley and immediately on the margin of the lake lay the village of templeton immediately under the eyes of the party the distance in an air line from their stand to the centre of the dwellings could not be much less than a mile but the air was so pure and the day so calm that it did not seem so far the children and even the dogs were seen running about the streets while the shrill cries of boys at their gambols ascended distinctly to the ear  as this was the templeton of the pioneers and the progress of society during half a century is connected with the circumstance we shall give the reader a more accurate notion of its present state than can be obtained from incidental allusions we undertake the office more readily because this is not one of those places that shoot up in a day under the unnatural efforts of speculation or which favoured by peculiar advantages in the way of trade becomes a precocious city while the stumps still stand in its streets but a sober county town that has advanced steadily pari passu with the surrounding country and offers a fair specimen of the more regular advancement of the whole nation in its progress towards civilization  the appearance of templeton as seen from the height where it is now exhibited to the reader was generally beautiful and maplike there might be a dozen streets principally crossing each other at right angles though sufficiently relieved from this precise delineation to prevent a starched formality perhaps the greater part of the buildings were painted white as is usual in the smaller american towns though a better taste was growing in the place and many of the dwellings had the graver and chaster hues of the grey stones of which they were built a general air of neatness and comfort pervaded the place it being as unlike a continental european town south of the rhine in this respect as possible if indeed we except the picturesque bourgs of switzerland in england templeton would be termed a small markettown so far as size was concerned in france a large bourg while in america it was in common parlance and legal appellation styled a village  of the dwellings of the place fully twenty were of a quality that denoted ease in the condition of their occupants and bespoke the habits of those accustomed to live in a manner superior to the oi polloi of the human race of these some six or eight had small lawns carriage sweeps and the other similar appliances of houses that were not deemed unworthy of the honour of bearing names of their own no less than five little steeples towers or belfries for neither word is exactly suitable to the architectural prodigies we wish to describe rose above the roofs denoting the sites of the same number of places of worship an american village usually exhibiting as many of these proofs of liberty of conscience caprices of conscience would perhaps be a better termas dollars and cents will by any process render attainable several light carriages such as were suitable to a mountainous country were passing to and fro in the streets and here and there a single horse vehicle was fastened before the door of a shop or a lawyers office denoting the presence of some customer or client from among the adjacent hills  templeton was not sufficiently a thoroughfare to possess one of those monstrosities a modern american tavern or a structure whose roof should overtop that of all its neighbours still its inns were of respectable size well piazzaed to use a word of our own invention and quite enough frequented  near the centre of the place in grounds of rather limited extent still stood that model of the composite order which owed its existence to the combined knowledge and taste in the remoter ages of the region of mr richard jones and mr hiram doolittle we will not say that it had been modernized for the very reverse was the effect in appearance at least but it had since undergone material changes under the more instructed intelligence of john effingham  this building was so conspicuous by position and size that as soon as they had taken in glimpses of the entire landscape which was not done without constant murmurs of pleasure every eye became fastened on it as the focus of interest a long and common silence denoted how general was this feeling and the whole party took seats on stumps and fallen trees before a syllable was uttered after the building had attracted their gaze aristabulus alone permitted his look to wander and he was curiously examining the countenance of mr effingham near whom he sate with a longing to discover whether the expression was that of approbation or of disapprobation of the fruits of his cousins genius  mr john effingham has considerably regenerated and revivified not to say transmogrified the old dwelling he said cautiously using terms that might have his own opinion of the changes doubtful the work of his hand has excited some speculation a good deal of inquiry and a little conversation throughout the country it has almost produced an excitement  as my house came to me from my father said mr effingham across whose mild and handsome face a smile was gradually stealing i knew its history and when called on for an explanation of its singularities could refer all to the composite order but you jack have supplanted all this by a style of your own for which i shall be compelled to consult the authorities for explanations  do you dislike my taste nedto my eye now the structure has no bad appearance from this spot  fitness and comfort are indispensable requisites for domestic architecture to use your own argument are you quite sure that yonder castellated roof for instance is quite suited to the deep snows of these mountains  john effingham whistled and endeavoured to look unconcerned for he well knew that the very first winter had demonstrated the unsuitableness of his plans for such a climate he had actually felt disposed to cause the whole to be altered privately at his own expense but besides feeling certain his cousin would resent a liberty that inferred his indisposition to pay for his own buildings he had a reluctance to admit in the face of the whole country that he had made so capital a mistake in a branch of art in which he prided himself rather more than common almost as much as his predecessor in the occupation mr richard jones  if you are not pleased with your own dwelling ned he answered you can have at least the consolation of looking at some of your neighbours houses and of perceiving that they are a great deal worse off of all abortions of this sort to my taste a grecian abortion is the worstmine is only gothic and that too in a style so modest that i should think it might pass unmolested  it was so unusual to see john effingham on the defensive that the whole party smiled while aristabulus who stood in salutary fear of his caustic tongue both smiled and wondered  nay do not mistake me john returned the proprietor of the edifice under discussionit is not your taste that i call in question but your provision against the seasons in the way of mere outward show i really think you deserve high praise for you have transformed a very ugly dwelling into one that is almost handsome in despite of proportions and the necessity of regulating the alterations by prescribed limits still i think there is a little of the composite left about even the exterior  i hope cousin jack you have not innovated on the interior cried eve for i think i shall remember that and nothing is more pleasant than the cattism of seeing objects that you remember in childhood pleasant i mean to those whom the mania of mutation has not affected  do not be alarmed miss effingham replied her kinsman with a pettishness of manner that was altogether extraordinary in a man whose mien in common was so singularly composed and masculine you will find all that you knew when a kitten in its proper place i could not rake together again the ashes of queen dido which were scattered to the four winds of heaven i fear nor could i discover a reasonably good bust of homer but respectable substitutes are provided and some of them have the great merit of puzzling all beholders to tell to whom they belong which i believe was the great characteristic of most of mr joness invention  i am glad to see cousin jack that you have at least managed to give a very respectable cloudcolour to the whole house  ay it lay between that and an invisible green the gentleman answered losing his momentary spleen in his natural love of the ludicrousbut finding that the latter would be only too conspicuous in the droughts that sometimes prevail in this climate i settled down into the yellowish drab that is indeed not unlike some of the richer volumes of the clouds  on the whole i think you are fairly entitled as steadfast dodge esquire would say to the meed of our thanks  what a lovely spot exclaimed mr effingham who had already ceased to think of his own dwelling and whose eye was roaming over the soft landscape athwart which the lustre of a june noontide was throwing its richest glories this is truly a place where one might fancy repose and content were to be found for the evening of a troubled life  indeed i have seldom looked upon a more bewitching scene answered the baronet the lakes of cumberland will scarce compete with this  or that of brienz or lungeren or nemi said eve smiling in a way that the other understood to be a hit at his nationality  cest charmant murmured mademoiselle viefville on pense à léternité dans une telle calme  the farm you can see lying near yonder wood mr effingham coolly observed aristabulus sold last spring for thirty dollars the acre and was bought for twenty the summerbefore  chacun à son gout said eve  and yet i fear this glorious scene is marred by the envy rapacity uncharitableness and all the other evil passions of man continued the more philosophical mr effingham perhaps it were better as it was so lately when it lay in the solitude and peace of the wilderness the resort of birds and beasts  who prey on each other dearest father just as the worst of our own species prey on their fellows  true childtrue and yet i never gaze on one of these scenes of holy calm without wishing that the great tabernacle of nature might be tenanted only by those who have a feeling for its perfection  do you see the lady said aristabulus that is just coming out on the lawn in front of the wigwam for that was the name john effingham had seen fit to give the altered and amended abode here miss effingham more in a line with the top of the pine beneath us  i see the person you mean she seems to be looking in this direction  you are quite right miss she knows that we are to stop on the vision and no doubt sees us that lady is your fathers cook miss effingham and is thinking of the late breakfast that has been ordered to be in readiness against our arrival  eve concealed her amusement for by this time she had discovered that mr bragg had a way peculiar to himself or at least to his class of using many of the commoner words of the english language it would perhaps be expecting too much of sir george templemore not to expect him to smile on such an occasion  ah exclaimed aristabulus pointing towards the lake across which several skiffs were stealing some in one direction and some in another there is a boat out that i think must contain the poet  poet repeated john effingham have we reached that pass at templeton  lord mr john effingham you must have very contracted notions of the place if you think a poet a great novelty in it why sir we have caravans of wild beasts nearly every summer  this is indeed a step in advance of which i was ignorant here then in a region that so lately was tenanted by beasts of prey beasts are already brought as curiosities you perceive the state of the country in this fact sir george templemore  i do indeed but i should like to hear from mr bragg what sort of animals are in these caravans  all sorts from monkeys to elephants the last had a rhinoceros  rhinoceroswhy there was but one lately in all europe neither the zoological gardens nor the jardin des plantes had a rhinoceros i never saw but one and that was in a caravan at rome that travelled between st petersburgh and naples  well sir we have rhinoceroses hereand monkeys and zebras and poets and painters and congressmen and bishops and governors and all other sorts of creatures  and who may the particular poet be mr bragg eve asked who honours templeton with his presence just at this moment  that is more than i can tell you miss for though some eight or ten of us have done little else than try to discover his name for the last week we have not got even as far as that one fact he and the gentleman who travels with him are both uncommonly close on such matters though i think we have some as good catechisers in templeton as can be found any where within fifty miles of us  there is another gentleman with himdo you suspect them both of being poets  oh no miss the other is the waiter of the poet that we know as he serves him at dinner and otherwise superintends his concerns such as brushing his clothes and keeping his room in order  this is being in luck for a poet for they are of a class that are a little apt to neglect the decencies may i ask why you suspect the master of being a poet if the man be so assiduous  why what else can he be in the first place miss effingham he has no name  that is a reason in point said john effingham very few poets having names  then he is out on the lake half his time gazing up at the silent pine or conversing with the speaking rocks or drinking at the fairy spring  all suspicious certainly especially the dialogue with the rocks though not absolutely conclusive  but mr john effingham the man does not take his food like other people he rises early and is out on the water or up in the forest all the morning and then returns to eat his breakfast in the middle of the forenoon he goes into the woods again or on the lake and comes back to dinner just as i take my tea  this settles the matter any man who presumes to do all this mr bragg deserves to be called by some harder name even than that of a poet pray sir how long has this eccentric person been a resident of templeton  histthere he is as i am a sinner and it was not he and the other gentlemen that were in the boat  the rebuked manner of aristabulus and the dropping of his voice induced the whole party to look in the direction of his eye and sure enough a gentleman approached them in the dress a man of the world is apt to assume in the country an attire of itself that was sufficient to attract comment in a place where the general desire was to be as much like town as possible though it was sufficiently neat and simple he came from the forest along the tableland that crowned the mountain for some distance following one of the foot paths that the admirers of the beautiful landscape have made all over that pleasant wood as he came out into the cleared spot seeing it already in possession of a party he bowed and was passing on with a delicacy that mr bragg would be apt to deem eccentric when suddenly stopping he gave a look of intense and eager interest at the whole party smiled advanced rapidly nearer and discovered his entire person  i ought not to be surprised he said as he advanced so near as to render doubt any longer impossible for i knew you were expected and indeed waited for your arrival and yet this meeting has been so unexpected as to leave me scarcely in possession of my faculties  it is needless to dwell upon the warmth and number of the greetings to the surprise of mr bragg his poet was not only known but evidently much esteemed by all the party with the exception of miss van cortlandt to whom he was cordially presented by the name of mr powis eve managed by an effort of womanly pride to suppress the violence of her emotions and the meeting passed off as one of mutual surprise and pleasure without any exhibition of unusual feeling to attract comment  we ought to express our wonder at finding you here before us my dear young friend said mr effingham still holding pauls hand affectionately between his own and even now that my own eyes assure me of the fact i can hardly believe you would arrive at new york and quit it without giving us the satisfaction of seeing you  in that sir you are not wrong certainly nothing could have deprived me of that pleasure but the knowledge that it would not have been agreeable to yourselves my sudden appearance here however will be without mystery when i tell you that i returned from england by the way of quebec the great lakes and the falls having been induced by my friend ducie to take that route in consequence of his ships being sent to the st lawrence a desire for novelty and particularly a desire to see the celebrated cataract which is almost the lion of america did the rest  we are glad to have you with us on any terms and i take it as particularly kind that you did not pass my door you have been here some days  quite a week on reaching utica i diverged from the great route to see this place not anticipating the pleasure of meeting you here so early but hearing you were expected i determined to remain with a hope which i rejoice to find was not vain that you would not be sorry to see an old fellowtraveller again  mr effingham pressed his hands warmly again before he relinquished them an assurance of welcome that paul received with thrilling satisfaction  i have been in templeton almost long enough the young man resumed laughing to set up as a candidate for the public favour if i rightly understand the claims of a denizen by what i can gather from casual remarks the old proverb that the new broom sweeps clean applies with singular fidelity throughout all this region  have you a copy of your last ode or a spare epigram in your pocket inquired john effingham  paul looked surprised and aristabulus for a novelty was a little dashed paul looked surprised as a matter of course for although he had been a little annoyed by the curiosity that is apt to haunt a village imagination since his arrival in templeton he did not in the least suspect that his love of a beautiful nature had been imputed to devotion to the muses perceiving however by the smiles of those around him that there was more meant than was expressed he had the tact to permit the explanation to come from the person who had put the question if it were proper it should come at all  we will defer the great pleasure that is in reserve continued john effingham to another time at present it strikes me that the lady of the lawn is getting to be impatient and the déjeuner à la fourchette that i have had the precaution to order is probably waiting our appearance it must be eaten though under the penalty of being thought moonstruck rhymers by the whole state come ned if you are sufficiently satisfied with looking at the wigwam in a birdseye view we will descend and put its beauties to the severer test of a close examination  this proposal was readily accepted though all tore themselves from that lovely spot with reluctance and not until they had paused to take another look  fancy the shores of this lake lined with villas said eve church towers raising their dark heads among these hills each mountain crowned with a castle or a crumbling ruin and all the other accessories of an old state of society and what would then be the charms of the view  less than they are today miss effingham said paul powis for though poetry requiresyou all smile is it forbidden to touch on such subjects  not at all so it be done in wholesome rhymes returned the baronet you ought to know that you are expected even to speak in doggerel  paul ceased and the whole party walked away from the place laughing and lighthearted  chapter x    it is the spot i came to seek my fathers ancient burial place    it is the spoti know it well of which our old traditions tell    bryant  from the day after their arrival in newyork or that on which the account of the arrests by the english cruiser had appeared in the journals little had been said by any of our party concerning paul powis or of the extraordinary manner in which he had left the packet at the very moment she was about to enter her haven it is true that mr dodge arrived at dodgeopolis had dilated on the subject in his hebdomadal with divers additions and conjectures of his own and this too in a way to attract a good deal of attention in the interior but it being a rule with those who are supposed to dwell at the fountain of foreign intelligence not to receive any thing from those who ought not to be better informed than themselves the effinghams and their friends had never heard of his account of the matter  while all thought the incident of the sudden return extraordinary no one felt disposed to judge the young man harshly the gentlemen knew that military censure however unpleasant did not always imply moral unworthiness and as for the ladies they retained too lively a sense of his skill and gallantry to wish to imagine evil on grounds so slight and vague still it had been impossible altogether to prevent the obtrusion of disagreeable surmises and all now sincerely rejoiced at seeing their late companion once more among them seemingly in a state of mind that announced neither guilt nor degradation  on quitting the mountain mr effingham who had a tender regard for grace offered her his arm as he would have given it to a second daughter leaving eve to the care of john effingham sir george attended to mademoiselle viefville and paul walked by the side of our heroine and her cousin leaving aristabulus to be what he himself called a miscellaneous companion or in other words to thrust himself into either set as inclination or accident might induce of course the parties conversed as they walked though those in advance would occasionally pause to say a word to those in the rear and as they descended one or two changes occurred to which we may have occasion to allude  i trust you have had pleasant passages said john effingham to paul as soon as they were separated in the manner just mentioned three trips across the atlantic in so short a time would be hard duty to a landsman though you as a sailor will probably think less of it  in this respect i have been fortunate the foam as we know from experience being a good traveller and ducie is altogether a fine fellow and an agreeable messmate you know i had him for a companion both going and coming  this was said naturally and while it explained so little directly it removed all unpleasant uncertainty by assuring his listeners that he had been on good terms at least with the person who had seemed to be his pursuer john effingham too well understood that no one messed with the commander of a vessel of war in his own ship who was in any way thought to be an unfit associate  you have made a material circuit to reach us the distance by quebec being nearly a fourth more than the direct road  ducie desired it so strongly that i did not like to deny him indeed he made it a point at first to obtain permission to land me at newyork where he had found me as he said but to this i would not listen as i feared it might interfere with his promotion of which he stood so good a chance in consequence of his success in the affair of the money by keeping constantly before the eyes of his superiors on duty of interest i thought his success would be more certain  and has his government thought his perseverance in the chase worthy of such a reward  indeed it has he is now a post and all owing to his good luck and judgment in that affair though in his country rank in private life does no harm to one in public life  eve liked the emphasis that paul laid on his country and she thought the whole remark was made in a spirit that an englishman would not be apt to betray  has it ever occurred to you continued john effingham that our sudden and unexpected separation has caused a grave neglect of duty in me if not in both of us  paul looked surprised and by his manner he demanded an explanation  you may remember the sealed package of poor mr monday that we were to open together on our arrival in newyork and on the contents of which we were taught to believe depended the settling of some important private rights i gave that package to you at the moment it was received and in the hurry of leaving us you overlooked the circumstance  all very true and to my shame i confess that until this instant the affair has been quite forgotten by me i had so much to occupy my mind while in england that it was not likely to be remembered and then the packet itself has scarce been in my possession since the day i left you  it is not lost i trust said john effingham quickly  surely notit is safe beyond a question in the writingdesk in which i deposited it but the moment we got to portsmouth ducie and myself proceeded to london together and as soon as he had got through at the admiralty we went into yorkshire where we remained much occupied with private matters of great importance to us both while his ship was docked and then it became necessary to make sundry visits to our relations  relations repeated eve involuntarily though she did not cease to reproach herself for the indiscretion during the rest of the walk  relations returned paul smiling captain ducie and myself are cousinsgerman and we made pilgrimages together to sundry family shrines this duty occupied us until a few days before we sailed for quebec on reaching our haven i left the ship to visit the great lakes and niagara leaving most of my effects with ducie who has promised to bring them on with himself when he followed on my track as he expected soon to do on his way to the west indies where he is to find a frigate he owed me this attention as he insisted on account of having induced me to go so far out of my way with so much luggage to oblige him the packet is unluckily left behind with the other things  and do you expect captain ducie to arrive in this country soonthe affair of the packet ought not to be neglected much longer for a promise to a dying man is doubly binding as it appeals to all our generosity rather than neglect the matter much longer i would prefer sending a special messenger to quebec  that will be quite unnecessary as indeed it would be useless ducie left quebec yesterday and has sent his and my effects direct to newyork under the care of his own steward the writingcase containing other papers that are of interest to us both he has promised not to lose sight of but it will accompany him on the same tour as that i have just made for he wishes to avail himself of this opportunity to see niagara and the lakes also he is now on my track and will notify me by letter of the day he will be in utica in order that we may meet on the line of the canal near this place and proceed to newyork in company  his companions listened to this brief statement with an intense interest with which the packet of poor mr monday however had very little connection john effingham called to his cousin and in a few words stated the circumstances as they had just been related to himself without adverting to the papers of mr monday which was an affair that he had hitherto kept to himself  it will be no more than a return of civility if we invite captain ducie to diverge from his road and pass a few days with us in the mountains he added at what precise time do you expect him to pass powis  within the fortnight i feel certain he would be glad to pay his respects to this party for he often expressed his sincere regrets at having been employed on a service that exposed the ladies to so much peril and delay  captain ducie is a near kinsman of mr powis dear father added eve in a way to show her parent that the invitation would be agreeable to herself for mr effingham was so attentive to the wishes of his daughter as never to ask a guest to his house that he thought would prove disagreeable to its mistress  i shall do myself the pleasure to write to captain ducie this evening urging him to honour us with his company returned mr effingham we expect other friends in a few days and i hope he will not find his time heavy on his hands while in exile among us mr powis will enclose my note in one of his letters and will i trust second the request by his own solicitations  paul made his acknowledgments and the whole party proceeded though the interruption caused such a change in the figure of the promenade as to leave the young man the immediate escort of eve the party by this time had not only reached the highway but it had again diverged from it to follow the line of an old and abandoned wheeltrack that descended the mountain along the side of the declivity by a wilder and more perilous direction than suited a modern enterprise it having been one of those little calculated and rude roads that the first settlers of a country are apt to make before there are time and means to investigate and finish to advantage although much more difficult and dangerous than its successor as a highway this relic of the infant condition of the country was by far the most retired and beautiful and pedestrians continued to use it as a common footpath to the vision the seasons had narrowed its surface and the second growth had nearly covered it with their branches shading it like an arbour and eve expressed her delight with its wildness and boldness mingled as both were with so pleasant a seclusion as they descended along a path as safe and convenient as a french allée glimpses were constantly obtained of the lake and the village while they proceeded and altogether they who were strangers to the scenery were loud in its praises  most persons who see this valley for the first time observed aristabulus find something to say in its favour for my part i consider it as rather curious myself  curious exclaimed paul that gentleman is at least singular in the choice of his expressions  you have met him before today said eve laughing for eve was now in a humour to laugh at trifles this we know since he had prepared us to meet a poet where we only find an old friend  only miss effinghamdo you estimate poets so high and old friends so low  this extraordinary person mr aristabulus bragg really deranges all ones notions and opinions in such a manner as to destroy even the usual signification of words i believe he seems so much in and yet so much out of his place is both so rusé and so unpractised so unfit for what he is and so ready at every thing that i scarcely know how to apply terms in any matter with which he has the smallest connection i fear he has persecuted you since your arrival in templeton  not at all i am so much acquainted with men of his cast that i have acquired a tact in managing them perceiving that he was disposed to suspect me of a disposition to poetize the lake to use his own term i took care to drop a couple of lines roughly written off like a hasty and imperfect effusion where i felt sure he would find them and have been living for a whole week on the fame thereof  you do indulge in such tastes then said eve smiling a little saucily  i am as innocent of such an ambition as of wishing to marry the heiress of the british throne which i believe just now is the goal of all the icaruses of our own time i am merely a rank plagiaristfor the rhyme on the fame of which i have rioted for a glorious week was two lines of popes an author so effectually forgotten in these palmy days of literature in which all knowledge seems so condensed into the productions of the last few years that a man might almost pass off an entire classic for his own without the fear of detection it was merely the first couplet of the essay on man which fortunately having an allusion to the pride of kings would pass for original as well as excellent in nineteen villages in twenty in america in these piping times of ultrarepublicanism no doubt mr bragg thought a eulogy on the people was to come next to be succeeded by a glorious picture of templeton and its environs  i do not know that i ought to admit these hits at liberty from a foreigner said eve pretending to look graver than she felt for never before in her life had our heroine so strong a consciousness of happiness as she had experienced that very morning  foreigner miss effinghamand why a foreigner  nay you know your own pretended cosmopolitism and ought not the cousin of captain ducie to be an englishman  i shall not answer for the ought the simple fact being a sufficient reply to the question the cousin of captain ducie is not an englishman nor as i see you suspect has he ever served a day in the british navy or in any other navy than that of his native land  this is indeed taking us by surprise and that most agreeably returned eve looking up at him with undisguised pleasure while a bright glow crimsoned her face we could not but feel an interest in one who had so effectually served us and both my father and mr john effingham  cousin jack interrupted the smiling paul  cousin jack then if you dislike the formality i used both my father and cousin jack examined the american navy registers for your name without success as i understood and the inference that followed was fair enough i believe you will admit  had they looked at a register of a few years date they would have met with better luck i have quitted the service and am a sailor only in recollections for the last few years like yourselves i have been a traveller by land as well as by water  eve said no more though every syllable that the young man uttered was received by attentive ears and retained with a scrupulous fidelity of memory they walked some distance in silence until they reached the grounds of a house that was beautifully placed on the side of the mountain near a lovely wood of pines crossing these grounds until they reached a terrace in front of the dwelling the village of templeton lay directly in their front perhaps a hundred feet beneath them and yet so near as to render the minutest object distinct here they all stopped to take a more distinct view of a place that had so much interest with most of the party  i hope you are sufficiently acquainted with the localities to act as cicerone said mr effingham to paul in a visit of a week to this village you have scarcely overlooked the wigwam  perhaps i ought to hesitate or rather ought to blush to own it answered the young man discharging the latter obligation by colouring to his temples but curiosity has proved so much stronger than manners that i have been induced to trespass so far on the politeness of this gentleman as to gain an admission to your dwelling in and about which more of my time has been passed than has probably proved agreeable to its inmates  i hope the gentleman will not speak of it said aristabulus in this country we live pretty much in common and with me it is a rule when a gentleman drops in whether stranger or neighbour to show him the civility to ask him to take off his hat  it appears to me said eve willing to change the conversation that templeton has an unusual number of steeples for what purpose can so small a place possibly require so many buildings of that nature  all in behalf of orthodoxy miss eve returned aristabulus who conceived himself to be the proper person to answer such interrogatories there is a shade of opinion beneath every one of those steeples  do you mean sir that there are as many shades of faith in templeton as i now see buildings that have the appearance of being devoted to religious purposes  double the number miss and some to spare in the bargain for you see but five meetinghouses and the countybuildings and we reckon seven regular hostile denominations in the village besides the diversities of sentiment on trifles this edifice that you perceive here in a line with the chimneys of the first house is new st pauls mr grants old church as orthodox a house in its way as there is in the diocese as you may see by the windows this is a gaining concern though there has been some falling off of late in consequence of the clergymans having caught a bad cold which has made him a little hoarse but i dare say he will get over it and the church ought not to be abandoned on that account serious as the matter undoubtedly is for the moment a few of us are determined to back up new st pauls in this crisis and i make it a point to go there myself quite half the time  i am glad we have so much of your company said mr effingham for that is our own church and in it my daughter was baptized but do you divide your religious opinions in halves mr bragg  in as many parts mr effingham as there are denominations in the neighbourhood giving a decided preference to new st pauls notwithstanding under the peculiar circumstances particularly to the windows the dark gloomylooking building miss off in the distance yonder is the methodist affair of which not much need be said methodism flourishing but little among us since the introduction of the new lights who have fairly managed to outexcite them on every plan they can invent i believe however they stick pretty much to the old doctrine which no doubt is one great reason of their present apathetic state for the people do love novelties  pray sir what building is this nearly in a line with new st pauls and which resembles it a little in colour and form  windows excepted it has two rows of regular squaretopped windows miss as you may observe that is the first presbyterian or the old standard a very good house and a pretty good faith too as times go i make it a point to attend there at least once every fortnight for change is agreeable to the nature of man i will say miss that my preference so far as i have any however is for new st pauls and i have experienced considerable regrets that these presbyterians have gained a material advantage over us in a very essential point lately  i am sorry to hear this mr bragg for being an episcopalian myself and having great reliance on the antiquity and purity of my church i should be sorry to find it put in the wrong by any other  i fear we must give that point up notwithstanding for these presbyterians have entirely outwitted the church people in that matter  and what is the point in which we have been so signally worsted  why miss their new bell weighs quite a hundred more than that of new st pauls and has altogether the best sound i know very well that this advantage will not avail them any thing to boast of in the last great account but it makes a surprising difference in the state of probation you see the yellowish looking building across the valley with a heavy wall around it and a belfry that in its regular character is the county courthouse and gaol but in the way of religion it is used pretty much miscellaneously  do you mean really sir that divine service is ever actually performed in it or that persons of all denominations are occasionally tried there  it would be truer to say that all denominations occasionally try the courthouse said aristabulus simpering for i believe it has been used in this way by every shade of religion short of the jews the gothic tower in wood is the building of the universalists and the grecian edifice that is not yet painted the baptists the quakers i believe worship chiefly at home and the different shades of the presbyterians meet in different rooms in private houses about the place  are there then shades of difference in the denominations as well as all these denominations asked eve in unfeigned surprise and this too in a population so small  this is a free county miss eve and freedom loves variety many men many minds  quite true sir said paul but here are many minds among few men nor is this all agreeably to your own account some of these men do not exactly know their own minds but can you explain to us what essential points are involved in all these shades of opinion  it would require a life sir to understand the half of them some say that excitement is religion and others that it is contentment one set cries up practice and another cries out against it this man maintains that he will be saved if he does good and that man affirms that if he only does good he will be damned a little evil is necessary to salvation with one shade of opinion while another thinks a man is never so near conversion as when he is deepest in sin  subdivision is the order of the day added john effingham every county is to be subdivided that there may be more county towns and county offices every religion decimated that there may be a greater variety and a better quality of saints  aristabulus nodded his head and he would have winked could he have presumed to take such a liberty with a man he held as much in habitual awe as john effingham  monsieur inquired mademoiselle viefville is there no église no véritable église in templeton  oh yes madame several returned aristabulus who would as soon think of admitting that he did not understand the meaning of véritable église as one of the sects he had been describing would think of admitting that it was not infallible in its interpretation of christianityseveral but they are not be seen from this particular spot  how much more picturesque would it be and even christianlike in appearance at least said paul could these good people consent to unite in worshipping godand how much does it bring into strong relief the feebleness and ignorance of man when you see him splitting hairs about doctrines under which he has been told in terms as plain as language can make it that he is simply required to believe in the goodness and power of a being whose nature and agencies exceed his comprehension  all very true cried john effingham but what would become of liberty of conscience in such a case most men nowadays understand by faith a firm reliance on their own opinions  in that case too put in aristabulus we should want this handsome display of churches to adorn our village there is good comes of it for any man would be more likely to invest in a place that has five churches than in a place with but one as it is templeton has as beautiful a set of churches as any village i know  say rather sir a set of castors for a stronger resemblance to vinegarcruets and mustardpots than is borne by these architectural prodigies eye never beheld  it is nevertheless a beautiful thing to see the high pointed roof of the house of god crowning an assemblage of houses as one finds it in other countries said eve instead of a pile of tavern as is too much the case in this dear home of ours  when this remark was uttered they descended the step that led from the terrace and proceeded towards the village on reaching the gate of the wigwam the whole party stood confronted with that offspring of john effinghams taste for so great had been his improvements on the original production of hiram doolittle that externally at least that distinguished architect could no longer have recognized the fruits of his own talents  this is carrying out to the full john the conceits of the composite order observed mr effingham drily  i shall be sorry ned if you dislike your house as it is amended and corrected  dear cousin jack cried eve it is an odd jumble of the grecian and gothic one would like to know your authorities for such a liberty  what do you think of the façade of the cathedral of milan miss laying emphasis on the last words in imitation of the manner of mr bragg is it such a novelty to see the two styles blended or is architecture so pure in america that you think i have committed the unpardonable sin  nay nothing that is out of rule ought to strike one in a country where imitation governs in all things immaterial and originality unsettles all things sacred and dear  by way of punishment for that bold speech i wish i had left the old rookery in the state i found it that its beauties might have greeted your eyes instead of this uncouth pile which seems so much to offend them mademoiselle viefville permit me to ask how you like that house  mais cest un petit chateau  un château effinghamisé said eve laughing  effinghamisé si vous voulez ma chère pourtant cest un château  the general opinion in this part of the country is said aristabulus that mr john effingham has altered the building on the plan of some edifice of europe though i forget the name of the particular temple it is not however the parthenon nor the temple of minerva  i hope at least said mr effingham leading the way up a little lawn it will not turn out to be the temple of the winds  chapter xi    nay ill come if i lose a scruple of this sport let me be oiled   to death with melancholyshakspeare  the progress of society in america has been distinguished by several peculiarities that do not so properly belong to the more regular and methodical advances of civilization in other parts of the world on the one hand the arts of life like minerva who was struck out of the intellectual being of her father at a blow have started full grown into existence as the legitimate inheritance of the colonists while on the other every thing tends towards settling down into a medium as regards quality a consequence of the communitycharacter of the institutions every thing she had seen that day had struck eve as partaking of this mixed nature in which while nothing was vulgar little even approached to that high standard that her european education had taught her to esteem perfect in the wigwam however as her fathers cousin had seen fit to name the family dwelling there was more of keeping and a closer attention to the many little things she had been accustomed to consider essential to comfort and elegance and she was better satisfied with her future home than with most she had seen since her return to america  as we have described the interior of this house in another work little remains to be said on the subject at present for while john effingham had completely altered its external appearance its internal was not much changed it is true the cloudcoloured covering had disappeared as had that stoop also the columns of which were so nobly upheld by their superstructure the former having given place to a less obtrusive roof that was regularly embattled and the latter having been swallowed up by a small entrance tower that the new architect had contrived to attach to the building with quite as much advantage to it in the way of comfort as in the way of appearance in truth the wigwam had none of the more familiar features of a modern american dwelling of its class there was not a column about it whether grecian roman or egyptian no venetian blinds no verandah or piazza no outside paint nor gay blending of colours on the contrary it was a plain old structure built with great solidity and of excellent materials and in that style of respectable dignity and propriety that was perhaps a little more peculiar to our fathers than it is peculiar to their successors our worthy selves in addition to the entrance tower or porch on its northern front john effingham had also placed a prettily devised conceit on the southern by means of which the abrupt transition from an inner room to the open air was adroitly avoided he had moreover removed the firstly of the edifice and supplied its place with a more suitable addition that contained some of the offices while it did not disfigure the building a rare circumstance in an architectural afterthought  internally the wigwam had gradually been undergoing improvements ever since that period which in the way of the arts if not in the way of chronology might be termed the dark ages of otsego the great hall had long before lost its characteristic decoration of the severed arm of wolf a gothic paper that was better adapted to the really respectable architecture of the room being its substitute and even the urn that was thought to contain the ashes of queen dido like the pitcher that goes often to the well had been broken in a war of extermination that had been carried on against the cobwebs by a particularly notable housekeeper old homer too had gone the way of all baked clay shakspeare himself had dissolved into dust leaving not a wreck behind and of washington and franklin even indigenous as they were there remained no vestiges instead of these venerable memorials of the past john effingham who retained a pleasing recollection of their beauties as they had presented themselves to his boyish eyes had bought a few substitutes in a new york shop and a shakspeare and a milton and a cæsar and a dryden and a locke as the writers of heroic so beautifully express it were now seated in tranquil dignity on the old medallions that had held their illustrious predecessors although time had as yet done little for this new collection in the way of colour dust and neglect were already throwing around them the tint of antiquity  the lady to use the language of mr bragg who did the cooking of the wigwam having every thing in readiness our party took their seats at the breakfast table which was spread in the great hall as soon as each had paid a little attention to the toilette as the service was neither very scientific nor sufficiently peculiar either in the way of elegance or of its opposite quality to be worthy of notice we shall pass it over in silence  one will not quite so much miss european architecture in this house said eve as she took her seat at table glancing an eye at the spacious and lofty room in which they were assembled here is at least size and its comforts if not elegance  had you lost all recollection of this building my child inquired her father kindly i was in hopes you would feel some of the happiness of returning home when you again found yourself beneath its roof  i should greatly dislike to have all the antics i have been playing in my own dressingroom exposed returned eve rewarding the parental solicitude of her father by a look of love though grace between her laughing and her tears has threatened me with such a disgrace ann sidley has also been weeping and as even annette always courteous and considerate has shed a few tears in the way of sympathy you ought not to imagine that i have been altogether so stoical as not to betray some feeling dear father but the paroxysm is past and i am beginning to philosophize i hope cousin jack you have not forgotten that the drawingroom is a ladys empire  i have respected your rights miss effingham though with a wish to prevent any violence to your tastes i have caused sundry antediluvian paintings and engravings to be consigned to the  garret inquired eve so quickly as to interrupt the speaker  fire coolly returned her cousin the garret is now much too good for them that part of the house being converted into sleepingrooms for the maids mademoiselle annette would go into hysterics were she to see the works of art that satisfied the past generation of masters in this country in too close familiarity with her louvre ized eyes  point du tout monsieur said mademoiselle viefville innocently annette a du gout dans son metier sans doute but she is too well bred to expect impossibilités no doubt she would have conducted herself with decorum  every body laughed for much lightheartedness prevailed at that board and the conversation continued  i shall be satisfied if annette escape convulsions eve added a refined taste being her weakness and to be frank what i recollect of the works you mention is not of the most flattering nature  and yet observed sir george nothing has surprised me more than the respectable state of the arts of engraving and painting in this country it was unlooked for and the pleasure has probably been in proportion to the surprise  in that you are very right sir george templemore john effingham answered but the improvement is of very recent date he who remembers an american town half a century ago will see a very different thing in an american town of today and this is equally true of the arts you mention with the essential difference that the latter are taking a right direction under a proper instruction while the former are taking a wrong direction under the influence of money that has no instruction had i left much of the old furniture or any of the old pictures in the wigwam we should have had the bland features of miss effingham in frowns instead of bewitching smiles at this very moment  and yet i have seen fine old furniture in this country cousin jack  very true though not in this part of it the means of conveyance were wanting half a century since and few people risk finery of any sort on corduroys this very house had some respectable old things that were brought here by dint of money and they still remain but the eighteenth century in general may be set down as a very dark antiquity in all this region  when the repast was over mr effingham led his guests and daughter through the principal apartments sometimes commending and sometimes laughing at the conceits of his kinsman the library was a good sized room good sized at least for a country in which domestic architecture as well as public architecture is still in the chrysalis state its walls were hung with an exceedingly pretty gothic paper in green but over each window was a chasm in the upper border and as this border supplied the arches the unity of the entire design was broken in no less than four places that being the precise number of the windows the defect soon attracted the eye of eve and she was not slow in demanding an explanation  the deficiency is owing to an american accident returned her cousin one of those calamities of which you are fated to experience many as the mistress of an american household no more of the border was to be bought in the country and this is a land of shops and not of fabricants at paris mademoiselle one would send to the paper maker for a supply but alas he that has not enough of a thing with us is as badly off as if he had none we are consumers and not producers of works of art it is a long way to send to france for ten or fifteen feet of paper hangings and yet this must be done or my beautiful gothic arches will remain forever without their key stones  one sees the inconvenience of this observed sir georgewe feel it even in england in all that relates to imported things  and we in nearly all things but food  and does not this show that america can never become a manufacturing country asked the baronet with the interest an intelligent englishman ever feels in that allabsorbing question if you cannot manufacture an article as simple as that of paperhangings would it not be well to turn your attention altogether to agriculture  as the feeling of this interrogatory was much more apparent than its logic smiles passed from one to the other though john effingham who really had a regard for sir george was content to make an evasive reply a singular proof of amity in a man of his caustic temperament  the survey of the house on the whole proved satisfactory to its future mistress who complained however that it was furnished too much like a town residence  for she added you will remember cousin jack that our visits here will be something like a villeggiatura  yes yes my fair lady it will not be long before your parisian and roman tastes will be ready to pronounce the whole country a villeggiatura  this is the penalty eve one pays for being a hajji observed grace who had been closely watching the expression of the others countenances for agreeably to her view of things the wigwam wanted nothing to render it a perfect abode the things that we enjoy you despise  that is an argument my dear coz that would apply equally well as a reason for preferring brown sugar to white  in coffee certainly miss eve put in the attentive aristabulus who having acquired this taste in virtue of an economical mother really fancied it a pure one every body in these regions prefers the brown in coffee  oh mon père et ma mère comme je vous en veux said eve without attending to the nice distinctions of mr bragg which savoured a little too much of the neophyte in cookery to find favour in the present company comme je vous en veux for having neglected so many beautiful sites to place this building in the very spot it occupies  in that respect my child we may rather be grateful at finding so comfortable a house at all compared with the civilization that then surrounded it this dwelling was a palace at the time of its erection bearing some such relation to the humbler structures around it as the château bears to the cottage remember that brick had never before been piled on brick in the walls of a house in all this region when the wigwam was constructed it is the temple of neptune of otsego if not of all the surrounding counties  eve pressed to her lips the hand she was holding in both her own and they all passed out of the library into another room as they came in front of the hall windows a party of apprenticeboys were seen coolly making their arrangements to amuse themselves with a game of ball on the lawn directly in front of the house  surely mr bragg said the owner of the wigwam with more displeasure in his voice than was usual for one of his regulated mind you do not countenance this liberty  liberty siri am an advocate for liberty wherever i can find it do you refer to the young men on the lawn mr effingham  certainly to them sir and permit me to say i think they might have chosen a more suitable spot for their sports they are mistaking liberties for liberty i fear  why sir i believe they have always played ball in that precise locality  alwaysi can assure you this is a great mistake what private family placed as we are in the centre of a village would allow of an invasion of its privacy in this rude manner well may the house be termed a wigwam if this whooping is to be tolerated before its door  you forget ned said john effingham with a sneer that an american always means just eighteen months antiquity is reached in five lustres and the dark ages at the end of a human life i dare say these amiable young gentlemen who enliven their sports with so many agreeable oaths would think you very unreasonable and encroaching to presume to tell them they are unwelcome  to own the truth mr john it would be downright unpopular  as i cannot permit the ears of the ladies to be offended with these rude brawls and shall never consent to have grounds that are so limited and which so properly belong to the very privacy of my dwelling invaded in this coarse manner i beg mr bragg that you will at once desire these young men to pursue their sports somewhere else  aristabulus received this commission with a very ill grace for while his native sagacity told him that mr effingham was right he too well knew the loose habits that had been rapidly increasing in the country during the last ten years not to foresee that the order would do violence to all the apprentices preconceived notions of their immunities for as he had truly stated things move at so quick a pace in america and popular feeling is so arbitrary that a custom of a twelve months existence is deemed sacred until the public itself sees fit to alter it he was reluctantly quitting the party on his unpleasant duty when mr effingham turned to a servant who belonged to the place and bade him go to the village barber and desire him to come to the wigwam to cut his hair pierre who usually performed that office for him being busied in unpacking trunks  never mind tom said aristabulus obligingly as he took up his hat i am going into the street and will give the message to mr lather  i cannot think sir of employing you on such a duty hastily interposed mr effingham who felt a gentlemans reluctance to impose an unsuitable office on any of his dependantstom i am sure will do me the favour  do not name it my dear sir nothing makes me happier than to do these little errands and another time you can do as much for me  aristabulus now went his way more cheerfully for he determined to go first to the barber hoping that some expedient might suggest itself by means of which he could coax the apprentices from the lawn and thus escape the injury to his popularity that he so much dreaded it is true these apprentices were not voters but then some of them speedily would be and all of them moreover had tongues an instrument mr bragg held in quite as much awe as some men dread saltpetre in passing the ballplayers he called out in a wheedling tone to their ringleader a notorious street brawler  a fine time for sport dickey dont you think there would be more room in the broad street than on this crowded lawn where you lose your ball so often in the shrubbery  this place will do on a pinch bawled dickeythough it might be better if it warnt for that plagued house we couldnt ask for a better ballground  i dont see put in another what folks built a house just in that spot for it has spoilt the very best playground in the village  some people have their notions as well as others returned aristabulus but gentlemen if i were in your place i would try the street i feel satisfied you would find it much the most agreeable and convenient  the apprentices thought differently however or they were indisposed to the change and so they recommenced their yells their oaths and their game in the mean while the party in the house continued their examination of john effinghams improvements and when this was completed they separated each to his or her own room  aristabulus soon reappeared on the lawn and approaching the ball players he began to execute his commission as he conceived in good earnest instead of simply saying however that it was disagreeable to the owner of the property to have such an invasion on his privacy and thus putting a stop to the intrusion for the future as well as at the present moment he believed some address necessary to attain the desired end  well dickey he said there is no accounting for tastes but in my opinion the street would be a much better place to play ball in than this lawn i wonder gentlemen of your observation should be satisfied with so cramped a playground  i tell you squire bragg this will do roared dickey we are in a hurry and no way particular the bosses will be after us in half an hour heave away sam  there are so many fences hereabouts continued aristabulus with an air of indifference its true the village trustees say there shall be no ballplaying in the street but i conclude you dont much mind what they think or threaten  let them sue for that if they like bawled a particularly amiable blackguard called peter who struck his ball as he spoke quite into the principal street of the village whos a trustee that he should tell gentlemen where they are to play ball  sure enough said aristabulus and now by following up that blow you can bring matters to an issue i think the law very oppressive and you can never have so good an opportunity to bring things to a crisis besides it is very aristocratic to play ball among roses and dahlias  the bait took for what apprenticeamerican apprentice in particularcan resist an opportunity of showing how much he considers himself superior to the law then it had never struck any of the party before that it was vulgar and aristocratic to pursue the sport among roses and one or two of them actually complained that they had pricked their fingers in searching for the ball  i know mr effingham will be very sorry to have you go continued aristabulus following up his advantage but gentlemen cannot always forego their pleasures for other folks  whos mr effingham i would like to know cried joe wart if he wants people to play ball on his premises let him cut down his roses come gentlemen i conform to squire bragg and invite you all to follow me into the street  as the lawn was now evacuated en masse aristabulus proceeded with alacrity to the house and went into the library where mr effingham was patiently waiting his return  i am happy to inform you sir commenced the ambassador that the ballplayers have adjourned and as for mr lather he declines your proposition  declines my proposition  yes sir he dislikes to come for he thinks it will be altogether a poor operation his notion is that if it be worth his while to come up to the wigwam to cut your hair it may be worth your while to go down to the shop to have it cut considering the matter in all its bearings therefore he concludes he would rather not engage in the transaction at all  i regret sir to have consented to your taking so disagreeable a commission and regret it the more now i find that the barber is disposed to be troublesome  not at all sir mr lather is a good man in his way and particularly neighbourly by the way mr effingham he asked me to propose to let him take down your garden fence in order that he may haul some manure on his potato patch which wants it dreadfully he says  certainly sir i cannot possibly object to his hauling his manure even through this house should he wish it he is so very valuable a citizen and one who knows his own business so well that i am only surprised at the moderation of his request  here mr effingham rose rang the bell for pierre and went to his own room doubting in his own mind from all that he had seen whether this was really the templeton he had known in his youth and whether he was in his own house or not  as for aristabulus who saw nothing out of rule or contrary to his own notions of propriety in what had passed he hurried off to tell the barber who was so ignorant of the first duty of his trade that he was at liberty to pull down mr effinghams fence in order to manure his own potato patch  lest the reader should suppose we are drawing caricatures instead of representing an actual condition of society it may be necessary to explain that mr bragg was a standing candidate for popular favour that like mr dodge he considered every thing that presented itself in the name of the public as sacred and paramount and that so general and positive was his deference for majorities that it was the bias of his mind to think halfadozen always in the right as opposed to one although that one agreeably to the great decision of the real majority of the entire community had not only the law on his side but all the abstract merits of the disputed question in short to such a pass of freedom had mr bragg in common with a large class of his countrymen carried his notions that he had really begun to imagine liberty was all means and no end  chapter xii    in sooth thou wast in very gracious fooling last night when thou   spokest of pigrogromotus of the vapians passing the equinoctial of   queubus t was very good i faithsir andrew aguecheek  the progress of society it has just been said in what is termed a new country is a little anomalous at the commencement of a settlement there is much of that sort of kind feeling and mutual interest which men are apt to manifest towards each other when they are embarked in an enterprise of common hazards the distance that is unavoidably inseparable from education habits and manners is lessened by mutual wants and mutual efforts and the gentleman even while he may maintain his character and station maintains them with that species of goodfellowship and familiarity that marks the intercourse between the officer and the soldier in an arduous campaign men and even women break bread together and otherwise commingle that in different circumstances would be strangers the hardy adventures and rough living of the forest apparently lowering the pretensions of the man of cultivation and mere mental resources to something very near the level of those of the man of physical energy and manual skill in this rude intercourse the parties meet as it might be on a sort of neutral ground one yielding some of his superiority and the other laying claims to an outward show of equality that he secretly knows however is the result of the peculiar circumstances in which he is placed in short the state of society is favourable to the claims of mere animal force and unfavourable to those of the higher qualities  this period may be termed perhaps the happiest of the first century of a settlement the great cares of life are so engrossing and serious that small vexations are overlooked and the petty grievances that would make us seriously uncomfortable in a more regular state of society are taken as matters of course or laughed at as the regular and expected incidents of the day goodwill abounds neighbour comes cheerfully to the aid of neighbour and life has much of the reckless gaiety careless association and buoyant merriment of childhood it is found that they who have passed through this probation usually look back to it with regret and are fond of dwelling on the rude scenes and ridiculous events that distinguish the history of a new settlement as the hunter is known to pine for the forest  to this period of fun toil neighbourly feeling and adventure succeeds another in which society begins to marshal itself and the ordinary passions have sway now it is that we see the struggles for place the heartburnings and jealousies of contending families and the influence of mere money circumstances have probably established the local superiority of a few beyond all question and the conditioese serves as a goal for the rest to aim at the learned professions the ministry included or what by courtesy are so called take precedence as a matter of course next to wealth however when wealth is at all supported by appearances then commence those gradations of social station that set institutions at defiance and which as necessarily follow civilization as tastes and habits are a consequence of indulgence  this is perhaps the least inviting condition of society that belongs to any country that can claim to be free and removed from barbarism the tastes are too uncultivated to exercise any essential influence and when they do exist it is usually with the pretension and effort that so commonly accompany infant knowledge the struggle is only so much the more severe in consequence of the late pèle mèle while men lay claim to a consideration that would seem beyond their reach in an older and more regulated community it is during this period that manners suffer the most since they want the nature and feeling of the first condition while they are exposed to the rudest assaults of the coarseminded and vulgar for as men usually defer to a superiority that is long established there being a charm about antiquity that is sometimes able to repress the passions in older communities the marshalling of time quietly regulates what is here the subject of strife  what has just been said depends on a general and natural principle perhaps but the state of society we are describing has some features peculiar to itself the civilization of america even in its older districts which supply the emigrants to the newer regions is unequal one state possessing a higher level than another coming as it does from different parts of this vast country the population of a new settlement while it is singularly homogenous for the circumstances necessarily brings with it its local peculiarities if to these elements be added a sprinkling of europeans of various nations and conditions the effects of the commingling and the temporary social struggles that follow will occasion no surprise  the third and last condition of society in a new country is that in which the influence of the particular causes enumerated ceases and men and things come within the control of more general and regular laws the effect of course is to leave the community possession of a civilization that conforms to that of the whole region be it higher or be it lower and with the division into castes that are more or less rigidly maintained according to circumstances  the periods as the astronomers call the time taken in a celestial revolution of the two first of these epochs in the history of a settlement depend very much on its advancement in wealth and in numbers in some places the pastoral age or that of good fellowship continues for a whole life to the obvious retrogression of the people in most of the higher qualities but to their manifest advantage however in the pleasures of the time being while in others it passes away rapidly like the buoyant animal joys that live their time between fourteen and twenty  the second period is usually of longer duration the migratory habits of the american people keeping society more unsettled than might otherwise prove to be the case it may be said never to cease entirely until the great majority of the living generation are natives of the region knowing no other means of comparison than those under which they have passed their days even when this is the case there is commonly so large an infusion of the birds of passage men who are adventurers in quest of advancement and who live without the charities of a neighbourhood as they may be said almost to live without a home that there is to be found for a long time a middle state of society during which it may well be questioned whether a community belongs to the second or to the third of the periods named  templeton was properly in this equivocal condition for while the third generation of the old settlers were in active life so many passersby came and went that the influence of the latter nearly neutralized that of time and the natural order of things its population was pretty equally divided between the descendants of the earlier inhabitants and those who flitted like swallows and other migratory birds all of those who had originally entered the region in the pride of manhood and had been active in converting the wilderness into the abodes of civilized men if they had not been literally gathered to their fathers in a physical sense had been laid the first of their several races beneath those sods that were to cover the heads of so many of their descendants a few still remained among those who entered the wilderness in young manhood but the events of the first period we have designated and which we have imperfectly recorded in another work were already passing into tradition among these original settlers some portion of the feeling that had distinguished their earliest communion with their neighbours yet continued and one of their greatest delights was to talk of the hardships and privations of their younger days as the veteran loves to discourse of his marches battles scars and sieges it would be too much to say that these persons viewed the more ephemeral part of the population with distrust for their familiarity with changes accustomed them to new faces but they had a secret inclination for each other preferred those who could enter the most sincerely into their own feelings and naturally loved that communion best where they found the most sympathy to this fragment of the community belonged nearly all there was to be found of that sort of sentiment which is connected with locality adventure with them supplying the place of time while the natives of the spot wanting in the recollections that had so many charms for their fathers were not yet brought sufficiently within the influence of traditionary interest to feel that hallowed sentiment in its proper force as opposed in feeling to these relics of the olden time were the birds of passage so often named a numerous and restless class that of themselves are almost sufficient to destroy whatever there is of poetry or of local attachment in any region where they resort  in templeton and its adjacent district however the two hostile influences might be said to be nearly equal the descendants of the fathers of the country beginning to make a manly stand against the looser sentiment or the want of sentiment that so singularly distinguishes the migratory bands the first did begin to consider the temple in which their fathers had worshipped more hallowed than strange altars the sods that covered their fathers heads more sacred than the clods that were upturned by the plough and the places of their childhood and childish sports dearer than the highway trodden by a nameless multitude  such then were the elements of the society into which we have now ushered the reader and with which it will be our duty to make him better acquainted as we proceed in the regular narration of the incidents of our tale  the return of the effinghams after so long an absence naturally produced a sensation in so small a place and visiters began to appear in the wigwam as soon as propriety would allow many false rumours prevailed quite as a matter of course and eve it was reported was on the point of being married to no less than three of the inmates of her fathers house within the first ten days viz sir george templemore mr powis and mr bragg the latter story taking its rise in some precocious hopes that had escaped the gentleman himself in the excitement of helping to empty a bottle of bad breton wine that was dignified with the name of champagne but these tales revived and died so often in a state of society in which matrimony is so general a topic with the young of the gentler sex that they brought with them their own refutation  the third day in particular after the arrival of our party was a reception day at the wigwam the gentlemen and ladies making it a point to be at home and disengaged after twelve oclock in order to do honour to their guests one of the first who made his appearance was a mr howel a bachelor of about the same age as mr effingham and a man of easy fortune and quiet habits nature had done more towards making mr howel a gentleman than either cultivation or association for he had passed his entire life with very immaterial exceptions in the valley of templeton where without being what could be called a student or a scholar he had dreamed away his existence in an indolent communication with the current literature of the day he was fond of reading and being indisposed to contention or activity of any sort his mind had admitted the impressions of what he perused as the stone receives a new form by the constant fall of drops of water unfortunately for mr howel he understood no language but his mother tongue and as all his reading was necessarily confined to english books he had gradually and unknown to himself in his moral nature at least got to be a mere reflection of those opinions prejudices and principles if such a word can properly be used for such a state of the mind that it had suited the interests or passions of england to promulgate by means of the press a perfect bonne foi prevailed in all his notions and though a very modest man by nature so very certain was he that his authority was always right that he was a little apt to be dogmatical on such points as he thought his authors appeared to think settled between john effingham and mr howel there were constant amicable skirmishes in the way of discussion for while the latter was so dependent limited in knowledge by unavoidable circumstances and disposed to an innocent credulity the first was original in his views accustomed to see and think for himself and moreover a little apt to estimate his own advantages at their full value  here comes our good neighbour and my old schoolfellow tom howel said mr effingham looking out at a window and perceiving the person mentioned crossing the little lawn in front of the house by following a winding footpathas kindhearted a man sir george templemore as exists one who is really american for he has scarcely quitted the county halfadozen times in his life and one of the honestest fellows of my acquaintance  ay put in john effingham as real an american as any man can be who uses english spectacles for all he looks at english opinions for all he says english prejudices for all he condemns and an english palate for all he tastes american quotha the man is no more american than the times newspaper or charing cross he actually made a journey to newyork last war to satisfy himself with his own eyes that a yankee frigate had really brought an englishman into port  his english predilections will be no fault in my eyes said the baronet smilingand i dare say we shall be excellent friends  i am sure mr howel is a very agreeable man added graceof all in your templeton côterie he is my greatest favourite  oh i foresee a tender intimacy between templemore and howel rejoined john effingham and sundry wordy wars between the latter and miss effingham  in this you do me injustice cousin jack i remember mr howel well and kindly for he was ever wont to indulge my childish whims when a girl  the man is a second burchell and i dare say never came to the wigwam when you were a child without having his pockets stuffed with cakes or bonbons  the meeting was cordial mr howel greeting the gentlemen like a warm friend and expressing great delight at the personal improvements that had been made in eve between the ages of eight and twenty john effingham was no more backward than the others for he too liked their simpleminded kindhearted but credulous neighbour  you are welcome backyou are welcome back added mr howel blowing his nose in order to conceal the tears that were gathering in his eyes i did think of going to newyork to meet you but the distance at my time of life is very serious age gentlemen seems to be a stranger to you  and yet we who are both a few months older than yourself howel returned mr effingham kindly have managed to overcome the distance you have just mentioned in order to come and see you  ay you are great travellers gentlemen very great travellers and are accustomed to motionbeen quite as far as jerusalem i hear  into its very gates my good friend and i wish with all my heart we had had you in our company such a journey might cure you of the homemalady  i am a fixture and never expect to look upon the ocean now i did at one period of my life fancy such an event might happen but i have finally abandoned all hope on that subject well miss eve of all the countries in which you have dwelt to which do you give the preference  i think italy is the general favourite eve answered with a friendly smile although there are some agreeable things peculiar to almost every country  italywell that astonishes me a good deal i never knew there was any thing particularly interesting about italy i should have expected you to say england  england is a fine country too certainly but it wants many things that italy enjoys  well now what said mr howel shifting his legs from one knee to the other in order to be more convenient to listen or if necessary to object what can italy possess that england does not enjoy in a still greater degree  its recollections for one thing and all that interest which time and great events throw around a region  and is england wanting in recollections and great events are there not the conqueror or if you will king alfred and queen elizabeth and shakspearethink of shakspeare young ladyand sir walter scott and the gunpowder plot and cromwell oliver cromwell my dear miss eve and westminster abbey and london bridge and george iv the descendant of a line of real kingswhat in the name of heaven can italy possess to equal the interest one feels in such things as these  they are very interesting no doubt said eve endeavouring not to smilebut italy has its relics of former ages too you forget the cæsars  very good sort of persons for barbarous times i dare say but what can they be to the english monarchs i would rather look upon a bonâ fide english king than see all the cæsars that ever lived i never can think any man a real king but the king of england  not king solomon cried john effingham  oh he was a bible king and one never thinks of them italy well this i did not expect from your fathers daughter your greatgreat greatgrandfather must have been an englishman born mr effingham  i have reason to think he was sir  and milton and dryden and newton and locke these are prodigious names and worth all the cæsars put together and pope too what have they got in italy to compare to pope  they have at least the pope said eve laughing  and then there are the boars head in eastcheap and the tower and queen anne and all the wits of her reign andandand titus oates and bosworth field and smithfield where the martyrs were burned and a thousand more spots and persons of intense interest in old england  quite true said john effingham with an air of sympathybut howel you have forgotten peeping tom of coventry and the climate  and holyroodhouse and yorkminster and st pauls continued the worthy mr howel too much bent on a catalogue of excellencies that to him were sacred to heed the interruption and above all windsor castle what is there in the world to equal windsor castle as a royal residence  want of breath now gave eve an opportunity to reply and she seized it with an eagerness that she was the first to laugh at herself afterwards  caserta is no mean house mr howel and in my poor judgment there is more real magnificence in its great staircase than in all windsor castle united if you except the chapel  but st pauls  why st peters may be set down quite fairly i think for its pendant at least  true the catholics do say so returned mr howel with the deliberation one uses when he greatly distrusts his own concession but i have always considered it one of their frauds i dont think there can be any thing finer than st pauls then there are the noble ruins of england they you must admit are unrivalled  the temple of neptune at pæstum is commonly thought an interesting ruin mr howel  yes yes for a temple i dare say though i do not remember to have ever heard of it before but no temple can ever compare to a ruined abbey   taste is an arbitrary thing tom howel as you and i know when as boys we quarrelled about the beauty of our ponies said mr effingham willing to put an end to a discussion that he thought a little premature after so long an absence here are two young friends who shared the hazards of our late passage with us and to whom in a great degree we owe our present happy security and i am anxious to make you acquainted with them this is our countryman mr powis and this is an english friend who i am certain will be happy to know so warm an admirer of his own countrysir george templemore  mr howel had never before seen a titled englishman and he was taken so much by surprise that he made his salutations rather awkwardly as both the young men however met him with the respectful ease that denotes familiarity with the world he soon recovered his self possession  i hope you have brought back with you a sound american heart miss eve resumed the guest as soon as this little interruption had ceased we have had sundry rumours of french marquisses and german barons but i have all along trusted too much to your patriotism to believe you would marry a foreigner  i hope you except englishmen cried sir george gaily we are almost the same people  i am proud to hear you say so sir nothing flatters me more than to be thought english and i certainly should not have accused miss effingham of a want of love of country had  she married halfadozen englishmen interrupted john effingham who saw that the old theme was in danger of being revived but howel you have paid me no compliments on the changes in the house i hope they are to your taste  a little too french mr john  frenchthere is not a french feature in the whole animal what has put such a notion into your head  it is the common opinion and i confess i should like the building better were it less continental  why my old friend it is a nondescriptoriginaleffingham upon doolittle if you will and as for models it is rather more english than any thing else  well mr john i am glad to hear this for i do confess to a disposition rather to like the house i am dying to know miss eve if you saw all our distinguished contemporaries when in europethat to me would be one of the greatest delights of travelling  to say that we saw them all might be too much though we certainly did meet with many  scott of course  sir walter we had the pleasure of meeting a few times in london  and southey and coleridge and wordsworth and moore and bulwer and disraeli and rogers and campbell and the grave of byron and horace smith and miss landon and barry cornwall and  cum multis aliis put in john effingham again by way of arresting the torrent of names eve saw many of these and as tubal told shylock we often came where we did hear of the rest but you say nothing friend tom of goethe and tieck and schlegel and la martine chateaubriant hugo delavigne mickiewicz nota manzoni niccolini c c c c c c  honest wellmeaning mr howel listened to the catalogue that the other ran volubly over in silent wonder for with the exception of one or two of these distinguished men he had never even heard of them and in the simplicity of his heart unconsciously to himself he had got to believe that there was no great personage still living of whom he did not know something  ah here comes young wenham by way of preserving the equilibrium resumed john effingham looking out of a windowi rather think you must have forgotten him ned though you remember his father beyond question  mr effingham and his cousin went out into the hall to receive the new guest with whom the latter had become acquainted while superintending the repairs of the wigwam  mr wenham was the son of a successful lawyer in the county and being an only child he had also succeeded to an easy independence his age however brought him rather into the generation to which eve belonged than into that of the father and if mr howel was a reflection or rather a continuation of all the provincial notions that america entertained of england forty years ago mr wenham might almost be said to belong to the opposite school and to be as ultra american as his neighbour was ultrabritishif there is lajeune france there is also la jeune amerique although the votaries of the latter march with less hardy steps than the votaries of the first mr wenham fancied himself a paragon of national independence and was constantly talking of american excellencies though the ancient impressions still lingered in his moral system as men look askance for the ghosts which frightened their childhood on crossing a churchyard in the dark john effingham knew the penchant of the young man and when he said that he came happily to preserve the equilibrium he alluded to this striking difference in the characters of their two friends  the introductions and salutations over we shall resume the conversation that succeeded in the drawingroom  you must be much gratified miss effingham observed mr wenham who like a true american being a young man himself supposed it de rigueur to address a young lady in preference to any other presentwith the great progress made by our country since you went abroad  eve simply answered that her extreme youth when she left home had prevented her from retaining any precise notions on such subjects  i dare say it is all very true she added but one like myself who remembers only older countries is i think a little more apt to be struck with the deficiencies than with what may in truth be improvements though they still fall short of excellence  mr wenham looked vexed or indignant would be a better word but he succeeded in preserving his coolnessa thing that is not always easy to one of provincial habits and provincial education when he finds his own beau idéal lightly estimated by others  miss effingham must discover a thousand imperfections said mr howel coming as she does directly from england that music nowalluding to the sounds of a flute that were heard through the open windows coming from the adjacent villagemust be rude enough to her ear after the music of london  the street music of london is certainly among the best if not the very best in europe returned eve with a glance of the eye at the baronet that caused him to smile and i think this fairly belongs to the class being so freely given to the neighbourhood  have you read the articles signed minerva in the hebdomad miss effingham inquired mr wenham who was determined to try the young lady on a point of sentiment having succeeded so ill in his first attempt to interest herthey are generally thought to be a great acquisition to american literature  well wenham you are a fortunate man interposed mr howel if you can find any literature in america to add to or to substract from beyond almanacs reports of cases badly got up and newspaper verses i know nothing that deserves such a name  we may not print on as fine paper mr howel or do up the books in as handsome binding as other people said mr wenham bridling and looking grave but so far as sentiments are concerned or sound sense american literature need turn its back on no literature of the day  by the way mr effingham you were in russia did you happen to see the emperor  i had that pleasure mr howel  and is he really the monster we have been taught to believe him  monster exclaimed the upright mr effingham fairly recoiling a step in surprise in what sense a monster my worthy friend surely not in a physical  i do not know that i have somehow got the notion he is any thing but handsome a mean butchering bloodyminded looking little chap ill engage  you are libelling one of the finestlooking men of the age  i think i would submit it to a jury i cannot believe after what i have read of him in the english publications that he is so very handsome  but my good neighbour these english publications must be wrong prejudiced perhaps or even malignant  oh i am not the man to be imposed on in that way besides what motive could an english writer have for belying an emperor of russia  sure enough what motive exclaimed john effinghamyou have your answer ned  but you will remember mr howel eve interposed that we have seen the emperor nicholas  i dare say miss eve that your gentle nature was disposed to judge him as kindly as possible and then i think most americans ever since the treaty of ghent have been disposed to view all russians too favourably no no i am satisfied with the account of the english they live much nearer to st petersburg than we do and they are more accustomed too to give accounts of such matters  but living nearer tom howel cried mr effingham with unusual animation in such a case is of no avail unless one lives near enough to see with his own eyes  wellwellmy good friend we will talk of this another time i know your disposition to look at every body with lenient eyes i will now wish you all a good morning and hope soon to see you again miss eve i have one word to say if you dare trust yourself with a youth of fifty for a minute in the library  eve rose cheerfully and led the way to the room her fathers visiter had named when within it mr howel shut the door carefully and then with a sort of eager delight he exclaimed  for heavens sake my dear young lady tell me who are these two strange gentlemen in the other room  precisely the persons my father mentioned mr howel mr paul powis and sir george templemore  englishmen of course  sir george templemore is of course as you say but we may boast of mr powis as a countryman  sir george templemorewhat a superblooking young fellow  why yes returned eve laughing he at least you will admit is a handsome man  he is wonderfulthe other mraaai forget what you called himhe is pretty well too but this sir george is a princely youth  i rather think a majority of observers would give the preference to the appearance of mr powis said eve struggling to be steady but permitting a blush to heighten her colour in despite of the effort  what could have induced him to come up among these mountainsan english baronet resumed mr howel without thinking of eves confusion is he a real lord  only a little one mr howel you heard what my father said of our having been fellowtravellers  but what does he think of us i am dying to know what such a man really thinks of us  it is not always easy to discover what such men really think although i am inclined to believe that he is disposed to think rather favourably of some of us  ay of you and your father and mr john you have travelled and are more than half european but what can he think of those who have never left america  even of some of those returned eve smiling i suspect he thinks partially  well i am glad of that do you happen to know his opinion of the emperor nicholas  indeed i do not remember to have heard him mention the emperors name nor do i think he has ever seen him  that is extraordinary such a man should have seen every thing and know every thing but ill engage at the bottom he does know all about him if you happen to have any old english newspapers as wrappers or by any other accident let me beg them of you i care not how old they are an english journal fifty years old is more interesting than one of ours wet from the press  eve promised to send him a package when they shook hands and parted as she was crossing the hall to rejoin the party john effingham stopped her  has howel made proposals the gentleman inquired in an affected whisper  none cousin jack beyond an offer to read the old english newspapers i can send him  yes yes tom howel will swallow all the nonsense that is timbré à londres  i confess a good deal of surprise at finding a respectable and intelligent man so weakminded as to give credit to such authorities or to form his serious opinions on information derived from such sources  you may be surprised eve at hearing so frank avowals of the weakness but as for the weakness itself you are now in a country for which england does all the thinking except on subjects that touch the current interests of the day  nay i will not believe this if it were true how came we independent of herwhere did we get spirit to war against her  the man who has attained his majority is independent of his fathers legal control without being independent of the lessons he was taught when a child the soldier sometimes mutinies and after the contest is over he is usually the most submissive man of the regiment  all this to me is very astonishing i confess that a great deal has struck me unpleasantly in this way since our return especially in ordinary society but i never could have supposed it had reached to the pass in which i see it existing in our good neighbour howel  you have witnessed one of the effects in a matter of no great moment to ourselves but as time and years afford the means of observation and comparison you will perceive the effects in matters of the last moment in a national point of view it is in human nature to undervalue the things with which we are familiar and to form false estimates of those which are remote either by time or by distance but go into the drawingroom and in young wenham you will find one who fancies himself a votary of a new school although his prejudices and mental dependence are scarcely less obvious than those of poor tom howel  the arrival of more company among whom were several ladies compelled eve to defer an examination of mr wenhams peculiarities to another opportunity she found many of her own sex whom she had left children grown into womanhood and not a few of them at a period of life when they should be cultivating their physical and moral powers already oppressed with the cares and feebleness that weigh so heavily on the young american wife  chapter xiii    nay we must longer kneel i am a suitor    queen katherine  the effinghams were soon regularly domesticated and the usual civilities had been exchanged many of their old friends resumed their ancient intercourse and some new acquaintances were made the few first visits were as usual rather labored and formal but things soon took their natural course and as the ease of country life was the aim of the family the temporary little bustle was quickly forgotten  the dressingroom of eve overlooked the lake and about a week after her arrival she was seated in it enjoying that peculiarly ladylike luxury which is to be found in the process of having another gently disposing of the hair annette wielded the comb as usual while ann sidley who was unconsciously jealous that any one should be employed about her darling even in this manner though so long accustomed to it busied herself in preparing the different articles of attire that she fancied her young mistress might be disposed to wear that morning grace was also in the room having escaped from the hands of her own maid in order to look into one of those books which professed to give an account of the extraction and families of the higher classes of great britain a copy of which eve happened to possess among a large collection of books allmanachs de gotha court guides and other similar works that she had found it convenient to possess as a traveller  ah here it is said grace in the eagerness of one who is suddenly successful after a long and vexatious search  here is what coz  grace coloured and she could have bitten her tongue for its indiscretion but too ingenuous to deceive she reluctantly told the truth  i was merely looking for the account of sir george templemores family it is awkward to be domesticated with one of whose family we are utterly ignorant  have you found the name  yes i see he has two sisters both of whom are married and a brother who is in the guards but  but what dear  his title is not so very old  the title of no baronet can be very old the order having been instituted in the reign of james i  i did not know that his ancestor was created a baronet in 1701 i see now eve  now what grace  we are both grace would not confine the remark to herselfwe are both of older families than this you have even a much higher english extraction and i think i can claim for the van cortlandts more antiquity than one that dates from 1701  no one doubts it grace but what do you wish me to understand by this are we to insist on preceding sir george in going through a door  grace blushed to the eyes and yet she laughed involuntarily  what nonsense no one thinks of such things in america  except at washington where i am told senators ladies do give themselves airs but you are quite right grace women have no rank in america beyond their general social rank as ladies or no ladies and we will not be the first to set an example of breaking the rule i am afraid our blood will pass for nothing and that we must give place to the baronet unless indeed he recognizes the rights of the sex  you know i mean nothing so silly sir george templemore does not seem to think of rank at all even mr powis treats him in all respects as an equal and sir george seems to admit it to be right  eves maid at the moment was twisting her hair with the intention to put it up but the sudden manner in which her young mistress turned to look at grace caused annette to relinquish her grasp and the shoulders of the beautiful and blooming girl were instantly covered with the luxuriant tresses  and why should not mr powis treat sir george templemore as one every way his equal grace she asked with an impetuosity unusual in one so trained in the forms of the world  why eve one is a baronet and the other is but a simple gentleman  eve effingham sat silent for quite a minute her little foot moved and she had been carefully taught too that a ladylike manner required that even this beautiful portion of the female frame should be quiet and unobtrusive but america did not contain two of the same sex years and social condition less alike in their opinions or it might be said their prejudices than the two cousins grace van cortlandt of the best blood of her native land had unconsciouslv imbibed in childhood the notions connected with hereditary rank through the traditions of colonial manners by means of novels by hearing the vulgar reproached or condemned for their obtrusion and ignorance and too often justly reproached and condemned and by the aid of her imagination which contributed to throw a gloss and brilliancy over a state of things that singularly gains by distance on the other hand with eve every thing connected with such subjects was a matter of fact she had been thrown early into the highest associations of europe she had not only seen royalty on its days of gala and representation a mere rareeshow that is addressed to the senses or purely an observance of forms that may possibly have their meaning but which can scarcely be said to have their reasons but she had lived long and intimately among the highborn and great and this too in so many different countries as to have destroyed the influence of the particular nation that has transmitted so many of its notions to america as heirlooms by close observation she knew that arbitrary and political distinctions made but little difference between men of themselves and so far from having become the dupe of the glitter of life by living so long within its immediate influence she had learned to discriminate between the false and the real and to perceive that which was truly respectable and useful and to know it from that which was merely arbitrary and selfish eve actually fancied that the position of an american gentleman might readily become nay that it ought to be the highest of all human stations short of that of sovereigns such a man had no social superior with the exception of those who actually ruled in her eyes and this fact she conceived rendered him more than noble as nobility is usually graduated she had been accustomed to see her father and john effingham moving in the best circles of europe respected for their information and independence undistinguished by their manners admired for their personal appearance manly courteous and of noble bearing and principles if not set apart from the rest of mankind by an arbitrary rule connected with rank rich and possessing all the habits that properly mark refinement of gentle extraction of liberal attainments walking abroad in the dignity of manhood and with none between them and the deity eve had learned to regard the gentlemen of her race as the equals in station of any of their european associates and as the superiors of most in every thing that is essential to true distinction with her even titular princes and dukes had no estimation merely as princes and dukes and as her quick mind glanced over the long catalogue of artificial social gradations and she found grace actually attaching an importance to the equivocal and purely conventional condition of an english baronet a strong sense of the ludicrous connected itself with the idea  a simple gentleman grace she repeated slowly after her cousin and is not a simple gentleman a simple american gentleman the equal of any gentleman on earthof a poor baronet in particular  poor baronet eve  yes dear poor baronet i know fully the extent and meaning of what i say it is true we do not know as much of mr powis family and here eves colour heightened though she made a mighty effort to be steady and unmoved as we might but we know he is an american that at least is something and we see he is a gentleman and what american gentleman a real american gentleman can be the inferior of an english baronet would your uncle think you would cousin jack proud loftyminded cousin jack think you grace consent to receive so paltry a distinction as a baronetcy were our institutions to be so far altered as to admit of such social classifications  why what would they be eve if not baronets  earls counts dukes nay princes these are the designations of the higher classes of europe and such titles or those that are equivalent would belong to the higher classes here  i fancy that sir george templemore would not be persuaded to admit all this  if you had seen miss eve surrounded and admired by princes as i have seen her miss grace said ann sidley you would not think any simple sir george half good enough for her  our good nanny means a sir george interrupted eve laughing and not the sir george in question but seriously dearest coz it depends more on ourselves and less on others in what light they are to regard us than is commonly supposed do you not suppose there are families in america who if disposed to raise any objections beyond those that are purely personal would object to baronets and the wearers of red ribands as unfit matches for their daughters on the ground of rank what an absurdity would it be for a sir george or the sir george either to object to a daughter of a president of the united states for instance on account of station and yet ill answer for it you would think it no personal honour if mr jackson had a son that he should propose to my dear father for you let us respect ourselves properly take care to be truly ladies and gentlemen and so far from titular ranks being necessary to us before a hundred lustres are past we shall bring all such distinctions into discredit by showing that they are not necessary to any one important interest or to true happiness and respectability any where  and do you not believe eve that sir george templemore thinks of the difference in station between us  i cannot answer for that said eve calmly the man is naturally modest and it is possible when he sees that we belong to the highest social condition of a great country he may regret that such has not been his own good fortune in his native land especially grace since he has known you  grace blushed looked pleased delighted even and yet surprised it is unnecessary to explain the causes of the three first expressions of her emotions but the last may require a short examination nothing but time and a change of circumstances can ever raise a province or a provincial town to the independent state of feeling that so strikingly distinguishes a metropolitan country or a capital it would be as rational to expect that the inhabitants of the nursery should disregard the opinions of the drawingroom as to believe that the provincial should do all his own thinking political dependency moreover is much more easily thrown aside than mental dependency it is not surprising therefore that grace van cortlandt with her narrow associations general notions of life origin and provincial habits should be the very opposite of eve in all that relates to independence of thought on subjects like those that they were now discussing had grace been a native of new england even she would have been less influenced by the mere social rank of the baronet than was actually the case for while the population of that part of the union feel more of the general subserviency to great britain than the population of any other portion of the republic they probably feel less of it in this particular form from the circumstance that their colonial habits were less connected with the aristocratical usages of the mother country grace was allied by blood too with the higher classes of england as indeed was the fact with most of the old families among the new york gentry and the traditions of her race came in aid of the traditions of her colony to continue the profound deference she felt for an english title eve might have been equally subjected to the same feelings had she not been removed into another sphere at so early a period of life where she imbibed the notions already mentionednotions that were quite as effectually rooted in her moral system as those of grace herself could be in her own  this is a strange way of viewing the rank of a baronet eve grace exclaimed as soon as she had a little recovered from the confusion caused by the personal allusion i greatly question if you can induce sir george templemore to see his own position with your eyes  no my dear i think he will be much more likely to regard not only that but most other things with the eyes of another person we will now talk of more agreeable things however for i confess when i do dwell on titles i have a taste for the more princely appellations and that a simple chevalier can scarce excite a feeling that such is the theme  nay eve interrupted grace with spirit an english baronet is noble sir george templemore assured me that as lately as last evening the heralds i believe have quite recently established that fact to their own satisfaction  i am glad of it dear returned eve with difficulty refraining from gaping as it will be of great importance to them in their own eyes at all events i concede that sir george templemore knight or baronet big baron or little baron is a noble fellow and what more can any reasonable person desire do you know sweet coz that the wigwam will be full to overflowing next weekthat it will be necessary to light our councilfire and to smoke the pipe of many welcomes  i have understood mr powis that his kinsman captain ducie will arrive on monday  and mrs hawker will come on tuesday mr and mrs bloomfield on wednesday and honest brave straightforward literatihating captain truck on thursday at the latest we shall be a large countrycircle and i hear the gentlemen talking of the boats and other amusements but i believe my father has a consultation in the library at which he wishes us to be present we will join him if you please  as eves toilette was now completed the two ladies rose and descended together to join the party below mr effingham was standing at a table that was covered with maps while two or three respectablelooking men mastermechanics were at his side the manners of these men were quiet civil and respectful having a mixture of manly simplicity with a proper deference for the years and station of the master of the house though all but one wore their hats the one who formed the exception had become refined by a long intercourse with this particular family and his acquired taste had taught him that respect for himself as well as for decency rendered it necessary to observe the longestablished rules of decorum in his intercourse with others his companions though without a particle of coarseness or any rudeness of intention were less decorous simply from a loose habit that is insensibly taking the place of the ancient laws of propriety in such matters and which habit it is to be feared has a part of its origin in false and impracticable political notions that have been stimulated by the arts of demagogues still not one of the three hardworking really civil and even humane men who now stood covered in the library of mr effingham was probably conscious of the impropriety of which he was guilty or was doing more than insensibly yielding to a vicious and vulgar practice  i am glad you have come my love said mr effingham as his daughter entered the room for i find i need support in maintaining my own opinions here john is obstinately silent and as for all these other gentlemen i fear they have decidedly taken sides against me  you can usually count on my support dearest father feeble as it may be but what is the disputed point today  there is a proposition to alter the interior of the church and our neighbour gouge has brought the plans on which as he says he has lately altered several churches in the county the idea is to remove the pews entirely converting them into what are called slips to lower the pulpit and to raise the floor amphitheatre fashion  can there be a sufficient reason for this change demanded eve with surprise slips the word has a vulgar sound even and savours of a useless innovation i doubt its orthodoxy  it is very popular miss eve answered aristabulus advancing from a window where he had been whispering assent this fashion takes universally and is getting to prevail in all denominations  eve turned involuntarily and to her surprise she perceived that the editor of the active inquirer was added to their party the salutations on the part of the young lady were distant and stately while mr dodge who had not been able to resist public opinion and had actually parted with his moustachios simpered and wished to have it understood by the spectators that he was on familiar terms with all the family  it may be popular mr bragg returned eve as soon as she rose from her profound curtsey to mr dodge but it can scarcely be said to be seemly this is indeed changing the order of things by elevating the sinner and depressing the saint  you forget miss eve that under the old plan the people could not see they were kept unnaturally down if one can so express it while nobody had a good lookout but the parson and the singers in the front row of the gallery this was unjust  i do not conceive sir that a good lookout as you term it is at all essential to devotion or that one cannot as well listen to instruction when beneath the teacher as when above him  pardon me miss eve recoiled as she always did when mr bragg used this vulgar and contemptuous mode of address we put no body up or down all we aim it is a just equalityto place all as near as possible on a level  eve gazed about her in wonder and then she hesitated a moment as if distrusting her ears  equality equality with what surely not with the ordained ministers of the church in the performance of their sacred duties surely not with the deity  we do not look at it exactly in this light maam the people build the church that you will allow miss effingham even you will allow this mr effingham  both the parties appealed to bowed a simple assent to so plain a proposition but neither spoke  well the people building the church very naturally ask themselves for what purpose it was built  for the worship of god returned eve with a steady solemnity of manner that a little abashed even the ordinarily indomitable and selfcomposed aristabulus  yes miss for the worship of god and the accommodation of the public  certainly added mr dodge for the public accommodation and for public worship laying due emphasis on the adjectives  father you at least will never consent to this  not readily my love i confess it shocks all my notions of propriety to see the sinner even when he professes to be the most humble and penitent thrust himself up ostentatiously as if filled only with his own selflove and selfimportance  you will allow mr effingham rejoined aristabulus that churches are built to accommodate the public as mr dodge has so well remarked  no sir they are built for the worship of god as my daughter has so well remarked  yes sir that too i grant you  as secondary to the main objectthe public convenience mr bragg unquestionably means put in john effingham speaking for the first time that morning on the subject  eve turned quickly and looked towards her kinsman he was standing near the table with folded arms and his fine face expressing all the sarcasm and contempt that a countenance so singularly calm and gentlemanlike could betray  cousin jack she said earnestly this ought not to be  cousin eve nevertheless this will be  surely notsurely not men can never so far forget appearances as to convert the temple of god into a theatre in which the convenience of the spectators is the one great object to be kept in view  you have travelled sir said john effingham indicating by his eye that he addressed mr dodge in particular and must have entered places of worship in other parts of the world did not the simple beauty of the manner in which all classes the great and the humble the rich and the poor kneel in a common humility before the altar strike you agreeably on such occasions in catholic countries in particular  bless me no mr john effingham i was disgusted at the meanness of their rites and really shocked at the abject manner in which the people knelt on the cold damp stones as if they were no better than beggars  and were they not beggars asked eve with almost a severity of tone ought they not so to consider themselves when petitioning for mercy of the one great and omnipotent god  why miss effingham the people will rule and it is useless to pretend to tell them that they shall not have the highest seats in the church as well as in the state really i can see no ground why a parson should be raised above his parishioners the neworder churches consult the public convenience and place every body on a level as it might be now in old times a family was buried in its pew it could neither see nor be seen and i can remember the time when i could just get a look of our clergymans wig for he was an oldschool man and as for his fellowcreatures one might as well be praying in his own closet i must say i am a supporter of liberty if it be only in pews  i am sorry mr dodge answered eve mildly you did not extend your travels into the countries of the mussulmans where most christian sects might get some useful notions concerning the part of worship at least that is connected with appearances there you would have seen no seats but sinners bowing down in a mass on the cold stones and all thoughts of cushioned pews and drawingroom conveniences unknown we protestants have improved on our catholic forefathers in this respect and the innovation of which you now speak in my eyes is an irreverent almost a sinful invasion of the proprieties of the temple  ah miss eve this comes from substituting forms for the substance of things exclaimed the editor for my part i can say i was truly shocked with the extravagancies i witnessed in the way of worship in most of the countries i visited would you think it mr bragg rational beings real bonâ fide living men and women kneeling on the stone pavement like so many camels in the desert mr dodge loved to draw his images from the different parts of the world he had seen ready to receive the burthens of their masters not a pew not a cushion not a single comfort that is suitable to a free and intelligent being but every thing conducted in the most abject manner as if accountable human souls were no better than so many mutes in a turkish palace  you ought to mention this in the active inquirer said aristabulus  all in good time sir i have many things in reserve among which i propose to give a few remarks i dare say they will be very worthless ones on the impropriety of a rational beings ever kneeling to my notion gentlemen and ladies god never intended an american to kneel  the respectable mechanics who stood around the table did not absolutely assent to this proposition for one of them actually remarked that he saw no great harm in a mans kneeling to the deity but they evidently inclined to the opinion that the new school of pews was far better than the old  it always appears to me miss effingham said one that i hear and understand the sermon better in one of the low pews than in one of the old highbacked things that look so much like pounds  but can you withdraw into yourself better sir can you more truly devote all your thoughts with a suitable singleness of heart to the worship of god  you mean in the prayers now i rather conclude  certainly sir i mean in the prayers and the thanksgivings  why we leave them pretty much to the parson though i will own it is not quite as easy leaning on the edge of one of the newschool pews as on one of the old they are better for sitting but not so good for standing but then the sitting posture at prayers is quite coming into favour among our people miss effingham as well as among yours the sermon is the main chance after all  yes observed mr gouge give me good strong preaching any day in preference to good praying a man may get along with secondrate prayers but he stands in need of firstrate preaching  these gentlemen consider religion a little like a cordial on a cold day observed john effingham which is to be taken in sufficient doses to make the blood circulate they are not the men to be pounded in pews like lost sheep not they  mr john will always have his say one remarked and then mr effingham dismissed the party by telling them he would think of the matter  when the mechanics were gone the subject was discussed at some length between those that remainedall the effinghams agreeing that they would oppose the innovation as irreverent in appearance unsuited to the retirement and selfabasement that best comported with prayer and opposed to the delicacy of their own habits while messrs bragg and dodge contended to the last that such changes were loudly called for by the popular sentiment that it was unsuited to the dignity of a man to be pounded even in a churchand virtually that a good stirring sermon as they called it was of far more account in public worship than all the prayers and praises that could issue from the heart or throat  chapter xiv    well follow cadewell follow cade    mob  the views of this mr bragg and of our old fellowtraveller mr dodge appear to be peculiar on the subject of religious forms observed sir george templemore as he descended the little lawn before the wigwam in company with the three ladies paul powis and john effingham on their way to the lake i should think it would be difficult to find another christian who objects to kneeling at prayer  therein you are mistaken templemore answered paul for this country to say nothing of one sect which holds it in utter abomination is filled with them our pious ancestors like neophytes ran into extremes on the subject of forms as well as in other matters when you go to philadelphia miss effingham you will see an instance of a most ludicrous natureludicrous if there were not something painfully revolting mingled with itof the manner in which men can strain at a gnat and swallow a camel and which i am sorry to say is immediately connected with our own church  it was music to eves ears to hear paul powis speak of his pious ancestors as being american and to find him so thoroughly identifying himself with her own native land for while condemning so many of its practices and so much alive to its absurdities and contradictions our heroine had seen too much of other countries not to take an honest pride in the real excellencies of her own there was also a soothing pleasure in hearing him openly own that he belonged to the same church as herself  and what is there ridiculous in philadelphia in particular and in connection with our own church she asked i am not so easily disposed to find fault where the venerable church is concerned  you know that the protestants in their horror of idolatry discontinued in a great degree the use of the cross as an outward religious symbol and that there was probably a time when there was not a single cross to be seen in the whole of a country that was settled by those who made a profession of love for christ and a dependence on his expiation the great business of their lives  certainly we all know our predecessors were a little overrigid and scrupulous on all the points connected with outward appearances  they certainly contrived to render the religious rites as little pleasing to the senses as possible by aiming at a sublimation that peculiarly favours spiritual pride and a pious conceit i do not know whether travelling has had the same effect on you as it has produced on me but i find all my inherited antipathies to the mere visible representation of the cross superseded by a sort of solemn affection for it as a symbol when it is plain and unaccompanied by any of those bloody and minute accessories that are so often seen around it in catholic countries the german protestants who usually ornament the altar with a cross first cured me of the disrelish i imbibed on this subject in childhood  we also i think cousin john were agreeably struck with the same usage in germany from feeling a species of nervousness at the sight of a cross i came to love to see it and i think you must have undergone a similar change for i have discovered no less than three among the ornaments of the great window of the entrance tower at the wigwam  you might have discovered one also in every door of the building whether great or small young lady our pious ancestors as powis calls them much of whose piety by the way was any thing but meliorated with spiritual humility or christian charity were such ignoramuses as to set up crosses in every door they built even while they veiled their eyes in holy horror whenever the sacred symbol was seen in a church  every door exclaimed the protestants of the party  yes literally every door i might almost say certainly every panelled door that was constructed twenty years since i first discovered the secret of our blunder when visiting a castle in france that dated back from the time of the crusade it was a château of the montmorencies that had passed into the hands of the condé family by marriage and the courtly old domestic who showed me the curiosities pointed out to me the stone croix in the windows which has caused the latter to be called croisées as a pious usage of the crusaders turning to a door i saw the same crosses in the wooden stiles and if you cast an eye on the first humble door that you may pass in this village you will detect the same symbol staring you boldly in the face in the very heart of a population that would almost expire at the thoughts of placing such a sign of the beast on their very thresholds  the whole party expressed their surprise but the first door they passed corroborated this account and proved the accuracy of john effinghams statements catholic zeal and ingenuity could not have wrought more accurate symbols of this peculiar sign of the sect and yet here they stood staring every passenger in the face as if mocking the ignorant and exaggerated pretension which would lay undue stress on the minor points of a religion the essence of which was faith and humility  and the philadelphia church said eve quickly so soon as her curiosity was satisfied on the subject of the door i am now more impatient than ever to learn what silly blunder we have also committed there  impious would almost be a better term paul answered the only church spire that existed for half a century in that town was surmounted by a mitre while the cross was studiously rejected  a silence followed for there is often more true argument in simply presenting the facts of a case than in all the rhetoric and logic that could be urged by way of auxiliaries every one saw the egregious folly not to say presumption of the mistake and at the moment every one wondered how a commonsense community could have committed so indecent a blunder we are mistaken there was an exception to the general feeling in the person of sir george templemore to his churchandstate notions and anticatholic prejudices which were quite as much political as religious there was every thing that was proper and nothing that was wrong in rejecting a cross for a mitre  the church no doubt was episcopal powis he remarked and it was not roman what better symbol than the mitre could be chosen  now i reflect it is not so very strange said grace eagerly for you will remember mr effingham that protestants attach the idea of idolatry to the cross as it is used by catholics  and of bishops peers in parliament church and state to a mitre  yes but the church in question i have seen and it was erected before the war of the revolution it was an english rather than an american church  it was indeed an english church rather than an american and templemore is very right to defend it mitre and all  i dare say a bishop officiated at its altar  i dare saynay i know he did and i will add he would rather that the mitre were two hundred feet in the air than down on his own simple whitehaired apostolicallooking head but enough of divinity for the morning yonder is tom with the boat let us to our oars  the party were now on the little wharf that served as a village landing and the boatman mentioned lay off in waiting for the arrival of his fare instead of using him however the man was dismissed the gentlemen preferring to handle the oars themselves aquatic excursions were of constant occurrence in the warm months on that beautifully limpid sheet of water and it was the practice to dispense with the regular boatmen whenever good oarsmen were to be found among the company  as soon as the light buoyant skiff was brought to the side of the wharf the whole party embarked and paul and the baronet taking the oars they soon urged the boat from the shore  the world is getting to be too confined for the adventurous spirit of the age said sir george as he and his companion pulled leisurely along taking the direction of the eastern shore beneath the forestclad cliffs of which the ladies had expressed a wish to be rowed here are powis and myself actually rowing together on a mountain lake of america after having boated as companions on the coast of africa and on the margin of the great desert polynesia and terra australis may yet see us in company as hardy cruisers  the spirit of the age is indeed working wonders in the way you mean said john effingham countries of which our fathers merely read are getting to be as familiar as our own homes to their sons and with you one can hardly foresee to what a pass of adventure the generation or two that will follow us may not reach  vraiment cest fort extraordinaire de se trouver sur un lac americain exclaimed mademoiselle viefville  more extraordinary than to find ones self on a swiss lake think you my dear mademoiselle viefville  non non mais tout aussi extraordinaire pour une parisienne  i am now about to introduce you mr john effingham and miss van cortlandt excepted eve continued to the wonders and curiosities of this lake and region there near the small house that is erected over a spring of delicious water stood the hut of natty bumppo once known throughout all these mountains as a renowned hunter a man who had the simplicity of a woodsman the heroism of a savage the faith of a christian and the feelings of a poet a better than he after his fashion seldom lived  we have all heard of him said the baronet looking round curiously and must all feel an interest in what concerns so brave and just a man i would i could see his counterpart  alas said john effingham the days of the leatherstockings have passed away he preceded me in life and i see few remains of his character in a region where speculation is more rife than moralizing and emigrants are plentier than hunters natty probably chose that spot for his hut on account of the vicinity of the spring is it not so miss effingham  he did and yonder little fountain that you see gushing from the thicket and which comes glancing like diamonds into the lake is called the fairy spring by some flight of poetry that like so many of our feelings must have been imported for i see no connection between the name and the character of the country fairies having never been known even by tradition in otsego  the boat now came under a shore where the trees fringed the very water frequently overhanging the element that mirrored their fantastic forms at this point a light skiff was moving leisurely along in their own direction but a short distance in advance on a hint from john effingham a few vigorous strokes of the oars brought the two boats near each other  this is the flagship half whispered john effingham as they came near the other skiff containing no less a man than the commodore formerly the chief of the lake was an admiral but that was in times when living nearer to the monarchy we retained some of the european terms now no man rises higher than a commodore in america whether it be on the ocean or on the otsego whatever may be his merits or his services a charming day commodore i rejoice to see you still afloat in your glory  the commodore a tail thin athletic man of seventy with a white head and movements that were quick as those of a boy had not glanced aside at the approaching boat until he was thus saluted in the wellknown voice of john effingham he then turned his head however and scanning the whole party through his spectacles he smiled goodnaturedly made a flourish with one hand while he continued paddling with the other for he stood erect and straight in the stern of his skiff and answered heartily  a fine morning mr john and the right time of the moon for boating this is not a real scientific day for the fish perhaps but i have just come out to see that all the points and bays are in their right places  how is it commodore that the water near the village is less limpid than common and that even up here we see so many specks floating on its surface  what a question for mr john effingham to ask on his native water so much for travelling in far countries where a man forgets quite as much as he learns i fear here the commodore turned entirely round and raising an open hand in an oratorical manner he addedyou must know ladies and gentlemen that the lake is in blow  in blow commodore i did not know that the lake bore its blossoms  it does sir nevertheless ay mr john and its fruits too but the last must be dug for like potatoes there have been no miraculous draughts of the fishes of late years in the otsego ladies and gentlemen but it needs the scientific touch and the knowledge of baits to get a fin of any of your true game above the water nowadays well i have had the head of the sogdollager thrice in the open air in my time though i am told the admiral actually got hold of him once with his hand  the sogdollager said eve much amused with the singularities of the man whom she perfectly remembered to have been commander of the lake even in her own infancy we must be indebted to you for an explanation of that term as well as for the meaning of your allusion to the head and the open air  a sogdollager young lady is the perfection of a thing i know mr grant used to say there was no such word in the dictionary but then there are many words that ought to be in the dictionaries that have been forgotten by the printers in the way of salmon trout the sogdollager is their commodore now ladies and gentlemen i should not like to tell you all i know about the patriarch of this lake for you would scarcely believe me but if he would not weigh a hundred when cleaned there is not an ox in the county that will weigh a pound when slaughtered  you say you had his head above water said john effingham  thrice mr john the first time was thirty years ago and i confess i lost him on that occasion by want of science for the art is not learned in a day and i had then followed the business but ten years the second time was five years later and i had then been fishing expressly for the old gentleman about a month for near a minute it was a matter of dispute between us whether he should come out of the lake or i go into it but i actually got his gills in plain sight that was a glorious haul washington did not feel better the night cornwallis surrendered than i felt on that great occasion  one never knows the feelings of another it seems i should have thought disappointment at the loss would have been the prevailing sentiment on that great occasion as you so justly term it  so it would have been mr john with an unscientific fisherman but we experienced hands know better glory is to be measured by quality and not by quantity ladies and gentlemen and i look on it as a greater feather in a mans cap to see the sogdollagers head above water for half a minute than to bring home a skiff filled with pickerel the last time i got a look at the old gentleman i did not try to get him into the boat but we sat and conversed for near two minutes he in the water and i in the skiff  conversed exclaimed eve and with a fish too what could the animal have to say  why young lady a fish can talk as well as one of ourselves the only difficulty is to understand what he says i have heard the old settlers affirm that the leatherstocking used to talk for hours at a time with the animals of the forest  you knew the leatherstocking commodore  no young lady i am sorry to say i never had the pleasure of looking on him even he was a great man they may talk of their jeffersons and jacksons but i set down washington and natty bumppo as the two only really great men of my time  what do you think of bonaparte commodore inquired paul  well sir bonaparte had some strong points about him i do really believe but he could have been nothing to the leatherstocking in the woods its no great matter young gentleman to be a great man among your inhabitants of citieswhat i call umbrella people why natty was almost as great with the spear as with the rifle though i never heard that he got a sight of the sogdollager  we shall meet again this summer commodore said john effingham the ladies wish to hear the echoes and we must leave you  all very natural mr john returned the commodore laughing and again flourishing his hand in his own peculiar manner the women all love to hear the echoes for they are not satisfied with what they have once said but they like to hear it over again i never knew a lady come on the otsego but one of the first things she did was to get paddled to the speaking rocks to have a chat with herself they come out in such numbers sometimes and then all talk at once in a way quite to confuse the echo i suppose you have heard young lady the opinion people have now got concerning these voices  i cannot say i have ever heard more than that they are some of the most perfect echoes known answered eve turning her body so as to face the old man as the skiff of the party passed that of the veteran fisherman  some people maintain that there is no echo at all and that the sounds we hear come from the spirit of the leatherstocking which keeps about its old haunts and repeats every thing we say in mockery of our invasion of the woods i do not say this notion is true or that it is my own but we all know that natty did dislike to see a new settler arrive in the mountains and that he loved a tree as a muskrat loves water they show a pine up here on the side of the vision which he notched at every newcomer until reaching seventeen his honest old heart could go no farther and he gave the matter up in despair  this is so poetical commodore it is a pity it cannot be true i like this explanation of the speaking rocks much better than that implied by the name of fairy spring  you are quite right young lady called out the fisherman as the boats separated still farther there never was any fairy known in otsego but the time has been when we could boast of a natty bumppo  here the commodore flourished his hand again and eve nodded her adieus the skiff of the party continued to pull slowly along the fringed shore occasionally sheering more into the lake to avoid some overhanging and nearly horizontal tree and then returning so closely to the land as barely to clear the pebbles of the narrow strand with the oar  eve thought she had never beheld a more wild or beautifully variegated foliage than that which the whole leafy mountainside presented more than half of the forest of tall solemn pines that had veiled the earth when the country was first settled had already disappeared but agreeably to one of the mysterious laws by which nature is governed a rich second growth that included nearly every variety of american wood had shot up in their places the rich rembrandtlike hemlocks in particular were perfectly beautiful contrasting admirably with the livelier tints of the various deciduous trees here and there some flowering shrub rendered the picture gay while masses of the rich chestnut in blossom lay in clouds of natural glory among the dark tops of the pines  the gentlemen pulled the light skiff fully a mile under this overhanging foliage occasionally frightening some migratory bird from a branch or a waterfowl from the narrow strand at length john effingham desired them to cease rowing and managing the skiff for a minute or two with the paddle which he had used in steering he desired the whole party to look up announcing to them that they were beneath the silent pine  a common exclamation of pleasure succeeded the upward glance for it is seldom that a tree is seen to more advantage than that which immediately attracted every eye the pine stood on the bank with its roots embedded in the earth a few feet higher than the level of the lake but in such a situation as to bring the distance above the water into the apparent height of the tree like all of its kind that grows in the dense forests of america its increase for a thousand years had been upward and it now stood in solitary glory a memorial of what the mountains which were yet so rich in vegetation had really been in their days of nature and pride for near a hundred feet above the eye the even round trunk was branchless and then commenced the darkgreen masses of foliage which clung around the stem like smoke ascending in wreaths the tall columnlike tree had inclined to wards the light when struggling among its fellows and it now so far overhung the lake that its summit may have been some ten or fifteen feet without the base a gentle graceful curve added to the effect of this variation from the perpendicular and infused enough of the fearful into the grand to render the picture sublime although there was not a breath of wind on the lake the currents were strong enough above the forest to move this lofty object and it was just possible to detect a slight graceful yielding of the very uppermost boughs to the passing air  this pine is illnamed cried sir george templemore for it is the most eloquent tree eye of mine has ever looked on  it is indeed eloquent answered eve one hears it speak even now of the fierce storms that have whistled round its topsof the seasons that have passed since it extricated that verdant cap from the throng of sisters that grew beneath it and of all that has passed on the otsego when this limpid lake lay like a gem embedded in the forest when the conqueror first landed in england this tree stood on the spot where it now stands here then is at last an american antiquity  a true and regulated taste miss effingham said paul has pointed out to you one of the real charms of the country were we to think less of the artificial and more of our natural excellencies we should render ourselves less liable to criticism  eve was never inattentive when paul spoke and her colour heightened as he paid this compliment to her taste but still her soft blue eye was riveted on the pine  silent it may be in one respect but it is indeed all eloquence in another she resumed with a fervour that was not lessened by pauls remark that crest of verdure which resembles a plume of feathers speaks of a thousand things to the imagination  i have never known a person of any poetry who came under this tree said john effingham that did not fall into this very train of thought i once brought a man celebrated for his genius here and after gazing for a minute or two at the high green tuft that tops the tree he exclaimed that mass of green waved there in the fierce light when columbus first ventured into the unknown sea it is indeed eloquent for it tells the same glowing tale to all who approach ita tale fraught with feeling and recollections  and yet its silence is after all its eloquence added paul and the name is not so misplaced as one might at first think  it probably obtained its name from some fancied contrast to the garrulous rocks that lie up yonder half concealed by the forest if you will ply the oars gentlemen we will now hold a little communion with the spirit of the leatherstocking  the young men complied and in about five minutes the skiff was off in the lake at the distance of fifty rods from the shore where the whole mountainside came at one glance into the view here they lay on their oars and john effingham called out to the rocks a good morning in a clear distinct voice the mocking sounds were thrown back again with a closeness of resemblance that actually startled the novice then followed other calls and other repetitions of the echoes which did not lose the minutest intonation of the voice  this actually surpasses the celebrated echoes of the rhine cried the delighted eve for though those do give the strains of the bugle so clearly i do not think they answer to the voice with so much fidelity  you are very right eve replied her kinsman for i can recall no place where so perfect and accurate an echo is to be heard as at these speaking rocks by increasing our distance to half a mile and using a bugle as i well know from actual experiment we should get back entire passages of an air the interval between the sound and the echo too would be distinct and would give time for an undivided attention whatever may be said of the pine these rocks are most aptly named and if the spirit of leatherstocking has any concern with the matter he is a mocking spirit  john effingham now looked at his watch and then he explained to the party a pleasure he had in store for them on a sort of small public promenade that lay at the point where the river flowed out of the lake stood a rude shell of a building that was called the gun house here a speaking picture of the entire security of the country from foes within as well as from foes without were kept two or three pieces of field artillery with doors so open that any one might enter the building and even use the guns at will although they properly belonged to the organized corps of the state  one of these guns had been sent a short distance down the valley and john effingham informed his companions that they might look momentarily for its reports to arouse the echoes of the mountains he was still speaking when the gun was fired its muzzle being turned eastward the sound first reached the side of the vision abreast of the village whence the reverberations reissued and rolled along the range from cave to cave and cliff to cliff and wood to wood until they were lost like distant thunder two or three leagues to the northward the experiment was thrice repeated and always with the same magnificent effect the western hills actually echoing the echoes of the eastern mountains like the dying strains of some falling music  such a locality would be a treasure in the vicinity of a melo dramatic theatre said paul laughing for certainly no artificial thunder i have ever heard has equalled this this sheet of water might even receive a gondola  and yet i fear one accustomed to the boundless horizon of the ocean might in time weary of it answered john effingham significantly  paul made no answer and the party rowed away in silence  yonder is the spot where we have so long been accustomed to resort for picnics said eve pointing out a lovely place that was beautifully shaded by old oaks and on which stood a rude house that was much dilapidated and indeed injured by the hands of man john effingham smiled as his cousin showed the place to her companions promising them an early and a nearer view of its beauties  by the way miss effingham he said i suppose you flatter yourself with being the heiress of that desirable retreat  it is very natural that at some day though i trust a very distant one i should succeed to that which belongs to my dear father  both natural and legal my fair cousin but you are yet to learn that there is a power that threatens to rise up and dispute your claim  what powerhuman power at leastcan dispute the lawful claim of an owner to his property that point has been ours ever since civilized man has dwelt among these hills who will presume to rob us of it  you will be much surprised to discover that there is such a power and that there is actually a disposition to exercise it the public the allpowerful omnipotent overruling lawmaking lawbreaking publichas a passing caprice to possess itself of your beloved point and ned effingham must show unusual energy or it will get it  are you serious cousin jack  as serious as the magnitude of the subject can render a responsible being as mr dodge would say  eve said no more but she looked vexed and remained almost silent until they landed when she hastened to seek her father with a view to communicate what she had heard mr effingham listened to his daughter as he always did with tender interest and when she had done he kissed her glowing cheek bidding her not to believe that which she seemed so seriously to dread possible  but cousin john would not trifle with me on such a subject father eve continued he knows how much i prize all those little heirlooms that are connected with the affections  we can inquire further into the affair my child if it be your desire ring for pierre if you please  pierre answered and a message was sent to mr bragg requiring his presence in the library  aristabulus appeared by no means in the best humour for he disliked having been omitted in the late excursion on the lake fancying that he had a communityright to share in all his neighbours amusements though he had sufficient selfcommand to conceal his feelings  i wish to know sir mr effingham commenced without introduction whether there can be any mistake concerning the ownership of the fishing point on the west side of the lake  certainly not sir it belongs to the public  mr effinghams cheek glowed and he looked astonished but he remained calm  the public do you gravely affirm mr bragg that the public pretends to claim that point  claim mr effingham as long as i have resided in this county i have never heard its right disputed  your residence in this county sir is not of very ancient date and nothing is easier than that you may be mistaken i confess some curiosity to know in what manner the public has acquired its title to the spot you are a lawyer mr bragg and may give an intelligible account of it  why sir your father gave it to them in his lifetime every body in all this region will tell you as much as this  do you suppose mr bragg there is any body in all this region who will swear to the fact proof you well know is very requisite even to obtain justice  i much question sir if there be any body in all this region that will not swear to the fact it is the common tradition of the whole country and to be frank with you sir there is a little displeasure because mr john effingham has talked of giving private entertainments on the point  this then only shows how idly and inconsiderately the traditions of the country take their rise but as i wish to understand all the points of the case do me the favour to walk into the village and inquire of those whom you think the best informed in the matter what they know of the point in order that i may regulate my course accordingly be particular if you please on the subject of title as one would not wish to move in the dark  aristabulus quitted the house immediately and eve perceiving that things were in the right train left her father alone to meditate on what had just passed mr effingham walked up and down his library for some time much disturbed for the spot in question was identified with all his early feelings and recollections and if there were a foot of land on earth to which he was more attached than to all others next to his immediate residence it was this still he could not conceal from himself in despite of his opposition to john effinghams sarcasms that his native country had undergone many changes since he last resided in it and that some of these changes were quite sensibly for the worse the spirit of misrule was abroad and the lawless and unprincipled held bold language when it suited their purpose to intimidate as he ran over in his mind however the facts of the case and the nature of his right he smiled to think that any one should contest it and sat down to his writing almost forgetting that there had been any question at all on the unpleasant subject  aristabulus was absent for several hours nor did he return until mr effingham was dressed for dinner and alone in the library again having absolutely lost all recollection of the commission he had given his agent  it is as i told you sirthe public insists that it owns the point and i feel it my duty to say mr effingham that the public is determined to maintain its claim  then mr bragg it is proper i should tell the public that it is not the owner of the point but that i am its owner and that i am determined to maintain my claim  it is hard to kick against the pricks mr effingham  it is so sir as the public will discover if it persevere in invading a private right  why sir some of those with whom i have conversed have gone so far as to desire me to tell youi trust my motive will not be mistaken  if you have any communication to make mr bragg do it without reserve it is proper i should know the truth exactly  well then sir i am the bearer of something like a defiance the people wish you to know that they hold your right cheaply and that they laugh at it not to mince matters they defy you  i thank you for this frankness mr bragg and increases my respect for your character affairs are now at such a pass that it is necessary to act if you will amuse yourself with a book for a moment i shall have further occasion for your kindness  aristabulus did not read for he was too much filled with wonder at seeing a man so coolly set about contending with that awful public which he himself as habitually deferred to as any asiatic slave defers to his monarch indeed nothing but his being sustained by that omnipotent power as he viewed the power of the public to be had emboldened him to speak so openly to his employer for aristabulus felt a secret confidence that right or wrong it was always safe in america to make the most fearless professions in favour of the great body of the community in the mean time mr effingham wrote a simple advertisement against trespassing on the property in question and handed it to the other with a request that he would have it inserted in the number of the village paper that was to appear next morning mr bragg took the advertisement and went to execute the duty without comment  the evening arrived before mr effingham was again alone when being by himself in the library once more mr bragg entered full of his subject he was followed by john effingham who had gained an inkling of what had passed  i regret to say mr effingham aristabulus commenced that your advertisement has created one of the greatest excitements it has ever been my illfortune to witness in templeton  all of which ought to be very encouraging to us mr bragg as men under excitement are usually wrong  very true sir as regards individual excitement but this is a public excitement  i am not at all aware that the fact in the least alters the case if one excited man is apt to do silly things half a dozen backers will be very likely to increase his folly  aristabulus listened with wonder for excitement was one of the means for effecting public objects so much practised by men of his habits that it had never crossed his mind any single individual could be indifferent to its effect to own the truth he had anticipated so much unpopularity from his unavoidable connexion with the affair as to have contributed himself in producing the excitement with the hope of choking mr effingham off as he had elegantly expressed it to one of his intimates in the vernacular of the country  a public excitement is a powerful engine mr effingham he exclaimed in a sort of politico pious horror  i am fully aware sir that it may be even a fearfully powerful engine excited men acting in masses compose what are called mobs and have committed a thousand excesses  your advertisement is to the last degree disrelished to be very sincere it is awfully unpopular  i suppose it is always what you term an unpopular act so far as the individuals opposed are concerned to resist aggression  but they call your advertisement aggression sir  in that simple fact exist all the merits of the question if i own this property the public or that portion of it which is connected with this affair are aggressors and so much more in the wrong that they are many against one if they own the property i am not only wrong but very indiscreet  the calmness with which mr effingham spoke had an effect on aristabulus and for a moment he was staggered it was only for a moment however as the pains and penalties of unpopularity presented themselves afresh to an imagination that had been so long accustomed to study the popular caprice that it had got to deem the public favour the one great good of life  but they say they own the point mr effingham  and i say they do not own the point mr bragg never did own it and with my consent never shall own it  this is purely a matter of fact observed john effingham and i confess i am curious to know how or whence this potent public derives its title you are lawyer enough mr bragg to know that the public can hold property only by use or by especial statute now under which title does this claim present itself  first by use sir and then by especial gift  the use you are aware must be adverse or as opposed to the title of the other claimants now i am a living witness that my late uncle permitted the public to use this point and that the public accepted the conditions its use therefore has not been adverse or at least not for a time sufficient to make title every hour that my cousin has permitted the public to enjoy his property adds to his right as well as to the obligation conferred on that public and increases the duty of the latter to cease intruding whenever he desires it if there is an especial gift as i understand you to say from my late uncle there must also be a law to enable the public to hold or a trustee which is the fact  i admit mr john effingham that i have seen neither deed nor law and i doubt if the latter exist still the public must have some claim for it is impossible that every body should be mistaken  nothing is easier nor any thing more common than for whole communities to be mistaken and more particularly when they commence with excitement  while his cousin was speaking mr effingham went to a secretary and taking out a large bundle of papers he laid it down on the table unfolding several parchment deeds to which massive seals bearing the arms of the late colony as well as those of england were pendent  here are my titles sir he said addressing aristabulus pointedly if the public has a better let it be produced and i shall at once submit to its claim  no one doubts that the king through his authorized agent the governor of the colony of newyork granted this estate to your predecessor mr effingham or that it descended legally to your immediate parent but all contend that your parent gave this spot to the public as a spot of public resort  i am glad that the question is narrowed down within limits that are so easily examined what evidence is there of this intention on the part of my late father  common report i have talked with twenty people in the village and they all agree that the point has been used by the public as public property from time immemorial  will you be so good mr bragg as to name some of those who affirm this  mr bragg complied naming quite the number of persons he had mentioned with a readiness that proved he thought he was advancing testimony of weight  of all the names you have mentioned returned mr effingham i never heard but three and these are the names of mere boys the first dozen are certainly the names of persons who can know no more of this village than they have gleaned in the last few years and several of them i understand have dwelt among us but a few weeks nay days  have i not told you ned interrupted john effingham that an american always means eighteen months and that time immemorial is only since the last general crisis in the money market  the persons i have mentioned compose a part of the population sir added mr bragg and one and all they are ready to swear that your father by some means or other they are not very particular as to minutiae gave them the right to use this property  they are mistaken and i should be sorry that any one among them should swear to such a falsehood but here are my titleslet them show better or if they can any indeed  perhaps your father abandoned the place to the public this might make a good claim  that he did not i am a living proof to the contrary he left it to his heirs at his death and i myself exercised full right of ownership over it until i went abroad i did not travel with it in my pocket sir it is true but i left it to the protection of the laws which i trust are as available to the rich as to the poor although this is a free country  well sir i suppose a jury must determine the point as you seem firm though i warn you mr effingham as one who knows his country that a verdict in the face of a popular feeling is rather a hopeless matter if they prove that your late father intended to abandon or give this property to the public your case will be lost  mr effingham looked among the papers a moment and selecting one he handed it to mr bragg first pointing out to his notice a particular paragraph  this sir is my late fathers will mr effingham said mildly and in that particular clause you will find that he makes a special devise of this very point leaving it to his heirs in such terms as to put any intention to give it to the public quite out of the question this at least is the latest evidence i his only son executor and heir possess of his final wishes if that wondering and timeimmemorial public of which you speak has a better i wait with patience that it may be produced  the composed manner of mr effingham had deceived aristabulus who did not anticipate any proof so completely annihilating to the pretensions of the public as that he now held in his hand it was a simple brief devise disposing of the piece of property in question and left it without dispute that mr effingham had succeeded to all the rights of his father with no reservation or condition of any sort  this is very extraordinary exclaimed mr bragg when he had read the clause seven times each perusal contributing to leave the case still clearer in favour of his employer the individual and still stronger against the hopedfor future employers the people the public ought to know of this bequest of the late mr effingham  i think it ought sir before it pretended to deprive his child of his property or rather it ought to be certain at least that there was no such devise  you will excuse me mr effingham but i think it is incumbent on a private citizen in a case of this sort when the public has taken up a wrong notion as i now admit is clearly the fact as regards the point to enlighten it and to inform it that it does not own the spot  this has been done already mr bragg in the advertisement you had the goodness to carry to the printers although i deny that there exists any such obligation  but sir they object to the mode you have chosen to set them right  the mode is usual i believe in the case of trespasses  they expect something different sir in an affair in which the public isisisall  wrong put in john effingham pointedly i have heard something of this out of doors ned and blame you for your moderation is it true that you had told several of your neighbours that you have no wish to prevent them from using the point but that your sole object is merely to settle the question of right and to prevent intrusions on your family when it is enjoying its own place of retirement  certainly john my only wish is to preserve the property for those to whom it is especially devised to allow those who have the best nay the only right to it its undisturbed possession occasionally and to prevent any more of that injury to the trees that has been committed by some of those rude men who always fancy themselves so completely all the public as to be masters in their own particular persons whenever the public has any claim i can have no wish to deprive my neighbours of the innocent pleasure of visiting the point though i am fully determined they shall not deprive me of my property  you are far more indulgent than i should be or perhaps than you will be yourself when you read this  as john effingham spoke he handed his kinsman a small handbill which purported to call a meeting for that night of the inhabitants of templeton to resist his arrogant claim to the disputed property this handbill had the usual marks of a feeble and vulgar malignancy about it affecting to call mr effingham one mr effingham and it was anonymous  this is scarcely worth our attention john said mr effingham mildly meetings of this sort cannot decide a legal title and no man who respects himself will be the tool of so pitiful an attempt to frighten a citizen from maintaining his rights  i agree with you as respects the meeting which has been conceived in ignorance and low malice and will probably end as all such efforts end in ridicule but  excuse me mr john interrupted aristabulus there is an awful excitement some have even spoken of lynching  then said mr effingham it does indeed require that we should be more firm do you sir know of any person who has dared to use such a menace  aristabulus quailed before the stern eye of mr effingham and he regretted having communicated so much though he had communicated nothing but the truth he stammered out an obscure and half intelligible explanation and proposed to attend the meeting in person in order that he might be in the way of understanding the subject without falling into the danger of mistake to this mr effingham assented as he felt too indignant at this outrage on all his rights whether as a citizen or a man to wish to pursue the subject with his agent that night aristabulus departed and john effingham remained closeted with his kinsman until the family retired during this long interview the former communicated many things to the latter in relation to this very affair of which the owner of the property until then had been profoundly ignorant  chapter xv    there shall be in england seven halfpenny loaves sold for a   penny the threehooped pot shall have ten hoops and i will make   it felony to drink small beer all the realm shall be in common   and in cheapside shall my palfrey go to grassjack cade  though the affair of the point continued to agitate the village of templeton next day and for many days it was little remembered in the wigwam confident of his right mr effingham though naturally indignant at the abuse of his long liberality through which alone the public had been permitted to frequent the place and this too quite often to his own discomfort and disappointment had dismissed the subject temporarily from his mind and was already engaged in his ordinary pursuits not so however with mr bragg agreeably to promise he had attended the meeting and now he seemed to regulate all his movements by a sort of mysterious selfimportance as if the repository of some secret of unusual consequence no one regarded his manner however for aristabulus and his secrets and opinions were all of too little value in the eyes of most of the party to attract peculiar attention he found a sympathetic listener in mr dodge happily that person having been invited through the courtesy of mr effingham to pass the day with those in whose company though very unwillingly on the editors part certainly he had gone through so many dangerous trials these two then soon became intimate and to have seen their shrugs significant whisperings and frequent conferences in corners one who did not know them might have fancied their shoulders burthened with the weight of the state  but all this pantomime which was intended to awaken curiosity was lost on the company in general the ladies attended by paul and the baronet proceeded into the forest on foot for a mornings walk while the two messrs effinghams continued to read the daily journals that were received from town each morning with a most provoking indifference neither aristabulus nor mr dodge could resist any longer and after exhausting their ingenuity in the vain effort to induce one of the two gentlemen to question them in relation to the meeting of the previous night the desire to be doing fairly overcame their affected mysteriousness and a formal request was made to mr effingham to give them an audience in the library as the latter who suspected the nature of the interview requested his kinsman to make one in it the four were soon alone in the apartment so often named  even now that his own request for the interview was granted aristabulus hesitated about proceeding until a mild intimation from mr effingham that he was ready to hear his communication told the agent that it was too late to change his determination  i attended the meeting last night mr effingham aristabulus commenced agreeably to our arrangement and i feel the utmost regret at being compelled to lay the result before a gentleman for whom i entertain so profound a respect  there was then a meeting said mr effingham inclining his body slightly by way of acknowledgment for the others compliment  there was sir and i think mr dodge we may say an overflowing one  the public was fairly represented returned the editor as many as fifty or sixty having been present  the public has a perfect right to meet and to consult on its claims to anything it may conceive itself entitled to enjoy observed mr effingham i can have no possible objection to such a course though i think it would have consulted its own dignity more had it insisted on being convoked by more respectable persons than those who i understand were foremost in this affair and in terms better suited to its own sense of propriety  aristabulus glanced at mr dodge and mr dodge glanced back at mr bragg for neither of these political mushrooms could conceive of the dignity and fairmindedness with which a gentleman could view an affair of this nature  they passed a set of resolutions mr effingham aristabulus resumed with the gravity with which he ever spoke of things of this nature a set of resolutions sir  that was to be expected returned his employer smiling the americans are a setofresolutionspassing people three cannot get together without naming a chairman and secretary and a resolution is as much a consequence of such an organizationi believe that is the approved wordas an egg is the accompaniment of the cackling of a hen  but sir you do not yet know the nature of those resolutions  very true mr bragg that is a piece of knowledge i am to have the pleasure of obtaining from you  again aristabulus glanced at steadfast and steadfast threw back the look of surprise for to both it was matter of real astonishment that any man should be so indifferent to the resolutions of a meeting that had been regularly organized with a chairman and secretary at its head and which so unequivocally professed to be the public  i am reluctant to discharge this duty mr effingham but as you insist on its performance it must be done in the first place they resolved that your father meant to give them the point  a decision that must clearly settle the matter and which will destroy all my fathers own resolutions on the same subject did they stop at the point mr bragg or did they resolve that my father also gave them his wife and children  no sir nothing was said concerning the latter  i cannot properly express my gratitude for the forbearance as they had just as good a right to pass this resolution as to pass the other  the publics is an awful power mr effingham  indeed it is sir but fortunately that of the republic is still more awful and i shall look to the latter for support in this crisisthat is the word too is it not mr john effingham  if you mean a change of administration the upsetting of a stage or the death of a carthorse they are all equally crisises in the american vocabulary  well mr bragg having resolved that it knew my late fathers intentions better than he knew them himself as is apparent from the mistake he made in his will what next did the public dispose of in the plenitude of its power  it resolved sir that it was your duty to carry out the intentions of your father  in that then we are perfectly of a mind as the public will most probably discover before we get through with this matter this is one of the most pious resolutions i ever knew the public to pass did it proceed any farther  mr bragg notwithstanding the longencouraged truckling to the sets of men whom he was accustomed to dignify with the name of the public had a profound deference or the principles character and station of mr effingham that no sophistry or selfencouragement in the practices of social confusion could overcome and he paused before he communicated the next resolution to his employers but perceiving that both the latter and his cousin were quietly waiting to hear it he was fain to overcome his scruples  they have openly libelled you by passing resolutions declaring you to be odious  that indeed is a strong measure and in the interest of good manners and of good morals it may call for a rebuke no one can care less than myself mr bragg for the opinions of those who have sufficiently demonstrated that their opinions are of no value by the heedless manner in which they have permitted themselves to fall into this error but it is proceeding too far when a few members of the community presume to take these liberties with a private individual and that moreover in a case affecting a pretended claim of their own and i desire you to tell those concerned that if they dare to publish their resolution declaring me to be odious i will teach them what they now do not appear to know that we live in a country of laws i shall not prosecute them but i shall indict them for the offence and i hope this is plainly expressed  aristabulus stood aghast to indict the public was a step he had never heard of before and he began to perceive that the question actually had two sides still his awe of public meetings and his habitual regard for popularity induced him not to give up the matter without another struggle  they have already ordered their proceedings to be published mr effingham he said as if such an order were not to be countermanded  i fancy sir that when it comes to the issue and the penalties of a prosecution present themselves their readers will begin to recollect their individuality and to think less of their public character they who hunt in droves like wolves are seldom very valiant when singled out from their pack the end will show  i heartily wish this unpleasant affair might be amicably settled added aristabulus  one might indeed fancy so observed john effingham since no one likes to be persecuted  but mr john the public thinks itself persecuted in this affair  the term as applied to a body that not only makes but which executes the law is so palpably absurd that i am surprised any man can presume to use it but mr bragg you have seen documents that cannot err and know that the public has not the smallest right to this bit of land  all very true sir but you will please to remember that the people do not know what i now know  and you will please to remember sir that when people choose to act affirmatively in so highhanded a manner as this they are bound to know what they are about ignorance in such a matter is like the drunkards plea of intoxication it merely makes the offence worse  do you not think mr john that mr effingham might have acquainted these citizens with the real state of the case are the people so very wrong that they have fallen into a mistake  since you ask this question plainly mr bragg it shall be answered with equal sincerity mr effingham is a man of mature years the known child executor and heir of one who it is admitted all round was the master of the controverted property knowing his own business this mr effingham in sight of the grave of his fathers beneath the paternal roof has the intolerable impudence  arrogance is the word jack said mr effingham smiling  aye the intolerable arrogance to suppose that his own is his own and this he dares to affirm without having had the politeness to send his titledeeds and private papers round to those who have been so short a time in the place that they might well know every thing that has occurred in it for the last half century oh thou naughty arrogant fellow ned  mr john you appear to forget that the public has more claims to be treated with attention than a single individual if it has fallen into error it ought to be undeceived  no doubt sir and i advise mr effingham to send you his agent to every man woman and child in the county with the patent of the king all the mesne conveyances and wills in your pocket in order that you may read them at length to each individual with a view that every man woman and child may be satisfied that he or she is not the owner of edward effinghams lands  nay sir a shorter process might be adopted  it might indeed sir and such a process has been adopted by my cousin in giving the usual notice in the newspaper against trespassing but mr bragg you must know that i took great pains three years since when repairing this house to correct the mistake on this very point into which i found that your immaculate public had fallen through its disposition to know more of other peoples affairs than those concerned knew of themselves  aristabulus said no more but gave the matter up in despair on quitting the house he proceeded forthwith to inform those most interested of the determination of mr effingham not to be trampled on by any pretended meeting of the public common sense not to say common honesty began to resume its sway and prudence put in its plea by way of applying the corrective both he and mr dodge however agreed that there was an unheardof temerity in thus resisting the people and this too without a commensurate object as the pecuniary value of the disputed point was of no material consequence to either party  the reader is not by any means to suppose that aristabulus bragg and steadfast dodge belonged to the same variety of the human species in consequence of their unity of sentiment in this affair and certain other general points of resemblance in their manner and modes of thinking as a matter of necessity each partook of those features of caste condition origin and association that characterize their particular set but when it came to the nicer distinctions that mark true individuality it would not have been easy to find two men more essentially different in character the first was bold morally and physically aspiring selfpossessed shrewd singularly adapted to succeed in his schemes where he knew the parties intelligent after his tastes and apt had it been his fortune to be thrown earlier into a better sphere the same natural qualities that rendered him so expert in his present situation would have conduced to his improvement and most probably would have formed a gentleman a scholar and one who could have contributed largely to the welfare and tastes of his fellowcreatures that such was not his fate was more his misfortune than his fault for his plastic character had readily taken the impression of those things that from propinquity alone pressed hardest on it on the other hand steadfast was a hypocrite by nature cowardly envious and malignant and circumstances had only lent their aid to the natural tendencies of his disposition that two men so differently constituted at their births should meet as it might be in a common centre in so many of their habits and opinions was merely the result of accident and education  among the other points of resemblance between these two persons was that fault of confounding the cause with the effects of the peculiar institutions under which they had been educated and lived because the law gave to the public that authority which under other systems is entrusted either to one or to the few they believed the public was invested with far more power than a right understanding of their own principles would have shown in a word both these persons made a mistake which is getting to be too common in america that of supposing the institutions of the country were all means and no end under this erroneous impression they saw only the machinery of the government becoming entirely forgetful that the power which was given to the people collectively was only so given to secure to them as perfect a liberty as possible in their characters of individuals neither had risen sufficiently above vulgar notions to understand that public opinion in order to be omnipotent or even formidable beyond the inflictions of the moment must be right and that if a solitary man renders himself contemptible by taking up false notions inconsiderately and unjustly bodies of men falling into the same error incur the same penalties with the additional stigma of having acted as cowards  there was also another common mistake into which messrs bragg and dodge had permitted themselves to fall through the want of a proper distinction between principles resisting the popular will on the part of an individual they considered arrogance and aristocracy per se without at all entering into the question of the right or the wrong the people rightly enough in the general signification of the term they deemed to be sovereign and they belonged to a numerous class who view disobedience to the sovereign in a democracy although it be in his illegal caprices very much as the subject of a despot views disobedience to his prince  it is scarcely necessary to say that mr effingham and his cousin viewed these matters differently clear headed justminded and liberal in all his practices the former in particular was greatly pained by the recent occurrence and he paced his library in silence for several minutes after mr bragg and his companion had withdrawn really too much grieved to speak  this is altogether a most extraordinary procedure john he at length observed and it strikes me that it is but an indifferent reward for the liberality with which i have permitted others to use my property these thirty years often very often as you well know to my own discomfort and to that of my friends  i have told you ned that you were not to expect the america on your return that you left behind you on your departure for europe i insist that no country has so much altered for the worse in so short a time  that unequalled pecuniary prosperity should sensibly impair the manners of what is termed the world by introducing suddenly lame bodies of uninstructed and untrained men and women into society is a natural consequence of obvious causes that it should corrupt morals even we have a right to expect for we are taught to believe it the most corrupting influence under which men can live but i confess i did not expect to see the day when a body of strangers birds of passage creatures of an hour should assume a right to call on the old and longestablished inhabitants of a country to prove their claims to their possessions and this too in an unusual and unheardof manner under the penalty of being violently deprived of them  long established repeated john effingham laughing what do you term long established have you not been absent a dozen years and do not these people reduce everything to the level of their own habits i suppose now you fancy you can go to rome or jerusalem or constantinople and remain four or five lustres and then come coolly back to templeton and on taking possession of this house again call yourself an old resident  i certainly do suppose i have that right how many english russians and germans did we meet in italy the residents of years who still retained all their natural and local right and feelings  ay that is in countries where society is permanent and men get accustomed to look on the same objects hear the same names and see the same faces for their entire lives i have had the curiosity to inquire and have ascertained that none of the old permanent families have been active in this affair of the point but that all the clamour has been made by those you call the birds of passage but what of that these people fancy everything reduced to the legal six months required to vote and that rotation in persons is as necessary to republicanism as rotation in office  is is not extraordinary that persons who can know so little on the subject should be thus indiscreet and positive  it is not extraordinary in america look about you ned and you will see adventurers uppermost everywhere in the government in your towns in your villages in the country even we are a nation of changes much of this i admit is the fair consequence of legitimate causes as an immense region in forest cannot be peopled on any other conditions but this necessity has infected the entire national character and men get to be impatient of any sameness even though it be useful everything goes to confirm this feeling instead of opposing it the constant recurrences of the elections accustom men to changes in their public functionaries the great increase in the population brings new faces and the sudden accumulations of property place new men in conspicuous stations the architecture of the country is barely becoming sufficiently respectable to render it desirable to preserve the buildings without which we shall have no monuments to revere in short everything contributes to produce such a state of things painful as it may be to all of any feeling and little to oppose it  you colour highly jack and no picture loses in tints in being retouched by you  look into the first paper that offers and you will see the young men of the country hardily invited to meet by themselves to consult concerning public affairs as if they were impatient of the counsels and experience of their fathers no country can prosper where the ordinary mode of transacting the business connected with the root of the government commences with this impiety  this is a disagreeable feature in the national character certainly but we must remember the arts employed by the designing to practise on the inexperienced  had i a son who presumed to denounce the wisdom and experience of his father in this disrespectful mariner i would disinherit the rascal  ah jack bachelors children are notoriously well educated and well mannered we will hope however that time will bring its changes also and that one of them will be a greater constancy in persons things and the affections  time will bring its changes ned but all of them that are connected with individual rights as opposed to popular caprice or popular interests are likely to be in the wrong direction  the tendency is certainly to substitute popularity for the right but we must take the good with the bad even you jack would not exchange this popular oppression for any other system under which you have lived  i dont know thati dont know that of all tyranny a vulgar tyranny is to me the most odious  you used to admire the english system but i think observation has lessened your particular admiration in that quarter said mr effingham smiling in a way that his cousin perfectly understood  harkee ned we all take up false notions in youth and this was one of mine but of the two i should prefer the cold dogged domination of english law with its fruits the heartlessness of a sophistication without parallel to being trampled on by every arrant blackguard that may happen to traverse this valley in his wanderings after dollars there is one thing you yourself must admit the public is a little too apt to neglect the duties it ought to discharge and to assume duties it has no right to fulfil  this remark ended the discourse  chapter xvi    her breast was a brave palace a broad street where all heroic   ample thoughts did meet where nature such a tenement had taen   that other souls to hers dwelt in a lane    john norton  the village of templeton it has been already intimated was a miniature town although it contained within the circle of its houses halfadozen residences with grounds and which were dignified with names as has been also said it did not cover a surface of more than a mile square that disposition to concentration which is as peculiar to an american town as the disposition to diffusion is peculiar to the country population and which seems almost to prescribe that a private dwelling shall have but three windows in front and a facade of twentyfive feet having presided at the birth of this spot as well as at the birth of so many of its predecessors and contemporaries in one of its more retired streets for templeton had its publicity and retirement the latter after a very village fashion however dwelt a widow bewitched of small worldly means five children and of great capacity for circulating intelligence mrs abbott for so was this demirelict called was just on the verge of what is termed the good society of the village the most uneasy of all positions for an ambitious and cidevant pretty woman to be placed in she had not yet abandoned the hope of obtaining a divorce and its suites was singularly nay rabidly devout if we may coin the adverb in her own eyes she was perfection in those of her neighbours slightly objectionable and she was altogether a droll and by no means an unusual compound of piety censoriousness charity proscription gossip kindness meddling illnature and decency  the establishment of mrs abbott like her house was necessarily very small and she kept no servant but a girl she called her help a very suitable appellation by the way as they did most of the work of the mènage in common this girl in addition to cooking and washing was the confidant of all her employers wandering notions of mankind in general and of her neighbours in particular as often helping her mistress in circulating her comments on the latter as in anything else  mrs abbott knew nothing of the effinghams except by a hearsay that got its intelligence from her own school being herself a late arrival in the place she had selected templeton as a residence on account of its cheapness and having neglected to comply with the forms of the world by hesitating about making the customary visit to the wigwam she began to resent in her spirit at least eves delicate forbearance from obtruding herself where agreeably to all usage she had a perfect right to suppose she was not desired it was in this spirit then that she sat conversing with jenny as the maid of all work was called the morning after the conversation related in the last chapter in her snug little parlour sometimes plying her needle and oftener thrusting her head out of a window which commanded a view of the principal street of the place in order to see what her neighbours might be about  this is a most extraordinary course mr effingham has taken concerning the point said mrs abbott and i do hope the people will bring him to his senses why jenny the public has used that place ever since i can remember and i have now lived in templeton quite fifteen monthswhat can induce mr howel to go so often to that barbers shop which stands directly opposite the parlour windows of mrs bennettone would think the man was all beard  i suppose mr howel gets shaved sometimes said the logical jenny  not he or if he does no decent man would think of posting himself before a ladys window to do such a thingorlando furioso calling to her eldest son a boy of eleven run over to mr joness store and listen to what the people are talking about and bring me back the news as soon as any thing worth hearing drops from any body and stop as you come back my son and borrow neighbour browns gridiron jenny it is most time to think of putting over the potatoes  ma cried orlando furioso from the front door mrs abbott being very rigid in requiring that all her children should call her ma being so much behind the age as actually not to know that mother had got to be much the genteeler term of the two ma roared orlando furioso suppose there is no news at mr joness store  then go to the nearest tavern something must be stirring this fine morning and im dying to know what it can possibly be mind you bring something besides the gridiron back with you hurry or never come home again as long as you live as i was saying jenny the right of the public which is our right for we are a part of the public to this point is as clear as day and i am only astonished at the impudence of mr effingham in pretending to deny it i dare say his french daughter has put him up to it they say she is monstrous arrogant  is eve effingham french said jenny studiously avoiding any of the usual terms of civility and propriety by way of showing her breedingwell i had always thought her nothing but templeton born  what signifies where a person was born where they live is the essential thing and eve effingham has lived so long in france that she speaks nothing but broken english and miss debby told me last week that in drawing up a subscription paper for a new cushion to the readingdesk of her people she actually spelt charity carrotty  is that french miss abbott  i rather think it is jenny the french are very niggardly and give their poor carrots to live on and so they have adopted the word i suppose you byansyalzumyann biancaalzumaann  marm  byansyalzumyann who taught you to call me marm is this the way you have learned your catechism say ma this instant  ma  take your bonnet my child and run down to mrs wheatons and ask her if any thing new has turned up about the point this morning and do you hear byansyalzumyann abbotthow the child starts away as if she were sent on a matter of life and death  why ma i want to hear the news too  very likely my dear but by stopping to get your errand you may learn more than by being in such a hurry stop in at mrs greens and ask how the people liked the lecture of the strange parson last eveningand ask her if she can lend me a wateringpot now run and be back as soon as possible never loiter when you carry news child  no one has a right to stop the man i believe miss abbott put in jenny very appositely  that indeed have they not or else we could not calculate the consequences you may remember jenny the pious even had to give up that point public convenience being too strong for them roger demetriusbenjamincalling to a second boy two years younger than his brotheryour eyes are better than minewho are all those people collected together in the street is not mr howel among them  i do not know ma answered rogerdemetriusbenjamin gaping  then run this minute and see and dont stop to look for your hat as you come back step into the tailors shop and ask if your new jacket is most done and what the news is i rather think jenny we shall find out something worth hearing in the course of the day by the way they do say that grace van cortlandt eve effinghams cousin is under concern  well she is the last person i should think would be troubled about any thing for every body says she is so desperate rich she might eat off of silver if she liked and she is sure of being married some time or other  that ought to lighten her concern you think oh it does my heart good when i see any of those flaunty people right well exercised nothing would make me happier than to see eve effingham groaning fairly in the spirit that would teach her to take away the peoples points  but miss abbott then she would become almost as good a woman as you are yourself  i am a miserable graceless awfully wicked sinner twenty times a day do i doubt whether i am actually converted or not sin has got such a hold of my very heartstrings that i sometimes think they will crack before it lets go rinaldorinaldinitimothy my child do you toddle across the way and give my compliments to mrs hulbert and inquire if it be true that young dickson the lawyer is really engaged to aspasia tubbs or not and borrow a skimmer or a tin pot or any thing you can carry for we may want something of the sort in the course of the day i do believe jenny that a worse creature than myself is hardly to be found in templeton  why miss abbott returned jenny who had heard too much of this selfabasement to be much alarmed at it this is giving almost as bad an account of yourself as i heard somebody that i wont name give of you last week  and who is your somebody i should like to know i dare say one no better than a formalist who thinks that reading prayers out of a book kneeling bowing and changing gowns is religion thank heaven im pretty indifferent to the opinions of such people harkee jenny if i thought i was no better than some persons i could name id give the point of salvation up in despair  miss abbott roared a rugged dirtyfaced barefooted boy who entered without knocking and stood in the middle of the room with his hat on with a suddenness that denoted great readiness in entering other peoples possessions miss abbott ma wants to know if you are likely to go from home this week  why what in nature can she want to know that for ordeal bumgrum mrs abbott pronounced this singular name however ordeel  oh she warnts to know  so do i warnt to know and know i will run home this instant and ask your mother why she has sent you here with this message jenny i am much exercised to find out the reason mrs bumgrum should have sent ordeal over with such a question  i did hear that miss bumgrum intended to make a journey herself and she may want your company  here comes ordeal back and we shall soon be out of the clouds what a boy that is for errands he is worth all my sons put together you never see him losing time by going round by the streets but away he goes over the garden fences like a cat or he will whip through a house if standing in his way as if he were its owner should the door happen to be open well ordeal  but ordeal was out of breath and although jenny shook him as if to shake the news out of him and mrs abbott actually shook her fist in her impatience to be enlightened nothing could induce the child to speak until he had recovered his wind  i believe he does it on purpose said the provoked maid  its just like him cried the mistress the very best newscarrier in the village is actually spoilt because he is thickwinded  i wish folks wouldnt make their fences so high ordeal exclaimed the instant he found breath i cant see of what use it is to make a fence people cant climb  what does your mother say cried jenny repeating her shake con amore  ma wants to know miss abbott if you dont intend to use it yourself if you will lend her your name for a few days to go to utica with she says folks dont treat her half as well when she is called bumgrum as when she has another name and she thinks shed like to try yours this time  is that allyou neednt have been so hurried about such a trifle ordeal give my compliments to your mother and tell her she is quite welcome to my name and i hope it will be serviceable to her  she says she is willing to pay for the use of it if you will tell her what the damage will be  oh its not worth while to speak of such a trifle i dare say she will bring it back quite as good as when she took it away i am no such unneighbourly or aristocratical person as to wish to keep my name all to myself tell your mother she is welcome to mine and to keep it as long as she likes and not to say any thing about pay i may want to borrow hers or something else one of these days though to say the truth my neighbours are apt to complain of me as unfriendly and proud for not borrowing as much as a good neighbour ought  ordeal departed leaving mrs abbot in some such condition as that of the man who had no shadow a rap at the door interrupted the further discussion of the old subject and mr steadfast dodge appeared in answer to the permission to enter mr dodge and mrs abbott were congenial spirits in the way of news he living by it and she living on it  you are very welcome mr dodge the mistress of the house commenced i hear you passed the day yesterday up at the effinghamses  why yes mrs abbott the effinghams insisted on it and i could not well get over the sacrifice after having been their shipmate so long besides it is a little relief to talk french when one has been so long in the daily practice of it  i hear there is company at the house  two of our fellowtravellers merely an english baronet and a young man of whom less is known than one could wish he is a mysterious person and i hate mystery mrs abbott  in that then mr dodge you and i are alike i think every thing should be known indeed that is not a free country in which there are any secrets i keep nothing from my neighbours and to own the truth i do not like my neighbours to keep any thing from me  then youll hardly like the effinghams for i never yet met with a more closemouthed family although i was so long in the ship with miss eve i never heard her once speak of her want of appetite of seasickness or of any thing relating to her ailings even no can you imagine how close she is on the subject of the beaux i do not think i ever heard her use the word or so much as allude to any walk or ride she ever took with a single man i set her down mrs abbott as unqualifiedly artful  that you may with certainty sir for there is no more sure sign that a young woman is all the while thinking of the beaux than her never mentioning them  that i believe to be human nature no ingenuous person ever thinks much of the particular subject of conversation what is your opinion mrs abbott of the contemplated match at the wigwam  match exclaimed mrs abbottwhat already it is the most indecent thing i ever heard of why mr dodge the family has not been home a fortnight and to think so soon of getting married it is quite as bad as a widowers marrying within the month  mrs abbott made a distinction habitually between the cases of widowers and widows as the first she maintained might get married whenever they pleased and the latter only when they got offers and she felt just that sort of horror of a mans thinking of marrying too soon after the death of his wife as might be expected in one who actually thought of a second husband before the first was dead  why yes returned steadfast it is a little premature perhaps though they have been long acquainted still as you say it would be more decent to wait and see what may turn up in a country that to them may be said to be a foreign land  but who are the parties mr dodge  miss eve effingham and mr john effingham  mr john effingham exclaimed the lady who had lent her name to a neighbour aghast for this was knocking one of her own daydreams in the head well this is too much but he shall not marry her sir the law will prevent it and we live in a country of laws a man cannot marry his own niece  it is excessively improper and ought to be put a stop to and yet these effinghams do very much as they please  i am very sorry to hear that they are extremely disagreeable said mrs abbott with a look of eager inquiry as if afraid the answer might be in the negative  as much so as possible they have hardly a way that you would like my dear maam and are as closemouthed as if they were afraid of committing themselves  desperate bad newscarriers i am told mr dodge there is dorindy dorinda mudge who was employed there by eve and grace one day she tells me she tried all she could to get them to talk by speaking of the most common things things that one of my children knew all about such as the affairs of the neighbourhood and how people are getting on and though they would listen a little and that is something i admit not a syllable could she get in the way of answer or remark she tells me that several times she had a mind to quit for it is monstrous unpleasant to associate with your tonguetied folks  i dare say miss effingham could throw out a hint now and then concerning the voyage and her late fellowtravellers said steadfast casting an uneasy glance at his companion  not she dorindy maintains that it is impossible to get a sentiment out of her concerning a single fellowcreature when she talked of the late unpleasant affair of poor neighbour bronsons familya melancholy transaction that mr dodge and i shouldnt wonder if it went to nigh break mrs bronsons heartbut when dorindy mentioned this which is bad enough to stir the sensibility of a frog neither of my young ladies replied or put a single question in this respect grace is as bad as eve and eve is as bad as grace they say instead of so much as seeming to wish to know any more what does my miss eve do but turn to some daubs of paintings and point out to her cousin what she was pleased to term peculiarities in swiss usages then the two hussies would talk of nature our beautiful nature dorindy says eve had the impudence to call it and as if human nature and its failings and backsliding wore not a fitter subject for a young womans discourse than a silly conversation about lakes and rocks and trees and as if she owned the nature about templeton it is my opinion mr dodge that downright ignorance is at the bottom of it all for dorindy says that they actually know no more of the intricacies of the neighbourhood than if they lived in japan  all pride mrs abbott rank pride they feel themselves too great to enter into the minutiae of common folks concerns i often tried miss effingham coming from england and things touching private interests that i know she did and must understand she always disdainfully refused to enter into oh she is a real tartar in her way and what she does not wish to do you never can make her do  have you heard that grace is under concern  not a breath of it under whose preaching was she sitting mrs abbott  that is more than i can tell you not under the church parsons ill engage no one ever heard of a real active regenerating soul reviving spiritgroaning and fruityielding conversion under his ministry  no there is very little unction in that persuasion generally how cold and apathetic they are in these soulstirring times not a sinner has been writhing on their floor ill engage nor a wretch transferred into a saint in the twinkling of an eye by that parson well we have every reason to be grateful mrs abbott  that we have for most glorious have been our privileges to be sure that is a sinful pride that can puff up a wretched sinful being like eve effingham to such a pass of conceit as to induce her to think she is raised above thinking of and taking an interest in the affairs of her neighbours now for my part conversion has so far opened my heart that i do actually feel as if i wanted to know all about the meanest creature in templeton  thats the true spirit mrs abbott stick to that and your redemption is secure i only edit a newspaper by way of showing an interest in mankind  i hope mr dodge the press does not mean to let this matter of the point sleep the press is the true guardian of the public rights and i can tell you the whole community looks to it for support in this crisis  we shall not fail to do our duty said mr dodge looking over his shoulder and speaking lower what shall one insignificant individual who has not a single right above that of the meanest citizen in the county oppress this great and powerful community what if mr effingham does own this point of land  but he does not own it interrupted mrs abbott ever since i have known templeton the public has owned it the public moreover says it owns it and what the public says in this happy country is law  but allowing that the public does not own  it does own it mr dodge the nameless repeated positively  well maam own or no own this is not a country in which the press ought to be silent when a solitary individual undertakes to trample on the public leave that matter to us mrs abbott it is in good hands and shall be well taken care of  im piously glad of it  i mention this to you as to a friend continued mr dodge cautiously drawing from his pocket a manuscript which he prepared to read to his companion who sat with a devouring curiosity ready to listen  the manuscript of mr dodge contained a professed account of the affair of the point it was written obscurely and was not without its contradictions but the imagination of mrs abbott supplied all the vacuums and reconciled all the contradictions the article was so liberal of its professions of contempt for mr effingham that every rational man was compelled to wonder why a quality that is usually so passive should in this particular instance be aroused to so sudden and violent activity in the way of facts not one was faithfully stated and there were several deliberate unmitigated falsehoods which went essentially to colour the whole account  i think this will answer the purpose said steadfast and we have taken means to see that it shall be well circulated  this will do them good cried mrs abbott almost breathless with delight i hope folks will believe it  no fear of that if it were a party thing now one half would believe it as a matter of course and the other half would not believe it as a matter of course but in a private matter lord bless you maam people are always ready to believe any thing that will give them something to talk about  here the tête à tête was interrupted by the return of mrs abbotts different messengers all of whom unlike the dove sent forth from the ark brought back something in the way of hopes the point was a general theme and though the several accounts flatly contradicted each other mrs abbott in the general benevolence of her pious heart found the means to extract corroboration of her wishes from each  mr dodge was as good as his word and the account appeared the press throughout the country seized with avidity on any thing that helped to fill its columns no one appeared disposed to inquire into the truth of the account or after the character of the original authority it was in print and that struck the great majority of the editors and their readers as a sufficient sanction few indeed were they who lived so much under a proper selfcontrol as to hesitate and this rank injustice was done a private citizen as much without moral restraint as without remorse by those who to take their own accounts of the matter were the regular and habitual champions of human rights  john effingham pointed out this extraordinary scene of reckless wrong to his wondering cousin with the cool sarcasm with which he was apt to assail the weaknesses and crimes of the country his firmness united to that of his cousin however put a stop to the publication of the resolutions of aristabuluss meeting and when a sufficient time had elapsed to prove that these prurient denouncers of their fellowcitizens had taken wit in their anger he procured them and had them published himself as the most effectual means of exposing the real character of the senseless mob that had thus disgraced liberty by assuming its professions and its usages  to an observer of men the end of this affair presented several strong points for comment as soon as the truth became generally known in reference to the real ownership and the public came to ascertain that instead of hitherto possessing a right it had in fact been merely enjoying a favour those who had commit ted themselves by their arrogant assumptions of facts and their indecent outrages fell back on their selflove and began to find excuses for their conduct in that of the other party mr effingham was loudly condemned for not having done the very thing he in truth had done viz telling the public it did not own his property and when this was shown to be an absurdity the complaint followed that what he had done had been done in precisely such a mode although it was the mode constantly used by every one else from these vague and indefinite accusations those most implicated in the wrong began to deny all their own original assertions by insisting that they had known all along that mr effingham owned the property but that they did not choose he or any other man should presume to tell them what they knew already in short the end of this affair exhibited human nature in its usual aspects of prevarication untruth contradiction and inconsistency notwithstanding the high profession of liberty made by those implicated and they who had been the most guilty of wrong were loudest in their complaints as if they alone had suffered  this is not exhibiting the country to us certainly after so long an absence in its best appearance said mr effingham i must admit john but error belongs to all regions and to all classes of institutions  ay ned make the best of it as usual but if you do not come round to my way of thinking before you are a twelvemonth older i shall renounce prophesying i wish we could get at the bottom of miss effinghams thoughts on this occasion  miss effingham has been grieved disappointed nay shocked said eve but still she will not despair of the republic none of our respectable neighbours in the first place have shared in this transaction and that is something though i confess i feel some surprise that any considerable portion of a community that respects itself should quietly allow an ignorant fragment of its own numbers to misrepresent it so grossly in an affair that so nearly touches its own character for common sense and justice  you have yet to learn miss effingham that men can get to be so saturated with liberty that they become insensible to the nicer feelings the grossest enormities are constantly committed in this good republic of ours under the pretence of being done by the public and for the public the public have got to bow to that bugbear quite as submissively as gesler would have wished the swiss to bow to his own cap as to the cap of rodolphs substitute men will have idols and the americans have merely set up themselves  and you cousin jack you would be wretched were you doomed to live under a system less free i fear you have the affectation of sometimes saying that which you do not exactly feel  chapter xvii    come these are no times to think of dreams   well talk of dreams hereafter    shakspeare  the day succeeding that in which the conversation just mentioned occurred was one of great expectation and delight in the wigwam mrs hawker and the bloomfields were expected and the morning passed away rapidly under the gay buoyancy of the feelings that usually accompany such anticipations in a countryhouse the travellers were to leave town the previous evening and though the distance was near two hundred and thirty miles they were engaged to arrive by the usual dinner hour in speed the americans so long as they follow the great routes are unsurpassed and even sir george templemore coming as he did from a country of macadamized roads and excellent posting expressed his surprise when given to understand that a journey of this length near a hundred miles of which were by land moreover was to be performed in twentyfour hours the stops included  one particularly likes this rapid travelling he remarked when it is to bring us such friends as mrs hawker  and mrs bloomfield added eve quickly i rest the credit of the american females on mrs bloomfield  more so than on mrs hawker miss effingham  not in all that is amiable respectable feminine and ladylike but certainly more so in the way of mind i know sir george templemore as a european what your opinion is of our sex in this country  good heaven my dear miss effinghammy opinion of your sex in america it is impossible for any one to entertain a higher opinion of your countrywomenas i hope to showas i trust my respect and admiration have always provednay powis you as an american will exonerate me from this want of tastejudgmentfeeling  paul laughed but told the embarrassed and really distressed baronet that he should leave him in the very excellent hands into which he had fallen  you see that bird that is sailing so prettily above the roofs of the village said eve pointing with her parasol in the direction she meant for the three were walking together on the little lawn in waiting for the appearance of the expected guests and i dare say you are ornithologist enough to tell its vulgar name  you are in the humour to be severe this morningthe bird is but a common swallow  one of which will not make a summer as every one knows our cosmopolitism is already forgotten and with it i fear our frankness  since powis has hoisted his national colours i do not feel as free on such subjects as formerly returned sir george smiling when i thought i had a secret ally in him i was not afraid to concede a little in such things but his avowal of his country has put me on my guard in no case however shall i admit my insensibility to the qualities of your countrywomen powis as a native may take that liberty but as for myself i shall insist they are at least the equals of any females i know  in naiveté prettiness delicacy of appearance simplicity and sincerity  in sincerity think you dear miss effingham  in sincerity above all things dear sir george templemore sinceritynay frankness is the last quality i should think of denying them  but to return to mrs bloomfieldshe is clever exceedingly clever i allow in what is her cleverness to be distinguished from that of one of her sex on the other side of the ocean  in nothing perhaps did there exist no differences in national characteristics naples and newyork are in the same latitude and yet i think you will agree with me that there is little resemblance in their populations  i confess i do not understand the allusionare you quicker witted powis  i will not say that answered paul but i think i do comprehend miss effinghams meaning you have travelled enough to know that as a rule there is more aptitude in a southern than in a northern people they receive impressions more readily and are quicker in all their perceptions  i believe this to be true but then you will allow that they are less constant and have less perseverance  in that we are agreed sir george templemore resumed eve though we might differ as to the cause the inconstancy of which you speak is more connected with moral than physical causes perhaps and we of this region might claim an exemption from some of them but mrs bloomfield is to be distinguished from her european rivals by a frame so singularly feminine as to appear fragile a delicacy of exterior that were it not for that illumined face of hers might indicate a general feebleness a sensitiveness and quickness of intellect that amount almost to inspiration and yet all is balanced by a practical common sense that renders her as safe a counsellor as she is a warm friend this latter quality causes you sometimes to doubt her genius it is so very homely and available now it is in this that i think the american woman when she does rise above mediocrity is particularly to be distinguished from the european the latter as a genius is almost always in the clouds whereas mrs bloomfield in her highest flights is either all heart or all good sense the nation is practical and the practical qualities get to be imparted even to its highest order of talents  the english women are thought to be less excitable and not so much under the influence of sentimentalism as some of their continental neighbours  and very justlybut  but what miss effinghamthere is in all this a slight return to the cosmopolitism that reminds me of our days of peril and adventure do not conceal a thought if you wish to preserve that character  well to be sincere i shall say that your women live under a system too sophisticated and factitious to give fair play to common sense at all times what for instance can be the habitual notions of one who professing the doctrines of christianity is accustomed to find money placed so very much in the ascendant as to see it daily exacted in payment for the very first of the sacred offices of the church it would be as rational to contend that a mirror which had been cracked into radii by a bullet like those we have so often seen in paris would reflect faithfully as to suppose a mind familiarized to such abuses would be sensitive on practical and common sense things  but my dear miss effingham this is all habit  i know it is all habit sir george templemore and a very bad habit it is even your devoutest clergymen get so accustomed to it as not to see the capital mistake they make i do not say it is absolutely sinful where there is no compulsion but i hope you agree with me mr powis when i say i think a clergyman ought to be so sensitive on such a subject as to refuse even the little offerings for baptisms that it is the practice of the wealthy of this country to make  i agree with you entirely for it would denote a more just perception of the nature of the office they are performing and they who wish to give can always make occasions  a hint might be taken from franklin who is said to have desired his father to ask a blessing on the porkbarrel by way of condensation put in john effingham who joined them as he spoke and who had heard a part of the conversation in this instance an average might be struck in the marriage fee that should embrace all future baptisms but here comes neighbour howel to favour us with his opinion do you like the usages of the english church as respects baptisms howel  excellent the best in the world john effingham  mr howel is so true an englishman said eve shaking hands cordially with their wellmeaning neighbour that he would give a certificate in favour of polygamy if it had a british origin  and is not this a more natural sentiment for an american than that which distrusts so much merely because it comes from the little island asked sir george reproachfully  that is a question i shall leave mr howel himself to answer  why sir george observed the gentleman alluded to i do not attribute my respect for your country in the least to origin i endeavour to keep myself free from all sorts of prejudices my admiration of england arises from conviction and i watch all her movements with the utmost jealousy in order to see if i cannot find her tripping though i feel bound to say i have never yet detected her in a single error what a very different picture francei hope your governess is not within hearing miss eve it is not her fault she was born a french woman and we would not wish to hurt her feelingsbut what a different picture france presents i have watched her narrowly too these forty years i may say and i have never yet found her right and this you must allow is a great deal to be said by one who is thoroughly impartial  this is a terrible picture indeed howel to come from an unprejudiced man said john effingham and i make no doubt sir george templemore will have a better opinion of himself for ever afterhe for a valiant lion and you for a true prince but yonder is the exclusive extra which contains our party  the elevated bit of lawn on which they were walking commanded a view of the road that led into the village and the travelling vehicle engaged by mrs hawker and her friends was now seen moving along it at a rapid pace eve expressed her satisfaction and then all resumed their walk as some minutes must still elapse previously to the arrival  exclusive extra repeated sir george that is a peculiar phrase and one that denotes any thing but democracy  in any other part of the world a thing would be sufficiently marked by being extra but here it requires the addition of exclusive in order to give it the tower stamp said john effingham with a curl of his handsome lip any thing may be as exclusive as it please provided it bear the public impress a stagecoach being intended for every body why the more exclusive it is the better the next thing we shall hear of will be exclusive steamboats exclusive railroads and both for the uses of the exclusive people  sir george now seriously asked an explanation of the meaning of the term when mr howel informed him that an extra in america meant a supernumerary coach to carry any excess of the ordinary number of passengers whereas an exclusive extra meant a coach expressly engaged by a particular individual  the latter then is american posting observed sir george  you have got the best idea of it that can be given said paul it is virtually posting with a coachman instead of postillions few persons in this country where so much of the greater distances is done by steam using their own travelling carriages the american exclusive extra is not only posting but in many of the older parts of the country it is posting of a very good quality  i dare say now this is all wrong if we only knew it said the simpleminded mr howel there is nothing exclusive in england ha sir george  every body laughed except the person who put this question but the rattling of wheels and the tramping of horses on the village bridge announced the near approach of the travellers by the time the party had reached the great door in front of the house the carriage was already in the grounds and at the next moment eve was in the arms of mrs bloomfield it was apparent at a glance that more than the expected number of guests was in the vehicle and as its contents were slowly discharged the spectators stood around it with curiosity to observe who would appear  the first person that descended after the exit of mrs bloomfield was captain truck who however instead of saluting his friends turned assiduously to the door he had just passed through to assist mrs hawker to alight not until this office had been done did he even look for eve for so profound was the worthy captains admiration and respect for this venerable lady that she actually had got to supplant our heroine in some measure in his heart mr bloomfield appeared next and an exclamation of surprise and pleasure proceeded from both paul and the baronet as they caught a glimpse of the face of the last of the travellers that got out  ducie cried sir george this is even better than we expected  ducie added paul you are several days before the expected time and in excellent company  the explanation however was very simple captain ducie had found the facilities for rapid motion much greater than he had expected and he reached fort plain in the eastward cars as the remainder of the party arrived in the westward captain truckwho had met mrs hawkers party in the river boat had been intrusted with the duty of making the arrangements and recognizing captain ducie to their mutual surprise while engaged in this employment and ascertaining his destination the latter was very cordially received into the exclusive extra  mr effingham welcomed all his guests with the hospitality and kindness for which he was distinguished we are no great admirers of the pretension to peculiar national virtues having ascertained to our own satisfaction by tolerably extensive observation that the moral difference between men is of no great amount but we are almost tempted to say on this occasion that mr effingham received his guests with american hospitality for if there be one quality that this people can claim to possess in a higher degree than that of most other christian nations it is that of a simple sincere confiding hospitality for mrs hawker in common with all who knew her the owner of the wigwam entertained a profound respect and though his less active mind did not take as much pleasure as that of his daughter in the almost intuitive intelligence of mrs bloomfield he also felt for this lady a very friendly regard it gave him pleasure to see eve surrounded by persons of her own sex of so high a tone of thought and breeding a tone of thought and breeding moreover that was as far removed as possible from anything strained or artificial and his welcomes were cordial in proportion mr bloomfield was a quiet sensible gentlemanlike man whom his wife fervently loved without making any parade of her attachment and he was also one who had the good sense to make himself agreeable wherever he went captain ducie who englishmanlike had required some urging to be induced to present himself before the precise hour named in his own letter and who had seriously contemplated passing several days in a tavern previously to showing himself at the wigwam was agreeably disappointed at a reception that would have been just as frank and warm had he come without any notice at all for the effinghams knew that the usages which sophistication and a crowded population perhaps render necessary in older countries were not needed in their own and then the circumstance that their quondam pursuer was so near a kinsman of paul powis did not fail to act essentially in his favour  we can offer but little in these retired mountains to interest a traveller and a man of the world captain ducie said mr effingham when he went to pay his compliments more particularly after the whole party was in the house but there is a common interest in our past adventures to talk about after all other topics fail when we met on the ocean and you deprived us so unexpectedly of our friend powis we did not know that you had the better claim of affinity to his company  captain ducie coloured slightly but he made his answer with a proper degree of courtesy and gratitude  it is very true he added powis and myself are relatives and i shall place all my claims to your hospitality to his account for i feel that i have been the unwilling cause of too much suffering to your party to bring with me any very pleasant recollections notwithstanding your kindness in including me as a friend in the adventures of which you speak  dangers that are happily past seldom bring very unpleasant recollections more especially when they were connected with scenes of excitement i understand sir that the unhappy young man who was the principal cause of all that passed anticipated the sentence of the law by destroying himself  he was his own executioner and the victim of a silly weakness that i should think your state of society was yet too young and simple to encourage the idle vanity of making an appearance a vanity by the way that seldom besets gentlemen or the class to which it may be thought more properly to belong ruins hundreds of young men in england and this poor creature was of the number i never was more rejoiced than when he quitted my ship for the sight of so much weakness sickened one of human nature miserable as his fate proved to be and pitiable as his condition really was while in my charge his case has the alleviating circumstance with me of having made me acquainted with those whom it might not otherwise have been my good fortune to meet  this civil speech was properly acknowledged and mr effingham addressed himself to captain truck to whom in the hurry of the moment he had not yet said half that his feelings dictated  i am rejoiced to see you under my roof my worthy friend taking the rough hand of the old seaman between his own whiter and more delicate fingers and shaking it with cordiality for this is being under my roof while those town residences have less the air of domestication and familiarity you will spend many of your holidays here i trust and when we get a few years older we will begin to prattle about the marvels we have seen in company  the eye of captain truck glistened and as he return ed the shake by another of twice the energy and the gentle pressure of mr effingham by a squeeze like that of a vice he said in his honest offhand manner  the happiest hour i ever knew was that in which i discharged the pilot the first time out as a shipmaster the next great event of my life in the way of happiness was the moment i found myself on the deck of the montauk after we had given those greasy arabs a him that their room was better than their company and i really think this very instant must be set down as the third i never knew my dear sir how much i truly loved you and your daughter until both were out of sight  that is so kind and gallant a speech that it ought not to be lost on the person most concerned eve my love our worthy friend has just made a declaration which will be a novelty to you who have not been much in the way of listening to speeches of this nature  mr effingham then acquainted his daughter with what captain truck had just said  this is certainly the first declaration of the sort i ever heard and with the simplicity of an unpractised young woman i here avow that the attachment is reciprocal said the smiling eve if there is an indiscretion in this hasty acknowledgement it must be ascribed to surprise and to the suddenness with which i have learned my power for your parvenues are not always perfectly regulated  i hope mamselle vav is well returned the captain cordially shaking the hand the young lady had given him and that she enjoys herself to her liking in this outlandish country  mademoiselle viefville will return you her thanks in person at dinner and i believe she does not yet regret la belle france unreasonably as i regret it myself in many particulars it would be unjust not to permit a native of the country some liberty in that way  i perceive a strange face in the roomone of the family my dear young lady  not a relative but a very old friendshall i have the pleasure of introducing you captain  i hardly dared to ask it for i know you must have been overworked in this way lately but i confess i should like an introduction i have neither introduced nor been introduced since i left newyork with the exception of the case of captain ducie whom i made properly acquainted with mrs hawker and her party as you may suppose they know each other regularly now and you are saved the trouble of going through the ceremony yourself  and how is it with you and the bloomfields did mrs hawker name you to them properly  that is the most extraordinary thing of the sort i ever knew not a word was said in the way of introduction and yet i slid into an acquaintance with mrs bloomfield so easily that i could not tell how it was done if my life depended on it but this very old friend of yours my dear young lady  captain truck mr howel mr howel captain truck said eve imitating the most approved manner of the introductory spirit of the day with admirable selfpossession and gravity i am fortunate in having it in my power to make two persons whom i so much esteem acquainted  captain truck is the gentleman who commands the montauk said mr howel glancing at eve as much as to say am i right  the very same and the brave seaman to whom we are all indebted for the happiness of standing here at this moment  you are to be envied captain truck of all the men in your calling you are exactly the one i should most wish to supplant i understand you actually go to england twice every year  three times sir when the winds permit i have even seen the old island four times between january and january  what a pleasure it must be the very acme of navigation to sail between america and england  it is not unpleasant sir from april to november but the long nights thick weather and heavy winds knock off a good deal of the satisfaction for the rest of the year  but i speak of the country of old england itself not of the passages  well england has what i call a pretty fair coast it is high and great attention is paid to the lights but of what account is either coast or lights if the weather is so thick you cannot see the end of your flyingjibboom  mr howel alludes more particularly to the country inland said eve to the towns the civilization and the other proofs of cultivation and refinement to the government especially  in my judgment sir the government is much too particular about tobacco and some other trifling things i could name then it restricts pennants to kings ships whereas to my notion my dear young lady a newyork packet is as worthy of wearing a pennant as any vessel that floats i mean of course ships of the regular european lines and not the southern traders  but these are merely spots on the sun my good sir returned mr howel putting a few such trifles out of the question i think you will allow that england is the most delightful country in the world  to be frank with you mr howel there is a good deal of hangdog weather along in october november and december i have known march any thing but agreeable and then april is just like a young girl with one of your melancholy novels now smiling and now blubbering  but the morals of the country my dear sir the moral features of england must be a source of neverdying delight to a true philanthropist resumed mr howel as eve who perceived that the discourse was likely to be long went to join the ladies an englishman has most reason to be proud of the moral excellencies of his country  why to be frank with you mr howel there are some of the moral features of london that are any thing but very beautiful if you could pass twentyfour hours in the neighbourhood of st catharines would see sights that would throw templeton into fits the english are a handsome people i allow but their morality is none of the bestfeatured  let us be seated sir i am afraid we are not exactly agreed on our terms and in order that we may continue this subject i beg you will let me take a seat next you at table  to this captain truck very cheerfully assented and then the two took chairs continuing the discourse very much in the blind and ambiguous manner in which it had been commenced the one party insisting on seeing every thing through the medium of an imagination that had got to be diseased on such subjects or with a species of monomania while the other seemed obstinately determined to consider the entire country as things had been presented to his limited and peculiar experience in the vicinity of the docks  we have had a very unexpected and a very agreeable attendant in captain truck said mrs hawker when eve had placed herself by her side and respectfully taken one of her hands i really think if i were to suffer shipwreck or to run the hazard of captivity i should choose to have both occur in his good company  mrs hawker makes so many conquests observed mrs bloomfield that we are to think nothing of her success with this merman but what will you say miss effingham when you learn that i am also in favour in the same high quarter i shall think the better of masters and boatswains and trinculos and stephanos as long as i live for this specimen of their craft  not trinculos and stephanos dear mrs bloom field for à l exception pres de saturdaynights and sweethearts and wives a more exemplary person in the way of libations does not exist than our excellent captain truck he is much too religious and moral for so vulgar an excess as drinking  religious exclaimed mrs bloomfield in sur prise this is a merit to which i did not know he possessed the smallest claims one might imagine a little superstition and some shortlived repentances in gales of wind but scarcely any thing as much like a trade wind as religion  then you do not know him for a more sincerely devout man though i acknowledge it is after a fashion that is perhaps peculiar to the ocean is not often met with at any rate you found him attentive to our sex  the pink of politeness and not to embellish there is a manly deference about him that is singularly agreeable to our frail vanity this comes of his packettraining i suppose and we may thank you for some portion of his merit his tongue never tires in your praises and did i not feel persuaded that your mind is made up never to be the wife of any republican american i should fear this visit exceedingly notwithstanding the remark i made concerning my being in favour the affair lies between mrs hawker and yourself i know it is not your habit to trifle even on that very popular subject with young ladies matrimony but this case forms so complete an exception to the vulgar passion that i trust you will overlook the indiscretion our golden captain for copper he is not protests that mrs hawker is the most delightful old lady he ever knew and that miss eve effingham is the most delightful young lady he ever knew here then each may see the ground she occupies and play her cards accordingly i hope to be forgiven for touching on a subject so delicate  in the first place said eve smiling i should wish to hear mrs hawkers reply  i have no more to say than to express my perfect gratitude answered that lady to announce a determination not to change my condition on account of extreme youth and a disposition to abandon the field to my younger if not fairer rival  well then resumed eve anxious to change the subject for she saw that paul was approaching their group i believe it will be wisest in me to suspend a decision circumstances leaving so much at my disposal time must show what that decision will be  nay said mrs bloomfield who saw no feeling involved in the trifling this is unjustifiable coquetry and i feel bound to ascertain how the land lies you will remember i am the captains confidant and you know the fearful responsibility of a friend in an affair of this sort that of a friend in the duello being insignificant in comparison that i may have testimony at need mr powis shall be made acquainted with the leading facts captain truck is a devout admirer of this young lady sir and i am endeavouring to discover whether he ought to hang himself on her fathers lawn this evening as soon as the moon rises or live another week in order to do this i shall pursue the categorical and inquisitorial methodand so defend yourself miss effingham do you object to the country of your admirer  eve though inwardly vexed at the turn this pleasantry had taken maintained a perfectly composed manner for she knew that mrs bloomfield had too much feminine propriety to say any thing improper or any thing that might seriously embarrass her  it would indeed be extraordinary should i object to a country which is not only my own but which has so long been that of my ancestors she answered steadily on this score my knight has nothing to fear  i rejoice to hear this returned mrs bloomfield glancing her eyes unconsciously to herself however towards sir george templemore and mr powis you who i believe are a european will learn humility in the avowal do you object to your swain that he is a seaman  eve blushed notwithstanding a strong effort to appear composed and for the first time since their acquaintance she felt provoked with mrs bloomfield she hesitated before she answered in the negative and this too in a way to give more meaning to her reply although nothing could be farther from her intentions  the happy man may then be an american and a seaman here is great encouragement do you object to sixty  in any other man i should certainly consider it a blemish as my own dear father is but fifty  mrs bloomfield was struck with the tremor in the voice and with the air of embarrassment in one who usually was so easy and collected and with feminine sensitiveness she adroitly abandoned the subject though she often recurred to this stifled emotion in the course of the day and from that moment she became a silent observer of eves deportment with all her fathers guests  this is hope enough for one day she said rising the profession and the flag must counterbalance the years as best they may and the truck lives another revolution of the sun mrs hawker we shall be late at dinner i see by that clock unless we retire soon  both the ladies now went to their rooms eve who was already dressed for dinner remaining in the drawingroom paul still stood before her and like herself he seemed embarrassed  there are men who would be delighted to hear even the little that has fallen from your lips in this trifling he said as soon as mrs bloomfield was out of hearing to be an american and a seaman then are not serious defects in your eyes  am i to be made responsible for mrs bloomfields caprices and pleasantries  by no means but i do think you hold yourself responsible for miss effinghams truth and sincerity i can conceive of your silence when questioned too far but scarcely of any direct declaration that shall not possess both these high qualities  eve looked up gratefully for she saw that profound respect for her character dictated the remark but rising she observed  this is making a little badinage about our honest lionhearted old captain a very serious affair and now to show you that i am conscious of and thankful for your own compliment i shall place you on the footing of a friend to both the parties and request you will take captain truck into your especial care while he remains here my father and cousin are both sincerely his friends but their habits are not so much those of their guests as yours will probably be and to you then i commit him with a request that he may miss his ship and the ocean as little as possible  i would i knew how to take this charge miss effinghamto be a seaman is not always a recommendation with the polished intelligent and refined  but when one is polished intelligent and refined to be a seaman is to add one other particular and useful branch of knowledge to those which are more familiar i feel certain captain truck will be in good hands and now i will go and do my devoirs to my own especial charges the ladies  eve bowed as she passed the young man and she left the room with as much haste as at all became her paul stood motionless quite a minute after she had vanished nor did he awaken from his reverie until aroused by an appeal from captain truck to sustain him in some of his matteroffact opinions concerning england against the visionary and bookish notions of mr howel  who is this mr powis asked mrs bloomfield of eve when the latter appeared in her dressingroom with an unusual impatience of manner  you know my dear mrs bloomfield that he was our fellowpassenger in the montauk and that he was of infinite service to us in escaping from the arabs  all this i know certainly but he is a european is he not  eve scarcely ever felt more embarrassed than in answering this simple question  i believe not at least i think not we thought so when we met him in europe and even until quite lately but he has avowed himself a countryman of our own since his arrival at templeton  has he been here long  we found him in the village on reaching home he was from canada and has been in waiting for his cousin captain ducie who came with you  his cousinhe has english cousins then mr ducie kept this to himself with true english reserve captain truck whispered something of the latters having taken out one of his passengers the mr powis the hero of the rocks but i did not know of his having found his way back to ourto his country is he as agreeable as sir george templemore  nay mrs bloomfield i must leave you to judge of that for yourself i think them both agreeable men but there is so much caprice in a womans tastes that i decline thinking for others  he is a seaman i believe observed mrs bloomfield with an abstracted mannerhe must have been to have manoeuvred and managed as i have been told he did powispowisthat is not one of our names neitheri should think he must be from the south  here eves habitual truth and dignity of mind did her good service and prevented any further betrayal of embarrassment  we do not know his family she steadily answered that he is a gentleman we see but of his origin and connections he never speaks  his profession would have given him the notions of a gentleman for he was in the navy i have heard although i had thought it the british navy i do not know of any powises in philadelphia or baltimore or richmond or charleston he must surely be from the interior  eve could scarcely condemn her friend for a curiosity that had not a little tormented herself though she would gladly change the discourse  mr powis would be much gratified did he know what a subject of interest he has suddenly become with mrs bloomfield she said smiling  i confess it all to be very sincere i think him the most distinguished young man in air appearance and expression of countenance i ever saw when this is coupled with what i have heard of his gallantry and coolness my dear i should not be woman to feel no interest in him i would give the world to know of what state he is a native if native in truth he be  for that we have his own word he was born in this country and was educated in our own marine  and yet from the little that fell from him in our first short conversation he struck me as being educated above his profession  mr powis has seen much as a traveller when we met him in europe it was in a circle particularly qualified to improve both his mind and his manners  europe your acquaintance did not then commence like that with sir george templemore in the packet  our acquaintance with neither commenced in the packet my father had often seen both these gentlemen during our residences in different parts of europe  and your fathers daughter  my fathers daughter too said eve laughing with mr powis in particular we were acquainted under circumstances that left a vivid recollection of his manliness and professional skill he was of almost as much service to us on one of the swiss lakes as he has subsequently been on the ocean  all this was news to mrs bloomfield and she looked as if she thought the intelligence interesting at this moment the dinnerbell rang and all the ladies descended to the drawingroom the gentlemen were already assembled and as mr effingham led mrs hawker to the table mrs bloomfield gaily took eve by the arm protesting that she felt herself privileged the first day to take a seat near the young mistress of the wigwam  mr powis and sir george templemore will not quarrel about the honour she said in a low voice as they proceeded towards the table  indeed you are in error mrs bloomfield sir george templemore is much better pleased with being at liberty to sit next my cousin grace  can this be so returned the other looking intently at her young friend  indeed it is so and i am very glad to be able to affirm it how far miss van cortlandt is pleased that it is so time must show but the baronet betrays every day and all day how much he is pleased with her  he is then a man of less taste and judgment and intelligence than i had thought him  nay dearest mrs bloomfield this is not necessarily true or if true need it be so openly said  se non e vero e ben trovato  chapter xviii    thine for a space are they   yet shalt thou yield thy treasures up at last   thy gates shall yet give way   thy bolts shall fall inexorable past    bryant  captain ducie had retired for the night and was sitting reading when a low tap at the door roused him from a brown study he gave the necessary permission and the door opened  i hope ducie you have not forgotten the secretary i left among your effects said paul entering the room and concerning which i wrote you when you were still at quebec  captain ducie pointed to the case which was standing among his other luggage on the floor of the room  thank you for this care said paul taking the secretary under his arm and retiring towards the door it contains papers of much importance to myself and some that i have reason to think are of importance to others  stop powisa word before you quit me is templemore de trop  not at all i have a sincere regard for templemore and should be sorry to see him leave us  and yet i think it singular a man of his habits should be rusticating among these hills when i know that he is expected to look at the canadas with a view to report their actual condition at home  is sir george really entrusted with a commission of that sort inquired paul with interest  not with any positive commission perhaps for none was necessary templemore is a rich fellow and has no need of appointments but it is hoped and understood that he will look at the provinces and report their condition to the government i dare say he will not be impeached for his negligence though it may occasion surprise  good night ducie templemore prefers a wigwam to your walled quebec and natives to colonists thats all  in a minute paul was at the door of john effinghams room where he again tapped and was again told to enter  ducie has not forgotten my request and here is the secretary that contains poor mr mondays paper he remarked as he laid his load on a toilettable speaking in a way to show that the visit was expected we have indeed neglected this duty too long and it is to be hoped no injustice or wrong to any will be the consequence  is that the package demanded john effingham extending a hand to receive a bundle of papers that paul had taken from the secretary we will break the seals this moment and ascertain what ought to be done before we sleep  these are papers of my own and very precious are they returned the young man regarding them a moment with interest before he laid them on the toilet here are the papers of mr monday  john effingham received the package from his young friend placed the lights conveniently on the table put on his spectacles and invited paul to be seated the gentlemen were placed opposite each other the duty of breaking the seals and first casting an eye at the contents of the different documents devolving as a matter of course on the senior of the two who in truth had alone been entrusted with it  here is something signed by poor monday himself in the way of a general certificate observed john effingham who first read the paper and then handed it to paul it was in form an unsealed letter and it was addressed to all whom it may concern the certificate itself was in the following words  i john monday do declare and certify that all the accompanying letters and documents are genuine and authentic jane dowse to whom and from whom are so many letters was my late mother she having intermarried with peter dowse the man so often named and who led her into acts for which i know she has since been deeply repentant in committing these papers to me my poor mother left me the sole judge of the course i was to take and i have put them in this form in order that they may yet do good should i be called suddenly away all depends on discovering who the person called bright actually is for he was never known to my mother by any other name she knows him to have been an englishman however and thinks he was or had been an upper servant in a gentlemans family john monday  this paper was dated several years back a sign that the disposition to do right had existed some time in mr monday and all the letters and other papers had been carefully preserved the latter also appeared to be regularly numbered a precaution that much aided the investigations of the two gentlemen the original letters spoke for themselves and the copies had been made in a clear strong mercantile hand and with the method of one accustomed to business in short so far as the contents of the different papers would allow nothing was wanting to render the whole distinct and intelligible  john effingham read the paper no 1 with deliberation though not aloud and when he had done he handed it to his young friend coolly remarking  that is the production of a deliberate villain  paul glanced his eye over the document which was an original letter signed david bright and addressed to mrs jane dowse it was written with exceeding art made many professions of friendship spoke of the writers knowledge of the womans friends in england and of her first husband in particular and freely professed the writers desire to serve her while it also contained several ambiguous allusions to certain means of doing so which should be revealed whenever the person to whom the letter was addressed should discover a willingness to embark in the undertaking this letter was dated philadelphia was addressed to one in newyork and it was old  this is indeed a rare specimen of villany said paul as he laid down the paper and has been written in some such spirit as that employed by the devil when he tempted our common mother i think i never read a better specimen of low wily cunning  and judging by all that we already know it would seem to have succeeded in this letter you will find the gentleman a little more explicit and but a little though he is evidently encouraged by the interest and curiosity betrayed by the woman in this copy of the answer to his first epistle  paul read the letter just named and then he laid it down to wait for the next which was still in the hands of his companion  this is likely to prove a history of unlawful love and of its miserable consequences said john effingham in his cool manner as he handed the answers to letter no 1 and letter no 2 to paul the world is full of such unfortunate adventures and i should think the parties english by a hint or two you will find in this very honest and conscientious communication strongly artificial social and political distinctions render expedients of this nature more frequent perhaps in great britain than in any other country youth is the season of the passions and many a man in the thoughtlessness of that period lays the foundation of bitter regret in after life  as john effingham raised his eyes in the act of extending his hand towards his companion he perceived that the fresh ruddy hue of his embrowned cheek deepened until the colour diffused itself over the whole of his fine brow at first an unpleasant suspicion flashed on john effingham and he admitted it with regret for eve and her future happiness had got to be closely associated in his mind with the character and conduct of the young man but when paul took the papers steadily and by an effort seemed to subdue all unpleasant feelings the calm dignity with which he read them completely effaced the disagreeable distrust it was then john effingham remembered that he had once believed paul himself might be the fruits of the heartless indiscretion he condemned commiseration and sympathy instantly took the place of the first impression and he was so much absorbed with these feelings that he had not taken up the letter which was to follow when paul laid down the paper he had last been required to read  this does indeed sir seem to foretell one of those painful histories of unbridled passion with the still more painful consequences said the young man with the steadiness of one who was unconscious of having a personal connexion with any events of a nature so unpleasant let us examine farther  john effingham felt emboldened by these encouraging signs of unconcern and he read the succeeding letters aloud so that they learned their contents simultaneously the next six or eight communications betrayed nothing distinctly beyond the fact that the child which formed the subject of the whole correspondence was to be received by peter dowse and his wife and to be retained as their own offspring for the consideration of a considerable sum with an additional engagement to pay an annuity it appeared by these letters also that the child which was hypocritically alluded to under the name of the pet had been actually transferred to the keeping of jane dowse and that several years passed after this arrangement before the correspondence terminated most of the later letters referred to the payment of the annuity although they all contained cold inquiries after the pet and answers so vague and general as sufficiently to prove that the term was singularly misapplied in the whole there were some thirty or forty letters each of which had been punctually answered and their dates covered a space of near twelve years the perusal of all these papers consumed more than an hour and when john effingham laid his spectacles on the table the village clock had struck the hour of midnight  as yet he observed we have learned little more than the fact that a child was made to take a false character without possessing any other clue to the circumstances than is given in the names of the parties all of whom are evidently obscure and one of the most material of whom we are plainly told must have borne a fictitious name even poor monday in possession of so much collateral testimony that we want could not have known what was the precise injustice done if any or certainly with the intentions he manifests he would not have left that important particular in the dark  this is likely to prove a complicated affair returned paul and it is not very clear that we can be of any immediate service as you are probably fatigued we may without impropriety defer the further examination to another time  to this john effingham assented and paul during the short conversation that followed brought the secretary from the toilet to the table along with the bundle of important papers that belonged to himself to which he had alluded and busied himself in replacing the whole in the drawer from which they had been taken  all the formalities about the seals that we observed when poor monday gave us the packet would seem to be unnecessary he remarked while thus occupied and it will probably be sufficient if i leave the secretary in your room and keep the keys myself  one never knows returned john effingham with the greater caution of experience and age we have not read all the papers and there are wax and lights before you each has his watch and seal and it will be the work of a minute only to replace every thing as we left the package originally when this is done you may leave the secretary or remove it at your own pleasure  i will leave it for though it contains so much that i prize and which is really of great importance to myself it contains nothing for which i shall have immediate occasion  in that case it were better that i place the package in which we have a common interest in an armoire or in my secretary and that you keep your precious effects more immediately under your own eye  it is immaterial unless the case will inconvenience you for i do not know that i am not happier when it is out of my sight so long as i feel certain of its security than when it is constantly before my eyes  paul said this with a forced smile and there was a sadness in his countenance that excited the sympathy of his companion the latter however merely bowed his assent and the papers were replaced and the secretary was locked and deposited in an armoire in silence paul was then about to wish the other good night when john effingham seized his hand and by a gentle effort induced him to resume his seat an embarrassing but short pause succeeded when the latter spoke  we have suffered enough in company and have seen each other in situations of sufficient trial to be friends he said i should feel mortified did i believe you could think me influenced by an improper curiosity in wishing to share more of your confidence than you are perhaps willing to bestow i trust you will attribute to its right motive the liberty i am now taking age makes some difference between us and the sincere and strong interest i feel in your welfare ought to give me a small claim not to be treated as a total stranger so jealous and watchful has this interest been i might with great truth call it affection that i have discovered you are not situated exactly as other men in your condition of life are situated and feel persuaded that the sympathy perhaps the advice of one so many years older than yourself might be useful you have already said so much to me on the subject of your personal situation that i almost feel a right to ask for more  john effingham uttered this in his mildest and most winning manner and few men could carry with them on such an occasion more of persuasion in their voices and looks pauls features worked and it was evident to his companion that he was moved while at the same time he was not displeased  i am grateful deeply grateful sir for this interest in my happiness paul answered and if i knew the particular points on which you feel any curiosity there is nothing that i can desire to conceal have the further kindness to question me mr effingham that i need not touch on things you do not care to hear  all that really concerns your welfare would have interest with me you have been the agent of rescuing not only myself but those whom i most love from a fate worse than death and a childless bachelor myself i have more than once thought of attempting to supply the places of those natural friends that i fear you have lost your parents  are both dead i never knew either said paul who spoke huskily and will most cheerfully accept your generous offer if you will allow me to attach to it a single condition  beggars must not be choosers returned john effingham and if you will allow me to feel this interest in you and occasionally to share in the confidence of a father i shall not insist on any unreasonable terms what is your condition  that the word money may be struck out of our vocabulary and that you leave your will unaltered were the world to be examined you could not find a worthier or a lovelier heiress than the one you have already selected and whom providence itself has given you compared with yourself i am not rich but i have a gentlemans income and as i shall probably never marry it will suffice for all my wants  john effingham was more pleased than he cared to express with this frankness and with the secret sympathy that had existed between them but he smiled at the injunction for with eves knowledge and her fathers entire approbation he had actually made a codicil to his will in which their young protector was left one half of his large fortune  the will may remain untouched if you desire it he answered evasively and that condition is disposed of i am glad to learn so directly from yourself what your manner of living and the reports of others had prepared me to hear that you are independent this fact alone will place us solely on our mutual esteem and render the friendship that i hope is now brought within a covenant if not now first established more equal and frank you have seen much of the world powis for your years and profession  it is usual to think that men of my profession see much of the world as a consequence of their pursuits though i agree with you sir that this is seeing the world only in a very limited circle it is now several years since circumstances i might almost say the imperative order of one whom i was bound to obey induced me to resign and since that time i have done little else but travel owing to certain adventitious causes i have enjoyed an access to european society that few of our countrymen possess and i hope the advantage has not been entirely thrown away it was as a traveller on the continent of europe that i had the pleasure of first meeting with mr and miss effingham i was much abroad even as a child and owe some little skill in foreign languages to that circumstance  so my cousin has informed me you have set the question of country at rest by declaring that you are an american and yet i find you have english relatives captain ducie i believe is a kinsman  he is we are sisters children though our friendship has not always been such as the connexion would infer when ducie and myself met at sea there was an awkwardness if not a coolness in the interview that coupled with my sudden return to england i fear did not make the most favourable impression on those who witnessed what passed  we had confidence in your principles said john effingham with a frank simplicity and though the first surmises were not pleasant perhaps a little reflection told us that there was no just ground for suspicion  ducie is a fine manly fellow and has a seamans generosity and sincerity i had last parted from him on the field where we met as enemies and the circumstance rendered the unexpected meeting awkward our wounds no longer smarted it is true but perhaps we both felt shame and sorrow that they had ever been inflicted  it should be a very serious quarrel that could arm sisters children against each other said john effingham gravely  i admit as much but at that time captain ducie was not disposed to admit the consanguinity and the offence grew out of an intemperate resentment of some imputations on my birth between two military men the issue could scarcely be avoided ducie challenged and i was not then in the humour to balk him a couple of flesh wounds happily terminated the affair but an interval of three years had enabled my enemy to discover that he had not done me justice that i had been causelessly provoked to the quarrel and that we ought to be firm friends the generous desire to make suitable expiation urged him to seize the first occasion of coming to america that offered and when ordered to chase the montauk by a telegraphic communication from london he was hourly expecting to sail for our seas where he wished to come expressly that we might meet you will judge therefore how happy he was to find me unexpectedly in the vessel that contained his principal object of pursuit thus killing as it might be two birds with one stone  and did he carry you away with him with any such murderous intention demanded john effingham smiling  by no means nothing could be more amicable than ducie and myself got to be when we had been a few hours together in his cabin as often happens when there have been violent antipathies and unreasonable prejudices a nearer view of each others character and motives removed every obstacle and long before we reached england two warmer friends could not be found or a more frank intercourse between relatives could not be desired you are aware sir that our english cousins do not often view their cisatlantic relatives with the most lenient eyes  this is but too true said john effingham proudly though his lip quivered as he spoke and it is in a great measure the fault of that miserable mental bondage which has left this country after sixty years of nominal independence so much at the mercy of a hostile opinion it is necessary that we respect ourselves in order that others respect us  i agree with you sir entirely in my case however previous injustice disposed my relatives to receive me better perhaps than might otherwise have been the case i had little to ask in the way of fortune and feeling no disposition to raise a question that might disturb the peerage of the ducies i became a favourite  a peerageboth your parents then were english  neither i believe but the connection between the two countries was so close that it can occasion no surprise a right of this nature should have passed into the colonies my mothers mother became the heiress of one of those ancient baronies that pass to the heirs general and in consequence of the deaths of two brothers these rights which however were never actually possessed by any of the previous generation centered in my mother and my aunt the former being dead as was contended without issue  you forget yourself  lawful issue added paul reddening to the temples i should have addedmrs ducie who was married to the younger son of an english nobleman claimed and obtained the rank my pretension would have left the peerage in abeyance and i probably owe some little of the opposition i found to that circumstance but after ducies generous conduct i could not hesitate about joining in the application to the crown that by its decision the abeyance might be determined in favour of the person who was in possession and lady dunluce is now quietly confirmed in her claim  there are many young men in this country who would cling to the hopes of a british peerage with greater tenacity  it is probable there are but my selfdenial is not of a very high order for it could scarcely be expected the english ministers would consent to give the rank to a foreigner who did not hesitate about avowing his principles and national feelings i shall not say i did hot covet this peerage for it would be supererogatory but i am born an american and will die an american and an american who swaggers about such a claim is like the daw among the peacocks the less that is said about it the better  you are fortunate to have escaped the journals which most probably would have begraced you by elevating you at once to the rank of a duke  instead of which i had no other station than that of a dog in the manger if it makes my aunt happy to be called lady dunluce i am sure she is welcome to the privilege and when ducie succeeds her as will one day be the case an excellent fellow will be a peer of england voila tout you are the only countryman sir to whom i have ever spoken of the circumstance and with you i trust it will remain a secret  what am i precluded from mentioning the facts in my own family i am not the only sincere the only warm friend you have in this house powis  in that respect i leave you to act your pleasure my dear sir if mr effingham feel sufficient interest in my fortunes to wish to hear what i have told you let there be no silly mysteriesoror mademoiselle viefville  or nanny sidley or annette interrupted john effingham with a kind smile well trust to me for that but before we separate for the night i wish to ascertain beyond question one other fact although the circumstances you have stated scarce leave a doubt of the reply  i understand you sir and did not intend to leave you in any uncertainty on that important particular if there can be a feeling more painful than all others with a man of any pride it is to distrust the purity of his mother mine was beyond reproach thank god and so it was most clearly established or i could certainly have had no legal claim to the peerage  or your fortune added john effingham drawing a long breath like one suddenly relieved from an unpleasant suspicion  my fortune comes from neither parent but from one of those generous dispositions or caprices if you will that sometimes induce men to adopt those who are alien to their blood my guardian adopted me took me abroad with him placed me quite young in the navy and dying he finally left me all he possessed as he was a bachelor with no near relative and had been the artisan of his own fortune i could have no hesitation about accepting the gift he so liberally bequeathed it was coupled with the condition that i should retire from the service travel for five years return home and marry there is no sillyforfeiture exacted in either case but such is the general course solemnly advised by a man who showed himself my true friend for so many years  i envy him the opportunity he enjoyed of serving you i hope he would have approved of your national pride for i believe we must put that at the bottom of your disinterestedness in the affair of the peerage  he would indeed although he never knew anything of the claim which arose out of the death of the two lords who preceded my aunt and who were the brothers of my grandmother my guardian was in all respects a man and in nothing more than in a manly national pride while abroad a decoration was offered him and he declined it with the character and dignity of one who felt that distinctions which his country repudiated every gentleman belonging to that country ought to reject and yet he did it with a respectful gratitude for the compliment that was due to the government from which the offer came  i almost envy that man said john effingham with warmth to have appreciated you powis was a mark of a high judgment but it seems he properly appreciated himself his country and human nature  and yet he was little appreciated in his turn that man passed years in one of our largest towns of no more apparent account among its population than any one of its commoner spirits and of not half as much as one of its bustling brokers or jobbers  in that there is nothing surprising the class of the chosen few is too small every where to be very numerous at any given point in a scattered population like that of america the broker will as naturally appreciate the broker as the dog appreciates the dog or the wolf the wolf least of all is the manliness you have named likely to be valued among a people who have been put into mens clothes before they are out of leadingstrings i am older than you my dear paul it was the first time john effingham ever used so familiar an appellation and the young man thought it sounded kindlyi am older than you my dear paul and will venture to tell you an important fact that may hereafter lessen some of your own mortifications in most nations there is a high standard to which man at least affects to look and acts are extolled and seemingly appreciated for their naked merits little of this exists in america where no man is much praised for himself but for the purposes of party or to feed national vanity in the country in which of all others political opinion ought to be the freest it is the most persecuted and the communitycharacter of the nation induces every man to think he has a right of property in all its fame england exhibits a great deal of this weakness and injustice which it is to be feared is a vicious fruit of liberty for it is certain that the sacred nature of opinion is most appreciated in those countries in which it has the least efficiency we are constantly deriding those governments which fetter opinion and yet i know of no nation in which the expression of opinion is so certain to attract persecution and hostility as our own though it may be and is in one sense free  this arises from its potency men quarrel about opinion here because opinion rules it is but one mode of struggling for power but to return to my guardian he was a man to think and act for himself and as far from the magazine and newspaper existence that most americans in a moral sense pass as any man could be  it is indeed a newspaper and magazine existence said john effingham smiling at pauls terms to know life only through such mediums it is as bad as the condition of those english who form their notions of society from novels written by men and women who have no access to it and from the records of the court journal i thank you sincerely mr powis for this confidence which has not been idly solicited on my part and which shall not be abused at no distant day we will break the seals again and renew our investigations into this affair of the unfortunate monday which is not yet certainly very promising in the way of revelations  the gentlemen shook hands cordially and paul lighted by his companion withdrew when the young man was at the door of his own room he turned and saw john effingham following him with his eye the latter then renewed the good night with one of those winning smiles that rendered his face so brilliantly handsome and each retired  chapter xix    item a capon 2s 2d item sauce 4d item sack two    gallons 5s 8d item bread a halfpenny    shakspeare  the next day john effingham made no allusion to the conversation of the previous night though the squeeze of the hand he gave paul when they met was an assurance that nothing was forgotten as he had a secret pleasure in obeying any injunction of eves the young man himself sought captain truck even before they had breakfasted and as he had made an acquaintance with the commodore on the lake previously to the arrival of the effinghams that worthy was summoned and regularly introduced to the honest shipmaster the meeting between these two distinguished men was grave ceremonious and dignified each probably feeling that he was temporarily the guardian of a particular portion of an element that was equally dear to both after a few minutes passed as it might be in the preliminary points of etiquette a better feeling and more confidence was established and it was soon settled that they should fish in company the rest of the day paul promising to row the ladies out on the lake and to join them in the course of the afternoon  as the party quitted the breakfasttable eve took an occasion to thank the young man for his attention to their common friend who it was reported had taken his mornings repast at an early hour and was already on the lake the day by this time having advanced within two hours of noon  i have dared even to exceed your instructions miss effingham said paul for i have promised the captain to endeavour to persuade you and as many of the ladies as possible to trust yourselves to my seamanship and to submit to be rowed out to the spot where we shall find him and his friend the commodore riding at anchor  an engagement that my influence shall be used to see fulfilled mrs bloomfield has already expressed a desire to go on the otsegowater and i make no doubt i shall find other companions once more let me thank you for this little attention for i too well know your tastes not to understand that you might find a more agreeable ward  upon my word i feel a sincere regard for our old captain and could often wish for no better companion were he however as disagreeable as i find him in truth pleasant and frank your wishes would conceal all his faults  you have learned mr powis that small attentions are as much remembered as important services and after having saved our lives wish to prove that you can discharge les petits devoirs socials as well as perform great deeds i trust you will persuade sir george templemore to be of our party and at four we shall be ready to accompany you until then i am contracted to a gossip with mrs bloomfield in her dressingroom  we shall now leave the party on the land and follow those who have already taken boat or the fishermen the beginning of the intercourse between the saltwater navigator and his freshwater companion was again a little constrained and critical their professional terms agreed as ill as possible for when the captain used the expression ship the oars the commodore understood just the reverse of what it had been intended to express and once when he told his companion to give way the latter took the hint so literally as actually to cease rowing all these professional niceties induced the worthy shipmaster to undervalue his companion who in the main was very skilful in his particular pursuit though it was a skill that he exerted after the fashions of his own lake and not after the fashions of the ocean owing to several contretems of this nature by the time they reached the fishingground the captain began to entertain a feeling for the commodore that ill comported with the deference due to his titular rank  i have come out with you commodore said captain truck when they had got to their station and laying a peculiar emphasis on the appellation he used in order to enjoy myself and you will confer an especial favour on me by not using such phrases as cablerope casting anchor and titivating as for the two first no seaman ever uses them and i never heard suchna word on board a ship as the last de sir if i believe it is to be found in the dictionary even  you amaze me sir casting anchor and cablerope are both bible phrases and they must be right  that follows by no means commodore as i have some reason to know for my father having been a parson and i being a seaman we may be said to have the whole subject as it were in the family st paul you have heard of such a man as st paul commodore  i know him almost by heart captain truck but st peter and st andrew were the men most after my heart ours is an ancient calling sir and in those two instances you see to what a fisherman can rise i do not remember to have ever heard of a seacaptain who was converted into a saint  ay ay there is always too much to do on board ship to have time to be much more than a beginner in religion there was my mate vyge before last tom leach who is now master of a ship of his own had he been brought up to it properly he would have made as conscientious a parson as did his grandfather before him such a man would have been a seaman as well as a parson i have little to say against st peter or st andrew but in my judgment they were none the better saints for having been fishermen and if the truth were known i dare say they were at the bottom of introducing such lubberly phrases into the bible as castinganchor and cable rope  pray sir asked the commodore with dignity what are you in the practice of saying when you speak of such matters for to be frank with you we always use these terms on these lakes  ay ay there is a freshwater smell about them we say anchor or let go the anchor or dropped the anchor or some such reasonable expression and not cast anchor as if a bit of iron weighing two or three tons is to be jerked about like a stone big enough to kill a bird with as for the cablerope as you call it we say the cable or the chain or the ground tackle according to reason and circumstances you never hear a real salt flourishing his cableropes and his castinganchors which are altogether too sentimental and particular for his manner of speaking as for ropes i suppose you have not got to be a commodore and need being told how many there are in a ship  i do not pretend to have counted them but i have seen a ship sir and one under full sail too and i know there were as many ropes about her as there are pines on the vision  are there more than seven of these trees on your mountain for that is just the number of ropes in a merchantman though a manofwars man counts one or two more  you astonish me sir but seven ropes in a shipi should have said there are seven hundred  i dare say i dare say that is just the way in which a landsman pretends to criticise a vessel as for the ropes i will now give you their names and then you can lay athwart hawse of these canoe gentry by the hour and teach them rigging and modesty both at the same time in the first place continued the captain jerking at his line and then beginning to count on his fingersthere is the man rope then come the bucketrope the tillerrope the bolt rope the footrope the toprope and the limberrope i have followed the seas now more than half a century and never yet heard of a cablerope from any one who could hand reef and steer  well sir every man to his trade said the commodore who just then pulled in a fine pickerel which was the third he had taken while his companion rejoiced in no more than a few fruitless bites you are more expert in ropes than in lines it would seem i shall not deny your experience and knowledge but in the way of fishing you will at least allow that the sea is no great school i dare say now if you were to hook the sogdollager we should have you jumping into the lake to get rid of him quite probably sir you never before heard of that celebrated fish  notwithstanding the many excellent qualities of captain truck he had a weakness that is rather peculiar to a class of men who having seen so much of this earth are unwilling to admit they have not seen it all the little brush in which he was now engaged with the commodore he conceived due to his own dignity and his motive was duly to impress his companion with his superiority which being fairly admitted he would have been ready enough to acknowledge that the other understood pikefishing much better than himself but it was quite too early in the discussion to make any such avowal and the supercilious remark of the commodores putting him on his mettle he was ready to affirm that he had eaten sogdollagers for breakfast a month at a time had it been necessary  pooh pooh man returned the captain with an air of cool indifference you do not surely fancy that you have any thing in a lake like this that is not to be found in the ocean if you were to see a whales flukes thrashing your puddle every cruiser among you would run for a port and as for sogdollagers we think little of them in saltwater the flyingfish or even the dry dolphin being much the best eating  sir said the commodore with some heat and a great deal of emphasis there is but one sogdollager in the world and he is in this lake no man has ever seen him but my predecessor the admiral and myself  bah ejaculated the captain they are as plenty as soft clams in the mediterranean and the egyptians use them as a panfish in the east they catch them to bait with for hallibut and other middling sized creatures that are particular about their diet it is a good fish i own as is seen in this very circumstance  sir repeated the commodore flourishing his hand and waxing warm with earnestness there is but one sogdollager in the universe and that is in lake otsego a sogdollager is a salmon trout and not a species a sort of father to all the salmon trout in this part of the world a scaly patriarch  i make no doubt your sogdollager is scaly enough but what is the use in wasting words about such a trifle a whale is the only fish fit to occupy a gentlemans thoughts as long as i have been at sea i have never witnessed the taking of more than three whales  this allusion happily preserved the peace for if there were any thing in the world for which the commodore entertained a profound but obscure reverence it was for a whale he even thought better of a man for having actually seen one gambolling in the freedom of the ocean and his mind became suddenly oppressed by the glory of a mariner who had passed his life among such gigantic animals shoving back his cap the old man gazed steadily at the captain a minute and all his displeasure about the sogdollagers vanished though in his inmost mind he set down all that the other had told him on that particular subject as so many parts of a regular fish story  captain truck he said with solemnity i acknowledge myself to be but an ignorant and inexperienced man one who has passed his life on this lake which broad and beautiful as it is must seem a pond in the eyes of a seaman like yourself who have passed your days on the atlantic  atlantic interrupted the captain contemptuously i should have but a poor opinion of myself had i seen nothing but the atlantic indeed i never can believe i am at sea at all on the atlantic the passages between newyork and portsmouth being little more than so much canalling along a towpath if you wish to say any thing about oceans talk of the pacific or of the great south sea where a man may run a month with a fair wind and hardly go from island to island indeed that is an ocean in which there is a manufactory of islands for they turn them off in lots to supply the market and of a size to suit customers  a manufactory of islands repeated the commodore who began to entertain an awe of his companion that he never expected to feel for any human being on lake otsego are you certain sir there is no mistake in this  none in the least not only islands but whole archipelagos are made annually by the sea insects in that quarter of the world but then you are not to form your notions of an insect in such an ocean by the insects you see in such a bit of water as this  as big as our pickerel or salmon trout i dare say returned the commodore in the simplicity of his heart for by this time his local and exclusive conceit was thoroughly humbled and he was almost ready to believe any thing  i say nothing of their size for it is to their numbers and industry that i principally allude now a solitary shark i dare say would set your whole lake in commotion  i think we might manage a shark sir i once saw one of those animals and i do really believe the sogdollager would outweigh him i do think we might manage a shark sir  ay you mean an inshore highlatitude fellow but what would you say to a shark as long as one of those pines on the mountain  such a monster would take in a man whole  a man he would take in a platoon indian file i dare say one of those pines now may be thirty or forty feet high  a gleam of intelligence and of exultation shot across the weather beaten face of the old fisherman for he detected a weak spot in the others knowledge the worthy captain with that species of exclusiveness which accompanies excellence in any one thing was quite ignorant of most matters that pertain to the land that there should be a tree so far inland that was larger than his mainyard he did not think probable although that yard itself was made of part of a tree and in the laudable intention of duly impressing his companion with the superiority of a real seaman over a mere fresh water navigator he had inadvertently laid bare a weak spot in his estimate of heights and distances that the commodore seized upon with some such avidity as the pike seizes the hook this accidental mistake alone saved the latter from an abject submission for the cool superiority of the captain had so far deprived him of his conceit that he was almost ready to acknowledge himself no better than a dog when he caught a glimpse of light through this opening  there is not a pine that can be called of age on all the mountain which is not more than a hundred feet high and many are nearer two he cried in exultation flourishing his hand the sea may have its big monsters captain but our hills have their big trees did you ever see a shark of half that length  now captain truck was a man of truth although so much given to occasional humorous violations of its laws and withal a little disposed to dwell upon the marvels of the great deep in the spirit of exaggeration and he could not in conscience affirm any thing so extravagant as this he was accordingly obliged to admit his mistake and from this moment the conversation was carried on with a greater regard to equality they talked as they fished of politics religion philosophy human nature the useful arts abolition and most other subjects that would be likely to interest a couple of americans who had nothing to do but to twitch from time to time at two lines dangling in the water although few people possess less of the art of conversation than our own countrymen no other nation takes as wide a range in its discussions he is but a very indifferent american that does not know or thinks he knows a little of every thing and neither of our worthies was in the least backward in supporting the claims of the national character in this respect this general discussion completely restored amity between the parties for to confess the truth our old friend the captain was a little rebuked about the affair of the tree the only peculiarity worthy of notice that occurred in the course of their various digressions was the fact that the commodore insensibly began to style his companion general the courtesy of the country in his eyes appearing to require that a man who has seen so much more than himself should at least enjoy a title equal to his own in rank and that of admiral being proscribed by the sensitiveness of republican principles after fishing a few hours the old laker pulled the skiff up to the point so often mentioned where he lighted a fire on the grass and prepared a dinner when every thing was ready the two seated themselves and began to enjoy the fruits of their labours in a way that will be understood by all sportsmen  i have never thought of asking you general said the commodore as he began to masticate a perch whether you are an aristocrat or a democrat we have had the government pretty much upsidedown too this morning but this question has escaped me  as we are here by ourselves under these venerable oaks and talking like two old messmates returned the general i shall just own the truth and make no bones of it i have been captain of my own ship so long that i have a most thorough contempt for all equality it is a vice that i deprecate and whatever may be the laws of this country i am of opinion that equality is no where borne out by the law of nations which after all commodore is the only true law for a gentleman to live under  that is the law of the strongest if i understand the matter general  only reduced to rules the law of nations to own the truth to you is full of categories and this will give an enterprising man an opportunity to make use of his knowledge would you believe commodore that there are countries in which they lay taxes on tobacco  taxes on tobacco sir i never heard of such an act of oppression under the forms of law what has tobacco done that any one should think of taxing it  i believe commodore that its greatest offence is being so general a favourite taxation i have found differs from most other things generally attacking that which men most prize  this is quite new to me general a tax on tobacco the lawmakers in those countries cannot chew i drink to your good health sir and to many happy returns of such banquets as this  here the commodore raised a large silver punchbowl which pierre had furnished to his lips and fastening his eyes on the boughs of a knarled oak he looked like a man who was taking an observation for near a minute all this time the captain regarded him with a sympathetic pleasure and when the bowl was free he imitated the example levelling his own eye at a cloud that seemed floating at an angle of fortyfive degrees above him expressly for that purpose  there is a lazy cloud exclaimed the general as he let go his hold to catch breath i have been watching it some time and it has not moved an inch  tobacco repeated the commodore drawing a long breath as if he was just recovering the play of his lungs i should as soon think of laying a tax on punch the country that pursues such a policy must sooner or later meet with a downfall i never knew good come of persecution  i find you are a sensible man commodore and regret i did not make your acquaintance earlier in life have you yet made up your mind on the subject of religious faith  why my dear general not to be nibbling like a sucker with a sore mouth with a person of your liberality i shall give you a plain history of my adventures in the way of experiences that you may judge for yourself i was born an episcopalian if one can say so but was converted to presbyterianism at twenty i stuck to this denomination about five years when i thought i would try the baptists having got to be fond of the water by this time at thirtytwo i fished a while with the methodists since which conversion i have chosen to worship god pretty much by myself out here on the lake  do you consider it any harm to hook a fish of a sunday  no more than it is to eat a fish of a sunday i go altogether by faith in my religion general for they talked so much to me of the uselessness of works that ive got to be very unparticular as to what i do your people who have been converted four or five times are like so many pickerel which strike at every hook  this is very much my case now on the riverof course you know where the river is  certain said the commodore it is at the foot of the lake  my dear commodore when we say the river we always mean the connecticut and i am surprised a man of your sagacity should require to be told this there are people on the river who contend that a ship should heaveto of a sunday they did talk of getting up an antisundaysailingsociety but the shipmasters were too many for them since they threatened to start a society to put down the growing of inyens the captain would sometimes use this pronunciation except of weekdays well i started in life on the platform tack in the way of religion and i believe i shall stand on the same course till orders come to cast anchor as you call it with you i hold out for faith as the one thing needful pray my good friend what are your real sentiments concerning old hickory  tough sirtough as a day in february on this lake all fins and gills and bones  that is the justest character i have yet heard of the old gentleman and then it says so much in a few words no category about it i hope the punch is to your liking  on this hint the old fisherman raised the bowl a second time to his lips and renewed the agreeable duty of letting its contents flow down his throat in a pleasant stream this time he took aim at a gull that was sailing over his head only relinquishing the draught as the bird settled into the water the general was more particular for selecting a stationary object in the top of an oak that grew on the mountain near him he studied it with an admirable abstruseness of attention until the last drop was drained as soon as this startling fact was mentioned however both the convives set about repairing the accident by squeezing lemons sweetening water and mixing liquors secundem artem at the same time each lighted a cigar and the conversation for some time was carried on between their teeth  we have been so frank with each other today my excellent commodore said captain truck that did i know your true sentiments concerning temperance societies i should look on your inmost soul as a part of myself by these free communications men get really to know each other  if liquor is not made to be drunk for what is it made any one may see that this lake was made for skiffs and fishing it has a length breadth and depth suited to such purposes now here is liquor distilled bottled and corked and i ask if all does not show that it was made to be drunk i dare say your temperance men are ingenious but let them answer that if they can  i wish from my heart my dear sir we had known each other fifty years since that would have brought you acquainted with saltwater and left nothing to be desired in your character we think alike i believe in every thing but on the virtues of freshwater if these temperance people had their way we should all be turned into so many turks who never taste wine and yet marry a dozen wives  one of the great merits of freshwater general is what i call its mixable quality  there would be an end to saturday nights too which are the seamens teaparties  i question if many of them fish in the rain from sunrise to sunset  or stand their watches in wet peejackets from sunset to sunrise splicing the main brace at such times is the very quintessence of human enjoyments  if liquors were not made to be drunk put in the commodore logically i would again ask for what are they made let the temperance men get over that difficulty if they can  commodore i wish you twenty more good hearty years of fishing in this lake which grows each instant more beautiful in my eyes as i confess does the whole earth and to show you that i say no more than i think i will clench it with a draught  captain truck now brought his right eye to bear on the new moon which happened to be at a convenient height closed the left one and continued in that attitude until the commodore began seriously to think he was to get nothing besides the lemonseeds for his share this apprehension however could only arise from ignorance of his companions character than whom a juster man according to the notions of shipmasters did not live and had one measured the punch that was left in the bowl when this draught was ended he would have found that precisely one half of it was still untouched to a thimblefull the commodore now had his turn and before he got through the bottom of the vessel was as much uppermost as the butt of a club bed firelock when the honest fisherman took breath after this exploit and lowered his cup from the vault of heaven to the surface of the earth he caught a view of a boat crossing the lake coming from the silent pine to that point on which they were enjoying so many agreeable hallucinations on the subject of temperance  yonder is the party from the wigwam he said and they will be just in time to become converts to our opinions if they have any doubts on the subjects we have discussed shall we give up the ground to them by taking to the skiff or do you feel disposed to face the women  under ordinary circumstances commodore i should prefer your society to all the petticoats in the state but there are two ladies in that party either of whom i would marry any day at a minutes warning  sir said the commodore with a tone of warning we who have lived bachelors so long and are wedded to the water ought never to speak lightly on so grave a subject  nor do i two women one of whom is twenty and the other seventy and hang me if i know which i prefer  you would soonest be rid of the last my dear general and my advice is to take her  old as she is sir a king would have to plead hard to get her consent we will make them some punch that they may see we were mindful of them in their absence  to work these worthies now went in earnest in order to anticipate the arrival of the party and as the different compounds were in the course of mingling the conversation did not flag by this time both the saltwater and the freshwater sailor were in that condition when men are apt to think aloud and the commodore had lost all his awe of his companion  my dear sir said the former i am a thousand times sorry you came from that river for to tell you my mind without any concealment my only objection to you is that you are not of the middle states i admit the good qualities of the yankees in a general way and yet they are the very worst neighbours that a man can have  this is a new character of them commodore as they generally pass for the best in their own eyes i should like to hear you explain your meaning  i call him a bad neighbour who never remains long enough in a place to love any thing but himself now sir i have a feeling for every pebble on the shore of this lake a sympathy with every wavehere the commodore began to twirl his hand about with the fingers standing apart like so many spikes in a chevauxdefriseand each hour as i row across it i find i like it better and yet sir would you believe me i often go away of a morning to pass the day on the water and on returning home at night find half the houses filled with new faces  what becomes of the old ones demanded captain truck for this it struck him was getting the better of him with his own weapons do you mean that the people come and go like the tides  exactly so sir just as it used to be with the herrings in the otsego before the susquehannah was dammed and is still with the swallows  well well my good friend take consolation youll meet all the faces you ever saw here one day in heaven  never not a man of them will stay there if there be such a thing as moving depend on it sir added the commodore in the simplicity of his heart heaven is no place for a yankee if he can get farther west by hook or by crook they are all too uneasy for any steady occupation you who are a navigator must know something concerning the stars is there such a thing as another world that lies west of this  that can hardly be commodore since the points of the compass only refer to objects on this earth you know i suppose that a man starting from this spot and travelling due west would arrive in time at this very point coming in from the east so that what is west to us in the heavens on this side of the world is east to those on the other  this i confess i did not know general i have understood that what is good in one mans eyes will be bad in anothers but never before have i heard that what is west to one man lies east to another i am afraid general that there is a little of the sogdollager bait in this  not enough sir to catch the merest freshwater gudgeon that swims no no there is neither east nor west off the earth nor any up and down and so we yankees must try and content ourselves with heaven now commodore hand me the bowl and we will get it ready down to the shore and offer the ladies our homage and so you have become a laker in your religion my dear commodore continued the general between his teeth while he smoked and squeezed a lemon at the same time and do your worshipping on the water  altogether of late and more especially since my dream  dream my dear sir i should think you altogether too innocent a man to dream  the best of us have our failings general i do sometimes dream i own as well as the greatest sinner of them all  and of what did you dreamthe sogdollager  i dreamt of death  of slipping the cable cried the general looking up suddenly well what was the drift  why sir having no wings i went down below and soon found myself in the presence of the old gentleman himself  that was pleasanthad he a tail i have always been curious to know whether he really has a tail or not  i saw none sir but then we stood face to face like gentlemen and i cannot describe what i did not see  was he glad to see you commodore  why sir he was civilly spoken but his occupation prevented many compliments  occupation  certainly sir he was cutting out shoes for his imps to travel about in in order to stir up mischief  and did he set you to workthis is a sort of stateprison affair after all  no sir he was too much of a gentleman to set me at making shoes as soon as i arrived he first inquired what part of the country i was from and when i told him he was curious to know what most of the people were about in our neighbourhood  you told him of course commodore  certainly sir i told him their chief occupation was quarrelling about religion making saints of them selves and sinners of their neighbours hollo says the devil calling out to one of his imps boy run and catch my horsei must be off and have a finger in that pie what denominations have you in that quarter commodore so i told him general that we had baptists and quakers and universalists and episcopalians and presbyterians oldlights new lights and bluelights and methodists stop said the devil thats enough you imp be nimble with that horselet me see commodore what part of the country did you say you came from i told him the name more distinctly this time  the very spot  town and county  and what did the devil say to that  he called out to the imp againhollo you boy never mind that horse these people will all be here before i can get there  here the commodore and the general began to laugh until the arches of the forest rang with their merriment three times they stopped and as often did they return to their glee until the punch being ready each took a fresh draught in order to ascertain if it were fit to be offered to the ladies  chapter xx    o romeo romeo wherefore art thou romeo    romeo and juliet  the usual effect of punch is to cause people to see double but on this occasion the mistake was the other way for two boats had touched the strand instead of the one announced by the commodore and they brought with them the whole party from the wigwam steadfast and aristabalus included a domestic or two had also been brought to prepare the customary repast  captain truck was as good as his word as respects the punch and the beverage was offered to each of the ladies in form as soon as her feet had touched the green sward which covers that beautiful spot mrs hawker declined drinking in a way to delight the gallant seaman for so completely had she got the better of all his habits and prejudices that every thing she did seemed right and gracious in his eyes  the party soon separated into groups or pairs some being seated on the margin of the limpid water enjoying the light cool airs by which it was fanned others lay off in the boats fishing while the remainder plunged into the woods that in their native wildness bounded the little spot of verdure which canopied by old oaks formed the arena so lately in controversy in this manner an hour or two soon slipped away when a summons was given for all to assemble around the viands  the repast was laid on the grass notwithstanding aristabulus more than hinted that the public his beloved public usually saw fit to introduce rude tables for that purpose the messrs effinghams however were not to be taught by a mere bird of passage how a rustic fête so peculiarly their own ought to be conducted and the attendants were directed to spread the dishes on the turf around this spot rustic seats were improvisés and the business of restauration proceeded of all there assembled the parisian feelings of mademoiselle viefville were the most excited for to her the scene was one of pure delights with the noble panorama of forestclad mountains the mirrorlike lake the overshadowing oaks and the tangled brakes of the adjoining woods  mais vraiment ceci surpasse les tuileries même dans leur propre genre she exclaimed with energy on passer ait volontiers par les dangers du désert pour y parvenir  those who understood her smiled at this characteristic remark and most felt disposed to join in the enthusiasm still the manner in which their companions expressed the happiness they felt appeared tame and unsatisfactory to mr bragg and mr dodge these two persons being accustomed to see the young of the two sexes indulge in broader exhibitions of merrymaking than those in which it comported with the tastes and habits of the present party to indulge in vain mrs hawker in her quiet dignified way enjoyed the ready wit and masculine thoughts of mrs bloom field appearing to renew her youth or eve with her sweet simplicity and highly cultivated mind and improved tastes seemed like a highlypolished mirror to throw back the flashes of thought and memory that so constantly gleamed before both it was all lost on these thoroughly matteroffact utilitarians mr effingham all courtesy and mild refinement was seldom happier and john effingham was never more pleasant for he had laid aside the severity of his character to appear what he ought always to have been a man in whom intelligence and quickness of thought could be made to seem secondary to the gentler qualities the young men were not behind their companions either each in his particular way appearing to advantage gay regulated and full of a humour that was rendered so much the more agreeable by drawing its images from a knowledge of the world that was tempered by observation and practice  poor grace alone was the only one of the whole party always excepting aristabulus and steadfast who for those fleeting but gay hours was not thoroughly happy for the first time in her life she felt her own deficiencies that ready and available knowledge so exquisitely feminine in its nature and exhibition which escaped mrs bloomfield and eve as it might be from its own excess which the former possessed almost intuitively a gift of heaven and which the latter enjoyed not only from the same source but as a just consequence of her long and steady selfdenial application and a proper appreciation of her duty to herself was denied one who in illjudged compliance with the customs of a society that has no other apparent aim than the love of display had precluded herself from enjoyments that none but the intellectual can feel still grace was beautiful and attractive and though she wondered where her cousin in general so simple and unpretending had acquired all those stores of thought that in the abandon and freedom of such a fête escaped her in rich profusion embellished with ready allusions and a brilliant though chastened wit her generous and affectionate heart could permit her to wonder without envying she perceived for the first time on this occasion that if eve were indeed a hajji it was not a hajji of a common school and while her modesty and self abasement led her bitterly to regret the hours irretrievably wasted in the frivolous levities so common to those of her sex with whom she had been most accustomed to mingle her sincere regret did not lessen her admiration for one she began tenderly to love  as for messrs dodge and bragg they both determined in their own minds that this was much the most stupid entertainment they had ever seen on that spot for it was entirely destitute of loud laughing noisy merriment coarse witticisms and practical jokes to them it appeared the height of arrogance for any particular set of persons to presume to come to a spot rendered sacred by the public suffrage in its favour in order to indulge in these outlandish doginthe mangerisms  towards the close of this gay repast and when the party were about to yield their places to the attendants who were ready to reship the utensils john effingham observed  i trust mrs hawker you have beenduly warned of the catastrophe character of this point on which woman is said never to have been wooed in vain here are captain truck and myself ready at any moment to use these carving knives faute des bowies in order to show our desperate devotion and i deem it no more than prudent in you not to smile again this day lest the crosseyed readings of jealousy should impute a wrong motive  had the injunction been against laughing sir i might have resisted but smiles are far too feeble to express ones approbation on such a day as this you may therefore trust to my discretion is it then true however that hymen haunts these shades  a bachelors history of the progress of love may be like the education of his children distrusted but so sayeth tradition and i never put my foot in the place without making fresh vows of constancy to myself after this announcement of the danger dare you accept an arm for i perceive signs that life cannot be entirely wasted in these pleasures great as they may prove  the whole party arose and separating naturally they strolled in groups or pairs again along the pebbly strand or beneath the trees while the attendants made the preparations to depart accident as much as design left sir george and grace alone for neither perceived the circumstance until they had both passed a little rise in the formation of the ground and were beyond the view of their companions the baronet was the first to perceive how much he had been favoured by fortune and his feelings were touched by the air of gentle melancholy that shaded the usually bright and brilliant countenance of the beautiful girl  i should have thrice enjoyed this pleasant day he said with an interest in his manner that caused the heart of grace to beat quicker had i not seen that to you it has been less productive of satisfaction than to most of those around you i fear you may not be as well as usual  in health never better though not in spirits perhaps  i could wish i had a right to inquire why you who have so few causes in general to be out of spirits should have chosen a moment so little in accordance with the common feeling  i have chosen no moment the moment has chosen me i fear not until this day sir george templemore have i ever been truly sensible of my great inferiority to my cousin eve  an inferiority that no one but yourself would observe or mention  no i am neither vain enough nor ignorant enough to be the dupe of this flattery returned grace shaking her hands and head while she forced a smile for even the delusions those we love pour into our ears are not without their charms when i first met my cousin after her return my own imperfections rendered me blind to her superiority but she herself has gradually taught me to respect her mind her womanly character her tact her delicacy principles breeding every thing that can make a woman estimable or worthy to be loved oh how have i wasted in childish amusements and frivolous vanities the precious moments of that girlhood which can never be recalled and left myself scarcely worthy to be an associate of eve effingham  the first feelings of grace had so far gotten the control that she scarce knew what she said or to whom she was speaking she even wrung her hands in the momentary bitterness of her regrets and in a way to arouse all the sympathy of a lover  no one but yourself would say this miss van cortlandt and least of all your admirable cousin  she is indeed my admirable cousin but what are we in comparison with such a woman simple and unaffected as a child with the intelligence of a scholar with all the graces of a woman she has the learning and mind of a man mistress of so many languages  but you too speak several my dear miss van cortlandt  yes said grace bitterly i speak them as the parrot repeats words that he does not understand but eve effingham has used these languages as means and she does not tell you merely what such a phrase or idiom signifies but what the greatest writers have thought and written  no one has a more profound respect for your cousin than myself miss van cortlandt but justice to you requires that i should say her great superiority over yourself has escaped me  this may be true sir george templemore and for a long time it escaped me too i have only learned to prize her as she ought to be prized by an intimate acquaintance hour by hour as it might be but even you must have observed how quick and intuitively my cousin and mrs bloomfield have understood each other today how much extensive reading and what polished tastes they have both shown and all so truly feminine mrs bloomfield is a remarkable woman but she loves these exhibitions for she knows she excels in them not so with eve effingham who while she so thoroughly enjoys every thing intellectual is content always to seem so simple now it happens that the conversation turned once today on a subject that my cousin no later than yesterday fully explained to me at my own earnest request and i observed that while she joined so naturally with mrs bloomfield in adding to our pleasure she kept back half what she knew lest she might seem to surpass her friend nononothere is not such another woman as eve effingham in this world  so keen a perception of excellence in others denotes an equal excellence in yourself  i know my own great inferiority now and no kindness of yours sir george templemore can ever persuade me into a better opinion of myself eve has travelled seen much in europe that does not exist here and instead of passing her youth in girlish trifling has treated the minutes as if they were all precious as she well knew them to be  if europe then does indeed possess these advantages why not yourself visit it dearest miss van cortlandt  ii a hajji cried grace with childish pleasure though her colour heightened and for a moment eve and her superiority was forgotten  certainly sir george templemore did not come out on the lake that day with any expectation of offering his baronetcy his fair estate with his hand to this artless halfeducated provincial but beautiful girl for a long time he had been debating with himself the propriety of such a step and it is probable that at some later period he would have sought an occasion had not one now so opportunely offered notwithstanding all his doubts and reasonings with himself if the woman who hesitates is lost it is equally true that the man who pretends to set up his reason alone against beauty is certain to find that sense is less powerful than the senses had grace van cortlandt been more sophisticated less natural her beauty might have failed to make this conquest but the baronet found a charm in her naiveté that was singularly winning to the feelings of a man of the world eve had first attracted him by the same quality the early education of american females being less constrained and artificial than that of the english but in eve he found a mental training and acquisitions that left the quality less conspicuous perhaps than in her scarcely less beautiful cousin though had eve met his admiration with any thing like sympathy her power over him would not have been easily weakened as it was grace had been gradually winding herself around his affections and he now poured out his love in a language that her unpractised and already favourably disposed feelings had no means of withstanding a very few minutes were allowed to them before the summons to the boat but when this summons came grace rejoined the party elevated in her own good opinion as happy as a cloudless future could make her and without another thought of the immeasurable superiority of her cousin  by a singular coincidence while the baronet and grace were thus engaged on one part of the shore eve was the subject of a similar proffer of connecting herself for life on another she had left the circle attended by paul her father and aristabulus but no sooner had they reached the margin of the water than the two former were called away by captain truck to settle some controverted point between the latter and the commodore by this unlookedfor desertion eve found herself alone with mr bragg  that was a funny and comprehensive remark mr john made about the point miss eve aristabulus commenced as soon as he found himself in possession of the ground i should like to know if it be really true that no woman was ever unsuccessfully wooed beneath these oaks if such be the case we gentlemen ought to be cautious how we come here  here aristabulus simpered and looked if possible more amiable than ever though the quiet composure and womanly dignity of eve who respected herself too much and too well knew what was due to her sex even to enter into or so far as it depended on her will to permit any of that commonplace and vulgar trifling about love and matrimony which formed a neverfailing theme between the youthful of the two sexes in mr braggs particular circle sensibly curbed his ambitious hopes still he thought he had made too good an opening not to pursue the subject  mr john effingham sometimes indulges in pleasantries eve answered that would lead one astray who might attempt to follow  love is a jackolantern rejoined aristabulus sentimentally that i admit and it is no wonder so many get swamped in following his lights have you ever felt the tender passion miss eve  now aristabulus had heard this question put at the soirée of mrs houston more than once and he believed himself to be in the most polite road for a regular declaration an ordinary woman who felt herself offended by this question would most probably have stepped back and raising her form to its utmost elevation answered by an emphatic sir not so with eve she felt the distance between mr bragg and herself to be so great that by no probable means could he even offend her by any assumption of equality this distance was the result of opinions habits and education rather than of condition however for though eve effingham could become the wife of a gentleman only she was entirely superior to those prejudices of the world that depend on purely factitious causes instead of discovering surprise indignation or dramatic dignity therefore at this extraordinary question she barely permitted a smile to curl her handsome mouth and this so slightly as to escape her companions eye  i believe we are to be favoured with as smooth water in returning to the village as we had in the morning while coming to this place she simply said you row sometimes i think mr bragg  ah miss eve such another opportunity may never occur again for you foreign ladies are so difficult of access let me then seize this happy moment here beneath the hymeneal oaks to offer you this faithful hand and this willing heart of fortune you will have enough for both and i say nothing about the miserable dross reflect miss eve how happy we might be protecting and soothing the old age of your father and in going down the hill of life in company or as the song says and hand in hand well go and sleep thegither at the foot john anderson my joe  you draw very agreeable pictures mr bragg and with the touches of a master  however agreeable you find them miss eve they fall infinitely short of the truth the tie of wedlock besides being the most sacred is also the dearest and happy indeed are they who enter into the solemn engagement with such cheerful prospects as ourselves our ages are perfectly suitable our disposition entirely consonant our habits so similar as to obviate all unpleasant changes and our fortunes precisely what they ought to be to render a marriage happy with confidence on one side and gratitude on the other as to the day miss eve i could wish to leave you altogether the mistress of that and shall not be urgent  eve had often heard john effingham comment on the cool impudence of a particular portion of the american population with great amusement to herself but never did she expect to be the subject of an attack like this in her own person by way of rendering the scene perfect aristabulus had taken out his penknife cut a twig from a bush and he now rendered himself doubly interesting by commencing the favourite occupation of whittling a cooler picture of passion could not well have been drawn  you are bashfully silent miss eve i make all due allowances for natural timidity and shall say no more at presentthough as silence universally gives consent if you please sir interrupted eve with a slight motion of her parasol that implied a check i presume our habits and opinions notwithstanding you seem to think them so consonant with each other are sufficiently different to cause you not to see the impropriety of one who is situated like yourself abusing the confidence of a parent by making such a proposal to a daughter without her fathers knowledge and on that point i shall say nothing but as you have done me the honour of making me a very unequivocal offer of your hand i wish that the answer may be as distinct as the proposal i decline the advantage and happiness of becoming your wife sir  time flies miss eve  time does fly mr bragg and if you remain much longer in the employment of mr effingham you may lose an opportunity of advancing your fortunes at the west whither i understand it has long been your intention to emigrate  i will readily relinquish all my hopes at the west for your sake  no sir i cannot be a party to such a sacrifice i will not say forget me but forget your hopes here and renew those you have so unreflectingly abandoned beyond the mississippi i shall not represent this conversation to mr effingham in a manner to create any unnecessary prejudices against you and while i thank you as every woman should for an offer that must infer some portion at least of your good opinion you will permit me again to wish you all lawful success in your western enterprises  eve gave mr bragg no farther opportunity to renew his suit for she curtsied and left him as she ceased speaking mr dodge who had been a distant observer of the interview now hastened to join his friend curious to know the result for it had been privately arranged between these modest youths that each should try his fortune in turn with the heiress did she not accept the first proposal to the chagrin of steadfast and probably to the readers surprise aristabulus informed his friend that eves manner and language had been full of encouragement  she thanked me for the offer mr dodge he said and her wishes for my future prosperity at the west were warm and repeated eve effingham is indeed a charming creature  at the west perhaps she meant differently from what you imagine i know her well the girl is full of art  art sir she spoke as plainly as woman could speak and i repeat that i feel considerably encouraged it is something to have had so plain a conversation with eve effingham  mr dodge swallowed his discontent and the whole party soon embarked to return to the village the commodore and general taking a boat by themselves in order to bring their discussions on human affairs in general to a suitable close  that night sir george templemore asked an interview with mr effingham when the latter was alone in his library  i sincerely hope this request is not the forerunner of a departure said the host kindly as the young man entered in which case i shall regard you as one unmindful of the hopes he has raised you stand pledged by implication if not in words to pass another month with us  so far from entertaining an intention so faithless my dear sir i am fearful that you may think i trespass too far on your hospitality  he then communicated his wish to be allowed to make grace van cortlandt his wife mr effingham heard him with a smile that showed he was not altogether unprepared for such a demand and his eye glistened as he squeezed the others hand  take her with all my heart sir george he said but remember you are transferring a tender plant into a strange soil there are not many of your countrymen to whom i would confide such a trust for i know the risk they run who make illassorted unions  illassorted unions mr effingham  yours will not be one in the ordinary acceptation of the term i know for in years birth and fortune you and my dear niece are as much on an equality as can be desired but it is too often an ill assorted union for an american woman to become an english wife so much depends on the man that with one in whom i have less confidence than i have in you i might justly hesitate i shall take a guardians privilege though grace be her own mistress and give you one solemn piece of advicealways respect the country of the woman you have thought worthy to bear your name  i hope always to respect every thing that is hers but why this particular cautionmiss van cortlandt is almost english in her heart  an affectionate wife will take her bias in such matters generally from her husband your country will be her country your god her god still sir george templemore a woman of spirit and sentiment can never wholly forget the land of her birth you love us not in england and one who settles there will often have occasion to hear gibes and sneers on the land from which she came  good god mr effingham you do not think i shall take my wife into society where  bear with a prosers doubts templemore you will do all that is wellintentioned and proper i dare say in the usual acceptation of the words but i wish you to do more that which is wise grace has now a sincere reverence and respect for england feelings that in many particulars are sustained by the facts and will be permanent but in some things observation as it usually happens with the young and sanguine will expose the mistakes into which she has been led by enthusiasm and the imagination as she knows other countries better she will come to regard her own with more favourable and discriminating eyes losing her sensitiveness on account of peculiarities she now esteems and taking new views of things perhaps you will think me selfish but i shall add also that if you wish to cure your wife of any homesickness the surest mode will be to bring her back to her native land  nay my dear sir said sir george laughing this is very much like acknowledging its blemishes  i am aware it has that appearance and yet the fact is otherwise the cure is as certain with the englishman as with the american and with the german as with either it depends on a general law which causes us all to overestimate bygone pleasures and distant scenes and to undervalue those of the present moment you know i have always maintained there is no real philosopher short of fifty nor any taste worth possessing that is a dozen years old  here mr effingham rang the bell and desired pierre to request miss van cortlandt to join him in the library grace entered blushing and shy but with a countenance beaming with inward peace her uncle regarded her a moment intently and a tear glistened in his eye again as he tenderly kissed her burning cheek  god bless you love he saidtis a fearful change for your sex and yet you all enter into it radiant with hope and noble in your confidence take her templemore giving her hand to the baronet and deal kindly by her you will not desert us entirely i trust i shall see you both once more in the wigwam before i die  uncleuncle burst from grace as drowned in tears she threw herself into mr effinghams arms i am an ungrateful girl thus to abandon all my natural friends i have acted wrong  wrong dearest miss van cortlandt  selfishly then sir george templemore the simplehearted girl ingenuously added scarcely knowing how much her words implied perhaps this matter night be reconsidered  i am afraid little would be gained by that my love returned the smiling uncle wiping his eyes at the same instant the second thoughts of ladies usually confirm the first in such matters god bless you gracetemplemore may heaven have you too in its holy keeping remember what i have said and tomorrow we will converse further on the subject does eve know of this my niece  the colour went and came rapidly in graces cheek and she looked to the floor abashed  we ought then to send for her resumed mr effingham again reaching towards the bell  uncle and grace hurriedly interposed in time to save the string from being pulled could i keep such an important secret from my dearest cousin  i find that i am the last in the secret as is generally the case with old fellows and i believe i am even now de trop  mr effingham kissed grace again affectionately and although she strenuously endeavoured to detain him he left the room  we must follow said grace hastily wiping her eyes and rubbing the traces of tears from her cheeksexcuse me sir george templemore will you open  he did though it was not the door but his arms grace seemed like one that was rendered giddy by standing on a precipice but when she fell the young baronet was at hand to receive her instead of quitting the library that instant the bell had announced the appearance of the suppertray before she remembered that she had so earnestly intended to do so  chapter xxi    this day no man thinks he has business at his house    king henry viii  the warm weather which was always a little behind that of the lower counties had now set in among the mountains and the season had advanced into the first week in july independence day as the fourth of that month is termed by the americans arrived and the wits of templeton were taxed as usual in order that the festival might be celebrated with the customary intellectual and moral treat the morning commenced with a parade of the two or three uniformed companies of the vicinity much gingerbread and sprucebeer were consumed in the streets no light potations of whiskey were swallowed in the groceries and a great variety of drinks some of which bore very ambitious names shared the same fate in the taverns  mademoiselle viefville had been told that this was the great american fête the festival of the nation and she appeared that morning in gay ribands and with her bright animated face covered with smiles for the occasion to her surprise however no one seemed to respond to her feelings and as the party rose from the breakfasttable she took an opportunity to ask an explanation of eve in a little aside  estce que je me suis trompée ma chere demanded the lively frenchwoman is not this la célébration de votre indépendance  you are not mistaken my dear mademoiselle viefville and great preparations are made to do it honour i understand there is to be a military parade an oration a dinner and fireworks  monsieur votre père  monsieur mon père is not much given to rejoicings and he takes this annual joy much as a valetudinarian takes his morning draught  et monsieur jean effingham  is always a philosopher you are to expect no antics from him  mais ces jeunes gens monsieur bragg monsieur dodge et monsieur powis même  se réjouissent en américains i presume you are aware that mr powis has declared himself to be an american  mademoiselle viefville looked towards the streets along which divers tall sombrelooking countrymen with faces more lugubrious than those of the mutes of a funeral were sauntering with a desperate air of enjoyment and she shrugged her shoulders as she muttered to herself que ces americains sont drôles  at a later hour however eve surprised her father and indeed most of the americans of the party by proposing that the ladies should walk out into the street and witness the fête  my child this is a strange proposition to come from a young lady of twenty said her father  why strange dear sirwe always mingled in the village fêtes in europe  certainement cried the delighted mademoiselle viefville cest de rigueur même  and it is de rigueur here mademoiselle for young ladies to keep out of them put in john effingham i should be very sorry to see either of you three ladies in the streets of templeton today  why so cousin jack have we any thing to fear from the rudeness of our countrymen i have always understood on the contrary that in no other part of the world is woman so uniformly treated with respect and kindness as in this very republic of ours and yet by all these ominous faces i perceive that it will not do for her to trust herself in the streets of a village on a festa  you are not altogether wrong in what you now say miss effingham nor are you wholly right woman as a whole is well treated in america and yet it will not do for a lady to mingle in scenes like these as ladies may and do mingle with them in europe  i have heard this difference accounted for said paul powis by the fact that women have no legal rank in this country in those nations where the station of a lady is protected by legal ordinances it is said she may descend with impunity but in this where all are equal before the law so many misunderstand the real merits of their position that she is obliged to keep aloof from any collisions with those who might be disposed to mistake their own claims  but i wish for no collisions no associations mr powis but simply to pass through the streets with my cousin and mademoiselle viefville to enjoy the sight of the rustic sports as one would do in france or italy or even in republican switzerland if you insist on a republican example  rustic sports repeated aristabulus with a frightened lookthe people will not bear to hear their sports called rustic miss effingham  surely sireve never spoke to mr bragg now without using a repelling politenesssurely sir the people of these mountains will hardly pretend that their sports are those of a capital  i merely mean maam that the term would be monstrously unpopular nor do i see why the sports in a cityaristabulus was much too peculiar in his notions to call any place that had a mayor and aldermen a townshould not be just as rustic as those of a village the contrary supposition violates the principle of equality  and do you decide against us dear sir eve added looking at mr effingham  without stopping to examine causes my child i shall say that i think you had better all remain at home  voilà mademoiselle viefville une fête americaine  a shrug of the shoulders was the significant reply  nay my daughter you are not entirely excluded from the festivities all gallantry has not quite deserted the land  a young lady shall walk alone with a young gentlemanshall ride alone with himshall drive out alone with himshall not move without him dans le monde mais she shall not walk in the crowd to look at une fête avec son père exclaimed mademoiselle viefville in her imperfect english je désespère vraiment to understand some habitudes americaines  well mademoiselle that you may not think us altogether barbarians you shall at least have the benefit of the oration  you may well call it the oration ned for i believe one or certainly one skeleton has served some thousand orators annually any time these sixty years  of this skeleton then the ladies shall have the benefit the procession is about to form i hear and by getting ready immediately we shall be just in time to obtain good seats  mademoiselle viefville was delighted for after trying the theatres the churches sundry balls the opera and all the admirable gaieties of newyork she had reluctantly come to the conclusion that america was a very good country pour sennuyer and for very little else but here was the promise of a novelty the ladies completed their preparations and accordingly attended by all the gentlemen made their appearance in the assembly at the appointed hour  the orator who as usual was a lawyer was already in possession of the pulpit for one of the village churches had been selected as the scene of the ceremonies he was a young man who had recently been called to the bar it being as much in rule for the legal tyro to take off the wireedge of his wit in a fourth of july oration as it was formerly for a mousquetaire to prove his spirit in a duel the academy which formerly was a servant of all work to the public being equally used for education balls preaching townmeetings and caucuses had shared the fate of most american edifices in wood having lived its hour and been burned and the collection of people whom we have formerly had occasion to describe appeared to have also vanished from the earth for nothing could be less alike in exterior at least than those who had assembled under the ministry of mr grant and their successors who were now collected to listen to the wisdom of mr writ such a thing as a coat of two generations was no longer to be seen the latest fashion or what was thought to be the latest fashion being as rigidly respected by the young farmer or the young mechanic as by the more admitted bucks the law student and the village shopboy all the red cloaks had long since been laid aside to give place to imitation merino shawls or in cases of unusual moderation and sobriety to mantles of silk as eve glanced her eye around her she perceived tuscan hats bonnets of gay colours and flowers and dresses of french chintzes where fifty years ago would have been seen even mens woollen hats and homely english calicoes it is true that the change among the men was not quite as striking for their attire admits of less variety but the black stock had superseded the check handkerchief and the bandanna gloves had taken the places of mittens and the coarse and clownish shoe of cowhide was supplanted by the calfskin boot  where are your peasants your rustics your milk and dairy maidsthe people in shortwhispered sir george templemore to mrs bloomfield as they took their seats or is this occasion thought to be too intellectual for them and the present assembly composed only of the élite  these are the people and a pretty fair sample too of their appearance and deportment most of these men are what you in england would call operatives and the women are their wives daughters and sisters  the baronet said nothing at the moment but he sat looking around him with a curious eye for some time when he again addressed his companion  i see the truth of what you say as regards the men for a critical eye can discover the proofs of their occupations but surely you must be mistaken as respects your own sex there is too much delicacy of form and feature for the class you mean  nevertheless i have said naught but truth  but look at the hands and the feet dear mrs bloomfield those are french gloves too or i am mistaken  i will not positively affirm that the french gloves actually belong to the dairymaids though i have known even this prodigy but rely on it you see here the proper female counterparts of the men and singularly delicate and pretty females are they for persons of their class this is what you call democratic coarseness and vulgarity miss effingham tells me in england  sir george smiled but as what it is the fashion of me country to call the exercises just then began he made no other answer  these exercises commenced with instrumental music certainly the weakest side of american civilization that of the occasion of which we write had three essential faults all of which are sufficiently general to be termed characteristic in a national point of view in the first place the instruments themselves were bad in the next place they were assorted without any regard to harmony and in the last place their owners did not know how to use them as in certain american citiesthe word is well applied hereshe is esteemed the greatest belle who can contrive to utter her nursery sentiments in the loudest voice so in templeton was he considered the ablest musician who could give the greatest éclat to a false note in a word clamour was the one thing needful and as regards time that great regulator of all harmonies paul powis whispered to the captain that the air they had just been listening to resembled what the sailors call a round robin or a particular mode of signing complaints practised by seamen in which the nicest observer cannot tell which is the beginning or which the end  it required all the parisian breeding of mademoiselle viefville to preserve her gravity during this overture though she kept her bright animated frenchlooking eyes roaming over the assembly with an air of delight that as mr bragg would say made her very popular no one else in the party from the wigwam captain truck excepted dared look up but each kept his or her eyes riveted on the floor as if in silent enjoyment of the harmonies as for the honest old seaman there was as much melody in the howling of a gale to his unsophisticated ears as in any thing else and he saw no difference between this feat of the templeton band and the sighings of old boreas and to say the truth our nautical critic was not so much out of the way  of the oration it is scarcely necessary to say much for if human nature is the same in all ages and under all circumstances so is a fourth of july oration there were the usual allusions to greece and rome between the republics of which and that of this country there exists some such affinity as is to be found between a horsechestnut and a chestnuthorse or that of mere words and a long catalogue of national glories that might very well have sufficed for all the republics both of antiquity and of our own time but when the orator came to speak of the american character and particularly of the intelligence of the nation he was most felicitous and made the largest investments in popularity according to his account of the matter no other people possessed a tithe of the knowledge or a hundredth part of the honesty and virtue of the very community he was addressing and after labouring for ten minutes to convince his hearers that they already knew every thing he wasted several more in trying to persuade them to undertake further acquisitions of the same nature  how much better all this might be made said paul powis as the party returned towards the wigwam when the exercises were ended by substituting a little plain instruction on the real nature and obligations of the institutions for so much unmeaning rhapsody nothing has struck me with more surprise and pain than to find how far or it might be better to say how high ignorance reaches on such subjects and how few men in a country where all depends on the institutions have clear notions concerning their own condition  certainly this is not the opinion we usually entertain of ourselves observed john effingham and yet it ought to be i am far from underrating the ordinary information of the country which as an average information is superior to that of almost every other people nor am i one of those who according to the popular european notion fancy the americans less gifted than common in intellect there can be but one truth in any thing however and it falls to the lot of very few any where to master it the americans moreover are a people of facts and practices paying but little attention to principles and giving themselves the very minimum of time for investigations that lie beyond the reach of the common mind and it follows that they know little of that which does not present itself in their everyday transactions as regards the practice of the institutions it is regulated here as elsewhere by party and party is never an honest or a disinterested expounder  are you then more than in the common dilemma asked sir george or worse off than your neighbours  we are worse off than our neighbours for the simple reason that it is the intention of the american system which has been deliberately framed and which is moreover the result of a bargain to carry out its theory in practice whereas in countries where the institutions are the results of time and accidents improvement is only obtained by innovations party invariably assails and weakens power when power is the possession of a few the many gain by party but when power is the legal right of the many the few gain by party now as party has no ally as strong as ignorance and prejudice a right understanding of the principles of a government is of far more importance in a popular government than in any other in place of the eternal eulogies on facts that one hears on all public occasions in this country i would substitute some plain and clear expositions of principles or indeed i might say of facts as they are connected with principles  mais la musique monsieur interrupted mademoiselle viefville in a way so droll as to raise a general smile quen pensezvous  that it is music my dear mademoiselle in neither fact nor principle  it only proves that a people can be free mademoiselle observed mrs bloomfield and enjoy fourth of july orations without having very correct notions of harmony or time but do our rejoicings end here miss effingham  not at allthere is still something in reserve for the day and all who honour it i am told the evening which promises to be sufficiently sombre is to terminate with a fête that is peculiar to templeton and which is called the fun of fire  it is an ominous name and ought to be a brilliant ceremony  as this was uttered the whole party entered the wigwam  the fun of fire took place as a matter of course at a later hour when night had set in every body appeared in the main street of the village a part of which from its width and form was particularly adapted to the sports of the evening the females were mostly at the windows or on such elevated stands as favoured their view and the party from the wigwam occupied a large balcony that topped the piazza of one of the principal inns of the place  the sports of the night commenced with rockets of which a few that did as much credit to the climate as to the state of the pyrotechnics of the village were thrown up as soon as the darkness had become sufficiently dense to lend them brilliancy then followed wheels crackers and serpents all of the most primitive kind if indeed there be any thing primitive in such amusements the fun of fire was to close the rejoicings and it was certainly worth all the other sports of that day united the gingerbread and spruce beer included  a blazing ball cast from a shopdoor was the signal for the commencement of the fun it was merely a ball of ropeyarn or of some other similar material saturated with turpentine and it burned with a bright fierce flame until consumed as the first of these fiery meteors sailed into the street a common shout from the boys apprentices and young men proclaimed that the fun was at hand it was followed by several more and in a few minutes the entire area was gleaming with glancing light the whole of the amusement consisted in tossing the fireballs with boldness and in avoiding them with dexterity something like competition soon entering into the business of the scene  the effect was singularly beautiful groups of dark objects became suddenly illuminated and here a portion of the throng might be seen beneath a brightness like that produced by a bonfire while all the background of persons and faces were gliding about in a darkness that almost swallowed up a human figure suddenly all this would be changed the brightness would pass away and a ball alighting in a spot that had seemed abandoned to gloom it would be found peopled with merry countenances and active forms the constant changes from brightness to deep darkness with all the varying gleams of light and shadow made the beauty of the scene which soon extorted admiration from all in the balcony  mais cest charmant exclaimed mademoiselle vielville who was enchanted at discovering something like gaiety and pleasure among the tristes amêricains and who had never even suspected them of being capable of so much apparent enjoyment  these are the prettiest village sports i have ever witnessed said eve though a little dangerous one would think there is something refreshing as the magazine writers term it to find one of these miniature towns of ours condescending to be gay and happy in a village fashion if i were to bring my strongest objection to american country life it would be its ambitious desire to ape the towns converting the ease and abandon of a village into the formality and stiffness that render children in the clothes of grown people so absurdly ludicrous  what exclaimed john effingham do you fancy it possible to reduce a freeman so low as to deprive him of his stilts no no young lady you are now in a country where if you have two rows of flounces on your frock your maid will make it a point to have three by way of maintaining the equilibrium this is the noble ambition of liberty  annettes foible is a love of flounces cousin jack and you have drawn that image from your eye instead of your imagination it is a french as well as an american ambition if ambition it be  let it be drawn whence it may it is true have you not remarked sir george templemore that the americans will not even bear the ascendency of a capital formerly philadelphia then the largest town in the country was the political capital but it was too much for any one community to enjoy the united consideration that belongs to extent and politics and so the honest public went to work to make a capital that should have nothing else in its favour but the naked fact that it was the seat of government and i think it will be generally allowed that they have succeeded to admiration i fancy mr dodge will admit that it would be quite intolerable that country should not be town and town country  this is a land of equal rights mr john effingham and i confess that i see no claims that newyork possesses which does not equally belong to templeton  do you hold sir inquired captain truck that a ship is a brig and a brig a ship  the case is different templeton is a town is it not mr john effingham  a town mr dodge but not town the difference is essential  i do not see it sir now newyork to my notion is not a town but a city  ah this is the critical acumen of the editor but you should be indulgent mr dodge to us laymen who pick up our phrases by merely wandering about the world or in the nursery perhaps while you of the favoured few by living in the condensation of a province obtain a precision and accuracy to which we can lay no claim  the darkness prevented the editor of the active inquirer from detecting the general smile and he remained in happy ignorance of the feeling that produced it to say the truth not the smallest of the besetting vices of mr dodge had their foundation in a provincial education and in provincial notions the invariable tendency of both being to persuade their subject that he is always right while all opposed to him in opinion are wrong that wellknown line of pope in which the poet asks what can we reason but from what we know contains the principle of half our foibles and faults and perhaps explains fully that proportion of those of mr dodge to say nothing of those of no small number of his countrymen there are limits to the knowledge and tastes and habits of every man and as each is regulated by the opportunities of the individual it follows of necessity that no one can have a standard much above his own experience that an isolated and remote people should be a provincial people or in other words a people of narrow and peculiar practices and opinions is as unavoidable as that study should make a scholar though in the case of america the great motive for surprise is to be found in the fact that causes so very obvious should produce so little effect when compared with the bulk of other nations the americans though so remote and insulated are scarcely provincial for it is only when the highest standard of this nation is compared with the highest standard of other nations that we detect the great deficiency that actually exists that a moral foundation so broad should uphold a moral superstructure so narrow is owing to the circumstance that the popular sentiment rules and as every thing is referred to a body of judges that in the nature of things must be of very limited and superficial attainments it cannot be a matter of wonder to the reflecting that the decision shares in the qualities of the tribunal in america the gross mistake has been made of supposing that because the mass rules in a political sense it has a right to be listened to and obeyed in all other matters a practical deduction that can only lead under the most favourable exercise of power to a very humble mediocrity it is to be hoped that time and a greater concentration of taste liberality and knowledge than can well distinguish a young and scattered population will repair this evil and that our children will reap the harvest of the broad fields of intelligence that have been sowed by ourselves in the mean time the present generation must endure that which cannot easily be cured and among its other evils it will have to submit to a great deal of very questionable information not a few false principles and an unpleasant degree of intolerant and narrow bigotry that are propagated by such apostles of liberty and learning as steadfast dodge esquire  we have written in vain if it now be necessary to point out a multitude of things in which that professed instructor and mentor of the public the editor of the active inquirer had made a false estimate of himself as well as of his fellowcreatures that such a man should be ignorant is to be expected as he had never been instructed that he was selfsufficient was owing to his ignorance which oftener induces vanity than modesty that he was intolerant and bigoted follows as a legitimate effect of his provincial and contracted habits that he was a hypocrite came from his homage of the people and that one thus constituted should be permitted periodically to pour out his vapidity folly malice envy and ignorance on his fellowcreatures in the columns of a newspaper was owing to a state of society in which the truth of the wholesome adage that what is every mans business is nobodys business is exemplified not only daily but hourly in a hundred other interests of equal magnitude as well as to a capital mistake that leads the community to fancy that whatever is done in their time is done for their good  as the fun of fire had by this time exhibited most of its beauties the party belonging to the wigwam left the balcony and the evening proving mild they walked into the grounds of the building where they naturally broke into groups conversing on the incidents of the day or of such other matters as came uppermost occasionally gleams of light were thrown across them from a fire ball or a rockets starry train was still seen drawn in the air resembling the wake of a ship at night as it wades through the ocean  chapter xxii                                gentle octavia let your best love draw   to that point which seeks but to preserve it    antony and cleopatra  we shall not say it was an accident that brought paul and eve side by side and a little separated from the others for a secret sympathy had certainly exercised its influence over both and probably contributed as much as any thing else towards bringing about the circumstance although the wigwam stood in the centre of the village its grounds covered several acres and were intersected with winding walks and ornamented with shrubbery in the wellknown english style improvements also of john effingham for while the climate and forests of america offer so many inducements to encourage landscape gardening it is the branch of art that of all the other ornamental arts is perhaps the least known in this country it is true time had not yet brought the labours of the projector to perfection in this instance but enough had been done to afford very extensive varied and pleasing walks the grounds were broken and john effingham had turned the irregularities to good account by planting and leading paths among them to the great amusement of the lookerson however who like true disciples of the manhattanese economy had already begun to calculate the cost of what they termed grading the lawns it being with them as much a matter of course to bring pleasure grounds down to a mathematical surface as to bring a railroad route down to the proper level  through these paths and among the irregularities groves and shrubberies just mentioned the party began to stroll one group taking a direction eastward another south and a third westward in a way soon to break them up into five or six different divisions these several portions of the company ere long got to move in opposite directions by taking the various paths and while they frequently met they did not often reunite as has been already intimated eve and paul were alone for the first time in their lives under circumstances that admitted of an uninterrupted confidential conversation instead of profiting immediately however by this unusual occurrence as many of our readers may anticipate the young man continued the discourse in which the whole party had been engaged when they entered the gate that communicated with the street  i know not whether you felt the same embarrassment as myself to day miss effingham he said when the orator was dilating on the glories of the republic and on the high honours that accompany the american name certainly though a pretty extensive traveller i have never yet been able to discover that it is any advantage abroad to be one of the fourteen millions of freemen  are we to attribute the mystery that so long hung over your birth place to this fact eve asked a little pointedly  if i have made any seeming mystery as to the place of my birth it has been involuntary on my part miss effingham so far as you at least have been concerned i may not have thought myself authorized to introduce my own history into our little discussions but i am not conscious of aiming at any unusual concealments at vienna and in switzerland we met as travellers and now that you appear disposed to accuse me of concealment i may retort and say that neither you nor your father ever expressly stated in my presence that you were americans  was that necessary mr powis  perhaps not and i am wrong to draw a comparison between my own insignificance and the éclat that attended you and your movements  nay interrupted eve do not misconceive me my father felt an interest in you quite naturally after what had occurred on the lake of lucerne and i believe he was desirous of making you out a countrymana pleasure that he has at length received  to own the truth i was never quite certain until my last visit to england on which side of the atlantic i was actually born and to this uncertainty perhaps may be attributed some of that cosmopolitism to which i made so many high pretensions in our late passage  not know where you were born exclaimed eve with an involuntary haste that she immediately repented  this no doubt sounds odd to you miss effingham who have always been the pride and solace of a most affectionate father but it has never been my good fortune to know either parent my mother who was the sister of ducies mother died at my birth and the loss of my father even preceded hers i may be said to have been born an orphan  eve for the first time in her life had taken his arm and the young man felt the gentle pressure of her little hand as she permitted this expression of sympathy to escape her at a moment she found so intensely interesting to herself  it was indeed a misfortune mr powis and i fear you were put into the navy through the want of those who would feel a natural concern in your welfare  the navy was my own choice partly i think from a certain love of adventure and quite as much perhaps with a wish to settle the question of my birthplace practically at least by enlisting in the service of the one that i first knew and certainly best loved  but of that birthplace i understand there is now no doubt said eve with more interest than she was herself conscious of betraying  none whatever i am a native of philadelphia that point was conclusively settled in my late visit to my aunt lady dunluce who was present at my birth  is lady dunluce also an american  she is never having quitted the country until after her marriage to colonel ducie she was a younger sister of my mothers and notwithstanding some jealousies and a little coldness that i trust have now disappeared i am of opinion she loved her though one can hardly answer for the durability of the family ties in a country where the institutions and habits are as artificial as in england  do you think there is less family affection then in england than in america  i will not exactly say as much though i am of opinion that neither country is remarkable in that way in england among the higher classes it is impossible that the feelings should not be weakened by so many adverse interests when a brother knows that nothing stands between himself and rank and wealth but the claims of one who was born a twelvemonth earlier than himself he gets to feel more like a rival than a kinsman and the temptation to envy or dislike or even hatred sometimes becomes stronger than the duty to love  and yet the english themselves say that the services rendered by the elder to the younger brother and the gratitude of the younger to the elder are so many additional ties  it would be contrary to all the known laws of feeling and all experience if this were so the younger applies to the elder for aid in preference to a stranger because he thinks he has a claim and what man who fancies he has a claim is disposed to believe justice is fully done him or who that is required to discharge a duty imagines he has not done more than could be properly asked  i fear your opinion of men is none of the best mr powis  there may be exceptions but such i believe to be the common fate of humanity the moment a duty is created a disposition to think it easily discharged follows and of all sentiments that of a continued and exacting gratitude is the most oppressive i fear more brothers are aided through family pride than through natural affection  what then loosens the tie among ourselves where no law of primogeniture exists  that which loosens every thing a love of change that has grown up with the migratory habits of the people and which perhaps is in some measure fostered by the institutions here is mr bragg to confirm what i say and we may hear his sentiments on this subject  as aristabulus with whom walked mr dodge just at that moment came out of the shrubbery and took the same direction with themselves powis put the question as one addresses an acquaintance in a room  rotation in feelings sir returned mr bragg is human nature as rotation in office is natural justice some of our people are of opinion that it might be useful could the whole of society be made periodically to change places in order that every one might know how his neighbour lives  you are then an agrarian mr bragg  as far from it as possible nor do i believe you will find such an animal in this county where property is concerned we are a people that never let go as long as we can hold on sir but beyond this we like lively changes now miss effingham every body thinks frequent changes of religious instructors in particular necessary there can be no vital piety without keeping the flame alive with excitement  i confess sir that my own reasoning would lead to a directly contrary conclusion and that there can be no vital piety as you term it with excitement  mr bragg looked at mr dodge and mr dodge looked at mr bragg then each shrugged his shoulders and the former continued the discourse  that may be the case in france miss effingham he said but in america we look to excitement as the great purifier we should as soon expect the air in the bottom of a well to be elastic as that the moral atmosphere shall be clear and salutary without the breezes of excitement for my part mr dodge i think no man should be a judge in the same court more than ten years at a time and a priest gets to be rather commonplace and flat after five there are men that may hold out a little longer i acknowledge but to keep real vital soulsaving regeneration stirring a change should take place as often as once in five years in a parish that is my opinion at least  but sir rejoined eve as the laws of religion are immutable the modes by which it is known universal and the promises mediation and obligations are every where the same i do not see what you propose to gain by so many changes  why miss effingham we change the dishes at table and no family of my acquaintance more than this of your honourable fathers and i am surprised to find you opposed to the system  our religion sir answered eve gravely is a duty and rests on revelation and obedience while our diet may very innocently be a matter of mere taste even of caprice if you will  well i confess i see no great difference the main object in this life being to stir people up and to go ahead i presume you know miss eve that many people think that we ought to change our own parson if we expect a blessing on the congregation  i should sooner expect a curse would follow an act of so much heartlessness sir our clergyman has been with us since his entrance into the duties of his holy office and it will be difficult to suppose that the divine favour would follow the commission of so selfish and capricious a step with a motive no better than the desire for novelty  you quite mistake the object miss eve which is to stir the people up a hopeless thing i fear so long as they always sit under the same preaching  i have been taught to believe that piety is increased mr bragg by the aid of the holy spirits sustaining and supporting us in our good desires and i cannot persuade myself that the deity finds it necessary to save a soul by the means of any of those human agencies by which men sack towns turn an election or incite a mob i hear that extraordinary scenes are witnessed in this country in some of the other sects but i trust never to see the day when the apostolic reverend and sober church in which i have been nurtured shall attempt to advance the workings of that divine power by a profane human hurrah  all this was greek to messrs dodge and bragg who in furthering their objects were so accustomed to stirring people up that they had quite forgotten that the more a man was in an excitement the less he had to do with reason the exaggerated religious sects which first peopled america have had a strong influence in transmitting to their posterity false notions on such subjects for while the old world is accustomed to see christianity used as an ally of government and perverted from its one great end to be the instrument of ambition cupidity and selfishness the new world has been fated to witness the reaction of such abuses and to run into nearly as many errors in the opposite extreme the two persons just mentioned had been educated in the provincial school of religious notions that is so much in favour in a portion of this country and they were striking examples of the truth of the adage that what is bred in the bone will be seen in the flesh for their common character common in this particular at least was a queer mixture of the most narrow superstitions and prejudices that existed under the garb of religious training and of unjustifiable frauds meannesses and even vices mr bragg was a better man than mr dodge for he had more selfreliance and was more manly but on the score of religion he had the same contradictory excesses and there was a common point in the way of vulgar vice towards which each tended simply for the want of breeding and tastes as infallibly as the needle points to the pole cards were often introduced in mr effinghams drawing room and there was one apartment expressly devoted to a billiard table and many was the secret fling and biting gibe that these pious devotees passed between themselves on the subject of so flagrant an instance of immorality in a family of so high moral pretensions the two worthies not unfrequently concluding their comments by repairing to some secret room in a tavern where after carefully locking the door and drawing the curtains they would order brandy and pass a refreshing hour in endeavouring to relieve each other of the labour of carrying their odd sixpences by means of little shoemakers loo  on the present occasion however the earnestness of eve produced a pacifying effect on their consciences for as our heroine never raised her sweet voice above the tones of a gentlewoman its very mildness and softness gave force to her expressions had john effingham uttered the sentiments to which they had just listened it is probable mr bragg would have attempted an answer but under the circumstances he preferred making his bow and diverging into the first path that offered followed by his companion eve and paul continued their circuit of the grounds as if no interruption had taken place  this disposition to change is getting to be universal in the country remarked the latter as soon as aristabulus and his friend had left them and i consider it one of the worst signs of the times more especially since it has become so common to connect it with what it is the fashion to call excitement  to return to the subject which these gentlemen interrupted said eve that of the family ties i have always heard england quoted as one of the strongest instances of a nation in which this tie is slight beyond its aristocratical influence and i should be sorry to suppose that we are following in the footsteps of our goodmother in this respect at least  has mademoiselle viefville never made any remark on this subject  mademoiselle viefville though observant is discreet that she believes the standard of the affections as high in this as in her own country i do not think for like most europeans she believes the americans to be a passionless people who are more bound up in the interests of gain than in any other of the concerns of life  she does not know us said paul so earnestly as to cause eve to start at the deep energy with which he spoke the passions lie as deep and run in currents as strong here as in any other part of the world though there not being as many factitious causes to dam them they less seldom break through the bounds of propriety  for near a minute the two paced the walk in silence and eve began to wish that some one of the party would again join them that a conversation which she felt was getting to be awkward might be interrupted but no one crossed their path again and without rudeness or affectation she saw no means of effecting her object paul was too much occupied with his own feelings to observe his companions embarrassment and after the short pause mentioned he naturally pursued the subject though in a less emphatic manner than before  it was an old and a favourite theory with the europeans he said with a sort of bitter irony that all the animals of this hemisphere have less gifted natures than those of the other nor is it a theory of which they are yet entirely rid the indian was supposed to be passionless because he had selfcommand and what in the european would be thought exhibiting the feelings of a noble nature in him has been represented as ferocity and revenge miss effingham you and i have seen europe have stood in the presence of its wisest its noblest and its best and what have they to boast beyond the immediate results of their factitious and laboured political systems that is denied to the americanor rather would be denied to the american had the latter the manliness and mental independence to be equal to his fortunes  which you think he is not  how can a people be even independent that imports its thoughts as it does its waresthat has not the spirit to invent even its own prejudices  something should be allowed to habit and to the influence of time england herself probably has inherited some of her false notions from the saxons and normans  that is not only possible but probable but england in thinking of russia france turkey or egypt when induced to think wrong yields to an english and not to an american interest her errors are at least requited in a degree by serving her own ends whereas ours are made too often to oppose our most obvious interests we are never independent unless when stimulated by some strong and pressing moneyed concern and not often then beyond the plainest of its effectshere is one apparently who does not belong to our party  paul interrupted himself in consequence of their meeting a stranger in the walk who moved with the indecision of one uncertain whether to advance or to recede rockets frequently fell into the grounds and there had been one or two inroads of boys which had been tolerated on account of the occasion but this intruder was a man in the decline of life of the condition of a warm tradesman seemingly and he clearly had no connection with skyrockets as his eyes were turned inquiringly on the persons of those who passed him from time to time none of whom had he stopped however until he now placed himself before paul and eve in a way to denote a desire to speak  the young people are making a merry night of it he said keeping a hand in each coatpocket while he unceremoniously occupied the centre of the narrow walk as if determined to compel a parley  although sufficiently acquainted with the unceremonious habits of the people of the country to feel no surprise at this intrusion paul was vexed at having his tête à tête with eve so rudely broken and he answered with more of the hauteur of the quarterdeck than he might otherwise have done by saying coldly  perhaps sir it is your wish to see mr effinghamor hesitating an instant as he scanned the strangers appearancesome of his people the first will soon pass this spot and you will find most of the latter on the lawn watching the rockets  the man regarded paul a moment and then he removed his hat respectfully  please sir can you inform me if a gentleman called captain truck one that sails the packets between newyork and england is staying at the wigwam at present  paul told him that the captain was walking with mr effingham and that the next pair that approached would be they the stranger fell back keeping his hat respectfully in his hand and the two passed  that man has been an english servant but has been a little spoiled by the reaction of an excessive liberty to do as he pleases the please sir and the attitude can hardly be mistaken while the nonchalance of his manner à nous aborder sufficiently betrays the second edition of his education  i am curious to know what this person can want with our excellent captainit can scarcely be one of the montauks crew  i will answer for it that the fellow has not enough seamanship about him to whip a rope said paul laughing for if there be two temporal pursuits that have less affinity than any two others they are those of the pantry and the tarbucket i think it will be seen that this man has been an english servant and he has probably been a passenger on board some ship commanded by our honest old friend  eve and paul now turned and they met mr effingham and the captain just as the two latter reached the spot where the stranger still stood  this is captain truck the gentleman for whom you inquired said paul  the stranger looked hard at the captain and the captain looked hard at the stranger the obscurity rendering a pretty close scrutiny necessary to enable either to distinguish features the examination seemed to be mutually unsatisfactory for each retired a little like a man who had not found a face that he knew  there must be two captain trucks then in the trade said the stranger this is not the gentleman i used to know  i think you are as right in the latter part of your remark friend as you are wrong in the first returned the captain know you i do not and yet there are no more two captain trucks in the english trade than there are two miss eve effinghams or two mrs hawkers in the universe i am john truck and no other man of that name ever sailed a ship between new york and england in my day at least  did you ever command the dawn sir  the dawn that i did and the regulus and the manhattan and the wilful girl and the deborahangelina and the sukey and katy which my dear young lady i may say was my first love she was only a foreandafter carrying no standing topsail even and we named her after two of the river girls who were flyers in their way at least i thought so then though a man by sailing a packet comes to alter his notions about men and things or for that matter about women and things too i got into a category in that schooner that i never expect to see equalled for i was driven ashore to windward in her which is gibberish to you my dear young lady but which mr powis will very well understand though he may not be able to explain it  i certainly know what you mean said paul though i confess i am in a category as well as the schooner so far as knowing how it could have happened  the sukey and katy ran away with me thats the upshot of it since that time i have never consented to command a vessel that was called after two of our river young women for i do believe that one of them is as much as a common mariner can manage you see mr effingham we were running along a weathershore as close in as we could get to be in the eddy when a squall struck her abeam and she luffed right on to the beach no helping it helm hard up peak down head sheets to windward and main sheet flying but it was all too late away she went plump ashore to windward but for that accident i think i might have married  and what connexion could you find between matrimony and this accident captain demanded the laughing eve  there was an admonition in it my dear young lady that i thought was not to be disregarded i tried the wilful girl next and she was thrown on her beamends with me after which i renounced all female names and took to the egyptian  the egyptian  certainly regulus who was a great snakekiller they tell me in that part of the world but i never saw my way quite clear as bachelor until i got the dawn did you know that ship friend  i believe sir i made two passages in her while you commanded her  nothing more likely we carried lots of your countrymen though mostly forward of the gangways i commanded the dawn more than twenty years ago  it is all of that time since i crossed with you sir you may remember that we fell in with a wreck ten days after we sailed and took off her crew and two passengers three or four of the latter had died with their sufferings and several of the people  all this seems but as yesterday the wreck was a charleston ship that had started a butt  yes siryes sirthat is just itshe had started but could not get in that is just what they said at the time i am david siri should think you cannot have forgotten david  the honest captain was very willing to gratify the others harmless selfimportance though to tell the truth he retained no more personal knowledge of the david of the dawn than he had of david king of the jews  oh david he cried cordiallyare you david well i did not expect to see you again in this world though i never doubted where we should be hereafter i hope you are very well david what sort of weather have you made of it since we parted if i recollect aright you worked your passagenever at sea before  i beg your pardon sir i never was at sea before the first time it is true but i did not belong to the crew i was a passenger  i remember now you were in the steerage returned the captain who saw daylight ahead  not at all sir but in the cabin  cabin echoed the captain who perceived none of the requisites of a cabinpassenger in the otheroh i understand in the pantry  exactly so sir you may remember my masterhe had the lefthand stateroom to himself and i slept next to the scuttlebutt you recollect master sir  out of doubt and a very good fellow he was i hope you live with him still  lord bless you sir he is dead  oh i recollect hearing of it at the time well david i hope if ever we cross again we shall be shipmates once more we were beginners then but we have ships worth living in nowgood night  do you remember dowse sir that we got from the wreck continued the other unwilling to give up his gossip so soon he was a dark man that had had the smallpox badly i think sir you will recollect him for he was a hard man in other particulars besides his countenance  somewhat flinty about the soul i remember the man well and so david good night you will come and see me if you are ever in town good night david  david was now compelled to leave the place for captain truck who perceived that the whole party was getting together again in consequence of the halt felt the propriety of dismissing his visiter of whom his master and dowse he retained just as much recollection as one retains of a common stagecoach companion after twenty years the appearance of mr howel who just at that moment approached them aided the manoeuvre and in a few minutes the different groups were again in motion though some slight changes had taken place in the distribution of the parties  chapter xxiii    how silver sweet sound lovers tongues at night like softest   music to attending ears    romeo and juliet  a poor matter this of the fireworks said mr howel who with an old bachelors want of tact had joined eve and paul in their walk the english would laugh at them famously i dare say have you heard sir george allude to them at all miss eve  it would be great affectation for an englishman to deride the fire works of any dry climate said eve laughing and i dare say if sir george templemore has been silent on the subject it is because he is conscious he knows little about it  well that is odd i should think england the very first country in the world for fireworks i hear miss eve that on the whole the baronet is rather pleased with us and i must say that he is getting to be very popular in templeton  nothing is easier than for an englishman to become popular in america observed paul especially if his condition in life be above that of the vulgar he has only to declare himself pleased with america or to be sincerely hated to declare himself displeased  and in what does america differ from any other country in this respect asked eve quickly  not much certainly love induces love and dislike dislike there is nothing new in all this but the people of other countries having more confidence in themselves do not so sensitively inquire what others think of them i believe this contains the whole difference  but sir george does rather like us inquired mr howel with interest  he likes some of us particularly well returned eve do you not know that my cousin grace is to become mrsi beg her pardonlady templemore very shortly  good godis that possiblelady templemorelady grace templemore  not lady grace templemore but grace lady templemore and graceful lady templemore in the bargain  and this honour my dear miss eve they tell me you refused  they tell you wrong then sir answered the young lady a little startled with the suddenness and brusquerie of the remark and yet prompt to do justice to all concerned sir george templemore never did me the honour to propose to me or for me and consequently he could not be refused  it is very extraordinaryi hear you were actually acquainted in europe  we were mr howel actually acquainted in europe but i knew hundreds of persons in europe who have never dreamed of asking me to marry them  this is very strangequite unlooked forto marry miss van cortlandt is mr john effingham in the grounds  eve made no answer but paul hurriedly observedyou will find him in the next walk i think by returning a short distance and taking the first path to the left  mr howel did as told and was soon out of sight  that is a most earnest believer in english superiority and one may say by his strong desire to give you an english husband miss effingham in english merit  it is the weak spot in the character of a very honest man they tell me such instances were much more frequent in this country thirty years since than they are today  i can easily believe it for i think i remember some characters of the sort myself i have heard those who are older than i am draw a distinction like this between the state of feeling that prevailed forty years ago and that which prevails today they say that formerly england absolutely and despotically thought for america in all but those cases in which the interests of the two nations conflicted and i have even heard competent judges affirm that so powerful was the influence of habit and so successful the schemes of the political managers of the mother country that even many of those who fought for the independence of america actually doubted of the propriety of their acts as luther is known to have had fits of despondency concerning the justness of the reformation he was producing while latterly the leaning towards england is less the result of a simple mental dependencethough of that there still remains a disgraceful amountthan of calculation and a desire in a certain class to defeat the dominion of the mass and to establish that of a few in its stead  it would indeed be a strange consummation of the history of this country to find it becoming monarchical  there are a few monarchists no doubt springing up in the country though almost entirely in a class that only knows the world through the imagination and by means of books but the disposition in our time is to aristocracy and not to monarchy most men that get to be rich discover that they are no happier for their possessions perhaps every man who has not been trained and prepared to use his means properly is in this category as our friend the captain would call it and then they begin to long for some other untried advantages the example of the rest of the world is before our own wealthy and faute dimagination they imitate because they cannot invent exclusive political power is also a great ally in the accumulation of money and a portion have the sagacity to see it though i suspect more pine for the vanities of the exclusive classes than for the substance your sex miss effingham as a whole is not above this latter weakness as i think you must have observed in your intercourse with those you met abroad  i met with some instances of weakness in this way said eve with reserve and with the pride of a woman though not more i think than among the men and seldom in either case among those whom we are accustomed to consider people of condition at home the self respect and the habits of the latter generally preserved them from betraying this feebleness of character if indeed they felt it  the americans abroad may be divided into two great classes those who go for improvement in the sciences or the arts and those who go for mere amusement as a whole the former have struck me as being singularly respectable equally removed from an apish servility and a swaggering pretension of superiority while i fear a majority of the latter have a disagreeable direction towards the vanities  i will not affirm the contrary said eve for frivolity and pleasure are only too closely associated in ordinary minds the number of those who prize the elegancies of life for their intrinsic value is every where small i should think and i question if europe is much better off than ourselves in this respect  this may be true and yet one can only regret that in a case where so much depends on example the tone of our people was not more assimilated to their facts i do not know whether you were struck with the same peculiarity but whenever i felt in the mood to hear high monarchical and aristocratical doctrines blindly promulgated i used to go to the nearest american legation  i have heard this fact commented on eve answered and even by foreigners and i confess it has always struck me as singular why should the agent of a republic make a parade of his antirepublican sentiments  that there are exceptions i will allow but after the experience of many years i honestly think that such is the rule i might distrust my own opinion or my own knowledge but others with opportunities equal to my own have come to the same conclusion i have just received a letter from europe complaining that an american envoy extraordinary who would as soon think of denouncing himself as utter the same sentiments openly at home has given an opinion against the utility of the vote by ballot and this too under circumstances that might naturally be thought to produce a practical effect  tant pis to me all this is inexplicable  it has its solution miss effingham like any other problem in ordinary times extraordinary men seldom become prominent power passing into the hands of clever managers now the very vanity and the petty desires that betray themselves in glittering uniforms puerile affectations and feeble imitations of other systems probably induce more than half of those who fill the foreign missions to apply for them and it is no more than we ought to expect that the real disposition should betray itself when there was no longer any necessity for hypocrisy  but i should think this necessity for hypocrisy would never cease can it be possible that a people as much attached to their institutions as the great mass of the american nation is known to be will tolerate such a base abandonment of all they cherish  how are they to know any thing about it it is a startling fact that there is a man at this instant who has not a single claim to such a confidence either in the way of mind principles manners or attainments filling a public trust abroad who on all occasions except those which he thinks will come directly before the american people not only proclaims himself opposed to the great principles of the institutions but who in a recent controversy with a foreign nation actually took sides against his own country informing that of the opposing nation that the administration at home would not be supported by the legislative part of the government  and why is not this publicly exposed  cui bono the presses that have no direct interest in the matter would treat the affair with indifference or levity while a few would mystify the truth it is quite impossible for any man in a private station to make the truth available in any country in a matter of public interest and those in public stations seldom or never attempt it unless they see a direct party end to be obtained this is the reason that we see so much infidelity to the principles of the institutions among the public agents abroad for they very well know that no one will be able to expose them in addition to this motive there is so strong a desire in that portion of the community which is considered the highest to effect a radical change in these very institutions that infidelity to them in their eyes would be a merit rather than an offence  surely surely other nations are not treated in this cavalier manner  certainly not the foreign agent of a prince who should whisper a syllable against his master would be recalled with disgrace but the servant of the people is differently situated since there are so many to be persuaded of his guilt i could always get along with all the attacks that the europeans are so fond of making on the american system but those which they quoted from the mouths of our own diplomatic agents  why do not our travellers expose this  most of them see too little to know anything of it they dine at a diplomatic table see a star or two fancy themselves obliged and puff elegancies that have no existence except in their own brains some think with the unfaithful and see no harm in the infidelity others calculate the injury to themselves and no small portion would fancy it a greater proof of patriotism to turn a sentence in favour of the comparative energies and superior intelligence of their own people than to point out this or any other disgraceful fact did they even possess the opportunities to discover it though no one thinks more highly of these qualities in the americans considered in connexion with practical things than myself no one probably gives them less credit for their ability to distinguish between appearances and reality in matters of principle  it is probable that were we nearer to the rest of the world these abuses would not exist for it is certain they are not so openly practised at home i am glad however to find that even while you felt some uncertainty concerning your own birthplace you took so much interest in us as to identify yourself in feeling at least with the nation  there was one moment when i was really afraid that the truth would show i was actually born an englishman  afraid interrupted eve that is a strong word to apply to so great and glorious a people  we cannot always account for our prejudices and perhaps this was one of mine and now that i know that to be an englishman is not the greatest possible merit in your eyes miss effingham it is in no manner lessened  in my eyes mr powis i do not remember to have expressed any partiality for or any prejudice against the english so far as i can speak of my own feelings i regard the english the same as any other foreign people  in words you have not certainly but acts speak louder than words  you are disposed to be mysterious tonight what act of mine has declared pro or con in this important affair  you have at least done what i fear few of your countrywomen would have the moral courage and selfdenial to do and especially those who are accustomed to living abroadrefused to be the wife of an english baronet of a good estate and respectable family  mr powis said eve gravely this is an injustice to sir george templemore that my sense of right will not permit to go uncontradicted as well as an injustice to my sex and me as i told mr howel in your presence that gentleman has never proposed for me and of course cannot have been refused nor can i suppose that any american gentlewoman can deem so paltry a thing as a baronetcy an inducement to forget her selfrespect  i fully appreciate your generous modesty miss effingham but you cannot expect that i to whom templemores admiration gave so much uneasiness not to say pain am to understand you as mr howel has probably done too broadly although sir george may not have positively proposed his readiness to do so on the least encouragement was too obvious to be overlooked by a near observer  eve was ready to gasp for breath so completely by surprise was she taken by the calm earnest and yet respectful manner in which paul confessed his jealousy there was a tremor in his voice too usually so clear and even that touched her heart for feeling responds to feeling as the echo answers sound when there exists a real sympathy between the sexes she felt the necessity of saying something and yet they had walked some distance ere it was in her power to utter a syllable  i fear my presumption has offended you miss effingham said paul speaking more like a corrected child than the lionhearted young man he had proved himself  there was deep homage in the emotion he betrayed and eve although she could barely distinguish his features was not slow in discovering this proof of the extent of her power over his feelings  do not call it presumption she said for one who has done so much for us all can surely claim some right to take an interest in those he has so well served as for sir george templemore you have probably mistaken the feeling created by our common adventures for one of more importance he is warmly and sincerely attached to my cousin grace van cortlandt  that he is so now i fully believe but that a very different magnet first kept him from the canadas i am surewe treated each other generously miss effingham and had no concealments during that long and anxious night when all expected that the day would dawn on our captivity templemore is too manly and honest to deny his former desire to obtain you for a wife and i think even he would admit that it depended entirely on yourself to be so or not  this is an act of selfhumiliation that he is not called onto perform eve hurriedly replied such allusions now are worse than useless and they might pain my cousin were she to hear them  i am mistaken in my friends character if he leave his betrothed in any doubt on this subject five minutes of perfect frankness now might obviate years of distrust hereafter  and would you mr powis avow a former weakness of this sort to the woman you had finally selected for your wife  i ought not to quote myself for authority for or against such a course since i have never loved but one and her with a passion too single and too ardent ever to admit of competition miss effingham there would be something worse than affectationit would be trifling with one who is sacred in my eyes were i now to refrain from speaking explicitly although what i am about to say is forced from me by circumstances rather than voluntary and is almost uttered without a definite object have i your permission to proceed  you can scarcely need a permission being the master of your own secrets mr powis  paul like all men agitated by strong passion was inconsistent and far from just and eve felt the truth of this even while her mind was ingeniously framing excuses for his weaknesses still the impression that she was about to listen to a declaration that possibly ought never to be made weighed upon her and caused her to speak with more coldness than she actually felt as she continued silent however the young man saw that it had become indispensably necessary to be explicit  i shall not detain you miss effingham perhaps vex you he said with the history of those early impressions which have gradually grown upon me until they have become interwoven with my very existence we met as you know at vienna for the first time an austrian of rank to whom i had become known through some fortunate circumstances introduced me into the best society of that capital in which i found you the admiration of all who knew you my first feeling was that of exultation at seeing a young countrywomanyou were then almost a child miss effinghamthe greatest attraction of a capital celebrated for the beauty and grace of its women  your national partialities have made you an unjust judge towards others mr powis eve interrupted him by saying though the earnestness and passion with which the young man uttered his feelings made music to her ears what had a young frightened halfeducated american girl to boast of when put in competition with the finished women of austria  her surpassing beauty her unconscious superiority her attainments her trembling simplicity and modesty and her meek purity of mind all these did you possess not only in my eyes but in those of others for these are subjects on which i dwelt too fondly to be mistaken  a rocket passed near them at the moment and while both were too much occupied by the discourse to heed the interruption its transient light enabled paul to see the flushed cheeks and tearful eyes of eve as the latter were turned on him in a grateful pleasure that his ardent praises extorted from her in despite of all her struggles for selfcommand  we will leave to others this comparison mr powis she said and confine ourselves to less doubtful subjects  if i am then to speak only of that which is beyond all question i shall speak chiefly of my long cherished devoted unceasing love i adored you at vienna miss effingham though it was at a distance as one might worship the sun for while your excellent father admitted me to his society and i even think honoured me with some portion of his esteem i had but little opportunity to ascertain the value of the jewel that was contained in so beautiful a casket but when we met the following summer in switzerland i first began truly to love then i learned the justness of thought the beautiful candour the perfectly feminine delicacy of your mind and although i will not say that these qualities were not enhanced in the eyes of so young a man by the extreme beauty of their possessor i will say that as weighed against each other i could a thousand times prefer the former to the latter unequalled as the latter almost is even among your own beautiful sex  this is presenting flattery in its most seductive form powis  perhaps my incoherent and abrupt manner of explaining myself deserves a rebuke though nothing can be farther from my intentions than to seem to flatter or in any manner to exaggerate i intend merely to give a faithful history of the state of my feelings and of the progress of my love  eve smiled faintly but very sweetly as paul would have thought had the obscurity permitted more than a dim view of her lovely countenance  ought i to listen to such praises mr powis she asked praises which only contribute to a selfesteem that is too great already  no one but yourself would say this but your question does indeed remind me of the indiscretion that i have fallen into by losing that command of my feelings in which i have so long exulted no man should make a woman the confidant of his attachment until he is fully prepared to accompany the declaration with an offer of his handand such is not my condition  eve made no dramatic start assumed no look of affected surprise or of wounded dignity but she turned on her lover her serene eyes with an expression of concern so eloquent and of a wonder so natural that could he have seen it it would probably have overcome every difficulty on the spot and produced the usual offer notwithstanding the difficulty that he seemed to think insurmountable  and yet he continued i have now said so much involuntarily as it has been that i feel it not only due to you but in some measure to myself to add that the fondest wish of my heart the end and aim of all my daydreams as well as of my most sober thoughts for the future centre in the common wish to obtain you for a wife  the eye of eve fell and the expression of her countenance changed while a slight but uncontrollable tremor ran through her frame after a short pause she summoned all her resolution and in a voice the firmness of which surprised even herself she asked  powis to what does all this tend  well may you ask that question miss effingham you have every right to put it and the answer at least shall add no further cause of selfreproach give me i entreat you but a minute to collect my thoughts and i will endeavour to acquit myself of an imperious duty in a manner more manly and coherent than i fear has been observed for the last ten minutes  they walked a short distance in profound silence eve still under the influence of astonishment in which an uncertain and indefinite dread of she scarce knew what began to mingle and paul endeavouring to quiet the tumult that had been so suddenly aroused within him the latter then spoke  circumstances have always deprived me of the happiness of experiencing the tenderness and sympathy of your sex miss effingham and have thrown me more exclusively among the colder and ruder spirits of my own my mother died at the time of my birth thus cutting me off at once from one of the dearest of earthly ties i am not certain that i do not exaggerate the loss in consequence of the privations i have suffered but from the hour when i first learned to feel i have had a yearning for the tender patient endearing disinterested love of a mother you too suffered a similar loss at an early period if i have been correctly informed  a soba stifled but painful sob escaped eve and inexpressibly shocked paul ceased dwelling on his own sources of sorrow to attend to those he had so unintentionally disturbed  i have been selfish dearest miss effingham he exclaimedhave overtaxed your patiencehave annoyed you with griefs and losses that have no interest for you which can have no interest with one happy and blessed as yourself  no no no powisyou are unjust to both i too lost my mother when a mere child and never knew her love and tenderness proceed i am calmer and earnestly intreat you to forget my weakness and to proceed  paul did proceed but this brief interruption in which they had mingled their sorrows for a common misfortune struck a new chord of feeling and removed a mountain of reserve and distance that might otherwise have obstructed their growing confidence  cut off in this manner from my nearest and dearest natural friend paul continued i was thrown an infant into the care of hirelings and in this at least my fortune was still more cruel than your own for the excellent woman who has been so happy as to have had the charge of your infancy had nearly the love of a natural mother however she may have been wanting in the attainments of one of your own condition in life  but we had both of us our fathers mr powis to me my excellent high principled affectionatenay tender father has been every thing without him i should have been truly miserable and with him notwithstanding these rebellious tears tears that i must ascribe to the infection of your own grief i have been truly blest  mr effingham deserves this from you but i never knew my father you will remember  i am an unworthy confidant to have forgotten this so soon poor powis you were indeed unhappy  he had parted from my mother before my birth and either died soon after or has never deemed his child of sufficient worth to make him the subject of interest sufficient to excite a single inquiry into his fate  then he never knew that child burst from eve with a fervour and frankness that set all reserves whether of womanly training or of natural timidity at defiance  miss effinghamdearest miss effinghameve my own eve what am i to infer from this generous warmth do not mislead me i can bear my solitary misery can brave the sufferings of an isolated existence but i could not live under the disappointments of such a hope a hope fairly quickened by a clear expression from your lips  you teach me the importance of caution powis and we will now return to your history and to that confidence of which i shall not again prove a faithless repository for the present at least i beg that you will forget all else  a command so kindlyso encouragingly givendo i offend dearest miss effingham eve for the second time in her life placed her own light arm and beautiful hand through the arm of paul discovering a bewitching but modest reliance on his worth and truth by the very manner in which she did this simple and everyday act while she said more cheerfully  you forget the substance of the command at the very moment you would have me suppose you most disposed to obey it  well then miss effingham you shall be more implicitly minded why my father left my mother so soon after their union i never knew it would seem that they lived together but a few months though i have the proud consolation of knowing that my mother was blameless for years i suffered the misery of doubt on a point that is ever the most tender with man a distrust of his own mother but all this has been happily blessedly cleared up during my late visit to england it is true that lady dunluce was my mothers sister and as such might have been lenient to her failings but a letter from my father that was written only a month before my mothers death leaves no doubt not only of her blamelessness as a wife but bears ample testimony to the sweetness of her disposition this letter is a precious document for a son to possess miss effingham  eve made no answer but paul fancied that he felt another gentle pressure of the hand which until then had rested so lightly on his own arm that he scarcely dared to move the latter lest he might lose the precious consciousness of its presence  i have other letters from my father to my mother the young man continued but none that are so cheering to my heart as this from their general tone i cannot persuade myself that he ever truly loved her it is a cruel thing miss effingham for a man to deceive a woman on a point like that  cruel indeed said eve firmly death itself were preferable to such a delusion  i think my father deceived himself as well as my mother for there is a strange incoherence and a want of distinctness in some of his letters that caused feelings keen as mine naturally were on such a subject to distrust his affection from the first  was your mother rich eve asked innocently for an heiress herself her vigilance had early been directed to that great motive of deception and dishonesty  not in the least she had little besides her high lineage and her beauty i have her picture which sufficiently proves the latter had i ought rather to say for it was her miniature of which i was robbed by the arabs as you may remember and i have not seen it since in the way of money my mother had barely the competency of a gentlewoman nothing more  the pressure on paul was more palpable as spoke of the miniature and he ventured to touch his companions arm in order to give it a surer hold of his own  mr powis was not mercenary then and it is a great deal said eve speaking as if she were scarcely conscious that she spoke at all  mr powishe was every thing that was noble and disinterested a more generous or a less selfish man never existed than francis powis  i thought you never knew your father personally exclaimed eve in surprise  nor did i but you are in an error in supposing that my fathers name was powis when it was assheton  paul then explained the manner in which he had been adopted while still a child by a gentleman called powis whose name he had taken on finding himself deserted by his own natural parent and to whose fortune he had succeeded on the death of his voluntary protector  i bore the name of assheton until mr powis took me to france when he advised me to assume his own which i did the more readily as he thought he had ascertained that my father was dead and that he had bequeathed the whole of a very considerable estate to his nephews and nieces making no allusion to me in his will and seemingly anxious even to deny his marriage at least he passed among his acquaintances for a bachelor to his dying day  there is something so unusual and inexplicable in all this mr powis that it strikes me you have been to blame in not inquiring more closely into the circumstances than by your own account i should think had been done  for a long time for many bitter years i was afraid to inquire lest i should learn something injurious to a mothers name then there was the arduous and confined service of my profession which kept me in distant seas and the last journey and painful indisposition of my excellent benefactor prevented even the wish to inquire after my own family the offended pride of mr powis who was justly hurt at the cavalier manner in which my fathers relatives met his advances aided in alienating me from that portion of my relatives and put a stop to all additional proffers of intercourse from me they even affected to doubt the fact that my father had ever married  but of that you had proof eve earnestly asked  unanswerable my aunt dunluce was present at the ceremony and i possess the certificate given to my mother by the clergyman who officiated is it not strange miss effingham that with all these circumstances in favour of my legitimacy even lady dunluce and her family until lately had doubts of the fact  that is indeed unaccountable your aunt having witnessed the ceremony  very true but some circumstances a little aided perhaps by the strong desire of her husband general ducie to obtain the revival of a barony that was in abeyance and of which she would be the only heir assuming that my rights were invalid inclined her to believe that my father was already married when he entered into the solemn contract with my mother but from that curse too i have been happily relieved  poor powis said eve with a sympathy that her voice expressed more clearly even than her words you have indeed suffered cruelly for one so young  i have learned to bear it dearest miss effingham and have stood so long a solitary and isolated being one in whom none have taken any interest  nay say not thatwe at least have always felt an interest in youhave always esteemed you and now have learned to  learned to  love you said eve with a steadiness that afterwards astonished herself but she felt that a being so placed was entitled to be treated with a frankness different from the reserve that it is usual for her sex to observe on similar occasions  love cried paul dropping her arm miss effinghamevebut that we  i mean my dear fathercousin jackmyself  such a feeling will not heal a wound like mine a love that is shared with even such men as your excellent father and your worthy cousin will not make me happy but why should i unowned bearing a name to which i have no legal title and virtually without relatives aspire to one like you  the windings of the path had brought them near a window of the house whence a stream of strong light gleamed upon the sweet countenance of eve as raising her eyes to those of her companion with a face bathed in tears and flushed with natural feeling and modesty the struggle between which even heightened her loveliness she smiled an encouragement that it was impossible to misconstrue  can i believe my senses will youdo youcan you listen to the suit of one like me the young man exclaimed as he hurried his companion past the window lest some interruption might destroy his hopes  is there any sufficient reason why i should not powis  nothing but my unfortunate situation in respect to my family my comparative poverty and my general unworthiness  your unfortunate situation in respect to your relatives would if any thing be a new and dearer tie with us your comparative poverty is merely comparative and can be of no account where there is sufficient already and as for your general unworthiness i fear it will find more than an offset in that of the girl you have so rashly chosen from the rest of the world  evedearest eve said paul seizing both her hands and stopping her at the entrance of some shrubbery that densely shaded the path and where the little light that fell from the stars enabled him still to trace her featuresyou will not leave me in doubt on a subject of this natuream i really so blessed  if accepting the faith and affection of a heart that is wholly yours powis can mate you happy your sorrows will be at an end  but your father said the young man almost breathless in his eagerness to know all  is here to confirm what his daughter has just declared said mr effingham coming out of the shrubbery beyond them and laying a hand kindly on pauls shoulder to find that you so well understand each other powis removes from my mind one of the greatest anxieties i have ever experienced my cousin john as he was bound to do has made me acquainted with all you have told him of your past life and there remains nothing further to be revealed we have known you for years and receive you into our family with as free a welcome as we could receive any precious boon from providence  mr effinghamdear sir said paul almost gasping between surprise and rapturethis is indeed beyond all my hopesand this generous frankness too in your lovely daughter  pauls hands had been transferred to those of the father he knew not how but releasing them hurriedly he now turned in quest of eve again and found she had fled in the short interval between the address of her father and the words of paul she had found means to disappear leaving the gentlemen together the young man would have followed but the cooler head of mr effingham perceiving that the occasion was favourable to a private conversation with his accepted soninlaw and quite as unfavourable to one or at least to a very rational one between the lovers he quietly took the young mans arm and led him towards a more private walk there half an hour of confidential discourse calmed the feelings of both and rendered paul powis one of the happiest of human beings  chapter xxiv    you shall do marvellous wisely good reynaldo before you visit   him to make inquiry of his behaviour    hamlet  ann sidley was engaged among the dresses of eve as she loved to be although annette held her taste in too low estimation ever to permit her to apply a needle or even to fit a robe to the beautiful form that was to wear it when our heroine glided into the room and sunk upon a sofa eve was too much absorbed with her own feelings to observe the presence of her quiet unobtrusive old nurse and too much accustomed to her care and sympathy to heed it had it been seen for a moment she remained her face still suffused with blushes her hands lying before her folded her eyes fixed on the ceiling and then the pent emotions found an outlet in a flood of tears  poor ann could not have felt more shocked had she heard of any unexpected calamity than she was at this sudden outbreaking of feeling in her child she went to her and bent over her with the solicitude of a mother as she inquired into the causes of her apparent sorrow  tell me miss eve and it will relieve your mind said the faithful woman your dear mother had such feelings sometimes and i never dared to question her about them but you are my own child and nothing can grieve you without grieving me  the eyes of eve were brilliant her face continued to be suffused and the smile which she gave through her tears was so bright as to leave her poor attendant in deep perplexity as to the cause of a gush of feeling that was very unusual in one of the others regulated mind  it is not grief dear nannyeve at length murmuredany thing but that i am not unhappy oh no as far from unhappiness as possible  god be praised it is so maam i was afraid that this affair of the english gentleman and miss grace might not prove agreeable to you for he has not behaved as handsomely as he might in that transaction  and why not my poor nannyi have neither claim nor the wish to possess a claim on sir george templemore his selection of my cousin has given me sincere satisfaction rather than pain were he a countryman of our own i should say unalloyed satisfaction for i firmly believe he will strive to make her happy  nanny now looked at her young mistress then at the floor at her young mistress again and afterwards at a rocket that was sailing athwart the sky her eyes however returned to those of eve and encouraged by the bright beam of happiness that was glowing in the countenance she so much loved she ventured to say  if mr powis were a more presuming gentleman than he is maam  you mean a less modest nanny said eve perceiving that her nurse paused  yes maamone that thought more of himself and less of other people is what i wish to say  and were this the case  i might think he would find the heart to say what i know he feels  and did he find the heart to say what you know he feels what does ann sidley think should be my answer  oh maam i know it would be just as it ought to be i cannot repeat what ladies say on such occasions but i know that it is what makes the hearts of the gentlemen leap for joy  there are occasions in which woman can hardly dispense with the sympathy of woman eve loved her father most tenderly had more than the usual confidence in him for she had never known a mother but had the present conversation been with him notwithstanding all her reliance on his affection her nature would have shrunk from pouring out her feelings as freely as she might have done with her other parent had not death deprived her of such a blessing between our heroine and ann sidley on the other hand there existed a confidence of a nature so peculiar as to require a word of explanation before we exhibit its effects in all that related to physical wants ann had been a mother or even more than a mother to eve and this alone had induced great personal dependence in the one and a sort of supervisory care in the other that had brought her to fancy she was responsible for the bodily health and welldoing of her charge but this was not all nanny had been the repository of eves childish griefs the confidant of her girlish secrets and though the years of the latter soon caused her to be placed under the management of those who were better qualified to store her mind this communication never ceased the hightoned and educated young woman reverting with unabated affection and a reliance that nothing could shake to the longtried tenderness of the being who had watched over her infancy the effect of such an intimacy was often amusing the one party bringing to the conferences a mind filled with the knowledge suited to her sex and station habits that had been formed in the best circles of christendom and tastes that had been acquired in schools of high reputation and the other little more than her single hearted love a fidelity that ennobled her nature and a simplicity that betokened perfect purity of thought nor was this extraordinary confidence without its advantages to eve for thrown so early among the artificial and calculating it served to keep her own ingenuousness of character active and prevented that cold selfish and unattractive sophistication that mere women of fashion are apt to fall into from their isolated and factitious mode of existence when eve therefore put the questions to her nurse that have already been mentioned it was more with a real wish to know how the latter would view a choice on which her own mind was so fully made up than any silly trifling on a subject that engrossed so much of her best affections  but you have not told me dear nanny she continued what you would have that answer be ought i for instance ever to quit my beloved father  what necessity would there be for that maam mr powis has no home of his own and for that matter scarcely any country  how can you know this nanny demanded eve with the jealous sensitiveness of a young love  why miss eve his man says this much and he has lived with him long enough to know it if he had a home now i seldom sleep without looking back at the day and often have my thoughts turned to sir george temple more and mr powis and when i have remembered that the first had a house and a home and that the last had neither it has always seemed to me that he ought to be the one  and then in all this matter you have thought of convenience and what might be agreeable to others rather than of me  miss eve  nay dearest nanny forgive me i know your last thought in every thing is for yourself but surely the mere circumstance that he had no home ought not to be a sufficient reason for selecting any man for a husband with most women it would be an objection  i pretend to know very little of these feelings miss eve i have been wooed i acknowledge and once i do think i might have been tempted to marry had it not been for a particular circumstance  you you marry ann sidley exclaimed eve to whom the bare idea seemed as odd and unnatural as that her own father should forget her mother and take a second wife this is altogether new and i should be glad to know what the lucky circumstance was which prevented what to me might have proved so great a calamity  why maam i said to myself what does a woman do who marries she vows to quit all else to go with her husband and to love him before father and mother and all other living beings on earthis it not so miss eve  i believe it is so indeed nannynay i am quite certain it is so eve answered the colour deepening on her cheek as she gave this opinion to her old nurse with the inward consciousness that she had just experienced some of the happiest moments of her life through the admission of a passion that thus overshadowed all the natural affections it is truly as you say  well maam i investigated my feelings i believe they call it and after a proper trial i found that i loved you so much better than any one else that i could not in conscience make the vows  dearest nanny my kind good faithful old nurse let me hold you in my arms and i selfish thoughtless heartless girl would forget the circumstance that would be most likely to keep us together for the remainder of our lives hist there is a tap at the door it is mrs bloomfield i know her light step admit her my kind ann and leave us together  the bright searching eye of mrs bloomfield was riveted on her young friend as she advanced into the room and her smile usually so gay and sometimes ironical was now thoughtful and kind  well miss effingham she cried in a manner that her looks contradicted am i to condole with you or to congratulatefor a more sudden or miraculous change did i never before witness in a young lady though whether it be for the better or the worsethese are ominous words toofor better or worse for richer or poorer  you are in fine spirits this evening my dear mrs bloomfield and appear to have entered into the gaieties of the fun of fire with all your  might will be a homely but an expressive word your templeton fun of fire is fiery fun for it has cost us something like a general conflagration mrs hawker has been near a downfall like your great namesake by a serpents coming too near her dress one barn i hear has actually been in a blaze and sir george templemores heart is in cinders mr john effingham has been telling me that he should not have been a bachelor had there been two mrs bloomfields in the world and mr powis looks like a rafter dugout of herculaneum nothing but coal  and what occasions this pleasantry asked eve so composed in manner that her friend was momentarily deceived  mrs bloomfield took a seat on the sofa by the side of our heroine and regarding her steadily for near a minute she continued  hypocrisy and eve effingham can have little in common and my ears must have deceived me  your ears dear mrs bloomfield  my ears dear miss effingham i very well know the character of an eavesdropper but if gentlemen will make passionate declarations in the walk of a garden with nothing but a little shrubbery between his ardent declarations and the curiosity of those who may happen to be passing they must expect to be overheard  eves colour had gradually increased as her friend proceeded and when the other ceased speaking as bright a bloom glowed on her countenance as had shone there when she first entered the room  may i ask the meaning of all this she said with an effort to appear calm  certainly my dear and you shall also know the feelings that prompt it as well as the meaning returned mrs bloomfield kindly taking eves hand in a way to show that she did not mean to trifle further on a subject that was of so much moment to her young friend mr john effingham and myself were stargazing at a point where two walks approach each other just as you and mr powis were passing in the adjoining path without absolutely stepping our ears it was quite impossible not to hear a portion of your conversation we both tried to behave honourably for i coughed and your kinsman actually hemmed but we were unheeded  coughed and hemmed repeated eve in greater confusion than ever there must be some mistake dear mrs bloomfield as i remember to have heard no such signals  quite likely my love for there was a time when i too had ears for only one voice but you can have affidavits to the fact à la mode de new england if you require them do not mistake my motive nevertheless miss effingham which is any thing but vulgar curiosityhere mrs bloomfield looked so kind and friendly that eve took both her hands and pressed them to her heartyou are motherless without even a single female connexion of a suitable age to consult with on such an occasion and fathers after all are but men  mine is as kind and delicate and tender as any woman can be mrs bloomfield  i believe it all though he may not be quite as quicksighted in an affair of this natuream i at liberty to speak to you as if i were an elder sister  speak mrs bloomfield as frankly as you please but leave me the mistress of my answers  it is then as i suspected said mrs bloomfield in a sort of musing manner the men have been won over and this young creature has absolutely been left without a protector in the most important moment of her life  mrs bloomfieldwhat does this meanwhat can it mean  it means merely general principles child that your father and cousin have been parties concerned instead of vigilant sentinels and with all their pretended care that you have been left to grope your way in the darkness of female uncertainty with one of the most pleasing young men in the country constantly before you to help the obscurity  it is a dreadful moment when we are taught to doubt the worth of those we love and eve became pale as death as she listened to the words of her friend once before on the occasion of pauls return to england she had felt a pang of that sort though reflection and a calm revision of all his acts and words since they first met in germany had enabled her to get the better of indecision and when she first saw him on the mountain nearly every unpleasant apprehension and distrust had been dissipated by an effort of pure reason his own explanations had cleared up the unpleasant affair and from that moment she had regarded him altogether with the eyes of a confiding partiality the speech of mrs bloomfield now sounded like words of doom to her and for an instant her friend was frightened with the effects of her own imperfect communication until that moment mrs bloomfield had formed no just idea of the extent to which the feelings of eve were interested in paul for she had but an imperfect knowledge of their early association in europe and she sincerely repented having introduced the subject at all it was too late to retreat however and first folding eve in her arms and kissing her cold forehead she hastened to repair a part at least of the mischief she had done  my words have been too strong i fear she said but such is my general horror of the manner in which the young of our sex in this country are abandoned to the schemes of the designing and selfish of the other that i am perhaps too sensitive when i see any one that i love thus exposed you are known my dear to be one of the richest heiresses of the country and i blush to say that no accounts of european society that we have make fortunehunting a more regular occupation there than it has got to be here  the paleness left eves face and a look of slight displeasure succeeded  mr powis is no fortunehunter mrs bloomfield she said steadily his whole conduct for three years has been opposed to such a character and then though not absolutely rich perhaps he has a gentlemans income and is removed from the necessity of being reduced to such an act of baseness  i perceive my error but it is now too late to retreat i do not say that mr powis is a fortunehunter but there are circumstances connected with his history that you ought at least to know and that immediately i have chosen to speak to you rather than to speak to your father because i thought you might like a female confidant on such occasion in preference even to your excellent natural protector the idea of mrs hawker occurred to me on account of her age but i did not feel authorised to communicate to her a secret of which i had myself become so accidentally possessed  i appreciate your motive fully dearest mrs bloomfield said eve smiling with all her native sweetness and greatly relieved for she now began to think that too keen a sensitiveness on the subject of paul had unnecessarily alarmed her and beg there may be no reserves between us if you know a reason why mr powis should not be received as a suitor i entreat you to mention it  is he mr powis at all  again eve smiled to mrs bloomfields great surprise for as the latter had put the question with sincere reluctance she was astonished at the coolness with which it was received  he is not mr powis legally perhaps though he might be but that he dislikes the publicity of an application to the legislature his paternal name is assheton  you know his history then  there has been no reserve on the part of mr powis least of all any deception  mrs bloomfield appeared perplexed even distressed and there was a brief space during which her mind was undecided as to the course she ought to take that she had committed an error by attempting a consultation in a matter of the heart with one of her own sex after the affections were engaged she discovered when it was too late but she prized eves friendship too much and had too just a sense of what was due to herself to leave the affair where it was or without clearing up her own unasked agency in it  i rejoice to learn this she said as soon as her doubts had ended for frankness while it is one of the safest is one of the most beautiful traits in human character but beautiful though it be it is one that the other sex uses least to our own  is our own too ready to use it to the other  perhaps not it might be better for both parties were there less deception practised during the period of courtship generally but as this is hopeless and might destroy some of the most pleasing illusions of life we will not enter into a treatise on the frauds of cupid now to my own confessions which i make all the more willingly because i know they are uttered to the ear of one of a forgiving temperament and who is disposed to view even my follies favourably  the kind but painful smile of eve assured the speaker she was not mistaken and she continued after taking time to read the expression of the countenance of her young friend  in common with all of newyork that town of babbling misses who prattle as water flows without consciousness or effort and of whiskered masters who fancy broadway the world and the flirtations of miniature drawingrooms human nature i believed on your return from europe that an accepted suitor followed in your train in the person of sir george templemore  nothing in my deportment or in that of sir george or in that of any of my family could justly have given rise to such a notion said eve quickly  justly what has justice or truth or even probability to do with a report of which love and matrimony are the themes do you not know society better than to fancy this improbability child  i know that our own sex would better consult their own dignity and respectability my dear mrs bloomfield if they talked less of such matters and that they would be more apt to acquire the habits of good taste not to say of good principles if they confined their strictures more to things and sentiments than they do and meddled less with persons  and pray is there no tittletattle no scandal no commenting on ones neighbours in other civilized nations besides this  unquestionably though i believe as a rule it is every where thought to be inherently vulgar and a proof of low associations  in that we are perfectly of a mind for if there be any thing that betrays a consciousness of inferiority it is our rendering others of so much obvious importance to ourselves as to make them the subjects of our constant conversation we may speak of virtues for therein we pay an homage to that which is good but when we come to dwell on personal faults it is rather a proof that we have a silent conviction of the superiority of the subject of our comments to ourselves either in character talents social position or something else that is deemed essential than of our distaste for his failings who for instance talks scandal of his grocer or of his shoemaker no no our pride forbids this we always make our betters the subject of our strictures by preference taking up with our equals only when we can get none of a higher class  this quite reconciles me to having been given to sir george templemore by the world of newyork said eve smiling  and well it may for they who have prattled of your engagement have done so principally because they are incapable of maintaining a conversation on any thing else but all this time i fear i stand accused in your mind of having given advice unasked and of feeling an alarm in an affair that affected others instead of myself which is the very sin that we lay at the door of our worthy manhattanese in common with all around me then i fancied sir george templemore an accepted lover and by habit had gotten to associate you together in my pictures oh my arrival here however i will confess that mr powis whom you will remember i had never seen before struck me as much the most dangerous manshall i own all my absurdity  even to the smallest shade  well then i confess to having supposed that while the excellent father believed you were in a fair way to become lady templemore the equally excellent daughter thought the other suitor infinitely the most agreeable person  what in contempt of a betrothal  of course i at once ascribed that part of the report to the usual embellishments we do not like to be deceived in our calculations or to discover that even our gossip has misled us in pure resentment at my own previous delusion i began to criticise this mr powis  criticise mrs bloomfield  to find fault with him my dear to try to think he was not just the handsomest and most engaging young man i had ever seen to imagine what he ought to be in place of what he was and among other things to inquire who he was  you did not think proper to ask that question of any of us said eve gravely  i did not for i discovered by instinct or intuition or conjecturethey mean pretty much the same thing i believethat there was a mystery about him something that even his templeton friends did not quite understand and a lucky thought occurred of making my inquiries of another person  they were answered satisfactorily said eve looking up at her friend with the artless confidence that marks her sex when the affections have gotten the mastery of reason  cosi cosi bloomfield has a brother who is in the navy as you know and i happened to remember that he had once spoken of an officer of the name of powis who had performed a clever thing in the west indies when they were employed together against the pirates i wrote to him one of my usual letters that are compounded of all things in nature and art and took an occasion to allude to a certain mr paul powis with a general remark that he had formerly served together with a particular inquiry if he knew any thing about him all this no doubt you think very officious but believe me dear eve where there was as much interest as i felt and feel in you it was very natural  so far from entertaining resentment i am grateful for your concern especially as i know it was manifested cautiously and without any unpleasant allusions to third persons  in that respect i believe i did pretty well tom bloomfieldi beg his pardon captain bloomfield for so he calls himself at present knows mr powis well or rather did know him for they have not met for years and he speaks of his personal qualities and professional merit highly but takes occasion to remark that there was some mystery connected with his birth as before he joined the service he understood he was called assheton and at a later day powis and this without any public law or public avowal of a motive now it struck me that eve effingham ought not to be permitted to form a connection with a man so unpleasantly situated without being apprised of the fact i was waiting for a proper occasion to do this ungrateful office myself when accident made me acquainted with what has passed this evening and perceiving that there was no time to lose i came hither more led by interest in you my dear perhaps than by discretion  i thank you sincerely for this kind concern in my welfare dear mrs bloomfield and give you full credit for the motive will you permit me to inquire how much you know of that which passed this evening  simply that mr powis is desperately in love a declaration that i take it is always dangerous to the peace of mind of a young woman when it comes from a very engaging young man  and my part of the dialogue eve blushed to the eyes as she asked this question though she made a great effort to appear calmmy answer  there was too much of woman in meof true genuine loyal native woman miss effingham to listen to that had there been an opportunity we were but a moment near enough to hear any thing though that moment sufficed to let us know the state of feelings of the gentleman i ask no confidences my dear eve and now that i have made my explanations lame though they be i will kiss you and repair to the drawingroom where we shall both be soon missed forgive me if i have seemed impertinent in my interference and continue to ascribe it to its true motive  stop mrs bloomfield i entreat for a single moment i wish to say a word before we part as you have been accidentally made acquainted with mr powiss sentiments towards me it is no more than just that you should know the nature of mine towards him  eve paused involuntarily for though she had commenced her explanation with a firm intention to do justice to paul the bashfulness of her sex held her tongue tied at the very moment her desire to speak was the strongest an effort conquered the weakness and the warmhearted generousminded girl succeeded in commanding her voice  i cannot allow you to go away with the impression that there is a shade of any sort on the conduct of mr powis she said so far from desiring to profit by the accidents that have placed it in his power to render us such essential service he has never spoken of his love until this evening and then under circumstances in which feeling naturally perhaps i might say uncontrollably got the ascendency  i believe it all for i feel certain eve effingham would not bestow her heart heedlessly  heartmrs bloomfield  heart my dear and now i insist on the subjects being dropped at least for the present your decision is probably not yet madeyou are not yet an hour in possession of your suitors secret and prudence demands deliberation i shall hope to see you in the drawingroom and until then adieu  mrs bloomfield signed for silence and quitted the room with the same light tread as that with which she had entered it  chapter xxv    to show virtue her own feature scorn her own image and the very   age and body of the time his form and pressure    shakspeare  when mrs bloomfield entered the drawingroom she found nearly the whole party assembled the fun of fire had ceased and the rockets no longer gleamed athwart the sky but the blaze of artificial light within was more than a substitute for that which had so lately existed without  mr effingham and paul were conversing by themselves in a window seat while john effingham mrs hawker and mr howel were in an animated discussion on a sofa mr wenham had also joined the party and was occupied with captain ducie though not so much so as to prevent occasional glances at the trio just mentioned sir george templemore and grace van cortlandt were walking together in the great hall and were visible through the open door as they passed and repassed  i am glad of your appearance among us mrs bloomfield said john effingham for certainly more anglomania never existed than that which my good friend howel manifests this evening and i have hopes that your eloquence may persuade him out of some of those notions on which my logic has fallen like seed scattered by the wayside  i can have little hopes of success where mr john effingham has failed  i am far from being certain of that for somehow howel has taken up the notion that i have gotten a grudge against england and he listens to all i say with distrust and distaste  mr john uses strong language habitually maam cried mr howel and you will make some allowances for a vocabulary that has no very mild terms in it though to be frank i do confess that he seems prejudiced on the subject of that great nation  what is the point in immediate controversy gentlemen asked mrs bloomfield taking a seat  why here is a review of a late american work maam and i insist that the author is skinned alive whereas mr john insists that the reviewer exposes only his own rage the work having a national character and running counter to the reviewers feelings and interests  nay i protest against this statement of the case for i affirm that the reviewer exposes a great deal more than his rage since his imbecility ignorance and dishonesty are quite as apparent as any thing else  i have read the article said mrs bloomfield after glancing her eye at the periodical and i must say that i take sides with mr john effingham in his opinion of its character  but do you not perceive maam that this is the idol of the nobility and gentry the work that is more in favour with people of consequence in england than any other bishops are said to write for it  i know it is a work expressly established to sustain one of the most factitious political systems that ever existed and that it sacrifices every high quality to attain its end  mrs bloomfield you amaze me the first writers of great britain figure in its pages  that i much question in the first place but even if it were so it would be but a shallow mystification although a man of character might write one article in a work of this nature it does not follow that a man of no character does not write the next the principles of the communications of a periodical are as different as their talents  but the editor is a pledge for allthe editor of this review is an eminent writer himself  an eminent writer may be a very great knave in the first place and one fact is worth a thousand conjectures in such a matter but we do not know that there is any responsible editor to works of this nature at all for there is no name given in the titlepage and nothing is more common than vague declarations of a want of this very responsibility but if i can prove to you that this article cannot have been written by a man of common honesty mr howel what will you then say to the responsibility of your editor  in that case i shall be compelled to admit that he had no connexion with it  any thing in preference to giving up the beloved idol said john effingham laughing why not add at once that he is as great a knave as the writer himself i am glad however that tom howel has fallen into such good hands mrs bloomfield and i devoutly pray you may not spare him  we have said that mrs bloomfield had a rapid perception of things and principles that amounted almost to intuition she had read the article in question and as she glanced her eyes through its pages had detected its fallacies and falsehoods in almost every sentence indeed they had not been put together with ordinary skill the writer having evidently presumed on the easiness of the class of readers who generally swallowed his round assertions and were so clumsily done that any one who had not the faith to move mountains would have seen through most of them without difficulty but mr howel belonged to another school and he was so much accustomed to shut his eyes to palpable mystification mentioned by mrs bloomfield that a lie which advanced in most works would have carried no weight with it advanced in this particular periodical became elevated to the dignity of truth  mrs bloomfield turned to an article on america in the periodical in question and read from it several disparaging expressions concerning mr howels native country one of which was the americans first plaything is the rattlesnakes tail  now what do you think of this assertion in particular mr howel she asked reading the words we have just quoted  oh that is said in mere pleasantryit is only wit  well then what do you think of it as wit  well well it may not be of a very pure water but the best of men are unequal at all times and more especially in their wit  here continued mrs bloomfield pointing to another paragraph is a positive statement or misstatement which makes the cost of the civil department of the united states government about six times more than it really is  our government is so extremely mean that i ascribe that error to generosity  well continued the lady smiling here the reviewer asserts that congress passed a law limiting the size of certain ships in order to please the democracy and that the executive privately evaded this law and built vessels of a much greater size whereas the provision of the law is just the contrary or that the ships should not be less than of seventyfour guns a piece of information by the way that i obtained from mr powis  ignorance maam a stranger cannot be supposed to know all the laws of a foreign country  then why make bold and false assertions about them that are intended to discredit the country here is another assertionten thousand of the men that fought at waterloo would have marched through north america do you believe that mr howel  but that is merely an opinion mrs bloomfield any man may be wrong in his opinion  very true but it is an opinion uttered in the year of our lord one thousand eight hundred and twentyeight and after the battles of bunker hill cowpens plattsburg saratoga and neworleans and moreover after it had been proved that something very like ten thousand of the identical men who fought at waterloo could not march even ten miles into the country  well well all this shows that the reviewer is sometimes mistaken  your pardon mr howel i think it shows according to your own admission that his wit or rather its wit for there is no his about itthat its wit is of a very indifferent quality as witticisms even that it is ignorant of what it pretends to know and that its opinions are no better than its knowledge all of which when fairly established against one who by his very pursuit professes to know more than other people is very much like making it appear contemptible  this is going back eight or ten yearslet us look more particularly at the article about which the discussion commences  volontiers  mrs bloomfield now sent to the library for the work reviewed and opening the review she read some of its strictures and then turning to the corresponding passages in the work itself she pointed out the unfairness of the quotations the omissions of the context and in several flagrant instances witticisms of the reviewer that were purchased at the expense of the english language she next showed several of those audacious assertions for which the particular periodical was so remarkable leaving no doubt with any candid person that they were purchased at the expense of truth  but here is an instance that will scarce admit of cavilling or objection on your part mr howel she continued do me the favour to read the passage in the review  mr howel complied and when he had done he looked expectingly at the lady  the effect of the reviewers statement is to make it appear that the author has contradicted himself is it not  certainly nothing can be plainer  according to your favourite reviewer who accuses him of it in terms now let us look at the fact here is the passage in the work itself in the first place you will remark that this sentence which contains the alleged contradiction is mutilated the part which is omitted giving a directly contrary meaning to it from that it bears under the reviewers scissors  it has some such appearance i do confess  here you perceive that the closing sentence of the same paragraph and which refers directly to the point at issue is displaced made to appear as belonging to a separate paragraph and as conveying a different meaning from what the author has actually expressed  upon my word i do not know but you are right  well mr howel we have had wit of no very pure water ignorance as relates to facts and mistakes as regards very positive assertions in what category as captain truck would say do you place this  why does not the author reviewed expose this  why does not a gentleman wrangle with a detected pickpocket  it is literary swindling said john effingham and the man who did it is inherently a knave  i think both these facts quite beyond dispute observed mrs bloomfield laying down mr howels favourite review with an air of cool contempt and i must say i did not think it necessary to prove the general character of the work at this late date to any american of ordinary intelligence much less to a sensible man like mr howel  but maam there may be much truth and justice in the rest of its remarks returned the pertinacious mr howel although it has fallen into these mistakes  were you ever on a jury howel asked john effingham in his caustic manner  often and on grand juries too  well did the judge never tell you when a witness is detected in lying on one point that his testimony is valueless on all others  very true but this is a review and not testimony  the distinction is certainly a very good one resumed mrs bloomfield laughing as nothing in general can be less like honest testimony than a review  but i think my dear maam you will allow that all this is excessively biting and severei cant say i ever read any thing sharper in my life  it strikes me mr howel as being nothing but epithets the cheapest and most contemptible of all species of abuse were two men in your presence to call each other such names i think it would excite nothing but disgust in your mind when the thought is clear and poignant there is little need to have recourse to mere epithets indeed men never use the latter except when there is a deficiency of the first  well well my friends cried mr howel as he walked away towards grace and sir george this is a different thing from what i at first thought it but still i think you undervalue the periodical  i hope this little lesson will cool some of mr howels faith in foreign morality observed mrs bloomfield as soon as the gentleman named was out of hearing a more credulous and devout worshipper of the idol i have never before met  the school is diminishing but it is still large men like tom howel who have thought in one direction all their lives are not easily brought to change their notions especially when the admiration which proceeds from distance distance that lends enchantment to the view is at the bottom of their faith had this very article been written and printed round the corner of the street in which he lives howel would be the first to say that it was the production of a fellow without talents or principles and was unworthy of a second thought  i still think he will be a wiser if not a better man by the exposure of its frauds  not he if you will excuse a homely and a coarse simile he will return like a dog to his vomit or the sow to its wallowing in the mire i never knew one of that school thoroughly cured until he became himself the subject of attack or by a close personal communication was made to feel the superciliousness of european superiority it is only a week since i had a discussion with him on the subject of the humanity and the relish for liberty in his beloved model and when i cited the instance of the employment of the tomahawk in the wars between england and this country he actually affirmed that the indian savages killed no women and children but the wives and offspring of their enemies and when i told him that the english like most other people cared very little for any liberty but their own he coolly affirmed that their own was the only liberty worth caring for  oh yes put in young mr wenham who had overheard the latter portion of the conversation mr howel is so thoroughly english that he actually denies that america is the most civilized country in the world or that we speak our language better than any nation was ever before known to speak its own language  this is so manifest an act of treason said mrs bloomfield endeavouring to look grave for mr wenham was any thing but accurate in the use of words himself commonly pronouncing been ben does dooze nothing nawthing few foo c c c that certainly mr howel should be arraigned at the bar of public opinion for the outrage  it is commonly admitted even by our enemies that our mode of speaking is the very best in the world which i suppose is the real reason why our literature has so rapidly reached the top of the ladder  and is that the fact asked mrs bloomfield with a curiosity that was not in the least feigned  i believe no one denies that you will sustain me in this i fancy mr dodge  the editor of the active inquirer had approached and was just in time to catch the subject in discussion now the modes of speech of these two persons while they had a great deal in common had also a great deal that was not in common mr wenham was a native of new york and his dialect was a mixture that is getting to be sufficiently general partaking equally of the doric of new england the dutch cross and the old english root whereas mr dodge spoke the pure unalloyed tuscan of his province rigidly adhering to all its sounds and significations dissipation he contended meant drunkenness ugly vicious clever goodnatured and humbly homely ugly in addition to this finesse in significations he had a variety of pronunciations that often put strangers at fault and to which he adhered with a pertinacity that obtained some of its force from the fact that it exceeded his power to get rid of them notwithstanding all these little peculiarities peculiarities as respects every one but those who dwelt in his own province mr dodge had also taken up the notion of his superiority on the subject of language and always treated the matter as one that was placed quite beyond dispute by its publicity and truth  the progress of american literature returned the editor is really astonishing the four quarters of the world i believe it is very generally admitted now that our pulpit and bar are at the very summit of these two professions then we have much the best poets of the age while eleven of our novelists surpass any of all other countries the american philosophical society is i believe generally considered the most acute learned body now extant unless indeed the newyork historical society may compete with it for that honour some persons give the palm to one and some to the other though i myself think it would be difficult to decide between them then to what a pass has the drama risen of late years genius is getting to be quite a drug in america  you have forgotten to speak of the press in particular put in the complacent mr wenham i think we may more safely pride ourselves on the high character of the press than any thing else  why to tell you the truth sir answered steadfast taking the other by the arm and leading him so slowly away that a part of what followed was heard by the two amused listeners modesty is so infallibly the companion of merit that we who are engaged in that high pursuit do not like to say any thing in our own favour you never detect a newspaper in the weakness of extolling itself but between ourselves i may say after a close examination of the condition of the press in other countries i have come to the conclusion that for talents taste candour philosophy genius honesty and truth the press of the united states stands at the very  here mr dodge passed so far from the listeners that the rest of the speech became inaudible though from the wellestablished modesty of the man and the editor there can be little doubt of the manner in which he concluded the sentence  it is said in europe observed johr effingham his fine face expressing the cool sarcasm in which he was so apt to indulge that there are la vieille and la jeune france i think we have now had pretty fair specimens of old and young america the first distrusting every thing native even to a potatoe and the second distrusting nothing and least of all itself  there appears to be a sort of pendulumuneasiness in mankind said mrs bloomfield that keeps opinion always vibrating around the centre of truth for i think it the rarest thing in the world to find man or woman who has not a disposition as soon as an error is abandoned to fly off into its opposite extreme from believing we had nothing worthy of a thought there is a set springing up who appear to have jumped to the conclusion that we have every thing  ay this is one of the reasons that all the rest of the world laugh at us  laugh at us mr effingham even i had supposed the american name had at last got to be in good credit in other parts of the world  then even you my dear mrs bloomfield are notably mistaken europe it is true is beginning to give us credit for not being quite as bad as she once thought us but we are far very far from being yet admitted to the ordinary level of nations as respects goodness  surely they give us credit for energy enterprize activity  qualities that they prettily term rapacity cunning and swindling i am far very far however from giving credit to all that it suits the interests and prejudices of europe especially of our venerable kinswoman old england to circulate and think to the prejudice of this country which in my poor judgment has as much substantial merit to boast of as any nation on earth though in getting rid of a set of ancient vices and follies it has not had the sagacity to discover that it is fast falling into pretty tolerableor if you like it betterintolerable substitutes  what then do you deem our greatest errorour weakest point  provincialisms with their train of narrow prejudices and a disposition to set up mediocrity as perfection under the double influence of an ignorance that unavoidably arises from a want of models and of the irresistible tendency to mediocrity in a nation where the common mind so imperiously rules  but does not the common mind rule every where is not public opinion always stronger than law  in a certain sense both these positions may be true but in a nation like this without a capital one that is all provinces in which intelligence and tastes are scattered this common mind wants the usual direction and derives its impulses from the force of numbers rather than from the force of knowledge hence the fact that the public opinion never or seldom rises to absolute truth i grant you that as a mediocrity it is well much better than common even but it is still a mediocrity  i see the justice of your remark and i suppose we are to ascribe the general use of superlatives which is so very obvious to these causes  unquestionably men have gotten to be afraid to speak the truth when that truth is a little beyond the common comprehension and thus it is that you see the fulsome flattery that all the public servants as they call themselves resort to in order to increase their popularity instead of telling the wholesome facts that are needed  and what is to be the result  heaven knows while america is so much in advance of other nations in a freedom from prejudices of the old school it is fast substituting a set of prejudices of its own that are not without serious dangers we may live through it and the ills of society may correct themselves though there is one fact that men aces more evil than any thing i could have feared  you mean the political struggle between money and numbers that has so seriously manifested itself of late exclaimed the quickminded and intelligent mrs bloomfield  that has its dangers but there is still another evil of greater magnitude i allude to the very general disposition to confine political discussions to political men thus the private citizen who should presume to discuss a political question would be deemed fair game for all who thought differently from himself he would be injured in his pocket reputation domestic happiness if possible for in this respect america is much the most intolerant nation i have ever visited in all other countries in which discussion is permitted at all there is at least the appearance of fair play whatever may be done covertly but here it seems to be sufficient to justify falsehood frauds nay barefaced rascality to establish that the injured party has had the audacity to meddle with public questions not being what the public chooses to call a public man it is scarcely necessary to say that when such an opinion gets to be effective it must entirely defeat the real intentions of a popular government  now you mention it said mrs bloomfield i think i have witnessed instances of what you mean  witnessed dear mrs bloomfield instances are to be seen as often as a man is found freeman enough to have an opinion independent of party it is not for connecting himself with party that a man is denounced in this country but for daring to connect himself with truth party will bear with party but party will not bear with truth it is in politics as in war regiments or individuals may desert and they will be received by their late enemies with open arms the honour of a soldier seldom reaching to the pass of refusing succour of any sort but both sides will turn and fire on the countrymen who wish merely to defend their homes and firesides  you draw disagreeable pictures of human nature mr effingham  merely because they are true mrs bloomfield man is worse than the beasts merely because he has a code of right and wrong which he never respects they talk of the variation of the compass and even pretend to calculate its changes though no one can explain the principle that causes the attraction or its vagaries at all so it is with men they pretend to look always at the right though their eyes are constantly directed obliquely and it is a certain calculation to allow of a pretty wide variationbut here comes miss effingham singularly well attired and more beautiful than i have ever before seen her  the two exchanged quick glances and then as if fearful of betraying to each other their thoughts they moved towards our heroine to do the honours of the reception  chapter xxvi            haply when i shall wed that lord whose hand must take   my plight shall carry half my love with him half my care and   duty    cordelia  as no man could be more gracefully or delicately polite than john effingham when the humour seized him mrs bloomfield was struck with the kind and gentlemanlike manner with which he met his young kinswoman on this trying occasion and the affectionate tones of his voice and the winning expression of his eye as he addressed her eve herself was not unobservant of these peculiarities nor was she slow in comprehending the reason she perceived at once that he was acquainted with the state of things between her and paul as she well knew the womanly fidelity of mrs bloomfield she rightly enough conjectured that the long observation of her cousin coupled with the few words accidentally overheard that evening had even made him better acquainted with the true condition of her feelings than was the case with the friend with whom she had so lately been conversing on the subject  still eve was not embarrassed by the conviction that her secret was betrayed to so many persons her attachment to paul was not the impulse of girlish caprice but the warm affection of a woman that had grown with time was sanctioned by her reason and which if it was tinctured with the more glowing imagination and ample faith of youth was also sustained by her principles and her sense of right she knew that both her father and cousin esteemed the man of her own choice nor did she believe the little cloud that hung over his birth could do more than have a temporary influence on his own sensitive feelings she met john effingham therefore with a frank composure returned the kind pressure of his hand with a smile such as a daughter might bestow on an affectionate parent and turned to salute the remainder of the party with that ladylike ease which had got to be a part of her nature  there goes one of the most attractive pictures that humanity can offer said john effingham to mrs bloomfield as eve walked away a young timid modest sensitive girl so strong in her principles so conscious of rectitude so pure of thought and so warm in her affections that she views her selection of a husband as others view their acts of duty and religious faith with her love has no shame as it has no weakness  eve effingham is as faultless as comports with womanhood and yet i confess ignorance of my own sex if she receive mr powis as calmly as she received her cousin  perhaps not for in that case she could scarcely feel the passion you perceive that he avoids oppressing her with his notice and that the meeting passes off without embarrassment i do believe there is an elevating principle in love that by causing us to wish to be worthy of the object most prized produces the desired effects by stimulating exertion there now are two as perfect beings as one ordinarily meets with each oppressed by a sense of his or her unworthiness to be the choice of the other  does love then teach humility successful love too  does it not it would be hardly fair to press this matter on you a married woman for by the pandects of american society a man may philosophize on love prattle about it trifle on the subject and even analyze the passion with a miss in her teens and yet he shall not allude to it in a discourse with a matron well chacun à son goût we are indeed a little peculiar in our usages and have promoted a good deal of village coquetry and the flirtations of the maypole to the drawingroom  is it not better that such follies should be confined to youth than that they should invade the sanctity of married life as i understand is too much the case elsewhere  perhaps so though i confess it is easier to dispose of a straight forward proposition from a mother a father or a commissioned friend than to get rid of a young lady who propriâ personâ angles on her own account while abroad i had a dozen proposals  proposals exclaimed mrs bloomfield holding up both hands and shaking her head incredulously  proposals why not maamam i more than fifty am i not reasonably youthful for that period of life and have i not six or eight thousand a year  eighteen or you are much scandalized  well eighteen if you will coolly returned the other in whose eyes money was no merit for he was born to a fortune and always treated it as a means and not as the end of life every dollar is a magnet after one has turned forty do you suppose that a single man of tolerable person wellborn and with a hundred thousand francs of rentes could entirely escape proposals from the ladies in europe  this is so revolting to all our american notions that though i have often heard of such things i have always found it difficult to believe them  and is it more revolting for the friends of young ladies to look out for them on such occasions than that the young ladies should take the affair into their own hands as is practised quite as openly here  it is well you are a confirmed bachelor or declarations like these would mar your fortunes i will admit that the school is not as retiring and diffident as formerly for we are all ready enough to say that no times are egual to our own times but i shall strenuously protest against your interpretation of the nature and artlessness of an american girl  artlessness repeated john effingham with a slight lifting of the eyebrows we live in an age when new dictionaries and vocabularies are necessary to understand each others meaning it is artlessness with a vengeance to beset an old fellow of fifty as one would besiege a town histned is retiring with his daughter my dear mrs bloomfield and it will not be long before i shall be summoned to a family council well we will keep the secret until it is publicly proclaimed  john effingham was right for his two cousins left the room together and retired to the library but in a way to attract no particular attention except in those who were enlightened on the subject of what had already passed that evening when they were alone mr effingham turned the key and then he gave a free vent to his paternal feelings  between eve and her parent there had always existed a confidence exceeding that which it is common to find between father and daughter in one sense they had been all in all to each other and eve had never hesitated about pouring those feelings into his breast which had she possessed another parent would more naturally have been confided to the affection of a mother when their eyes first met therefore they were mutually beaming with an expression of confidence and love such as might in a measure have been expected between two of the gentler sex mr effingham folded his child to his heart pressed her there tenderly for near a minute in silence and then kissing her burning cheek he permitted her to look up  this answers all my fondest hopes evehe exclaimed fulfils my most cherished wishes for thy sake  dearest sir  yes my love i have long secretly prayed that such might be your good fortune for of all the youths we have met at home or abroad paul powis is the one to whom i can consign you with the most confidence that he will cherish and love you as you deserve to be cherished and loved  dearest father nothing but this was wanting to complete my perfect happiness  mr effingham kissed his daughter again and he was then enabled to pursue the conversation with greater composure  powis and i have had a full explanation he said though in order to obtain it i have been obliged to give him strong encouragement  father  nay my love your delicacy and feelings nave been sufficiently respected but he has so much diffidence of himself and permits the unpleasant circumstances connected with his birth to weigh so much on his mind that i have been compelled to tell him what i am sure you will approve that we disregard family connections and look only to the merit of the individual  i hope father nothing was said to give mr powis reason to suppose we did not deem him every way our equal  certainly not he is a gentleman and i can claim to be no more there is but one thing in which connections ought to influence an american marriage where the parties are suited to each other in the main requisites and that is to ascertain that neither should be carried necessarily into associations for which their habits have given them too much and too good tastes to enter into a woman especially ought never to be transplanted from a polished to an unpolished circle for when this is the case if really a lady there will be a dangerous clog on her affection for her husband this one great point assured i see no other about which a parent need feel concern  powis unhappily has no connections in this country or none with whom he has any communications and those he has in england are of a class to do him credit  we have been conversing of this and he has manifested so much proper feeling that it has even raised him in my esteem i knew his fathers family and must have known his father i think though there were two or three asshetons of the name of john it is a highly respectable family of the middle states and belonged formerly to the colonial aristocracy jack effinghams mother was an assheton  of the same blood do you think sir i remembered this when mr powis mentioned his fathers name and intended to question cousin jack on the subject  now you speak of it eve there must be a relationship between them do you suppose that our kinsman is acquainted with the fact that paul is in truth an assheton  eve told her father that she had never spoken with their relative on the subject at all  then ring the bell and we will ascertain at once how far my conjecture is true you can have no false delicacy my child about letting your engagement be known to one as near and as dear to us as john  engagement father  yes engagement returned the smiling parent for such i already deem it i have ventured in your behalf to plight your troth to paul powis or what is almost equal to it and in return i can give you back as many protestations of unequalled fidelity and eternal constancy as any reasonable girl can ask  eve gazed at her lather in a way to show that reproach was mingled with fondness for she felt that in this instance too much of the precipitation of the other sex had been manifested in her affairs still superior to coquetry and affectation and much too warm in her attachments to be seriously hurt she kissed the hand she held shook her head reproachfully even while she smiled and did as had been desired  you have indeed rendered it important to us to know more of mr powis my beloved father she said as she returned to her seat though i could wish matters had not proceeded quite so fast  nay all i promised was conditional and dependent on yourself you have nothing to do if i have said too much but to refuse to ratify the treaty made by your negotiator  you propose an impossibility said eve taking the hand again that she had so lately relinquished and pressing it warmly between her own the negotiator is too much revered has too strong a right to command and is too much confided in to be thus dishonoured father i will i do ratify all you have all you can promise in my behalf  even if i annul the treaty darling  even in that case father i will marry none without your consent and have so absolute a confidence in your tender care of me that i do not even hesitate to say i will marry him to whom you contract me  bless you bless you eve i do believe you for such have i ever found you since thought has had any control over your actions desire mr john effingham to come hitherthen as the servant closed the door he continuedand such i believe you will continue to be until your dying day  nay reckless careless father you forget that you yourself have been instrumental in transferring my duty and obedience to another what if this seamonster should prove a tyrant throw off the mask and show himself in his real colours are you prepared then thoughtless precipitate parenteve kissed mr effinghams cheek with childish playfulness as she spoke her heart swelling with happiness the whole time to preach obedience where obedience would then be due  hush preciousi hear the step of jack he must not catch us fooling in this manner  eve rose and when her kinsman entered the room she held out her hand kindly to him though it was with an averted face and a tearful eye  it is time i was summoned said john effingham after he had drawn the blushing girl to him and kissed her forehead for what between tête à têtes with young fellows and tête à têtes with old fellows this evening i began to think myself neglected i hope i am still in time to render my decided disapprobation available  cousin jack exclaimed eve with a look of reproachful mockery you are the last person who ought to speak of disapprobation for you have done little else but sing the praises of the applicant since you first met him  is it even so then like others i must submit to the consequences of my own precipitation and false conclusions am i summoned to inquire how many thousands a year i shall add to the establishment of the new couple as i hate business say five at once and when the papers are ready i will sign them without reading  most generous cynic cried eve i would i dared now to ask a single question  ask it without scruple young lady for this is the day of your independence and power i am mistaken in the man if powis do not prove to be the captain of his own ship in the end  well then in whose behalf is this liberality really meant mine or that of the gentleman  fairly enough put said john effingham laughing again drawing eve towards him and saluting her cheek for if i were on the rack i could scarcely say which i love best although you have the consolation of knowing pert one that you get the most kisses  i am almost in the same state of feeling myself john for a son of my own could scarcely be dearer to me than paul  i see indeed that i must marry said eve hastily dashing the tears of delight from her eyes for what could give more delight than to hear the praises of her beloved if i wish to retain my place in your affections but father we forget the question you were to put to cousin jack  true love john your mother was an assheton  assuredly ned you are not to learn my pedigree at this time of day i trust  we are anxious to make out a relationship between you and paul can it not be done  i would give half my fortune eve consenting were it sowhat reason is there for supposing it probable or even possible  you know that he bears the name of his friend and adopted parent while that of his family is really assheton  assheton exclaimed the other in a way to show that this was the first he had ever heard of the fact  certainly and as there is but one family of this name which is a little peculiar in the spellingfor here it is spelt by paul himself on this cardwe have thought that he must be a relation of yours i hope we are not to be disappointed  asshetonit is as you say an unusual name nor is there more than one family that bears it in this country to my knowledge can it be possible that powis is truly an assheton  out of all doubt eve eagerly exclaimed we have it from his own mouth his father was an assheton and his mother was  who demanded john effingham with a vehemence that startled his companions  nay that is more than i can tell you for he did not mention the family name of his mother as she was a sister of lady dunluce however who is the wife of general ducie the father of our guest it is probable her name was dunluce  i remember no relative that has made such a marriage or who can have made such a marriage and yet do i personally and intimately know every assheton in the country  mr effingham and his daughter looked at each other for it at once struck them all painfully that there must be asshetons of another family  were it not for the peculiar manner in which this name is spelled said mr effingham i could suppose that there are asshetons of whom we know nothing but it is difficult to believe that there can be such persons of a respectable family of whom we never heard for powis said his relatives were of the middle states  and that his mother was called dunluce demanded john effingham earnestly for he too appeared to wish to discover an affinity between himself and paul  nay father this i think he did not say though it is quite probable for the title of his aunt is an ancient barony and those ancient baronies usually became the family name  in this you must be mistaken eve since he mentioned that the right was derived through his mothers mother who was an englishwoman  why not send for him at once and put the question said the simpleminded mr effingham next to having him for my own son it would give me pleasure john to learn that he was lawfully entitled to that which i know you have done in his behalf  that is impossible returned john effingham i am an only child and as for cousins through my mother there are so many who stand in an equal degree of affinity to me that no one in particular can be my heiratlaw if there were i am an effingham my estate came from effinghams and to an effingham it should descend in despite of all the asshetons in america  paul powis included exclaimed eve raising a finger reproachfully  true to him i have left a legacy but it was to a powis and not to an assheton  and yet he declares himself legally an assheton and not a powis  say no more of this eve it is unpleasant to me i hate the name of assheton though it was my mothers and could wish never to hear it again  eve and her father were mute for their kinsman usually so proud and selfrestrained spoke with suppressed emotion and it was plain that for some hidden cause he felt even more than he expressed the idea that there should be any thing about paul that could render him an object of dislike to one as dear to her as her cousin was inexpressibly painful to the former and she regretted that the subject had ever been introduced not so with her father simple direct and full of truth mr effingham rightly enough believed that mysteries in a family could lead to no good and he repeated his proposal of sending for paul and having the matter cleared up at once  you are too reasonable jack he concluded to let an antipathy against a name that was your mothers interfere with your sense of right i know that some unpleasant questions arose concerning your succession to my aunts fortune but that was all settled in your favour twenty years ago and i had thought to your entire satisfaction  unhappily family quarrels are ever the most bitter and usually they are the least reconcileable returned john effingham evasivelyi would that this young mans name were any thing but assheton i do not wish to see eve plighting her faith at the altar to any one bearing that accursed name  i shall plight my faith if ever it be done dear cousin john to the man and not to his name  no nohe must keep the appellation of powis by which we have all learned to love him and to which he has done so much credit  this is very strange jack for a man who is usually as discreet and as well regulated as yourself i again propose that we send for paul and ascertain precisely to what branch of this somuchdisliked family he really belongs  no father if you love me not now cried eve arresting mr effinghams hand as it touched the bellcord it would appear distrustful and even cruel were we to enter into such an inquiry so soon powis might think we valued his family more than we do himself  eve is right ned but i will not sleep without learning all there is an unfinished examination of the papers left by poor monday and i will take an occasion to summon paul to its completion when an opportunity will offer to renew the subject of his own history for it was at the other investigation that he first spoke frankly to me concerning himself  do so cousin jack and let it be at once said eve earnestly i can trust you with powis alone for i know how much you respect and esteem him in your heart see it is already ten  but he will naturally wish to spend the close of an evening like this engaged in investigating something very different from mr mondays tale returned her cousin the smile with which he spoke chasing away the look of chilled aversion that had so lately darkened his noble features  no not tonight answered the blushing eve i have confessed weakness enough for one day tomorrow if you willif he willbut not tonight i shall retire with mrs hawker who already complains of fatigue and you will send for powis to meet you in your own room without unnecessary delay  eve kissed john effingham coaxingly and as they walked together out of the library she pointed towards the door that led to the chambers her cousin laughingly complied and when in his own room he sent a message to paul to join him  now indeed may i call you a kinsman said john effingham rising to receive the young man towards whom he advanced with extended hands in his most winning manner eves frankness and your own discernment have made us a happy family  if any thing could add to the felicity of being acceptable to miss effingham returned paul struggling to command his feelings it is the manner in which her father and yourself have received my poor offers  well we will now speak of it no more i saw from the first which way things were tending and it was my plaindealing that opened the eyes of templemore to the impossibility of his ever succeeding by which means his heart has been kept from breaking  oh mr effingham templemore never lovedeve effingham i thought so once and he thought so too but it could not have been a love like mine  it certainly differed in the essential circumstance of reciprocity which in itself singularly qualifies the passion so far as duration is concerned templemore did not exactly know the reason why he preferred eve but having seen so much of the society in which he lived i was enabled to detect the cause accustomed to an elaborate sophistication the singular union of refinement and nature caught his fancy for the english seldom see the last separated from vulgarity and when it is found softened by a high intelligence and polished manners it has usually great attractions for the biasés  he is fortunate in having so readily found a substitute for eve effingham  this change is not unnatural neither in the first place i with this truthtelling tongue destroyed all hope before he had committed himself by a declaration and then grace van cortlandt possesses the great attraction of nature in a degree quite equal to that of her cousin besides templemore though a gentleman and a brave man and a worthy one is not remarkable for qualities of a very extraordinary kind he will be as happy as is usual for an englishman of his class to be and he has no particular right to expect more i sent for you however less to talk of love than to trace its unhappy consequences in this affair revealed by the papers of poor monday it is time we acquitted ourselves of that trust do me the favour to open the dressingcase that stands on the toilet table you will find in it the key that belongs to the bureau where i have placed the secretary that contains the papers  paul did as desired the dressingcase was complicated and large having several compartments none of which were fastened in the first opened he saw a miniature of a female so beautiful that his eve rested on it as it might be by a fascinationnotwithstanding some difference produced by the fashions of different periods the resemblance to the object of his love was obvious at a glance borne away by the pleasure of the discovery and actually believing that he saw a picture of eve drawn in a dress that did not in a great degree vary from the present attire fashion having undergone no very striking revolution in the last twenty years he exclaimed  this is indeed a treasure mr effingham and most sincerely do i envy you its possession it is like and yet in some particulars it is unlikeit scarcely does miss effingham justice about the nose and forehead  john effingham started when he saw the miniature in pauls hand but recovering himself he smiled at the eager delusion of his young friend and said with perfect composure  it is not eve but her mother the two features you have named in the former came from my family but in all the others the likeness is almost identical  this then is mrs effingham murmured paul gazing on the face of the mother of his love with a respectful melancholy and an interest that was rather heightened than lessened by a knowledge of the truth she died young sir  quite she can scarcely be said to have become an angel too soon for she was always one  this was said with a feeling that did not escape paul though it surprised him there were six or seven miniaturecases in the compartment of the dressingbox and supposing that the one which lay uppermost belonged to the miniature in his hand he raised it and opened the lid with a view to replace the picture of eves mother with a species of pious reverence instead of finding an empty case however another miniature met his eye the exclamation that now escaped the young man was one of delight and surprise  that must be my grandmother with whom you are in such raptures at present said john effingham laughingi was comparing it yesterday with the picture of eve which is in the russialeather case that you will find somewhere there i do not wonder however at your admiration for she was a beauty in her day and no woman is fool enough to be painted after she grows ugly  not sonot somr effingham this is the miniature i lost in the montauk and which i had given up as booty to the arabs it has doubtless found its way into your stateroom and has been put among your effects by your man through mistake it is very precious to me for it is nearly every memorial i possess of my own mother  your mother exclaimed john effingham rising i think there must be some mistake for i examined all those pictures this very morning and it is the first time they have been opened since our arrival from europe it cannot be the missing picture  mine it is certainly in that i cannot be mistaken  it would be odd indeed if one of my grandmothers for both are there should prove to be your motherpowis will you have the goodness to let me see the picture you mean  paul brought the miniature and a light placing both before the eyes of his friend  that exclaimed john effingham his voice sounding harsh and unnatural to the listenerthat picture like your mother  it is her miniaturethe miniature that was transmitted to me from those who had charge of my childhood i cannot be mistaken as to the countenance or the dress  and your fathers name was assheton  certainlyjohn assheton of the asshetons of pennsylvania  john effingham groaned aloud when paul stepped back equally shocked and surprised he saw that the face of his friend was almost livid and that the hand which held the picture shook like the aspen  are you unwell dear mr effingham  nonotis impossible this lady never had a child powis you have been deceived by some fancied or some real resemblance this picture is mine and has not been out of my possession these five and twenty years  pardon me sir it is the picture of my mother and no other the very picture lost in the montauk  the gaze that john effingham cast upon the young man was ghastly and paul was about to ring the bell but a gesture of denial prevented him  see said john effingham hoarsely as he touched a spring in the setting and exposed to view the initials of two names interwoven with hairis this too yours  paul looked surprised and disappointed  that certainly settles the question my miniature had no such addition and yet i believe that sweet and pensive countenance to be the face of my own beloved mother and of no one else  john effingham struggled to appear calm and replacing the pictures he took the key from the dressing case and opening the bureau he took out the secretary this he signed for powis who had the key to open throwing himself into a chair though every thing was done mechanically as if his mind and body had little or no connection with each other  some accidental resemblance has deceived you as to the miniature he said while paul was looking for the proper number among the letters of mr monday nonothat cannot be the picture of your mother she left no child assheton did you say was the name of your father  asshetonjohn asshetonabout that at least there can have been no mistake this is the num her at which we left offwill you sir or shall i read  the other made a sign for paul to read looking at the same time as if it were impossible for him to discharge that duty himself  this is a letter from the woman who appears to have been entrusted with the child to the man dowse said paul first glancing his eyes over the pageit appears to be little else but gossiphawhat is this i see  john effingham raised himself in his chair and he sat gazing at paul as one gazes who expects some extraordinary developement though of what nature he knew not  this is a singular passage paul continuedso much so as to need elucidation i have taken the child with me to get the picture from the jeweller who has mended the ring and the little urchin knew it at a glance  what is there remarkable in that others beside ourselves have had picturesand this child knows its own better than you  mr effingham such a thing occurred to myself it is one of those early events of which i still retain have ever retained a vivid recollection though little more than an infant at the time well do i recollect to have been taken in this manner to a jewellers and the delight i felt at recovering my mothers picture that which is now lost after it had not been seen for a month or two  paul bluntpowisassheton said john effingham speaking so hoarsely as to be nearly unintelligible remain here a few minutes i will rejoin you  john effingham arose and notwithstanding he rallied all his powers it was with extreme difficulty he succeeded in reaching the door steadily rejecting the offered assistance of paul who was at a loss what to think of so much agitation in a man usually so selfpossessed and tranquil when out of the room john effingham did better and he proceeded to the library followed by his own man whom he had ordered to accompany him with a light  desire captain ducie to give me the favour of his company for a moment he then said motioning to the servant to withdraw you will not be needed any longer  it was but a minute before captain ducie stood before him this gentleman was instantly struck with the pallid look and general agitation of the person he had come to meet and he expressed an apprehension that he was suddenly taken ill but a motion of the hand forbade his touching the bellcord and he waited in silent wonder at the scene which he had been so unexpectedly called to witness  a glass of that water if you please captain ducie said john effingham endeavouring to smile with gentlemanlike courtesy as he made the request though the effort caused his countenance to appear ghastly again a little recovered by this beverage he said more steadily  you are the cousin of powis captain ducie  we are sisters children sir  and your mother is  lady dunlucea peeress in her own right  but whather family name  her own family name has been sunk in that of my father the ducies claiming to be as old and as honourable a family as that from which my mother inherits her rank indeed the dunluce barony has gone through so many names by means of females that i believe there is no intention to revive the original appellation of the family which was first summoned  you mistake meyour motherwhen she marriedwas  miss warrender  i thank you sir and will trouble you no longer returned john effingham rising and struggling to make his manner second the courtesy of his wordsi have troubled you abruptlyincoherently i fearyour arm  captain ducie stepped hastily forward and was just in time to prevent the other from falling senseless on the floor by receiving him in his own arms  chapter xxvii    whats hecuba to him or he to hecuba that he should weep for   her    hamlet  the next morning paul and eve were alone in that library which had long been the scene of the confidential communications of the effingham family eve had been weeping nor were pauls eyes entirely free from the signs of his having given way to strong sensations still happiness beamed in the countenance of each and the timid but affectionate glances with which our heroine returned the fond admiring look of her lover were any thing but distrustful of their future felicity her hand was in his and it was often raised to his lips as they pursued the conversation  this is so wonderful exclaimed eve after one of the frequent musing pauses in which both indulged that i can scarcely believe myself awake that you blunt powis assheton should after all prove an effingham  and i who have so long thought myself an orphan should find a living father and he a man like mr john effingham  i have long thought that something heavy lay at the honest heart of cousin jackyou will excuse me powis but i shall need time to learn to call him by a name of greater respect  call him always so love for i am certain it would pain him to meet with any change in you he is your cousin jack  nay he may some day unexpectedly become my father too as he has so wonderfully become yours rejoined eve glancing archly at the glowing face of the delighted young man and then cousin jack might prove too familiar and disrespectful a term  so much stronger does your claim to him appear than mine that i think when that blessed day shall arrive eve it will convert him into my cousin jack instead of your father but call him as you may why do you still insist on calling me powis  that name will ever be precious in my eyes you abridge me of my rights in denying me a change of name half the young ladies of the country marry for the novelty of being called mrs somebody else instead of the misses they were while i am condemned to remain eve effingham for life  if you object to the appellation i can continue to call myself powis this has been done so long now as almost to legalize the act  indeed noyou are an effingham and as an effingham ought you to be known what a happy lot is mine spared even the pain of parting with my old friends at the great occurrence of my life and finding my married home the same as the home of my childhood  i owe every thing to you eve name happiness and even a home  i know not that now that it is known that you are the great grandson of edward effingham i think your chance of possessing the wigwam would be quite equal to my own even were we to look different ways in quest of married happiness an arrangement of that nature would not be difficult to make as john effingham might easily compensate a daughter for the loss of her house and lands by means of those moneyyielding stocks and bonds of which he possesses so many  i view it differently you were mrmy fathers heirhow strangely the word father sounds in unaccustomed earsbut you were my fathers chosen heir and i shall owe to you dearest in addition to the treasures of your heart and faith my fortune  are you so very certain of this ingratedid not mr john effinghamcousin jackadopt you as his son even before he knew of the natural tie that actually exists between you  true for i perceive that you have been made acquainted with most of that which has passed but i hope that in telling you his own offer mrthat my father did not forget to tell you of the terms on which it was accepted  he did you ample justice or he informed me that you stipulated there should be no altering of wills but that the unworthy heir already chosen should still remain the heir  and to this mr  cousin jack said eve laughing for the laugh comes easy to the supremely happy  to this cousin jack assented  most true again the will would not have been altered for your interests were already cared for  and at the expense of yours dearest eve  it would have been at the expense of my better feelings paul had it not been so however that will can never do either harm or good to any now  i trust it will remain unchanged beloved that i may owe as much to you as possible  eve looked kindly at her betrothed blushed even deeper than the bloom which happiness had left on her cheek and smiled like one who knew more than she cared to express  what secret meaning is concealed behind the look of portentous signification  it means powis that i have done a deed that is almost criminal i have destroyed a will  not my fathers  even sobut it was done in his presence and if not absolutely with his consent with his knowledge when he informed me of your superior rights i insisted on its being done at once so should any accident occur you will be heir at law as a matter of course cousin jack affected reluctance but i believe he slept more sweetly for the consciousness that this act of justice had been done  i fear he slept little as it was it was long past midnight before i left him and the agitation of his spirits was such as to appear awful in the eyes of a son  and the promised explanation is to come to renew his distress why make it at all is it not enough that we are certain that you are his child and for that have we not the solemn assurance the declaration of almost a dying man  there should be no shade left over my mothers fame faults there have been somewhere but it is painful oh how painful for a child to think evil of a mother  on this head you are already assured your own previous knowledge and john effinghams distinct declarations make your mother blameless  beyond question but this sacrifice must be made to my mothers spirit it is now nine the breakfastbell will soon ring and then we are promised the whole of the melancholy tale pray with me eve that it may be such as will not wound the ear of a son  eve took the hand of paul within both of hers and kissed it with a sort of holy hope that in its exhibition caused neither blush nor shame indeed so bound together were these young hearts so ample and confiding had been the confessions of both and so pure was their love that neither regarded such a manifestation of feeling differently from what an acknowledgement of a dependence on any other sacred principle would have been esteemed the bell now summoned them to the breakfasttable and eve yielding to her sexs timidity desired paul to precede her a few minutes that the sanctity of their confidence might not be weakened by the observation of profane eyes  the meal was silent the discovery of the previous night which had been made known to all in the house by the declarations of john effingham as soon as he was restored to his senses captain ducie having innocently collected those within hearing to his succour causing a sort of moral suspense that weighed on the vivacity if not on the comforts of the whole party the lovers alone excepted  as profound happiness is seldom talkative the meal was a silent one then and when it was ended they who had no tie of blood with the parties most concerned with the revelations of the approaching interview delicately separated making employments and engagements that left the family at perfect liberty while those who had been previously notified that their presence would be acceptable silently repaired to the dressingroom of john effingham the latter party was composed of mr effingham paul and eve only the first passed into his cousins bedroom where he had a private conference that lasted half an hour at the end of that time the two others were summoned to join him  john effingham was a strongminded and a proud man his governing fault being the selfreliance that indisposed him to throw himself on a greater power for the support guidance and counsel that all need to humiliation before god however he was not unused and of late years it had got to be frequent with him and it was only in connexion with his fellowcreatures that his repugnance to admitting even of an equality existed he felt how much more just intuitive conscientious even were his own views than those of mankind in general and he seldom deigned to consult with any as to the opinions he ought to entertain or as to the conduct he ought to pursue it is scarcely necessary to say that such a being was one of strong and engrossing passions the impulses frequently proving too imperious for the affections or even for principles the scene that he was now compelled to go through was consequently one of sore mortification and selfabasement and yet feeling its justice no less than its necessity and having made up his mind to discharge what had now become a duty his very pride of character led him to do it manfully and with no uncalledfor reserves it was a painful and humiliating task notwithstanding and it required all the selfcommand all the sense of right and all the clear perception of consequences that one so quick to discriminate could not avoid perceiving to enable him to go through it with the required steadiness and connexion  john effingham received paul and eve seated in an easy chair for while he could not be said to be ill it was evident that his very frame had been shaken by the events and emotions of the few preceding hours he gave a hand to each and drawing eve affectionately to him he imprinted a kiss on a cheek that was burning though it paled and reddened in quick succession the heralds of the tumultuous thoughts within the look he gave paul was kind and welcome while a hectic spot glowed on each cheek betraying that his presence excited pain as well as pleasure a long pause succeeded this meeting when john effingham broke the silence  there can now be no manner of question my dear paul he said smiling affectionately but sadly as he looked at the young man about your being my son the letter written by john assheton to your mother after the separation of your parents would settle that important point had not the names and the other facts that have come to our knowledge already convinced me of the precious truth for precious and very dear to me is the knowledge that i am the father of so worthy a child you must prepare yourself to hear things that it will not be pleasant for a son to listen  no nocousin jackdear cousin jack cried eve throwing herself precipitately into her kinsmans arms we will hear nothing of the sort it is sufficient that you are pauls father and we wish to know no morewill hear no more  this is like yourself eve but it will not answer what i conceive to be the dictates of duty paul had two parents and not the slightest suspicion ought to rest on one of them in order to spare the feelings of the other in showing me this kindness you are treating paul inconsiderately  i beg dear sir you will not think too much of me but entirely consult your own judgmentyour own sense ofin short dear father that you will consider yourself before your son  i thank you my childrenwhat a word and what a novel sensation is this for me nedi feel all your kindness but if you would consult my peace of mind and wish me to regain my selfrespect you will allow me to disburthen my soul of the weight that oppresses it this is strong language but while i have no confessions of deliberate criminality or of positive vice to make i feel it to be hardly too strong for the facts my tale will be very short and i crave your patience ned while i expose my former weakness to these young people here john effingham paused as if to recollect himself then he proceeded with a seriousness of manner that caused every syllable he uttered to tell on the ears of his listeners it is well known to your father eve though it will probably be new to you he said that i felt a passion for your sainted mother such as few men ever experience for any of your sex your father and myself were suitors for her favour at the same time though i can scarcely say edward that any feeling of rivalry entered into the competition  you do me no more than justice john for if the affection of my beloved eve could cause me grief it was because it brought you pain  i had the additional mortification of approving of the choice she made for certainly as respected her own happiness your mother did more wisely in confiding it to the regulated mild and manly virtues of your father than in placing her hopes on one as eccentric and violent as myself  this is injustice john you may have been positive and a little stern at times but never violent and least of all with a woman  call it what you will it unfitted me to make one so meek gentle and yet highsouled as entirely happy as she deserved to be and as you did make her while she remained on earth i had the courage to stay and learn that your father was accepted though the marriage was deferred two years in consideration for my feelings and then with a heart in which mortified pride wounded love a resentment that was aimed rather against myself than against your parents i quitted home with a desperate determination never to rejoin my family again this resolution i did not own to myself even but it lurked in my intentions unowned festering like a mortal disease and it caused me when i burst away from the scene of happiness of which i had been a compelled witness to change my name and to make several inconsistent and extravagant arrangements to abandon my native country even  poor john exclaimed his cousin involuntarily this would have been a sad blot on our felicity had we known it  i was certain of that even when most writhing under the blow you had so unintentionally inflicted ned but the passions are tyrannical and inconsistent masters i took my mothers name changed my servant and avoided those parts of the country where i was known at this time i feared for my own reason and the thought crossed my mind that by making a sudden marriage i might supplant the old passion which was so near destroying me by some of that gentler affection which seemed to render you so blest edward  nay john this was itself a temporary tottering of the reasoning faculties  it was simply the effect of passions over which reason had never been taught to exercise a sufficient influence chance brought me acquainted with miss warrender in one of the southern states and she promised as i fancied to realize all my wild schemes of happiness and resentment  resentment john  i fear i must confess it edward though it were anger against myself i first made miss warrenders acquaintance as john assheton and some months had passed before i determined to try the fearful experiment i have mentioned she was young beautiful wellborn virtuous and good if she had a fault it was her high spiritnot high temper but she was highsouled and proud  thank god for this burst from the inmost soul of paul with unrestrainable feeling  you have little to apprehend my son on the subject of your mothers character if not perfect she was wanting in no womanly virtue and might nay ought to have made any reasonable man happy my offer was accepted for i found her heart disengaged miss warrender was not affluent and in addition to the other unjustifiable motives that influenced me i thought there would be a satisfaction in believing that i had been chosen for myself rather than for my wealth indeed i had got to be distrustful and ungenerous and then i disliked the confession of the weakness that had induced me to change my name the simple i might almost say loose laws of this country on the subject of marriage removed all necessity for explanations there being no bans nor license necessary and the christian name only being used in the ceremony we were married therefore but i was not so unmindful of the rights of others as to neglect to procure a certificate under a promise of secrecy in my own name by going to the place where the ceremony was performed you will also find the marriage of john effingham and mildred warrender duly registered in the books of the church to which the officiating clergyman belonged so far i did what justice required though with a motiveless infatuation for which i can now hardly account which cannot be accounted for except by ascribing it to the inconsistent cruelty of passion i concealed my real name from her with whom there should have been no concealment i fancied i tried to fancy i was no impostor as i was of the family i represented myself to be by the mothers side and i wished to believe that my peace would easily be made when i avowed myself to be the man i really was i had found miss warrender and her sister living with a wellintentioned but weak aunt and with no male relative to make those inquiries which would so naturally have suggested themselves to persons of ordinary worldly prudence it is true i had become known to them under favourable circumstances and they had good reason to believe me an assheton from some accidental evidence that i possessed which unanswerably proved my affinity to that family without betraying my true name but there is so little distrust in this country that by keeping at a distance from the places in which i was personally known a life might have passed without exposure  this was all wrong dear cousin jack said eve taking his hand and affectionately kissing it while her face kindled with a sense of her sexs rights and i should be unfaithful to my womanhood were i to say otherwise you had entered into the most solemn of all human contracts and evil is the omen when such an engagement is veiled by any untruth but still one would think you might have been happy with a virtuous and affectionate wife  alas it is but a hopeless experiment to marry one while the heart is still yearning towards another confidence came too late for discovering my unhappiness mildred extorted a tardy confession from me a confession of all but the concealment of the true name and justly wounded at the deception of which she had been the dupe and yielding to the impulses of a high and generous spirit she announced to me that she was unwilling to continue the wife of any man on such terms we parted and i hastened into the southwestern states where i passed the next twelvemonth in travelling hurrying from place to place in the vain hope of obtaining peace of mind i plunged into the prairies and most of the time mentioned was lost to me as respects the world in the company of hunters and trappers  this then explains your knowledge of that section of the country exclaimed mr effingham for which i have never been able to account we thought you among your old friends in carolina all that time  no one knew where i had secreted myself for i passed under another feigned name and had no servant even i had however sent an address to mildred where a letter would find me for i had begun to feel a sincere affection for her though it might not have amounted to passion and looked forward to being reunited when her wounded feelings had time to regain their tranquillity the obligations of wedlock are too serious to be lightly thrown aside and i felt persuaded that neither of us would be satisfied in the end without discharging the duties of the state into which we had entered  and why did you not hasten to your poor wife cousin jack eve innocently demanded as soon as you returned to the settlements  alas mydear girl i found letters at st louis announcing her death nothing was said of any child nor did i in the least suspect that i was about to become a father when mildred died i thought all the ties all the obligations all the traces of my illjudged marriage were extinct and the course taken by her relations of whom in this country there remained very few left me no inclination to proclaim it by observing silence i continued to pass as a bachelor of course though had there been any apparent reason for avowing what had occurred i think no one who knows me can suppose i would have shrunk from doing so  may i inquire my dear sir paul asked with a timidity of manner that betrayed how tenderly he felt it necessary to touch on the subject at allmay i inquire my dear sir what course was taken by my mothers relatives  i never knew mr warrender my wifes brother but he had the reputation of being a haughty and exacting man his letters were not friendly scarcely tolerable for he affected to believe i had given a false address at the west when i was residing in the middle states and he threw out hints that to me were then inexplicable but which the letters left with me by paul have sufficiently explained i thought him cruel and unfeeling at the time but he had an excuse for his conduct  which was sir paul eagerly inquired  i perceive by the letters you have given me my son that your mothers family had imbibed the opinion that i was john assheton of lancaster a man of singular humours who had made an unfortunate marriage in spain and whose wife i believe is still living in paris though lost to herself and her friends my kinsman lived retired and never recovered the blow as he was one of the only persons of the name who could have married your mother her relatives appear to have taken up the idea that he had been guilty of bigamy and of course that paul was illegitimate mr warrender by his letters appears even to have had an interview with this person and on mentioning his wife was rudely repulsed from the house it was a proud family and mildred being dead the concealment of the birth of her child was resorted to as a means of averting a fancied disgrace as for myself i call the allseeing eye of god to witness that the thought of my being a parent never crossed my mind until i learned that a john assheton was the father of paul and that the miniature of mildred warrender that i received at the period of our engagement was the likeness of his mother the simple declaration of captain ducie concerning the family name of his mother removed all doubt  but cousin jack did not the mention of lady dunluce of the ducies and of pauls connections excite curiosity  concerning what dear i could have no curiosity about a child of whose existence i was ignorant i did know that the warrenders had pretensions to both rank and fortune in england but never heard the title and cared nothing about money that would not probably be mildreds of general ducie i never even heard as he married after my separation and subsequently to the receipt of my brotherinlaws letters i wished to forget the existence of the family i went to europe and remained abroad seven years and as this was at a time when the continent was closed against the english i was not in a way to hear any thing on the subject on my return my wifes aunt was dead the last of my wifes brothers was dead her sister must then have been mrs ducie no one mentioned the warrenders all traces of whom were nearly lost in this country and to me the subject was too painful to be either sought or dwelt on it is a curious fact that in 1829 during our late visit to the old world i ascended the nile with general ducie for a travelling companion we met at alexandria and wont to the cataracts and returned in company he knew me as john effingham an american traveller of fortune if of no particular merit and i knew him as an agreeable english general officer he had the reserve of an englishman of rank and seldom spoke of his family and it was only on our return that i found he had letters from his wife lady dunluce but little did i dream that lady dunluce was mabel warrender how often are we on the very verge of important information and yet live on in ignorance and obscurity the ducies appear finally to have arrived at the opinion that the marriage was legal and that no reproach rests on the birth of paul by the inquiries made concerning the eccentric john assheton  they fancied in common with my uncle warrender for a long time that the john assheton whom you have mentioned sir said paul was my father but some accidental information at a late day convinced them of their error and then they naturally enough supposed that it was the only other john assheton that could be heard of who passes and probably with sufficient reason for a bachelor this latter gentleman i have myself always supposed to be my father though he has treated two or three letters i have written to him with the indifference with which one would be apt to treat the pretensions of an impostor pride has prevented me from attempting to renew the correspondence lately  it is john assheton of bristol my mothers brothers son as inveterate a bachelor as is to be found in the union said john effingham smiling in spite of the grave subject and deep emotions that had so lately been uppermost in his thoughts he must have supposed your letters were an attempt at mystification on the part of some of his jocular associates and i am surprised that he thought it necessary to answer them at all  he did answer but one and that reply certainly had something of the character you suggest sir i freely forgive him now i understand the truth though his apparent contempt gave me many a bitter pang at the time i saw mr assheton once in public and observed him well for strange as it is i have been thought to resemble him  why strange jack assheton and myself have or rather had a strong family likeness to each other and though the thought is new to me i can now easily trace this resemblance to myself it is rather an assheton than an effingham look though the latter is not wanting  these explanations are very clear and satisfactory observed mr effingham and leave little doubt that paul is the child of john effingham and mildred warrender but they would be beyond all cavil were the infancy of the boy placed in an equally plain point of view and could the reasons be known why the warrenders abandoned him to the care of those who yielded him up to mr powis  i see but little obscurity in that returned john effingham paul is unquestionably the child referred to in the papers left by poor monday to the care of whose mother he was intrusted until in his fourth year she yielded him to mr powis to get rid of trouble and expense while she kept the annuity granted by lady dunluce the names appear in the concluding letters and had we read the latter through at first we should earlier have arrived at the same conclusion could we find the man called dowse who appears to have instigated the fraud and who married mrs monday the whole thing would be explained  of this i am aware said paul for he and john effingham had perused the remainder of the monday papers together after the fainting fit of the latter as soon as his strength would admit and captain truck is now searching for an old passenger of his who i think will furnish the clue should we get this evidence it would settle all legal questions  such questions will never be raised said john effingham holding out his hand affectionately to his son you possess the marriage certificate given to your mother and i avow myself to have been the person therein styled john assheton this fact i have endorsed on the back of the certificate while here is another given to me in my proper name with the endorsement made by the clergyman that i passed by another name at the ceremony  such a man cousin jack was unworthy of his cloth said eve with energy  i do not think so my child he was innocent of the original deception this certificate was given after the death of my wife and might do good whereas it could do no harm the clergyman in question is now a bishop and is still living he may give evidence if necessary to the legality of the marriage  and the clergyman by whom i was baptized is also alive cried paul and has never lost sight of me he was in part in the confidence of my mother family and even after i was adopted by mr powis he kept me in view as one of his little christians as he termed me it was no less a person than dr  this alone would make out the connection and identity said mr effingham without the aid of the monday witnesses the whole obscurity has arisen from johns change of name and his ignorance of the fact that his wife had a child the ducies appear to have had plausible reasons too for distrusting the legality of the marriage but all is now clear and as a large estate is concerned we will take care that no further obscurity shall rest over the affair  the part connected with the estate is already secured said john effingham looking at eve with a smile an american can always make a will and one that contains but a single bequest is soon written mine is executed and paul effingham my son by my marriage with mildred warrender and lately known in the united states navy as paul powis is duly declared my heir this will suffice for all legal purposes though we shall have large draughts of gossip to swallow  cousin jack  daughter eve  who has given cause for it  he who commenced one of the most sacred of his earthly duties with an unjustifiable deception the wisest way to meet it will be to make our avowals of the relationship as open as possible  i see no necessity john of entering into details said mr effingham you were married young and lost your wife within a year of your marriage she was a miss warrender and the sister of lady dunluce paul and ducie are declared cousins and the former proves to be your son of whose existence you were ignorant no one will presume to question any of us and it really strikes me that all rational people ought to be satisfied with this simple account of the matter  father exclaimed eve with her pretty little hands raised in the attitude of surprise in what capital even in what part of the world would such a naked account appease curiosity much less will it suffice here where every human being gentle or simple learned or ignorant refined or vulgar fancies himself a constitutional judge of all the acts of all his fellowcreatures  we have at least the consolation of knowing that no revelations will make the matter any worse or any better said paul as the gossips would tell their own tale in every case though its falsehood were as apparent as the noonday sun a gossip is essentially a liar and truth is the last ingredient that is deemed necessary to his other qualifications indeed a well authenticated fact is a deathblow to a gossip i hope my dear sir you will say no more than that i am your son a circumstance much too precious to me to be omitted  john effingham looked affectionately at the noble young man whom he had so long esteemed and admired and the tears forced themselves to his eyes as he felt the supreme happiness that can alone gladden a parents heart  chapter xxviii    for my part i care not i say little but when the time comes   there shall be smilesnym  although paul effingham was right and eve effingham was also right in their opinions of the art of gossiping they both forgot one qualifying circumstance that arising from different causes produces the same effect equally in a capital and in a province in the first marvels form a nine days wonder from the hurry of events in the latter from the hurry of talking when it was announced in templeton that mr john effingham had discovered a son in mr powis as that son had conjectured every thing but the truth was rumoured and believed in connection with the circumstance of course it excited a good deal of a natural and justifiable curiosity and surprise in the trained and intelligent for john effingham had passed for a confirmed bachelor but they were generally content to suffer a family to have feelings and incidents that were not to be paraded before a neighbourhood having some notions themselves of the delicacy and sanctity of the domestic affections they were willing to respect the same sentiments in others but these few excepted the village was in a tumult of surmises reports contradictions confirmations rebutters and surrebutters for a fortnight several village élégants whose notions of life were obtained in the valley in which they were born and who had turned up their noses at the quiet reserved gentlemanlike paul because he did not happen to suit their tastes were disposed to resent his claim to be his fathers son as if it were an injustice done to their rights such commentators on men and things uniformly bringing every thing down to the standard of serf then the approaching marriages at the wigwam had to run the gauntlet not only of village and county criticisms but that of the mighty emporium itself as it is the fashion to call the confused and tasteless collection of flaring red brick houses martenbox churches and colossal taverns that stands on the island of manhattan the discussion of marriages being a topic of never ending interest in that well regulated social organization after the subjects of dollars lots and wines have been duly exhausted sir george templemore was transformed into the honourable lord george templemore and pauls relationship to lady dunluce was converted as usual into his being the heir apparent of a duchy of that name eves preference for a nobleman as a matter of course to the aristocratical tastes imbibed during a residence in foreign countries eve the intellectual feminine instructed eve whose european associations while they had taught her to prize the refinement grace retenue and tone of an advanced condition of society had also taught her to despise its mere covering and glitter but as there is no protection against falsehood so is there no reasoning with ignorance  a sacred few at the head of whom were mr steadfast dodge and mrs widowbewitched abbott treated the matter as one of greater gravity and as possessing an engrossing interest for the entire community  for my part mr dodge said mrs abbott in one of their frequent conferences about a fortnight after the éclaircissement of the last chapter i do not believe that paul powis is paul effingham at all you say that you knew him by the name of blunt when he was a younger man  certainly maam he passed universally by that name formerly and it may be considered as at least extraordinary that he should have had so many aliases the truth of the matter is mrs abbott if truth could be come at which i always contend is very difficult in the present state of the world  you never said a juster thing mr dodge interrupted the lady feelings impetuous as hers seldom waiting for the completion of a sentence i never can get hold of the truth of any thing now you may remember you insinuated that mr john effingham himself was to be married to eve and lo and behold it turns out to be his son  the lady may have changed her mind mrs abbott she gets the same estate with a younger man  shes monstrous disagreeable and im sure it will be a relief to the whole village when she is married let it be to the father or to the son now do you know mr dodge i have been in a desperate taking about one thing and that is to find that bony fiedy the two old effinghams are not actually brothers i knew that they called each other cousin jack and cousin ned and that eve affected to call her uncle cousin jack but then she has so many affectations and the people are so foreign that i looked upon all that as mere pretence i said to myself a neighbourhood ought to know better about a mans family than he can know himself and the neighbourhood all declared they were brothers and yet it turns out after all that they are only cousins  yes i do believe that for once the family was right in that matter and the public mistaken  well i should like to know who has a better right to be mistaken than the public mr dodge this is a free country and if the people cant sometimes be wrong what is the mighty use of their freedom we are all sinful wretches at the best and it is vain to look for any thing but vice from sinners  nay my dear mrs abbott you are too hard on yourself for every body allows that you are as exemplary as you are devoted to your religious duties  oh i was not speaking particularly of myself sir i am no egotist in such things and wish to leave my own imperfections to the charity of my friends and neighbours but do you think mr dodge that a marriage between paul effingham for so i suppose he must becalled and eve effingham will be legal cant it be set aside and if that should be the case wouldnt the fortune go to the public  it ought to be so my dear maam and i trust the day is not distant when it will be so the people are beginning to understand their rights and another century will not pass before they will enforce them by the necessary penal statutes we have got matters so now that a man can no longer indulge in the aristocratic and selfish desire to make a will and take my word for it we shall not stop until we bring every thing to the proper standard  the reader is not to suppose from his language that mr dodge was an agrarian or that he looked forward to a division of property at some future day for possessing in his own person already more than what could possibly fall to an individual share he had not the smallest desire to lessen its amount by a general division in point of fact he did not know his own meaning except as he felt envy of all above him in which in truth was to be found the whole secret of his principles his impulses and his doctrines any thing that would pull down those whom education habits fortune or tastes had placed in positions more conspicuous than his own was in his eyes reasonable and justas any thing that would serve him in person the same ill turn would have been tyranny and oppression the institutions of america like every thing human have their bad as well as their good side and while we firmly believe in the relative superiority of the latter as compared with other systems we should fail of accomplishing the end set before us in this work did we not exhibit in strong colours one of the most prominent consequences that has attended the entire destruction of factitious personal distinctions in the country which has certainly aided in bringing out in bolder relief than common the prevalent disposition in man to covet that which is the possession of another and to decry merits that are unattainable  well i rejoice to hear this returned mrs abbott whose principles were of the same loose school as those of her companion for i think no one should have rights but those who have experienced religion if you would keep vital religion in a country there goes that old sealion truck and his fishing associate the commodore with their lines and poles as usual mr dodge i beg you will call to them for i long to hear what the first can have to say about his beloved effinghams now  mr dodge complied and the navigator of the ocean and the navigator of the lake were soon seated in mrs abbotts little parlour which might be styled the focus of gossip near those who were so lately its sole occupants  this is wonderful news gentlemen commenced mrs abbott as soon as the bustle of the entrance had subsided mr powis is mr effingham and it seems that miss effingham is to become mrs effingham miracles will never cease and i look upon this as one of the most surprising of my time  just so maam said the commodore winking his eye and giving the usual flourish with a hand your time has not been that of a day neither and mr powis has reason to rejoice that he is the hero of such a history for my part i could not have been more astonished were i to bring up the sogdollager with a trouthook having a cheese paring for the bait  i understand continued the lady that there are doubts after all whether this miracle be really a true miracle it is hinted that mr powis is neither mr effingham nor mr powis but that he is actually a mr blunt do you happen to know any thing of the matter captain truck  i have been introduced to him maam by all three names and i consider him as an acquaintance in each character i can assure you moreover that he is a no 1 on whichever tack you take him a man who carries a weather helm in the midst of his enemies  well i do not consider it a very great recommendation for one to have enemies at all now i dare say mr dodge you have not an enemy on earth  i should be sorry to think that i had mrs abbott i am every mans friend particularly the poor mans friend and i should suppose that every man ought to be my friend i hold the whole human family to be brethren and that they ought to live together as such  very true sir quite truewe are all sinners and ought to look favourably on each others failings it is no business of mine i say it is no business of ours mr dodge who miss eve effingham marries but were she my daughter i do think i should not like her to have three family names and to keep her own in the bargain  the effinghams hold their heads very much up though it is not easy to see why but so they do and the more names the better perhaps for such people returned the editor for my part i treat them with condescension just as i do every body else for it is a rule with me captain truck to make use of the same deportment to a king on his throne as i would to a beggar in the street  merely to show that you do not feel yourself to be above your betters we have many such philosophers in this country  just so said the commodore  i wish i knew resumed mrs abbott for there existed in her head as well as in that of mr dodge such a total confusion on the subject of deportment that neither saw nor felt the cool sarcasm of the old sailor i wish i knew now whether eve effingham has really been regenerated what is your opinion commodore  rewhat maam said the commodore who was not conscious of ever having heard the word before for in his sabbaths on the water where he often worshipped god devoutly in his heart the language of the professedly pious was never heard i can only say she is as pretty a skiff as floats but i can tell you nothing about resuscitationindeed i never heard of her having been drowned  ah mrs abbott the very best friends of the effinghams will not maintain that they are pious i do not wish to be invidious or to say unneighbourly things but were i upon oath i could testify to a great many things which would unqualifiedly show that none of them have ever experienced  now mr dodge you know how much i dislike scandal the widow bewitched cried affectedly and i cannot tolerate such a sweeping charge i insist on the proofs of what you say in which no doubt these gentlemen will join me  by proofs mrs abbott meant allegations  well maam since you insist on my proving what i have said you shall not be disappointed in the first place then they read their family prayers out of a book  ay ay put in the captain but that merely shows they have some education it is done every where  your pardon sir no people but the catholics and the church people commit this impiety the idea of reading to the deity mrs abbott is particularly shocking to a pious soul  as if the lord stood in need of letters that is very bad i allow for at family prayers a form becomes mockery  yes maam but what do you think of cards  cards exclaimed mrs abbott holding up her pious hands in holy horror  even so foul pasteboard marked with kings and queens said the captain why this is worse than a common sin being unqualifiedly antirepublican  i confess i did not expectthis i had heard that eve effingham was guilty of indiscretions but i did not think she was so lost to virtue as to touch a card oh eve effingham eve effingham for what is your poor diseased soul destined  she dances too i suppose you know that continued mr dodge who finding his popularity a little on the wane had joined the meeting himself a few weeks before and who did not fail to manifest the zeal of a new convert  dances repeated mrs abbott in holy horror  real fi diddle de di echoed captain truck  just so put in the commodore i have seen it with my own eyes but mrs abbott i feel bound to tell you that your own daughter  biansyalzumyanne exclaimed the mother in alarm  just so myauntyallsuitmeanne if that is her name do you know maam that i have seen your own blessed daughter myaunty anne do a worse thing even than dancing  commodore you are awful what could a child of mine do that is worse than dancing  why maam if you will hear all it is my duty to tell you i saw auntyanne the commodore was really ignorant of the girls name jump a skippingrope yesterday morning between the hours of seven and eight as i hope ever to see the sogdollager again maam i did  and do you this as bad as dancing  much worse maam to my notion it is jumping about without music and without any grace either particularly as it was performed by myauntyanne  you are given to light jokes jumping the skippingrope is not forbidden in the bible  just so nor is dancing if i know any thing about it nor for that matter cards  but waste of time is a sinful waste of time and evilpassions and all unrighteousness  just so myauntyanne was going to the pump for wateri dare say you sent herand she was misspending her time and as for evil passions she did not enjoy the hop until she and your neighbours daughter had pulled each others hair for the rope as if they had been two shedragons take my word for it maam it wanted for nothing to make it sin of the purest water but a cracked fiddle  while the commodore was holding mrs abbott at bay in this manner captain truck who had given him a wink to that effect was employed in playing off a practical joke at the expense of the widow it was one of the standing amusements of these worthies who had gotten to be sworn friends and constant associates after they had caught as many fish as they wished to retire to the favourite spring light the one his cigar the other his pipe mix their grog and then relieve their ennui when tired of discussing men and things by playing cards on a particular stump now it happens that the captain had the identical pack which had been used on all such occasions in his pocket as was evident in the fact that the cards were nearly as distinctly marked on their backs as on their faces these cards he showed secretly to his companion and when the attention of mrs abbott was altogether engaged in expecting the terrible announcement of her daughters errors the captain slipped them kings queens and knaves high low jack and the game without regard to rank into the ladys workbasket as soon as this feat was successfully performed a sign was given to the commodore that the conspiracy was effected and that disputant in theology gradually began to give ground while he continued to maintain that jumping the rope was a sin though it might be one of a nominal class there is little doubt had he possessed a smattering of phrases a greater command of biblical learning and more zeal that the fisherman might have established a new shade of the christian faith for while mankind still persevere in disregarding the plainest mandates of god as respects humility the charities and obedience nothing seems to afford them more delight than to add to the catalogue of the offences against his divine supremacy it was perhaps lucky for the commodore who was capital at casting a pickerel line but who usually settled his polemics with the fist when hard pushed that captain truck found leisure to come to the rescue  im amazed maam said the honest packetmaster that a woman of your sanctity should deny that jumping the rope is a sin for i hold that point to have been settled by all our people these fifty years you will admit that the rope cannot be welljumped without levity  levity captain truck i hope you do not insinuate that a daughter of mine discovers levity  certainly maam she is called the best rope jumper in the village i hear and levity or lightness of carriage is the great requisite for skill in the art then there are vain repetitions in doing the same thing over and over so often and vain repetitions are forbidden even in our prayers i can call both father and mother to testify to that fact  well this is news to me i must speak to the minister about it  of the two the skippingrope is rather more sinful than dancing for the music makes the latter easy whereas one has to force the spirit to enter into the other commodore our hour has come and we must make sail may i ask the favour mrs abbott of a bit of thread to fasten this hook afresh  the widowbewitched turned to her basket and raising a piece of calico to look for the thread high low jack and the game stared her in the face when she bent her eyes towards her guests she perceived all three gazing at the cards with as much apparent surprise and curiosity as if two of them knew nothing of their history  awful exclaimed mrs abbott shaking both handsawfulawful awful the powers of darkness have been at work here  they seem to have been pretty much occupied too observed the captain for a better thumbed pack i never yet found in the forecastle of a ship  awfulawfulawfulthis is equal to the forty days in the wilderness mr dodge  it is a trying cross maam  to my notion now said the captain those cards are not worse than the skippingrope though i allow that they might have been cleaner  but mrs abbott was not disposed to view the matter so lightly she saw the hand of the devil in the affair and fancied it was a new trial offered to her widowed condition  are these actually cards she cried like one who distrusted the evidence of her senses  just so maam kindly answered the commodore this is the ace of spades a famous fellow to hold when you have the lead and this is the jack which counts one you know when spades are trumps i never saw a more thoroughworking pack in my life  or a more thoroughly worked pack added the captain in a condoling manner well we are not all perfect and i hope mrs abbott will cheer up and look at this matter in a gayer point of view for myself i hold that a skippingrope is worse than the jack of spades sundays or week days commodore we shall see no pickerel today unless we tear ourselves from this good company  here the two wags took their leave and retreated to the skiff the captain who foresaw an occasion to use them considerately offering to relieve mrs abbott from the presence of the odious cards intimating that he would conscientiously see them fairly sunk in the deepest part of the lake  when the two worthies were at a reasonable distance from the shore the commodore suddenly ceased rowing made a flourish with his hand and incontinently began to laugh as if his mirth had suddenly broken through all restraint captain truck who had been lighting a cigar commenced smoking and seldom indulging in boisterous merriment he responded with his eyes shaking his head from time to time with great satisfaction as thoughts more ludicrous than common came over his imagination  harkee commodore he said blowing the smoke upward and watching it with his eye until it floated away in a little cloud neither of us is a chicken you have studied life on the fresh water and i have studied life on the salt i do not say which produces the best scholars but i know that both make better christians than the jack screw system  just so i tell them in the village that little is gained in the end by following the blind that is my doctrine sir  and a very good doctrine it would prove i make no doubt were you to enter into it a little more fully  well sir i can explain  not another syllable is necessary i know what you mean as well as if i said it myself and moreover short sermons are always the best you mean that a pilot ought to know where he is steering which is perfectly sound doctrine my own experience tells me that if you press a sturgeons nose with your foot it will spring up as soon as it is loosened now the jackscrew will heave a great strain no doubt but the moment it is let up down comes all that rests on it again this mr dodge i suppose you know has been a passenger with me once or twice  i have heard as muchthey say he was tigerish in the fight with the niggersquite an outandouter  ay i hear he tells some such story himself but harkee commodore i wish to do justice to all men and i find there is very little of it inland hereaway the hero of that day is about to marry your beautiful miss effingham other men did their duty too as for instance was the case with mr john effingham but paul bluntpowis effingham finished the job as for mr steadfast dodge sir i say nothing unless it be to add that he was nowhere near me in that transaction and if any man felt like an alligator in lent on that occasion it was your humble servant  which means that he was not nigh the enemy ill swear before a magistrate  and no fear of perjury any one who saw mr john effingham and mr powis on that day might have sworn that they were father and son and any one who did not see mr dodge might have said at once that he did not belong to their family that is all sir i never disparage a passenger and therefore shall say no more than merely to add that mr dodge is no warrior  they say he has experienced religion lately as they call it  it is high time sir for he had experienced sin quite long enough according to my notion i hear that the man goes up and down the country disparaging those whose shoeties he is unworthy to unloose and that he has published some letters in his journal that are as false as his heart but let him beware lest the world should see some rainy day an extract from a certain logbook belonging to a ship called the montauk i am rejoiced at this marriage after all commodore or marriages rather for i understand that mr paul effingham and sir george templemore intend to make a double bowline of it tomorrow morning all is arranged and as soon as my eyes have witnessed that blessed sight i shall trip for newyork again  it is clearly made out then that the young gentleman is mr john effinghams son  as clear as the northstar in a bright night the fellow who spoke to me at the fun of fire has put us in a way to remove the last doubt if there were any doubt mr effingham himself who is so coolheaded and cautious says there is now sufficient proof to make it good in any court in america that point may be set down as settled and for my part i rejoice it is so since mr john effingham has so long passed for an old bachelor that it is a credit to the corps to find one of them the father of so noble a son  here the commodore dropped his anchor and the two friends began to fish for an hour neither talked much but having obtained the necessary stock of perch they landed at the favourite spring and prepared a fry while seated on the grass alternating be tween the potations of punch and the mastication of fish these worthies again renewed the dialogue in their usual discursive philosophical and sentimental manner  we are citizens of a surprisingly great country commodore commenced mr truck after one of his heaviest draughts every body says it from maine to florida and what every body says must be true  just so sir i sometimes wonder how so great a country ever came to produce so little a man as myself  a good cow may have a bad calf and that explains the matter have you many as virtuous and pious women in this part of the world as mrs abbott  the hills and valleys are filled with them you mean persons who have got so much religion that they have no room for any thing else  i shall mourn to my dying day that you were not brought up to the sea if you discover so much of the right material on freshwater what would you have been on salt the people who suck in nutriment from a brain and a conscience like those of mr dodge too commodore must get in time to be surprisingly clearsighted  just so his readers soon overreach themselves but its of no great consequence sir the people of this part of the world keep nothing long enough to do much good or much harm  fond of change ha  like unlucky fishermen always ready to shift the ground i dont believe sir that in all this region you can find a dozen graves of sons that lie near their fathers every body seems to have a mortal aversion to stability  it is hard to love such a country commodore  sir i never try to love it god has given me a pretty sheet of water that suits my fancy and wants a beautiful sky fine green mountains and i am satisfied one may love god in such a temple though he love nothing else  well i suppose if you love nothing nothing loves you and no injustice is done  just so sir self has got to be the idol though in the general scramble a man is sometimes puzzled to know whether he is himself or one of the neighbours  i wish i knew your political sentiments commodore you have been communicative on all subjects but that and i have taken up the notion that you are a true philosopher  i hold myself to be but a babe in swaddlingclothes compared to yourself sir but such as my poor opinions are you are welcome to them in the first place then sir i have lived long enough on this water to know that every man is a lover of liberty in his own person and that he has a secret distaste for it in the persons of other people then sir i have got to understand that patriotism means bread and cheese and that opposition is every man for himself  if the truth were known i believe commodore you have buoyed out the channel  just so after being pulled about by the salt of the land and using my freemans privileges at their command until i got tired of so much liberty sir i have resigned and retired to private life doing most of my own thinking out here on the otsegowater like a poor slave as i am  you ought to be chosen the next president  i owe my present emancipation sir to the sogdollager i first began to reason about such a man as this mr dodge who has thrust himself and his ignorance together into the village lately as an expounder of truth and a ray of light to the blind well sir i said to myself if this man be the man i know him to be as a man can he be any thing better as an editor  that was a home question put to yourself commodore how did you answer it  the answer was satisfactory sir to myself whatever it might be to other people i stopped his paper and set up for myself just about that time the sogdollager nibbled and instead of trying to be a great man over the shoulders of the patriots and sages of the land i endeavoured to immortalize myself by hooking him i go to the elections now for that i feel to be a duty but instead of allowing a man like this mr dodge to tell me how to vote i vote for the man in public that i would trust in private  excellent i honour you more and more every minute i pass in your society we will now drink to the future happiness of those who will become brides and bridegrooms tomorrow if all men were as philosophical and as learned as you commodore the human race would be in a fairer way than they are today  just so i drink to them with all my heart is it not surprising sir that people like mrs abbott and mr dodge should have it in their power to injure such as those whose happiness we have just had the honour of commemorating in advance  why commodore a fly may bite an elephant if he can find a weak spot in his hide i do not altogether understand the history of the marriage of john effingham myself but we see the issue of it has been a fine son now i hold that when a man fairly marries he is bound to own it the same as any other crime for he owes it to those who have not been as guilty as himself to show the world that he no longer belongs to them  just so but we have flies in this part of the world that will bite through the toughest hide  that comes from there being no quarterdeck in your social ship commodore now aboard of a wellregulated packet all the thinking is done aft they who are desirous of knowing whereabouts the vessel is being compelled to wait till the observations are taken or to sit down in their ignorance the whole difficulty comes from the fact that sensible people live so far apart in this quarter of the world that fools have more room than should fall to their share you understand me commodore  just so said the commodore laughing and winking well it is fortunate that there are some people who are not quite as weakminded as some other people i take it captain truck that you will be present at the wedding  the captain now winked in his turn looked around him to make sure no one was listening and laying a finger on his nose he answered in a much lower key than was usual for him  you can keep a secret i know commodore now what i have to say is not to be told to mrs abbott in order that it may be repeated and multiplied but is to be kept as snug as your bait in the baitbox  you know your man sir  well then about ten minutes before the clock strikes nine to morrow morning do you slip into the gallery of new st pauls and you shall see beauty and modesty when unadorned adorned the most you comprehend  just so and the hand was flourished even more than usual  it does not become us bachelors to be too lenient to matrimony but i should be an unhappy man were i not to witness the marriage of paul powis to eve effingham  here both the worthies freshened the nip as captain truck called it and then the conversation soon got to be too philosophical and contemplative for this unpretending record of events and ideas  chapter xxix    then plainly know my hearts dear love is set on the fair   daughter of rich capulet as mine on hers so hers is set on mine   and all combined save what thou must confine by holy marriage    romeo and juliet  the morning chosen for the nuptials of eve and grace arrived and all the inmates of the wigwam were early afoot though the utmost care had been taken to prevent the intelligence of the approaching ceremony from getting into the village they little knew however how closely they were watched the mean artifices that were resorted to by some who called themselves their neighbours to tamper with servants to obtain food for conjecture and to justify to themselves their exaggerations falsehoods and frauds the news did leak out as will presently be seen and through a channel that may cause the reader who is unacquainted with some of the peculiarities of american life a little surprise  we have frequently alluded to annette the femme de chambre that had followed eve from europe although we have had no occasion to dwell on her character which was that of a woman of her class as they are well known to exist in france annette was young had bright sparkling black eyes was well made and had the usual tournure and manner of a parisian grisette as it is the besetting weakness of all provincial habits to mistake graces for grace flourishes for elegance and exaggeration for merit annette soon acquired a reputation in her circle as a woman of more than usual claims to distinction her attire was in the height of the fashion being of eves castoff clothes and of the best materials and attire is also a point that is not without its influence on those who are unaccustomed to the world  as the double ceremony was to take place before breakfast annette was early employed about the person of her young mistress adorning it in the bridal robes while she worked at her usual employment the attendant appeared unusually agitated and several times pins were badly pointed and new arrangements had to supersede or to supply the deficiencies of her mistakes eve was always a model of patience and she bore with these little oversights with a quiet that would have given paul an additional pledge of her admirable selfcommand as well as of a sweetness of temper that in truth raised her almost above the commoner feelings of mortality  vous êtes un peu agitée ce matin ma bonne annette she merely observed when her maid had committed a blunder more material than common  jespère que mademoiselle a été contente de moi jusqu à present returned annette vexed with her own awkwardness and speaking in the manner in which it is usual to announce an intention to quit a service  certainly annette you have conducted yourself well and are very expert in your métier but why do you ask this question just at this moment  parcequebecausewith mademoiselles permission i intended to ask for my congé  congé do you think of quitting me annette  it would make me happier than anything else to die in the service of mademoiselle but we are all subject to our destinythe conversation was in frenchand mine compels me to cease my services as a femme de chambre  this is a sudden and for one in a strange country an extraordinary resolution may i ask annette what you propose to do  here the woman gave herself certain airs endeavoured to blush did look at the carpet with a studied modesty that might have deceived one who did not know the genus and announced her intention to get married too at the end of the present month  married repeated evesurely not to old pierre annette  pierre mademoiselle i shall not condescend to look at pierre je vais me marier avec un avocat  un avocat  oui mademoiselle i will marry myself with monsieur aristabule bragg if mademoiselle shall permit  eve was perfectly mute with astonishment notwithstanding the proofs she had often seen of the wide range that the ambition of an american of a certain class allows itself of course she remembered the conversation on the point and it would not have been in nature had not a mistress who had been so lately wooed felt some surprise at finding her discarded suitor so soon seeking consolation in the smiles of her own maid still her surprise was less than that which the reader will probably experience at this announcement for as has just been said she had seen too much of the active and pliant enterprise of the lover to feel much wonder at any of his moral tours de force even eve however was not perfectly acquainted with the views and policy that had led aristabulus to seek this consummation to his matrimonial schemes which must be explained explicitly in order that they may be properly understood  mr bragg had no notion of any distinctions in the world beyond those which came from money and political success for the first he had a practical deference that was as profound as his wishes for its enjoyments and for the last he felt precisely the sort of reverence that one educated under a feudal system would feel for a feudal lord the first after several unsuccessful efforts he had found unattainable by means of matrimony and he turned his thoughts towards annette whom he had for some months held in reserve in the event of his failing with eve and grace for on both these heiresses had he entertained designs as a pis aller annette was a dressmaker of approved taste her person was sufficiently attractive her broken english gave piquancy to thoughts of no great depth she was of a suitable age and he had made her proposals and been accepted as soon as it was ascertained that eve and grace were irretrievably lost to him of course the parisienne did not hesitate an instant about becoming the wife of un avocat for agreeably to her habits matrimony was a legitimate means of bettering her condition in life the plan was soon arranged they were to be married as soon as annettes months notice had expired and then they were to emigrate to the far west where mr bragg proposed to practise law or keep school or to go to congress or to turn trader or to saw lumber or in short to turn his hand to any thing that offered while annette was to help along with the ménage by making dresses and teaching french the latter occupation promising to be somewhat peripatetic the population being scattered and few of the dwellers in the interior deeming it necessary to take more than a quarters instruction in any of the higher branches of education the object being to study as it is called and not to know aristabulus who was filled with goaheadism would have shortened the delay but this annette positively resisted her esprit de corps as a servant and all her notions of justice repudiating the notion that the connexion which had existed so long between eve and herself was to be cut off at a moments warning so diametrically were the ideas of the fiancés opposed to each other on this point that at one time it threatened a rupture mr bragg asserting the natural independence of man to a degree that would have rendered him independent of all obligations that were not effectually enacted by the law and annette maintaining the dignity of a european femme de chambre whose sense of propriety demanded that she should not quit her place without giving a months warning the affair was happily decided by aristabuluss receiving a commission to tend a store in the absence of its owner mr effingham on a hint from his daughter having profited by the annual expiration of the engagement to bring their connexion to an end  this termination to the passion of mr bragg would have afforded eve a good deal of amusement at any other moment but a bride cannot be expected to give too much of her attention to the felicity and prospects of those who have no natural or acquired claims to her affection the cousins met attired for the ceremony in mr effinghams room where he soon came in person to lead them to the drawingroom it is seldom that two more lovely young women are brought together on similar occasions as mr effingham stood between them holding a hand of each his moistened eyes turned from one to the other in honest pride and in an admiration that even his tenderness could not restrain the toilettes were as simple as the marriage ceremony will permit for it was intended that there should be no unnecessary parade and perhaps the delicate beauty of each of the brides was rendered the more attractive by this simplicity as it has often been justly remarked that the fair of this country are more winning in dress of a less conventional character than when in the elaborate and regulated attire of ceremonies as might have been expected there was most of soul and feeling in eves countenance though grace wore an air of charming modesty and nature both were unaffected simple and graceful and we may add that both trembled as mr effingham took their hands  this is a pleasing and yet a painful hour said that kind and excellent man one in which i gain a son and lose a daughter  and i dearest uncle exclaimed grace whose feelings trembled on her eyelids like the dew ready to drop from the leaf have i no connexion with your feelings  you are the daughter that i lose my child for eve will still remain with me but templemore has promised to be grateful and i will trust his word  mr effingham then embraced with fervour both the charming young women who stood apparelled for the most important event of their lives lovely in their youth beauty innocence and modesty and taking an arm of each he led them below john effingham the two bridegrooms captain ducie mr and mrs bloomfield mrs hawker captain truck mademoiselle viefville annette and ann sidley were all assembled in the drawingroom ready to receive them and as soon as shawls were thrown around eve and grace in order to conceal the wedding dresses the whole party proceeded to the church  the distance between the wigwam and new st pauls was very trifling the solemn pines of the churchyard blending from many points with the gayer trees in the grounds of the former and as the buildings in this part of the village were few the whole of the bridal train entered the tower unobserved by the eyes of the curious the clergyman was waiting in the chancel and as each of the young men led the object of his choice immediately to the altar the double ceremony began without delay at this instant mr aristabulus dodge and mrs abbot advanced from the rear of the gallery and coolly took their seats in its front neither belonged to this particular church though having discovered that the marriages were to take place that morning by means of annette they had no scruples on the score of delicacy about thrusting themselves forward on the occasion for to the latest moment that publicityprinciple which appeared to be interwoven with their very natures induced them to think that nothing was so sacred as to be placed beyond the reach of curiosity they entered the church because the church they held to be a public place precisely on the principle that others of their class conceive if a gate be blown open by accident it removes all the moral defences against trespassers as it removes the physical  the solemn language of the prayers and vows proceeded none the less for the presence of these unwelcome intruders for at that grave moment all other thoughts were hushed in those that more properly belonged to the scene when the clergyman made the usual appeal to know if any man could give a reason why those who stood before him should not be united in holy wedlock mrs abbott nudged mr dodge and in the fulness of her discontent eagerly inquired in a whisper if it were not possible to raise some valid objection could she have had her pious wish the simple unpretending meek and churchgoing eve should never be married but the editor was not a man to act openly in any thing his particular province lying in insinuations and innuendoes as a hint would not now be available he determined to postpone his revenge to a future day we say revenge for steadfast was of the class that consider any happiness or advantage in which they are not ample participators wrongs done to themselves  that is a wise regulation of the church which makes the marriage ceremony brief for the intensity of the feelings it often creates would frequently become too powerful to be suppressed were it unnecessarily prolonged mr effingham gave away both the brides the one in the quality of parent the other in that of guardian and neither of the bridegrooms got the ring on the wrong finger this is all we have to of the immediate scene at the altar as soon as the benediction was pronounced and the brides were released from the first embraces of their husbands mr effingham without even kissing eve threw the shawls over their shoulders and taking an arm of each he led them rapidly from the church for he felt reluctant to suffer the holy feelings that were uppermost in his heart to be the spectacle of rude and obtrusive observers at the door he relinquished eve to paul and grace to sir george with a silent pressure of the hand of each and signed for them to proceed towards the wigwam he was obeyed and in less than half an hour from the time they had left the drawingroom the whole party was again assembled in it  what a change had been produced in the situation of so many in that brief interval  father eve whispered while mr effingham folded her to his heart the unbidden tears falling from both their eyesi am still thine  it would break my heart to think otherwise darling no noi have not lost a daughter but have gained a son  and what place am i to occupy in this scene of fondness inquired john effingham who had considerately paid his compliments to grace first that she might not feel forgotten at such a moment and who had so managed that she was now receiving the congratulations of the rest of the party am i to lose both son and daughter  eve smiling sweetly through her tears raised herself from her own fathers arms and was received in those of her husbands parent after he had fondly kissed her forehead several times without withdrawing from his bosom she parted the rich hair on his forehead passing her hand down his face like an infant and said softly  cousin jack  i believe this must be my rank and estimation still paul shall make no difference in our feeling we will love each other as we have ever done  paul can be nothing new between you and me you have always been a second father in my eyes and in my heart too deardear cousin jack  john effingham pressed the beautiful ardent blushing girl to his bosom again and as he did so both felt notwithstanding their language that a new and dearer tie than ever bound them together eve now received the compliments of the rest of the party when the two brides retired to change the dresses in which they had appeared at the altar for their more ordinary attire  in her own dressingroom eve found ann sidley waiting with impatience to pour out her feelings the honest and affectionate creature being much too sensitive to open the floodgates of her emotions in the presence of third parties  maammiss evemrs effingham she exclaimed as soon as her young mistress entered afraid of saying too much now that her nursling had become a married woman  my kind and good nanny said eve taking her old nurse in her arms their tears mingling in silence for near a minute you have seen your child enter on the last of her great earthly engagements nanny and i know you pray that they may prove happy  i doi doi domaammadammiss evewhat am i to call you in future maam  call me miss eve as you have done since my childhood dearest nanny  nanny received this permission with delight and twenty times that morning she availed herself of the permission and she continued to use the term until two years later she danced a miniature eve on her knee as she had done its mother before her when matronly rank began silently to assert its rights and our present bride became mrs effingham  i shall not quit you maam now that you are married ann sidley timidly asked for although she could scarcely think such an event within the bounds of probability and eve had already more than once assured her of the contrary with her own tongue still did she love to have assurance made doubly sure i hope nothing will ever happen to make me quit you maam  nothing of that sort with my consent ever shall happen my excellent nanny and now that annette is about to get married i shall have more than the usual necessity for your services  and mamerzelle maam inquired nanny with sparkling eyes i suppose she too will return to her own country now you know every thing and have no farther occasion for her  mademoiselle viefville will return to france in the autumn but it will be with us all for my dear father cousin jack my husband eve blushed as she pronounced the novel wordand myself not forgetting you my old nurse will all sail for england with sir george and lady templemore on our way to italy the first week in october  i care not maam so that i go with you i would rather we did not live in a country where i cannot understand all that the people say to you but wherever you are will be my earthly paradise  eve kissed the truehearted woman and annette entering she changed her dress  the two brides met at the head of the great stairs on their way back to the drawingroom eve was a little in advance but with a half concealed smile she gave way to grace curtsying gravely and saying  it does not become me to precede lady templemorei who am only mrs paul effingham  nay dear eve i am not so weak as you imagine do you not think i should have married him had he not been a baronet  templemore my dear coz is a man any woman might love and i believe as firmly as i hope it sincerely that he will make you happy  and yet there is one woman who would not love him eve  eve looked steadily at her cousin for a moment was startled and then she felt gratified that sir george had been so honest for the frankness and manliness of his avowal was a pledge of the good faith and sincerity of his character she took her cousin affectionately by the hand and said  grace this confidence is the highest compliment you can pay me and it merits a return that sir george templemore may have had a passing inclination for one who so little deserved it is possibly truebut my affections were anothers before i knew him  you never would have married templemore eve he says himself now that you are quite too continental as he calls it to like an englishman  then i shall take the first good occasion to undeceive him for i do like an englishman and he is the identical man  as few women are jealous on their weddingday grace took this in good part and they descended the stairs together side by side reflecting each others happiness in their timid but conscious smiles in the great hall they were met by the bridegrooms and each taking the arm of him who had now become of so vast importance to her they paced the room to and fro until summoned to the déjéuner à la fourchette which had been prepared under the especial superintendence of mademoiselle viefville after the manner of her country  weddingdays like all formally prepared festivals are apt to go off a little heavily such however was not the case with this for every appearance of premeditation and preparation vanished with this meal it is true the family did not quit the grounds but with this exception ease and tranquil happiness reigned throughout captain truck was alone disposed to be sentimental and more than once as he looked about him he expressed his doubts whether he had pursued the right course to attain happiness  i find myself in a solitary category he said at the dinner table in the evening mrs hawker and both the messrs effinghams have been married every body else is married and i believe i must take refuge in saying that i will be married if i can now persuade any one to have me even mr powis my righthand man in all that african affair has deserted me and left me like a single dead pine in one of your clearings or a jewelblock dangling at a yardarm without a sheave mrs bride the captain styled eve thus throughout the day to the utter neglect of the claims of lady templemoremrs bride we will consider my forlorn condition more philosophically when i shall have the honour to take you and so many of this blessed party back again to europe where i found you under your advice i think i might even yet venture  and i am overlooked entirely cried mr howel who had been invited to make one at the weddingfeast what is to become of me captain truck if this marrying mania go any further  i have long had a plan for your welfare my dear sir that i will take this opportunity to divulge i propose ladies and gentlemen that we enlist mr howel in our project for this autumn and that we carry him with us to europe i shall be proud to have the honour of introducing him to his old friend the island of great britain  ah that is a happiness i fear that is not in reserve for me said mr howel shaking his head i have thought of these things in my time but age will now defeat any such hopes  age tom howel said john effingham you are but fifty like ned and myself we were all boys together forty years ago and yet you find us who have so lately returned ready to take a fresh departure pluck up heart there may be a steamboat ready to bring you back by the time you wish to return  never said captain truck positively ladies and gentlemen it is morally impossible that the atlantic should ever be navigated by steamers that doctrine i shall maintain to my dying day but what need of a steamer when we have packets like palaces  i did not know captain that you entertained so hearty a respect for great britainit is encouraging really to find so generous a feeling toward the old island in one of her descendants sir george and lady templemore permit me to drink to your lasting felicity  ayayi entertain no illwill to england though her tobacco laws are none of the genteelest but my wish to export you mr howel is less from a desire to show you england than to let you perceive that there are other countries in europe  other countriessurely you do not suppose i am so ignorant of geography as to believe that there are no other countries in europeno such places as hanover brunswick and brunswick lunenberg and denmark the sister of old george the third married the king of that country and wurtemberg the king of which married the princess royal  and mecklenburgstrelitz added john effingham gravely a princess of which actually married george the third propriâ personâ as well as by proxy nothing can be plainer than your geography howel but in addition to these particular regions our worthy friend the captain wishes you to know also that there are such places as france and austria and russia and italy though the latter can scarcely repay a man for the trouble of visiting it  you have guessed my motive mr john effingham and expressed it much more discreetly than i could possibly have done cried the captain if mr howel will do me the honour to take passage with me going and coming i shall consider the pleasure of his remarks on men and things as one of the greatest advantages i ever possessed  i do not know but i might be induced to venture as far as england but not a foot farther  pas à paris exclaimed mademoiselle viefville who wondered why any rational being would take the trouble to cross the atlantic merely to see ce melancolique londres you will go to paris for my sake monsieur howel  for your sake indeed mamselle i would do any thing but hardly for my own i confess i have thought of this and i will think of it farther i should like to see the king of england and the house of lords i confess before i die  ay and the tower and the boarshead at eastcheap and the statue of the duke of wellington and london bridge and richmond hill and bow street and somerset house and oxford road and bartlemy fair and hungerford market and charingcrossold charingcross tom howeladded john effingham with a goodnatured nod of the head  a wonderful nation cried mr howel whose eyes sparkled as the other proceeded in his enumeration of wonders i do not think after all that i can die in peace without seeing some of these thingsall would be too much for me how far is the isle of dogs now from st catherines docks captain  oh but a few cables lengths if you will only stick to the ship until she is fairly docked i will promise you a sight of the isle of dogs before you land even but then you must promise me to carry out no tobacco  no fear of me i neither smoke nor chew and it does not surprise me that a nation as polished as the english should have this antipathy to tobacco and one might really see the isle of dogs before landing it is a wonderful country mrs bloomfield will you ever be able to die tranquilly without seeing england  i hope sir whenever that event shall arrive that it may be met tranquilly let what may happen previously i do confess in common with mrs effingham a longing desire to see italy a wish that i believe she entertains from her actual knowledge and which i entertain from my anticipations  now this really surprises me what can italy possess to repay one for the trouble of travelling so far  i trust cousin jack said eve colouring at the sound of her own voice for on that day of supreme happiness and intense emotions she had got to be so sensitive as to be less selfpossessed than common that our friend mr wenham will not be forgotten but that he may be invited to join the party  this representative of la jeune amérique was also present at the dinner out of regard to his deceased father who was a very old friend of mr effinghams and being so favourably noticed by the bride he did not fail to reply  i believe an american has little to learn from any nation but his own observed mr wenham with the complacency of the school to which he belonged although one might wish that all of this country should travel in order that the rest of the world might have the benefit of the intercourse  it is a thousand pities said john effingham that one of our universities for instance was not ambulant old yale was so in its infancy but unlike most other creatures it went about with greater ease to itself when a child than it can move in manhood  mr john effingham loves to be facetious said mr wenham with dignity for while he was as credulous as could be wished on the subject of american superiority he was not quite as blind as the votaries of the angloamerican school who usually yield the control of all their faculties and common sense to their masters on the points connected with their besetting weaknesses every body is agreed i believe that the american imparts more than he receives in his intercourse with europeans  the smiles of the more experienced of this young mans listeners were wellbred and concealed and the conversation turned to other subjects it was easy to raise the laugh on such an occasion and contrary to the usage of the wigwam where the men usually left the table with the other sex captain truck john effingham mr bloomfield and mr howel made what is called a night of it much delicious claret was consumed and the honest captain was permitted to enjoy his cigar about midnight he swore he had half a mind to write a letter to mrs hawker with an offer of his hand as for his heart that she well knew she had possessed for a long time  the next day about the hour when the house was tranquil from the circumstance that most of its inmates were abroad on their several avocations of boating riding shopping or walking eve was in the library her father having left it a few minutes before to mount his horse she was seated at a table writing a letter to an aged relative of her own sex to communicate the circumstance of her marriage the door was half open and paul appeared at it unexpectedly coming in search of his young bride his step had been so light and so intently was our heroine engaged with her letter that his approach was unnoticed though it had now been a long time that the ear of eve had learned to know his tread and her heart to beat at its welcome sound perhaps a beautiful woman is never so winningly lovely as when in her neat morning attire she seems fresh and sweet as the newborn day eve had paid a little more attention to her toilette than usual even admitting just enough of a properly selected jewelry a style of ornament that so singularly denotes the refinement of a gentlewoman when used understandingly and which so infallibly betrays vulgarity under other circumstances while her attire had rather more than its customary finish though it was impossible not to perceive at a glance that she was in an undress the parisian skill of annette on which mr bragg based so many of his hopes of future fortune had cut and fitted the robe to her faultlessly beautiful person with a tact or it might be truer to say a contact so perfect that it even left more charms to be imagined than it displayed though the outline of the whole figure was that of the most lovely womanhood but notwithstanding the exquisite modelling of the whole form the almost fairy lightness of the full swelling but small foot about which nothing seemed lean and attenuated the exquisite hand that appeared from among the ruffles of the dress paul stood longest in nearly breathless admiration of the countenance of his bright and blooming bride perhaps there is no sentiment so touchingly endearing to a man as that which comes over him as he contemplates the beauty confiding faith holy purity and truth that shine in the countenance of a young unpractised innocent woman when she has so far overcome her natural timidity as to pour out her tenderness in his behalf and to submit to the strongest impulses of her nature such was now the fact with eve she was writing of her husband and though her expressions were restrained by taste and education they partook of her unutterable fondness and devotion the tears stood in her eyes the pen trembled in her hand and she shaded her face as if to conceal the weakness from herself paul was alarmed he knew not why but eve in tears was a sight painful to him in a moment he was at her side with an arm placed gently around her waist and he drew her fondly towards his bosom  evedearest eve he saidwhat mean these tears  the serene eye the radiant blush and the meek tenderness that rewarded his own burst of feeling reassured the young husband and deferring to the sensitive modesty of so young a bride he released hold retaining only a hand  it is happiness powisnothing but excess of happiness which makes us women weaker i fear than even sorrow  paul kissed her hands regarded her with an intensity of admiration before which the eyes of eve rose and fell as if dazzled while meeting his looks and yet unwilling to lose them and then he reverted to the motive which had brought him to the library  my fatheryour father that is now  cousin jack  cousin jack if you will has just made me a present which is second only to the greater gift i received from your own excellent parent yesterday at the altar see dearest eve he has bestowed this lovely image of yourself on me lovely though still so far from the truth and here is the miniature of my poor mother also to supply the place of the one carried away by the arabs  eve gazed long and wistfully at the beautiful features of this image of her husbands mother she traced in them that pensive thought that winning kindness that had first softened her heart towards paul and her lips trembled as she pressed the insensible glass against them  she must have been very handsome eve and there is a look of melancholy tenderness in the face that would seem almost to predict an unhappy blighting of the affections  and yet this young ingenuous faithful woman entered on the solemn engagement we have just made paul with as many reasonable hopes of a bright future as we ourselves  not so eveconfidence and holy truth were wanting at the nuptials of my parents when there is deception at the commencement of such a contract it is not difficult to predict the end  i do not think paul you ever deceived that noble heart of yours is too generous  if any thing can make a man worthy of such a love dearest it is the perfect and absorbing confidence with which your sex throw themselves on the justice and faith of ours did that spotless heart ever entertain a doubt of the worth of any living being on which it had set its affections  of itself often and they say selflove lies at the bottom of all our actions  you are the last person to hold this doctrine beloved for those who live most in your confidence declare that all traces of self are lost in your very nature  most in my confidence my father my dear kind father has then been betraying his besetting weakness by extolling the gift he has made  your kind excellent father knows too well the total want of necessity for any such thing if the truth must be confessed i have been passing a quarter of an hour with worthy ann sidley  nannydear old nannyand you have been weak enough traitor to listen to the eulogiums of a nurse on her child  all praise of thee my blessed eve is grateful to my ears and who can speak more understandingly of those domestic qualities which lie at the root of domestic bliss than those who have seen you in your most intimate life from childhood down to the moment when you have assumed the duties of a wife  paul paul thou art beside thyself too much learning hath made thee mad  i am not mad most beloved and beautiful eve but blessed to a degree that might indeed upset a stronger reason  we will now talk of other things said eve raising his hand to her lips in respectful affection and looking gratefully up into his fond and eloquent eyes i hope the feeling of which you so lately spoke has subsided and that you no longer feel yourself a stranger in the dwelling of your own family  now that i can claim a right through you i confess that my conscience is getting to be easier on this point have you been yet told of the arrangement that the older heads meditate in reference to our future means  i would not listen to my dear father when he wished to introduce the subject for i found that it was a project that made distinctions between paul effingham and eve effingham two that i wish henceforth to consider as one in all things  in this darling you may do yourself injustice as well as me but perhaps you may not wish me to speak on the subject neither  what would my lord  then listen and the tale is soon told we are each others natural heirs of the name and blood of effingham neither has a relative nearer than the other for though but cousins in the third degree our family is so small as to render the husband in this case the natural heir of the wife and the wife the natural heir of the husband now your father proposes that his estates be valued and that my father settle on you a sum of equal amount which his wealth will fully enable him to do and that i become the possessor in reversion of the lands that would otherwise have been yours  you possess me my heart my affections my duty of what account is money after this  i perceive that you are so much and so truly woman eve that we must arrange all this without consulting you at all  can i be in safer hands a father that has always been too indulgent of my unreasonable wishesa second parent that has only contributed too much to spoil me in the same thoughtless mannerand a  husband added paul perceiving that eve hesitated at pronouncing to his face a name so novel though so endearing who will strive to do more than either in the same way  husband she added looking up into his face with a smile innocent as that of an infant while the crimson tinge covered her forehead if the formidable word must be uttered who is doing all he can to increase a selfesteem that is already so much greater than it ought to be  a light tap at the door caused eve to start and look embarrassed like one detected in a fault and paul to release the hand that he had continued to hold during the brief dialogue  sirmaamsaid the timid meek voice of ann sidley as she held the door ajar without presuming to look into the room miss eve mr powis  enter my good nanny said eve recovering her selfcomposure in a moment the presence of her nurse always appearing to her as no more than a duplication of herself what is your wish  i hope i am not unreasonable but i knew that mr effingham was alone with you here and i wishedthat is maammiss evesir  speak your wishes my good old nurseam i not your own child and is not this your own childsagain eve hesitated blushed and smiled ere she pronounced the formidable wordhusband  yes maam and god be praised that it is so i dreamt it is now four years miss eve we were then travelling among the denmarkers and i dreamt that you were married to a great prince  but your dream has not come true my good nanny and you see by this fact that it is not always safe to trust in dreams  maam i do not esteem princes by the kingdoms and crowns but by their qualitiesand if mr powis be not a prince who is  that indeed changes the matter said the gratified young wife and i believe after all dear nanny that i must become a convert to your theory of dreams  while i must always deny it good mrs sidley if this is a specimen of its truth said paul laughing but perhaps this prince proved unworthy of miss eve after all  not he sir he made her a most kind and affectionate husband not humouring all her idle wishes if miss eve could have had such wishes but cherishing her and counselling her and protecting her showing as much tenderness for her as her own father and as much love for her as i had myself  in which case my worthy nurse he proved an invaluable husband said eve with glistening eyesand i trust too that he was considerate and friendly to you  he took me by the hand the morning after the marriage and said faithful ann sidley you have nursed and attended my beloved when a child and as a young lady and i now entreat you will continue to wait on and serve her as a wife to your dying day he did indeed maam and i think i can now hear the very words he spoke so kindly the dream so far has come good  my faithful ann said paul smiling and taking the hand of the nurse you have been all that is good and true to my best beloved as a child and as a young lady and now i earnestly entreat you to continue to wait on her and to serve her as my wife to your dying day  nanny clapped her hands with a scream of delight and bursting into tears she exclaimed as she hurried from the room  it has all come trueit has all come true  a pause of several minutes succeeded this burst of superstitious but natural feeling  all who live near you appear to think you the common centre of their affections paul resumed when his swelling heart permitted him to speak  we have hitherto been a family of lovegod grant it may always continue so  another delicious silence which lasted still longer than the other followed eve then looked up into her husbands face with a gentle curiosity and observed  you have told me a great deal powisexplained all but one little thing that at the time caused me great pain why did ducie when you were about to quit the montauk together so unceremoniously stop you as you were about to get into the boat first is the etiquette of a manofwar so rigid as to justify so much rudeness i had almost called it  the etiquette of a vessel of war is rigid certainly and wisely so but what you fancied rudeness was in truth a compliment among us sailors it is the inferior who goes first into a boat and who quits it last  so much then for forming a judgment ignorantly i believe it is always safer to have no opinion than to form one without a perfect knowledge of all the accompanying circumstances  let us adhere to this safe rule through life dearest and we may find its benefits an absolute confidence caution in drawing conclusions and a just reliance on each other may keep us as happy to the end of our married life as we are at this blessed moment when it is commencing under auspices so favourable as to seem almost providential
