84764557	history of friedrich ii of prussia  frederick the great  by thomas carlyle  volume x     book x  at reinsberg  17361740     chapter i  mansion of reinsberg  on the crownprinces marriage three years ago when the amt or governmentdistrict ruppin with its incomings was assigned to him for revenue we heard withal of a residence getting ready hint had fallen from the prince that reinsberg an old countryseat standing with its domain round it in that little territory of ruppin and probably purchasable as was understood might be pleasant were it once his and well put in repair which hint the kind paternal majesty instantly proceeded to act upon he straightway gave orders for the purchase of reinsberg concluded said purchase on fair terms after some months bargaining 23d october 1733 order given16th march 1734 purchase completed preuss i 75and set his best architect one kemeter to work in concert with the crownprince to newbuild and enlarge the decayed schloss of reinsberg into such a mansion as the young royal highness and his wife would like  kemeter has been busy all this while a solid elegant yet frugal builder and now the main body of the mansion is complete or nearly so the wings and adjuncts going steadily forward mansion so far ready that the royal highnesses can take up their abode in it which they do this autumn 1736 and fairly commence joint housekeeping in a permanent manner hitherto it has been intermittent only hitherto the crownprincess has resided in their berlin mansion or in her own countryhouse at schonhausen husband not habitually with her except when on leave of absence from ruppin in carnival time or for shorter periods at ruppin his life has been rather that of a bachelor or husband abroad on business up to this time but now at reinsberg they do kindle the sacred hearth together 6th august 1736 the date of that important event they have got their court about them dames and cavaliers more than we expected they have arranged the furnitures of their existence here on fit scale and set up their lares and penates on a thrifty footing majesty and queen come out on a visit to them next month 4th september 1736 ibraising the sacred hearth into its first considerable blaze and crowning the operation in a human manner  and so there has a new epoch arisen for the crownprince and his consort a new and muchimproved one it lasted into the fourth year rather improving all the way and only kingship which if a higher sphere was a far less pleasant one put an end to it friedrichs happiest time was this at reinsberg the little four years of hope composure realizable idealism an actual snatch of something like the idyllic appointed him in a lifepilgrimage consisting otherwise of realisms oftenest contradictory enough and sometimes of very grim complexion he is master of his work he is adjusted to the practical conditions set him conditions once complied with daily work done he lives to the muses to the spiritual improvements to the social enjoyments and has though not without flaws of illweatherfrom the tobaccoparliament perhaps rather less than formerly and from the financequarter perhaps rather morea sunny time his innocent insipidity of a wife too appears to have been happy she had the charm of youth of good looks a wholesome perfect loyalty of character withal and did not take to pouting as was once apprehended of her but pleasantly gave and received of what was going this poor crownprincess afterwards queen has been heard in her old age reverting in a touching transient way to the glad days she had at reinsberg complaint openly was never heard from her in any kind of days but these doubtless were the best of her life  reinsberg we said is in the amt ruppin naturally under the crownprinces government at present the little town or village of reinsberg stands about ten miles north of the town ruppinnot quite a thirdpart as big as ruppin is in our time and much more pleasantly situated the country about is of comfortable not unpicturesque character to be distinguished almost as beautiful in that region of sand and moor lakes abound in it tilled fields heights called hills and wood of fair growthone reads of beechavenues of high lindenavenuesa country rather of the ornamented sort before the prince with his improvements settled there many lakes and lakelets in it as usual hereabouts the loitering waters straggle all over that region into meshes of lakes reinsberg itself village and schloss stands on the edge of a pleasant lake last of a mesh of such the summary or outfall of which already here a good strong brook or stream is called the rhein rhyn or rein and gives name to the little place we heard of the rein at ruppin it is there counted as a kind of river still more twenty miles farther down where it falls into the havel on its way to the elbe the waters i think are drabcolored not peatbrown and here at the source or outfall from that mesh of lakes where reinsberg is the country seems to be about the bestsufficient in picturesqueness and otherwise to satisfy a reasonable man  the little town is very old but till the crownprince settled there had no peculiar vitality in it i think there are now some potteries glassmanufactories friedrich wilhelm just while the crownprince was removing thither settled a first glasswork there which took good root and rose to eminence in the crystal bohemiancrystal whiteglass cutglass and other commoner lines in the crownprinces time bescheibung des lutschlosses c zu reinsberg berlin 1788 author a lieutenant hennert thoroughly acquainted with his subject  reinsberg stands on the east or southeast side of its pretty lake lake is called the grinerick see as all those remote lakes have their names mansion is between the town and lake a mansion fronting we may say four ways for it is of quadrangular form with a wet moat from the lake begirdling it and has a spacious court for interior but the principal entrance is from the town side for the rest the building is ashlar on all sides front and rear stands there handsomely abutting on the lake with two towers a tower at each angle which it has on that lakeward side and looks over reinsberg and its steeple rising amid friendly umbrage which hides the housetops towards the rising sun townward there is room for a spacious esplanade and then for the stables outbuildings well masked which still farther shut off the town to this day reinsberg stands with the air of a solid respectable edifice still massive raintight though long since deserted by the princeshipsby friedrich nearly sixscore years ago and nearly threescore by prince henri brother of friedrichs who afterwards had it last accounts i got were of talk there had risen of planting an extensive normalschool there which promising plan had been laid aside again for the time  the old schloss residence of the bredows and other feudal people for a long while had good solid masonry in it and around it orchards potherb gardens which friedrich wilhelms architects took good care to extend and improve not to throw away the result of their art is what we see a beautiful countryhouse what might be called a countrypalace with all its adjunctsand at a rate of expense which would fill english readers of this time with amazement much is admirable to us as we study reinsberg what it had been what it became and how it was made but nothing more so than the small modicum of money it cost to our wondering thought it seems as if the shilling in those parts were equal to the guinea in these and the reason if we ask it is by no means flattering altogether change in the value of money alas reader no that is not above the fourth part of the phenomenon threefourths of the phenomenon are change in the methods of administering moneydifference between managing it with wisdom and veracity on both sides and managing it with unwisdom and mendacity on both sides which is very great indeed and infinitely sadder than any one in these times will believebut we cannot dwell on this consideration let the reader take it with him as a constant accompaniment in whatever work of friedrich wilhelms or of friedrich his sons he now or at any other time may be contemplating impious waste which means disorder and dishonesty and loss of much other than money to all partiesdisgusting aspect of human creatures master and servant working together as if they were not humanwill be spared him in those foreign departments and in an english heart thoughts will arise perhaps of a wholesome tendency though very sad as times are  it would but weary the reader to describe this crownprince mansion which by desperate study of our abstruse materials it is possible to do with auctioneer minuteness there are engraved views of reinsberg and its environs which used to lie conspicuous in the portfolios of collectorswhich i have not seen see hennert just cited for the titles of them of the house itself engraved frontages facades groundplans are more accessible and along with them descriptions which are little descriptivewearisomely detailed and as it were dark by excess of light auctioneer light thrown on them the reader sees in general a fine symmetrical block of buildings standing in rectangular shape in the above localityabout two hundred english feet each the two longer sides measure the townward and the lakeward on their outer front about a hundred and thirty each the two shorter or a hundred and fifty taking in their towers just spoken of the fourth or lakeward side however which is one of the longer pair consists mainly of colonnade spacious colonnade with vases and statues catching up the outskirts of said towers and handsomely uniting everything  beyond doubt a dignified substantial pile of stonework all of good proportions architecture everywhere of cheerfully serious solidly graceful character all of sterling ashlar the due risalites projecting spaces with their attics and statues atop the due architraves cornices and corbelsin short the due opulence of ornament being introduced and only the due genuine sculptors genuine painters artists have been busy and in fact all the suitable fine arts and all the necessary solid ones have worked together with a noticeable fidelity comfortable to the very beholder to this day general height is about forty feet two stories of ample proportions the towers overlooking them are sixty feet in height extent of outer frontage if you go all round and omit the colonnade will be five hundred feet and more this with the rearward face is a thousand feet of room frontagefancy the extent of lodging space for all the kitchens and appurtenances are underground the left front which is a new part of the edifice rising comfortably over these windows i did not count but they must go high up into the hundreds no end to lodging space way in a detached sideedifice subsequently built called cavalier house i read of there being for one item fifty lodging rooms and for another a theatre and if an english duke of trumps were to look at the bills for all that his astonishment would be extreme and perhaps in a degree painful and salutary to him  in one of these towers the crownprince has his library a beautiful apartment nothing wanting to it that the arts could furnish ceiling done by pesne with allegorical geniuses and what notlooks out on mere sky mere earth and water in an ornamental state silent as in elysium it is there we are to fancy the correspondence written the poetries and literary industries going on there or stepping down for a turn in the open air or sauntering meditatively under the colonnade with its statues and vases where weather is no object one commands the lake with its little tufted islands remus island much famed among them and high beechwoods on the farther side the lake is very pretty all say lying between you and the sunsetwith perhaps some other lakelet or solitary pool in the wilderness many miles away revealing itself as a cup of molten gold at that interesting moment what the bookcollection was in the interior i know not except by mere guess  the crownprincesss apartment too which remained unaltered at the last accounts had of it from hennert namely in 1778 is very finetake the anteroom for specimen this fine room some twenty feet height of ceiling has six windows three of them in the main front looking towards the town the other three towards the interior court the light from these windows is heightened by mirrors covering all the piers schafte interspaces of the walls to an uncommonly splendid pitch and shows the painting of the ceiling which again is by the famous pesne to much perfection the artist himself too has managed to lay on his colors there so softly and with such delicate skill that the lightbeams seem to prolong themselves in the painted clouds and air as if it were the real sky you had overhead there in that cloudregion mars is being disarmed by the lovegoddesses and they are sporting with his weapons he stretches out his arm towards the goddess who looks upon him with fond glances cupids are spreading out a draping that is pesnes luxurious performance in the ceilingweaponfestoons in bassorelievo gilt adorn the walls of this room and two pictures also by pesne which represent in life size the late king and queen our good friends friedrich wilhelm and his sophie are worthy of attention over each of the doors you find in lowrelief the profiles of hannibal pompey scipio caesar introduced as medallions  all this is very fine but all this is little to another ceiling in some big saloon elsewhere musicsaloon i think black night making off with all her sickly dews at one end of the ceiling and at the other end the steeds of phoebus bursting forth and the glittering shafts of daywith cupids lovegoddesses wargods not omitting bacchus and his vines all getting beautifully awake in consequence a very fine room indeedused as a musicsaloon or i know not whatand the ceiling of it almost an ideal say the connoisseurs  endless gardens pavilions grottos hermitages orangeries artificial ruins parks and pleasances surround this favored spot and its schloss nothing wanting in it that a princes establishment needsexcept indeed it be hounds for which this prince never had the least demand  except the old ruppin duties which imply continual journeyings thither distance only a mornings ride except these and occasional commissions from papa friedrich is left master of his time and pursuits in this new mansion there are visits to potsdam periodical appearances at berlin some correspondence to keep the tobaccoparliament in tune but friedrichs taste is for the literatures philosophies ayoung prince bent seriously to cultivate his mind to attain some clear knowledge of this world so allimportant to him and he does seriously read study and reflect a good deal his main recreations seemingly are music and the converse of wellinformed friendly men in music we find him particularly rich daily at a fixed hour of the afternoon there is concert held the reader has seen in what kind of room and if the artists entertained here for that function were enumerated high names not yet forgotten in the musical world it would still more astonish readers i count them to the number of twenty or nineteen and mention only that the two brothers graun and the two brothers benda were of the lot suppressing four other fiddlers of eminence and a pianist who is known to everybody hennert p 21 the prince has a fine sensibility to music does himself with thrilling adagios on the flute join in these harmonious acts and no doubt if rightly vigilant against the nonsenses gets profit now and henceforth from this part of his resources  he has visits calls to make on distinguished persons within reach he has much correspondence of a literary or social nature for instance there is suhm the saxon envoy translating wolfs philosophy into french for him sending it in fascicles with endless letters to and from upon itwhich were then highly interesting but are now dead to every reader the crownprince has got a postoffice established at reinsberg leathern functionary of some sort comes lumbering round southward from the mecklenburg quarter twice a week and goes by fehrbellin for the benefit of his correspondences of his calls in the neighborhood we mean to show the reader one sample before long and only one  there are lists given us of the princes court at reinsberg and one reads and again reads the dreariest unmemorable accounts of them but cannot with all ones industry attain any definite understanding of what they were employed in day after day at reinsbergstill more are their salaries and maintenance a mystery to us in that frugal establishment there is wolden for hofmarschall our old custrin friend there is colonel senning old marlborough colonel with the wooden leg who taught friedrich his drillings and artillerypractices in boyhood a fine sagacious old gentleman this latter there is a m jordan expreacher an ingenious prussianfrenchman still young who acts as reader and librarian of whom we shall hear a good deal more intendant is captain excaptain knobelsdorf a very sensible accomplished man whom we saw once at baireuth who has been to italy since and is now returned with beautiful talents for architecture it is he that now undertakes the completing of reinsberg hennert p 29 which he will skilfully accomplish in the course of the next three years twenty musicians on wind or string painters antoine pesne but one of them sculptors glume and others of eminence and hofcavaliers to we know not what extenthow was such a court kept up in harmonious free dignity and no halt in its finances or mean pinch of any kind visible the prince did get in debt but not deep and it was mainly for the tall recruits he had to purchase his moneyaccounts are by no means fully known to me but i should question if his expenditure such is my guess ever reached 3000 pounds a year and am obliged to reflect more and more as the ancient cato did what an admirable revenue frugality is  many of the cavaliers i find for one thing were of the regiment goltz that was one evident economy rittmeister van chasot as the books call him readers saw that chasot flying to prince eugene and know him since the siege of philipsburg he is not yet rittmeister or captain of horse as he became but is of the ruppin garrison hofcavalier attended friedrich on his late prussian journey and is much a favorite when he can be spared from ruppin captain wylich afterwards a general of mark the lieutenant buddenbrock who did the parsoncharivari at ruppin but is now reformed from those practices all these are of goltz colonel keyserling not of goltz nor in active military duty here is a friend of very old standing was officially named as companion to the prince a long while back and got into trouble on his account in the disastrous antecustrin or flight epoch one of the princes first acts when he got pardoned after custrin was to beg for the pardon of this keyserling and now he has him here and is very fond of him a courlander of good family this keyserling of good gifts toowhich it was once thought would be practically sublime for he carried off all manner of college prizes and was the admirablecrichton of konigsberg university and the graduates there but in the end they proved to be gifts of the vocal sort rather and have led only to what we see a man i should guess rather of buoyant vivacity than of depth or strength in intellect or otherwise excessively buoyant ingenious full of wit kindly exuberance a loyalhearted gaytempered man and much a favorite in society as well as with the prince if we were to dwell on reinsberg keyserling would come prominently forward  major van stille ultimately majorgeneral von stille i should also mention near twenty years older than the prince a wise thoughtful soldier went by permission to the siege of dantzig lately to improve himself a man capable of rugged service when the time comes his military writings were once in considerable esteem with professional men and still impress a lay reader with favorable notions towards stille as a man of real worth and sense campagnes du roi de prussea posthumous book anterior to the sevenyears war     of monsieur jordan and the literary set  there is of course a chaplain in the establishment a reverend m deschamps who preaches to them allin french no doubt friedrich never hears deschamps friedrich is always over at ruppin on sundays and there himself reads a sermon to the garrison as part of the days duties reads finely in a melodious feeling manner says formey who can judge even in his old days he would incidentally when some emeritus parson like formey chanced to be with him roll out choice passages from bossuet from massillon in a voice and with a look which would have been perfection in the pulpit thinks formey souvenirs dun citoyen 2de edition paris 1797 i 37  m jordan though he was called lecteur reader did not read to him i can perceive but took charge of the books busied himself honestly to be useful in all manner of literary or quasiliterary ways he was as his name indicates from the frenchrefugee department a recent acquisition much valued at reinsberg as he makes a figure afterwards we had better mark him a little  jordans parents were wealthy religious persons in trade at berlin this jordan charles etienne age now thirtysix was their eldest son it seems they had destined him from birth consulting their own pious feelings merely to be a preacher of the gospel the other sons all of them reckoned clever too were brought up to secular employments and preach he this poor charles etienne accordingly did what best gospel he had in an honest manner all saythough never with other than a kind of reluctance on the part of nature forced out of her course he had wedded been clergyman in two successive country places when his wife died leaving him one little daughter and a heart much overset by that event friends wealthy brothers probably had pushed him out into the free air in these circumstances take a tour holland england feel the winds blowing see the sun shining as in times past it will do you good  jordan in the course of his tour came to composure on several points he found that by frugality by wise management of some peculium already his his little daughter and he might have quietness at berlin and the necessary food and raimentand on the whole that he would altogether cease preaching and settle down there among his books in a frugal manner which he didand was living so when the prince searching for that kind of person got tidings of him and here he is at reinsberg bustling about in a brisk modestly frank and cheerful manner well liked by everybody by his master very well and ever better who grew into real regard esteem and even friendship for him and has much correspondence of a freer kind than is common to him with little jordan so long as they lived together jordans death ten years hence was probably the one considerable pain he had ever given his neighbors in this the ultimate section of his life  i find him described at reinsberg as a small nimble figure of southernfrench aspect black uncommonly bright eyes and a general aspect of adroitness modesty sense sincerity good prognostics which on acquaintance with the man were pleasantly fulfilled  for the sake of these considerations i fished out from the oldbook catalogues and sea of forgetfulness some of the poor books he wrote especially a voyage litteraire histoire dun voyage litteraire fait en mdccxxxiii en france en angleterre et en hollande 2de edition a la haye 1736 journal of that first sanitary excursion or tour he took to get the clouds blown from his mind a literary voyage which awakens a kind of tragic feeling being itself dead and treating of matters which are all gone dead so many immortal writers dutch chiefly whom jordan is enabled to report as having effloresced or being soon to effloresce in such and such forms of books important to be learned leafy blossomy forest of literature waving glorious in the then sunlight to jordanand it lies all now to jordan and us not withered only but abolished compressed into a film of indiscriminate peat consider what that peat is made of o celebrated or uncelebrated reader and take a moral from jordans book other merit except indeed clearness and commendable brevity the voyage litteraire or other little books of jordans have not now a few of his letters to friedrich which exist are the only writings with the least life left in them and this an accidental life not momentous to him or us dryasdust informs me abbe jordan alone of the crownprinces cavaliers sleeps in the town of reinsberg not in the schloss and if i ask whythere is no answer probably his poor little daughterkin was beside him there  we have to say of friedrichs associates that generally they were of intelligent type each of them master of something or other and capable of rational discourse upon that at least integrity loyalty of character was indispensable good humor wit if it could be had were much in request there was no man of shining distinction there but they were the best that could be had and that is saying all friedrich cannot be said either as prince or as king to have been superlatively successful in his choice of associates with one single exception to be noticed shortly there is not one of them whom we should now remember except for friedrichs sakeuniformly they are men whom it is now a weariness to hear of except in a cursory manner one man of shining parts he had and one only no man ever of really high and great mind the latter sort are not so easy to get rarely producible on the soil of this earth nor is it certain how friedrich might have managed with one of this sort or he with friedrichthough friedrich unquestionably would have tried had the chance offered for he loved intellect as few men on the throne or off it ever did and the little he could gather of it round him often seems to me a fact tragical rather than otherwise  with the outer berlin social world acting and reacting friedrich has his connections which obscurely emerge on us now and then literary eminences who are generally of theological vesture any follower of philosophy especially if he be of refined manners withal or known in fashionable life is sure to attract him and gains ample recognition at reinsberg or on townvisits but the berlin theological or literary world at that time still more the berlin social like a sunk extinct object continues very dim in those old records and to say truth what features we have of it do not invite to miraculous efforts for farther acquaintance venerable beausobre with his history of the manicheans histoire critique de manichee et du manicheisme wrote also remarques c sur le nouveau testament which were once famous histoire de la reformation c c he is beausobre senior there were two sons one of them born in second wedlock after papa was 70 who were likewise given to writingsee formey souvenirs dun citoyen since in toland and the republican queens time as a light of the world he is now fourscore grown white as snow very serene polite with a smack of french noblesse in him perhaps a smack of affectation traceable too the crownprince on one of his berlin visits wished to see this beausobre got a meeting appointed in somebodys rooms in the french college and waited for the venerable man venerable man entered loftily serene as a martyr preacher of the word something of an ancient seigneur de beausobre in him too for the rest soft as sunset and really with fine radiances in a somewhat twisted state in that good old mind of his what have you been reading lately m de beausobre said the prince to begin conversation ah monseigneur i have just risen from reading the sublimest piece of writing that existsand what the exordium of st johns gospel in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was which somewhat took the prince by surprise as formey reports though he rallied straightway and got good conversation out of the old gentleman to whom we perceive he writes once or twice oeuvres de frederic 121126 dates are all of 1737 the last of beausobres yearsa copy of his own verses to correct on one occasionand is very respectful and considerate  formey tells us of another french sage personally known to the prince since boyhood for he used to be about the palace doing something this is one la croze professor of i think philosophy in the french college sublime monster of erudition at that time forgotten now i fear by everybody swagbellied short of wind liable to rages to utterances of a coarse nature a decidedly ugly monstrous and rather stupid kind of man knew twenty languages in a coarse inexact way attempted deep kinds of discourse in the lectureroom and elsewhere but usually broke off into endless welters of anecdote not always of cleanly nature and after every two or three words a desperate sigh not for sorrow but on account of flabbiness and fat formey gives a portraiture of him not worth copying farther the same formey standing one day somewhere on the streets of berlin was himself he cannot doubt seen by the crownprince in passing who asked m jordan who that was and got answeris not that a comfortable fact nothing farther came of itrespectable exparson formey though ever ready with his pen being indeed of very vapid nature not wanted at reinsberg as we can guess  there is m achard too another preacher supreme of his sort in the then berlin circles to whom or from whom a letter or two exist letters worthless if it were not for one dim indication that on inquiry the crownprince had been consulting this supreme achard on the difficulties of orthodoxy oeuvres de frederic xvi pp 112117 date marchjune 1736 and had given him texts or a text to preach from supreme achard did not abolish the difficulties for his inquiring princewho complains respectfully that his faith is weak and leaves us dark as to particulars this achard passage is almost the only hint we have of what might have been an important chapter friedrichs religious history at reinsberg the expression weak faith i take to be meant not in mockery but in ingenuous regret and solicitude much painful fermentation probably on the religious question in those reinsberg years but the old gnadenwahl business the freegrace controversy had taught him to be cautious as to what he uttered on those points the fermentation therefore had to go on under cover what the result of it was is notorious enough though the steps of the process are not in any point known  enough now of such details outwardly or inwardly there is no history or almost none to be had of this reinsberg period the extensive records of it consisting as usual mainly of chaotic nugatory matter opaque to the mind of readers there is copious correspondence of the crownprince with at least dates to it for most part but this which should be the main resource proves likewise a poor one the crownprinces letters now or afterwards being almost never of a deep or intimate quality and seldom turning on events or facts at all and then not always on facts interesting on facts clearly apprehensible to us in that extinct element  the thing we know always is there but vision of the thing is only to be had faintly intermittently dim inane twilight with here and there a transient spark falling somewhither in ityou do at last by desperate persistence get to discern outlines featuresthe thing cannot always have been nothing you reflect outlines featuresand perhaps after all those are mostly what the reader wants on this occasion     chapter ii  of voltaire and the literary correspondences  one of friedrichs grand purposes at reinsberg to himself privately the grandest there which he follows with constant loyalty and ardor is that of scaling the heights of the muses hill withal of attaining mastership discipleship in art and philosophyor in candor let us call it what it truly was that of enlightening and fortifying himself with clear knowledge clear belief on all sides and acquiring some spiritual panoply in which to front the coming practicalities of life this he feels well will be a noble use of his seclusion in those still places and it must be owned he struggles and endeavors towards this with great perseverance by all the methods in his power here or wherever afterwards he might be  here at reinsberg one of his readiest methods his pleasantest if not his usefulest is that of getting into correspondence with the chief spirits of his time which accordingly he forthwith sets about after getting into reinsberg and continues as we shall see with much assiduity rollin fontenelle and other french lights of the then firmamenthis letters to them exist and could be given in some quantity but it is better not they are intrinsically the common letters on such occasions o sublime demigod of literature how small are princely distinctions to such a glory as thine thou who enterest within the veil of the temple and issuest with thy face shiningto which the response is hm think you so most happy gracious illustrious prince with every convenience round you and such prospects ahead well thank you at any rateand as the irish say more power to your honors glory this really is nearly all that said sets of letters contain and except perhaps the voltaire set none of them give symptoms of much capacity to contain more  certainly there was no want of literary men discernible from reinsberg at that time and the young prince corresponds with a good many of them temporal potentate saluting spiritual from the distancein a way highly interesting to the then parties but now without interest except of the reflex kind to any creature a very cold and empty portion this of the friedrich correspondence standing there to testify what his admiration was for literary talent or the great reputation of such but in itself uninstructive utterly and of freezing influence on the now living mind most of those french lights of the then firmament are gone out forgotten altogether or recognized like rollin and others for polished dullards university bigwigs and longwinded commonplace persons deserving nothing but oblivion to montesquieunot yet called baron de montesquieu with esprit des lois but m de secondat with anonymous lettres persanes and already known to the world for a person of sharp audacious eyesightit does not appear that friedrich addressed any letter now or afterwards no notice of montesquieu nor of some others the absence of whom is a little unexpected probably it was want of knowledge mainly for his appetite was not fastidious at this time and certainly he did hit the centre of the mark and get into the very kernel of french literature when in 1736 hardly yet established in his new quarters he addressed himself to the shining figure known to us as arouet junior long since and now called m de voltaire which latter is still a name notable in friedrichs history and that of mankind friedrichs first letter challenging voltaire to correspondence dates itself 8th august 1736 and voltaires answerthe reinsberg household still only in its second monthwas probably the brightest event which had yet befallen there  on various accounts it will behoove us to look a good deal more strictly into this voltaire and as his relations to friedrich and to the world are so multiplex endeavor to disengage the real likeness of the man from the circumambient noise and confusion which in his instance continue very great voltaire was the spiritual complement of friedrich says sauerteig once what little of lasting their poor century produced lies mainly in these two a very somnambulating century but what little it did we must call friedrich what little it thought voltaire other fruit we have not from it to speak of at this day voltaire and what can be faithfully done on the voltaire creed realized voltairismadmit it reader not in a too triumphant humoris not that pretty much the net historical product of the eighteenth century the rest of its history either pure somnambulism or a mere controversy to the effect realized voltairism how soon shall it be realized then not at once surely so that friedrich and voltaire are related not by accident only they are they for want of better the two original men of their century the chief and in a sense the sole products of their century they alone remain to us as still living results from itsuch as they are and the rest truly ought to depart and vanish as they are now doing being mere ephemera contemporary eaters scramblers for provender talkers of acceptable hearsay and related merely to the butteries and wiggeries of their time and not related to the perennialities at all as these two werewith more of the like sort from sauerteig  m de voltaire who used to be m francoismarie arouet was at this time about forty born 20th february 1694 the younger of two sons father francois arouet a notary of the chatelet ultimately treasurer of the chamber of accounts mother marguerite daumart of a noble family of poitou and had gone through various fortunes a man now and henceforth in a high degree conspicuous and questionable to his fellowcreatures clear knowledge of him ought at this stage to be common but unexpectedly it is not what endless writing and biographying there has been about this man in which one still reads with a kind of lazy satisfaction due to the subject and to the french genius in that department but the man himself and his environment and practical aspects what the actual physiognomy of his life and of him can have been is dark from beginning to ending and much is left in an ambiguous undecipherable condition to us a proper history of voltaire in which should be discoverable luminous to human creatures what he was what element he lived in what work he did this is still a problem for the genius of france  his fathers name is known to us the name of his fathers profession too but not clearly the nature of it still less his fathers character economic circumstances physiognomy spiritual or social not the least possibility granted you of forming an image however faint of that notable man and household which distinguished itself to all the earth by producing little francois into the light of this sun of madame arouet who or what or how she was nothing whatever is known a human reader pestered continually with the madamedenises abbemignots and enigmatic nieces and nephews would have wished to know at least what children besides francois madame arouet had once for all how many children name them with year of birth year of death according to the churchregisters they all at any rate had that degree of history no even that has not been done beneficent correspondents of my own make answer after some research no register of the arouets anywhere to be had the very name voltaire if you ask whence came it there is no answer or worse than nonethe fit history of this man which might be one of the shining epics of his century and the lucid summary and soul of any history france then had but which would require almost a french demigod to do it is still a great way off if on the road at all for present purposes we select what follows from a wellknown hand  youth of voltaire 16941725french biographers have left the arouet household very dark for us meanwhile we can perceive or guess that it was moderately well in economic respects that francois was the second of the two sons and that old arouet a steady practical and perhaps rather sharptempered old gentleman of official legal habits and position notary of the chatelet and something else had destined him for the law profession as was natural enough to a son of m arouet who had himself succeeded well in law and could there best of all open roads for a clever second son francois accordingly sat in chambers as we call it and his fellowclerks much loved himthe most amusing fellow in the world sat in chambers even became an advocate but did not in the least take to advocateshiptook to poetry and other airy dangerous courses speculative practical causing family explosions and rebukes which were without effect on him a young fool bent on sportful pursuits instead of serious more and more shuddering at law to the surprise and indignation of m arouet senior law with its wigs and sheepskins pointing towards high honors and deep fleshpots had no charms for the young fool he could not be made to like law  whereupon arose explosions as we hint family explosions on the part of m arouet senior such that friends had to interfere and it was uncertain what would come of it one judicious friend m caumartin took the young fellow home to his house in the country for a timeand there incidentally brought him acquainted with old gentlemen deep in the traditions of henri quatre and the cognate topics which much inflamed the young fellow and produced big schemes in the head of him  m arouet senior stood strong for law but it was becoming daily more impossible madrigals dramas not without actresses satirical wit airy verse and all manner of adventurous speculation were what this young man went upon and was getting more and more loved for introduced even to the superior circles and recognized there as one of the brightest young fellows ever seen which tended of course to confirm him in his folly and open other outlooks and harbors of refuge than the paternal one  such things strange to m arouet senior were in vogue then wicked regent dorleans having succeeded sublime louis xiv and set strange fashions to the quality not likely to profit this fool francois thought m arouet senior and was much confirmed in his notion when a rhymed lampoon against the government having come out les jai vu as they call it i have seen jai vu this ignominy occur i have seen that otherto the amount of a dozen or twoand am not yet twenty copy of it and guess as to authorship in oeuvres de voltaire i 321 and become the rage as a clever thing of the kind will it was imputed to the brightest young fellow in france m arouets son who in fact was not the author but was not believed on his denial and saw himself in spite of his high connections ruthlessly lodged in the bastille in consequence let him sit thought m arouet senior and come to his senses there he sat for eighteen months age still little above twenty but privately employed his time not in repentance or in serious legal studies but in writing a poem on his henri quatre epic poem no less la ligue as he then called it which it was his hope the whole world would one day fall in love withas it did nay in two years more he had done a play oedipe the renowned name of it which ran for fortyeight nights 18th november 1718 the first of them and was enough to turn any head of such age law may be considered hopeless even by m arouet senior  try him in the diplomatic line break these bad habits and connections thought m arouet at one time and sent him to the french ambassador in hollandon good behavior as it were and by way of temporary banishment but neither did this answer on the contrary the young fellow got into scrapes again got into amatory intriguesyoung lady visiting you in mens clothes young ladys mother inveigling and i know not whatso that the ambassador was glad to send him home again unmarried marked as it were glass with care and the young ladys mother printed his letters not the least worth readingand the old m arouet seems now to have flung up his head to have settled some small allowance on him with peremptory no hope of more and said go your own way then foolish junior the elder shall be my son m arouet disappears at this point or nearly so from the history of his son francois and i think must have died in not many years poor old m arouet closed his old eyes without the least conception what a prodigious evermemorable thing he had done unknowingly in sending this francois into the world to kindle such universal dry dungheap of a rotten world and set it blazing francois his fathers synonym came to be representative of the family after all the elder brother also having died before long except certain confused nieceandnephew personages progeny of the sisters francois has no more trouble or solacement from the paternal household francois meanwhile is his fathers synonym and signs arouet junior francois aroue l j le jeune  all of us princes then or poets said he one night at supper looking to right and left the brightest fellow in the world well fit to be phoebus apollo of such circles and great things now ahead of him dissolute regent dorleans politest most debauched of men and very witty holds the helm near him dubois the devils cardinal and so many bright spirits all the luciferous spiritualism there is in france is lifting anchor under these auspices joyfully towards new latitudes and isles of the blest what may not francois hope to become hmph answers m arouet senior steadily so long as he lives here are one or two subsequent phases epochs or turningpoints of the young gentlemans career  phasis first 17251728the accomplished duc de sulli year 1725 day not recorded is giving in his hotel a dinner such as usual and a bright witty company is assembledthe brightest young fellow in france sure to be there and with his electric coruscations illuminating everything and keeping the table in a roar to the delight of most not to that of a certain splenetic illgiven duc de rohan grandee of high rank great haughtiness and very illbehavior in the world who feels impatient at the notice taken of a mere civic individual arouet junior  quel est done ce jeune homme qui parle si haut who is this young man that talks so loud then exclaims the proud splenetic duke monseigneur flashes the young man back upon him in an electric manner it is one who does not drag a big name about with him but who secures respect for the name he has figure that in the penetrating grandly clangorous voice voix sombre et majestueuse and the momentary flash of eyes that attended it duc de rohan rose in a sulphurous frame of mind and went his ways what date you ask the idle french biographer in vainsee only after more and more inspection that the incident is true and with labor date it summer of the year 1725 treaty of utrecht itself though all the newspapers and own correspondents were so interested in it was perhaps but a foolish matter to date in comparison  about a week after m arouet junior was again dining with the duc de sulli and a fine company as before a servant whispers him that somebody has called and wants him below cannot come answers arouet how can i so engaged servant returns after a minute or two pardon monsieur i am to say it is to do an act of beneficence that you are wanted below arouet lays down his knife and fork descends instantly to see what act it is a carriage is in the court and hackneycoach near it would monsieur have the extreme goodness to come to the door of the carriage in a case of necessity at the door of the carriage hands seize the collar of him hold him as in a vice diabolic visage of duc de rohan is visible inside who utters looking to the hackneycoach some voila now then whereupon the hackneycoach opens gives out three porters or hired bullies with the due implements scandalous actuality of horsewhipping descends on the back of poor arouet who shrieks and execrates to no purpose nobody being near that will do says rohan at last and the gallant ducal party drive off young arouet with torn frills and deranged hair rushing up stairs again in such a mood as is easy to fancy everybody is sorry inconsolable everybody shocked nobody volunteers to help in avenging monseigneur de sulli is not such atrocity done to one of your guests an insult to yourself asks arouet well yes perhaps butmonseigneur de sulli shrugs his shoulders and proposes nothing arouet withdrew of course in a most blazing condition to consider what he could on his own strength do in this conjuncture  his biographer duvernet says he decided on doing two things learning english and the smallsword exercise la vie de voltaire par ma geneve 1786 pp 5557 or pp 6063 in his second form of the book the m is an abbe duvernet of no great mark otherwise he got into revolution trouble afterwards but escaped with his head and republished his book swollen out somewhat by new anecdotes and republican bluster in this second instance signing himself t j d vparis 1797 a vague but not dark or mendacious little book with traces of real eyesight in itby one who had personally known voltaire or at least seen and heard him he retired to the country for six months and perfected himself in these two branches being perfect he challenged duc de rohan in the proper manner applying ingenious compulsives withal to secure acceptance of the challenge rohan accepted not without some difficulty and compulsion at the theatre or otherwiseaccepted but withal confessed to his wife the result was no measuring of swords took place and rohan only blighted by public opinion or incapable of farther blight that way went at large a convenient lettre de cachet having put arouet again in the bastille where for six months arouet lodged a second time the innocent not the guilty making we can well suppose innumerable reflections on the phenomena of human life imprisonment once over he hastily quitted for england shaking the dust of ungrateful france off his feetresolved to change his unhappy name for one thing  smelfungus denouncing the torpid fatuity of voltaires biographers says he never met with one frenchman even of the literary classes who could tell him whence this name voltaire originated a petite terre small family estate they said and sent him hunting through topographies far and wide to no purpose others answered volterra in italy some connection with volterraand seemed even to know that this was but fatuity in evertalking everprinting paris is it as in timbuctoo then which neither prints nor has anything to print exclaims poor smelfungus he tells us at last the name voltaire is a mere anagram of arouet l jyou try it arouetljvoltaire and perceive at once with obligations to smelfungus that he has settled this small matter for you and that you can be silent upon it forever thenceforth  the anagram voltaire gloomily settled in the bastille in this manner can be reckoned a very famous widesounding outer result of the rohan impertinence and blackguardism but it is not worth naming beside the inner intrinsic result of banishing voltaire to england at this point of his course england was full of constitutionality and freethinking tolands collinses wollastons bolingbrokes still living very free indeed england one is astonished to see has its royalrepublican ways of doing something roman in it from peerage down to plebs strange and curious to the eye of m de voltaire sciences flourishing newton still alive white with fourscore years the venerable hoary man lockes gospel of common sense in full vogue or even done into verse by incomparable mr pope for the cultivated upper classes in science in religion in politics what a surprising liberty allowed or taken never was a freer turn of thinking and what to m de voltaire is a pleasant feature it is freethinking with ruffles to its shirt and rings on its fingersnever yet the least dreaming of the shirtless or sansculottic state that lies ahead for it that is the palmy condition of english liberty when m de voltaire arrives there  in a man just out of the bastille on those terms there is a mind driven by hard suffering into seriousness and provoked by indignant comparisons and remembrances as if you had elaborately ploughed and pulverized the mind of this voltaire to receive with its utmost avidity and strength of fertility whatever seed england may have for it that was a notable conjuncture of a man with circumstances the question is this man to grow up a court poet to do legitimate dramas lampoons witty verses and wild spiritual and practical magnificences the like never seen princes and princesses recognizing him as plainly divine and keeping him tied by enchantments to that poor trade as his task in life is answered in the negative no and it is not quite to decorate and comfort your dry dungheap of a world or the fortunate cocks that scratch on it that the man voltaire is here but to shoot lightnings into it and set it ablaze one day that was an important alternative truly of worldimportance to the poor generations that now are and it was settled in good part by this voyage to england as one may surmise such is sometimes the use of a dissolute rohan in this world for the gods make implements of all manner of things  m de voltaire for we now drop the arouet altogether and never hear of it more came to englandwhen quitted englandwhen sorrow on all fatuous biographers who spend their time not in laying permanent foundationstones but in fencing with the windi at last find indisputably it was in 1726 that he came to england got out of the bastille with orders to leave france 29th april of that year oeuvres de voltaire i 40 n and he himself tells us that he 1728 spent therefore some two years there in alllast year of george is reign and first of george iis but mere inanity and darkness visible reign in all his biographies over this period of his life which was above all others worth investigating seek not to know it no man has inquired into it probably no competent man now ever will by hints in certain letters of the period we learn that he lodged or at one time lodged in maiden lane covent garden one of those old houses that yet stand in maiden lane for which small fact let us be thankful his own letters of the period are dated now and then from wandsworth allusions there are to bolingbroke but the wandsworth is not bolingbrokes mansion which stood in battersea the wandsworth was one edward fawkeners a man somewhat admirable to young voltaire but extinct now or nearly so in human memory he had been a turkey merchant it would seem and nevertheless was admitted to speak his word in intellectual even in political circles which was wonderful to young voltaire this fawkener i think became sir edward fawkener and some kind of secretary to the duke of cumberlandi judge it to be the same fawkener a man highly unmemorable now were it not for the young frenchman he was hospitable to fawkeners and bolingbrokes are perhaps the only names that turn up in voltaires letters of this english period over which generally there reigns in the french biographies inane darkness with an intimation half involuntary that it should have been made luminous and would if perfectly easy  we know from other sources that he had acquaintance with many men in england with all manner of important men notes to pope in voltaireenglish visit of voltaire to congreve notes even to such as lady sundon in the interior of the palace are known of the brightest young fellow in the world did not want for introductions to the highest quarters in that time of political alliance and extensive private acquaintance between his country and ours and all this he was the man to improve both in the trivial and the deep sense his bow to the divine princess caroline and suite could it fail in graceful reverence or what else was needed dexterous right words in the right places winged with esprit so called that was the mans supreme talent in which he had no match to the last a most brilliant swift farglancing young man disposed to make himself generally agreeable for the rest his wonder we can see was kept awake wonder readily inclining in his circumstances towards admiration the stereotype figure of the englishman always the same which turns up in voltaires works is worth noting in this respect a rugged surly kind of fellow muchenduring not intrinsically bad splenetic without complaint standing oddly inexpugnable in that natural stoicism of his taciturn yet with strange flashes of speech in him now and then something which goes beyond laughter and articulate logic and is the taciturn elixir of these two what they call humor in their dialect this is pretty much the reverse of voltaires own self and therefore all the welcomer to him delineated always with a kind of mockery but with evident love what excellences are in england thought voltaire no bastille in it for one thing newtons philosophy annihilated the vortexes of descartes for him lockes toleration is very grand especially if all is uncertain and you are in the minority then collins wollaston and companyno vile jesuits here strong in their mendacious malodorous stupidity despicablest yet most dangerous of creatures to check freedom of thought illustrious mr pope of the essay on man surely he is admirable as are pericles bolingbroke and many others even bolingbrokes highlacquered brass is gold to this young french friend of histhrough all which admirations and exaggerations the progress of the young man toward certain very serious attainments and achievements is conceivable enough  one other man who ought to be mentioned in the biographies i find voltaire to have made acquaintance with in england a german m fabrice one of several brothers called fabrice or fabriciusconcerning whom how he had been at bender and how voltaire picked charles douse from the memory of him there was already mention the same fabrice who held poor george i in his arms while they drove galloping to osnabriick that night in extremisnot needing mention again the following is more to the point  voltaire among his multifarious studies while in england did not forget that of economics his poem la liguesurreptitiously printed three years since under that title one desfontaines a hungry exjesuit the perpetrator 1723 vie par t j d v that is m in the second form p 59he now took in hand for his own benefit washed it clean of its blots christened it henriade under which name it is still known over all the worldand printed it published it here by subscription in 1726 one of the first things he undertook very splendid subscription headed by princess caroline and much favored by the opulent of quality which yielded an unknown but very considerable sum of thousands sterling and grounded not only the worldrenown but the domestic finance of m de voltaire for the fame of the new epic as this henriade was called soon spread into all lands and such fame and other agencies on his behalf having opened the way home for voltaire he took this sum of thousands sterling along with him laid it out judiciously in some city lottery or profitable scrip then going at paris which at once doubled the amount after which he invested it in corntrade army clothing barbarytrade commissariat bacontrade all manner of wellchosen tradesbeing one of the shrewdest financiers on recordand never from that day wanted abundance of money for one thing which he judged to be extremely expedient for a literary man especially in times of jesuit and other tribulation you have only to watch he would say what scrips public loans investments in the field of agio are offered if you exert any judgment it is easy to gain there do not the stupidest of mortals gain there by intensely attending to it  voltaire got almost nothing by his books which he generally had to disavow and denounce as surreptitious supposititious scandals when some sharpset bookseller in whose way he had laid the savory article as bait chose to risk his ears for the profit of snatching and publishing it next to nothing by his books but by his fine financetalent otherwise he had become possessed of ample moneys which were so cunningly disposed too that he had resources in every country and no conceivable combination of confiscating jesuits and dark fanatic official persons could throw him out of a livelihood whithersoever he might be forced to run a man that looks facts in the face which is creditable of him the vulgar call it avarice and the like as their way is but m de voltaire is convinced that effects will follow causes and that it well beseems a lonely ishmaelite hunting his way through the howling wildernesses and confused ravenous populations of this world to have money in his pocket he died with a revenue of some 7000 pounds a year probably as good as 20000 pounds at present the richest literary man ever heard of hitherto as well as the remarkablest in some other respects but we have to mark the second phasis of his life in which friedrich now sees him and how it grew out of this first one  phasis second 17281733returning home as if quietly triumphant with such a talent in him and such a sanction put upon it and him by a neighboring nation and by all the world voltaire was warmly received in his old aristocratic circles by cultivated france generally and now in 1728 in his thirtysecond year might begin to have definite outlooks of a sufficiently royal kind in literature and otherwise nor is he slow far from it to advance to conquer and enjoy he writes successful literature falls in love with women of quality encourages the indigent and humble eclipses and in case of need tramples down the too proud he elegizes poor adrienne lecouvreur the actressour poor friend the comte de saxes female friend who loyally emptied out her whole purse for him 30000 pounds in one sum that he might try for courland and whether he could fall in love with her of the swollen cheek there which proved impossible elegizes adrienne slightly and even buries her under cloud of night ready to protect unfortunate females of merit especially theatrical females having much to do in the theatre which we perceive to be the pulpit or real preachingplace of cultivated france in those years all manner of verse all manner of prose he dashes off with surprising speed and grace showers of light spray for the moment and always some current of graver enterprise siecle de louis quatorze or the like going on beneath it for he is a most diligent swift unresting man and studies and learns amazingly in such a rackety existence victorious enough in some senses defeat in literature never visited him his plays coming thick on the heels of one another rapid brilliant pieces are brilliantly received by the unofficial world and ought to dethrone dull crebillon and the sleepy potentates of poetry that now are which in fact is their result with the public but not yet in the highest courtly placesa defect much to be condemned and lamented  numerous enemies arise as is natural of an envious venomous description this is another everwidening shadow in the sunshine in fact we perceive he has besides the inner obstacles and griefs two classes of outward ones there are lions on his path and also dogs lions are the exbishop of mirepoix and certain other dark holy fathers or potent orthodox official persons these though voltaire does not yet declare his heterodoxy which indeed is but the orthodoxy of the cultivated private circles perceive well enough even by the henriade and its talk of tolerance horror of fanaticism and the like what this ones doxy is and how dangerous he not a mere mute man of quality but a talking spirit with winged words may beand they much annoy and terrify him by their roaring in the distance which roaring cannot of course convince and since it is not permitted to kill can only provoke a talking spirit into still deeper strains of heterodoxy for his own private behoof these are the lions on his path beasts conscious to themselves of good intentions but manifesting from voltaires point of view it must be owned a physiognomy unlovely to a degree light is superior to darkness i should think meditates voltaire power of thought to the want of power the ane de mirepoix ass of mirepoix poor joke of voltaires continually applied to this bishop or exbishopwho was thought generally a rather tenebrific man for appointment to the feuille des benefices charge of nominating bishops keeping kings conscience c and who in that capacity signed himself anc by no means ane but ancien whilom de mirepoixto the enragement of voltaire often enough pretending to use me in this manner is it other in the court of rhadamanthus than transcendent stupidity with transcendent insolence superadded voltaire grows more and more heterodox and is ripening towards dangerous utterances though he strives to hold in  the dogs upon his path again are all the disloyal envious persons of the writing class whom his success has offended and more generally all the dishonest hungry persons who can gain a morsel by biting him and their name is legion it must be owned about as ugly a doggery infame canaille he might well reckon them as has before or since infested the path of a man they are not hired and set on as angry suspicion might suggest but they are covertly somewhat patronized by the mirepoix or orthodox official class scandalous exjesuit desfontaines thersites freronthese are but types of an endless doggery whose names and works should be blotted out whose one claim to memory is that the riding man so often angrily sprang down and tried horsewhipping them into silence a vain attempt the individual hound flies howling abjectly petitioning and promising but the rest bark all with new comfort and even he starts again straightway it is bad travelling in those woods with such lions and such dogs and then the sparsely scattered human creatures so we may call them in contrast persons of quality for most part are not always what they should be the grand mansions you arrive at in this wastehowling solitude prove sometimes essentially robbertowersand there may be armida palaces and divinelooking armidas where your ultimate fate is still worse  que le monde est rempli denchanteurs je ne dis rien denchanteresses  to think of it the solitary ishmaelite journeying never so well mounted through such a wilderness with lions dogs human robbers and armidas all about him himself lonely friendless under the starsone could pity him withal though that is not the feeling he solicits nor gets hitherto even at this impartial distance  one of the beautiful creatures of qualitywe hope not an armidawho came athwart voltaire in these times was a madame du chatelet distinguished from all the others by a love of mathematics and the pure sciences were it nothing else she was still young under thirty the literary man still under forty with her husband to whom she had brought a child or couple of children there was no formal quarrel but they were living apart neither much heeding the other as was by no means a case without example at that time monsieur soldiering and philandering about in garrison or elsewhere madame in a like humor doing the best for herself in the high circles of society to which he and she belonged most wearisome barren circles to a person of thought as both she and m de voltaire emphatically admitted to one another on first making acquaintance but is there no help  madame had tried the pure sciences and philosophies in books but how much more charming when they come to you as a human philosopher handsome magnanimous and the wittiest man in the world young madame was not regularly beautiful but she was very piquant radiant adventurous understood other things than the pure sciences and could be abundantly coquettish and engaging i have known her scuttle off on an evening with a couple of adventurous young wives of quality to the remote lodging of the witty m de voltaire and make his dim evening radiant to him one of voltaires letters then again in public crowds i have seen them obliged to dismount to the peril of madames diamonds there being a jam of carriages and no getting forward for half the day in short they are becoming more and more intimate to the extremest degree and scorning the world thank heaven that they are mutually indispensable cannot we get away from this scurvy waspsnest of a paris thought they and live to ourselves and our books  madame was of high quality one of the breteuils but was poor in comparison and her husband the like an old chateau of theirs named cirey stands in a pleasant enough little valley in champagne but so dilapidated gaunt and vacant nobody can live in it voltaire who is by this time a man of ample moneys furnishes the requisite cash madame and he in sweet symphony concert the plans cirey is repaired at least parts of it are into a boudoir of the gods regardless of expense nothing ever seen so tasteful so magnificent and the two withdraw thither to study in peace what sciences pure and other they have a mind to they are recognized as lovers by the parisian public with little audible censure from anybody therewith none at all from the easy husband who occasionally even visits cirey if he be passing that way and is content to take matters as he finds them without looking below the surface see whosoever is curious madame

illicitidyllic form of life has been the form of voltaires since 1733for some three years now when friedrich and we first make acquaintance with him it lasted above a dozen years more an illicit marriage after its sort and subject only to the liabilities of such perhaps we may look in upon the cirey household ourselves at some future time andthis editor hopes not  madame admits that for the first ten years it was on the whole sublime a perfect eden on earth though stormy now and then lettres inedites de madame la marquise du chastelet auxquelles on a joint une dissertation c of hers paris 1806 after ten years it began to grow decidedly dimmer and in the course of few years more it became undeniably evident that m de voltaire did not love me as formerlyin fact if madame could have seen it m de voltaire was growing old losing his teeth and the like and did not care for anything as formerly which was a dreadful discovery and gave rise to results by and by  in this retreat at cirey varied with flying visits to paris and kept awake by multifarious correspondences the quantity of literature done by the two was great and miscellaneous by madame chiefly in the region of the pure sciences in newtonian dissertations competitions for prizes and the like really sound and ingenious pieces entirely forgotten long since by voltaire in serious tragedies histories in light sketches and deep dissertationsmockery getting ever wilder with him the satirical vein in prose and verse amazingly copious and growing more and more heterodox as we can perceive his troubles from the ecclesiastical or lion kind in the literary forest still more from the rabid doggery in it are manifold incessant and it is pleasantly notableduring these first ten yearswith what desperate intensity vigilance and fierceness madame watches over all his interests and liabilities and casualties great and small leaping with her whole force into m de voltaires scale of the balance careless of antecedences and consequences alike flying with the spirit of an angry broodhen at the face of mastiffs in defence of any feather that is m de voltaires to which voltaire replies as he well may with eloquent gratitude with verses to the divine emilie with gifts to her verses and gifts the prettiest in the worldand industriously celebrates the divine emilie to herself and all third parties  an ardent aerial gracefully predominant and in the end somewhat termagant female figure this divine emilie her temper radiant rather than bland was none of the patientest on occasion nor was m de voltaire the least of a job if you came athwart him the wrong way i have heard their domestic symphony was liable to furious flawslet us hope at great distances apartthat plates in presence of the lackeys actual crockery or metal have been known to fly from end to end of the dinnertable nay they mention knives though only in the way of oratorical action and voltaire has been heard to exclaim the sombre and majestic voice of him risen to a very high pitch ne me regardez tant de ces yeux hagards et louches dont fix those haggard sidelong eyes on me in that waymere shrillness of pale rage presiding over the scene but we hope it was only once in the quarter or seldomer after which the element would be clearer for some time a lonesome literary man who has got a brood phoenix to preside over him and fly at the face of gods and men for him in that manner ought to be grateful  perhaps we shall one day glance personally as it were into cirey with our readersnot with this editor or hisit will turn out beyond the readers expectation tolerable illicit restingplace so far as the illicit can be tolerable for a lonesome man of letters who goes into the illicit helpfulness affection or the flattering image of such are by no means wanting squalls of infirm temper are not more frequent than in the most licit establishments of a similar sort madame about this time has a swift palfrey

china tiles gilt sculptures marble slabs and the supreme of taste and expense study fit for the phoebus apollo of france so far as madame could contrive it takes coffee with madame in the gallery about noon and his bedroom i expressly discern letters of voltaire looks out upon a running brook the murmur of which is pleasant to one  enough enough we can perceive what kind of voltaire it was to whom the crownprince now addressed himself and how luminous an object shining afar out of the solitudes of champagne upon the ardent young man still so capable of admiration model epic henriade model history charles douze sublime tragedies cisar alzire and others which readers still know though with less enthusiasm are blooming fresh in friedrichs memory and heart such literature as man never saw before and in the background friedrich has inarticulately a feeling as if in this man there were something grander than all literatures a reform of human thought itself a new gospel goodtidings or godsmessage by this manwhich friedrich does not suspect as the world with horror does to be a new baspel or devilsmessage of badtidings a sublime enough voltaire radiant enough over at cirey yonder to all lands a visible phoebus apollo climbing the eastern steeps with arrows of celestial new light in his quiver capable of stretching many a big foul python belly uppermost in its native mud and ridding the poor world of her nightmares and mudserpents in some measure we may hope  and so there begins from this point a lively correspondence between friedrich and voltaire which with some interruptions of a notable sort continued during their mutual life and is a conspicuous feature in the biographies of both the world talked much of it and still talks and has now at last got it all collected and elucidated into a dimly legible form for studious readers preuss oeuvres de frederic xxi xxii xxiii berlin 1853 who supersedes the lazy french editors in this matter it is by no means the diabolically wicked correspondence it was thought to be the reverse indeed on both sidesbut it has unfortunately become a very dull one to the actual generation of mankind not without intrinsic merit on the contrary if you read intensely and bring the extinct alive again it sparkles notably with epistolary grace and vivacity and on any terms it has still passages of biographical and other interest but the substance of it then so new and shining has fallen absolutely commonplace the property of all the world since then and is now very wearisome to the reader no doctrine or opinion in it that you have not heard with clear belief or clear disbelief a hundred times and could wish rather not to hear again the common fate of philosophical originalities in this world as a biographical document it is worth a very strict perusal if you are interested that way in either friedrich or voltaire finely significant hints and traits though often almost evanescent so slight are they abound in this correspondence frankness veracity under graceful forms being the rule of it strange to say as an illustration of two memorable characters and of their century showing on what terms the sage plato of the eighteenth century and his tyrant dionysius correspond and what their manners are to one another it may long have a kind of interest to mankind otherwise it has not much left  in friedrichs history it was no doubt an important fact that there lived a voltaire along with him twenty years his senior with another theory of the universe than the voltaire one how much other had friedrich too been but the theory called by voltaires name was not properly of voltaires creating but only of his uttering and publishing it lay ready for everybodys finding and could not well have been altogether missed by such a one as friedrich so that perhaps we exaggerate the effects of voltaire on him though undoubtedly they were considerable considerable but not derived from this express correspondence which seldom turns on didactic points at all derived rather from voltaires printed works where they lay derivable to all the world certain enough it is voltaire was at this time and continued all his days friedrichs chief thinker in the world unofficially the chief preacher prophet and priest of this working kingno better off for a spiritual trismegistus was poor friedrich in the world on the practical side friedrich soon outgrew himperhaps had already outgrown having far more veracity of character and an intellect far better built in the silent parts of it and trained too by hard experiences to know shadow from substanceoutgrew him and gradually learned to look down upon him occasionally with much contempt in regard to the practical but in all changes of humor towards voltaire friedrich we observe considers him as plainly supreme in speculative intellect and has no doubt but for thinking and speaking nature never made such another which may be taken as a notable feature of friedrichs history and gives rise to passages between voltaire and him which will make much noise in time coming  here meanwhile faithfully presented though in condensed form is the starting of the correspondence first letter of it and first response two pieces which were once bright as the summer sunrise on both sides but are now fallen very dim and have much needed condensation and abridgment by omission of the unessentialso lengthy are they so extinct and almost dreary to us sublime wolf and his philosophy how he was hunted out of halle with it long since and now shines from marburg his philosophy and he supreme among mankind this and other extinct points the readers fancy will endeavor to rekindle in some slight measure  to m de voltaire at cirey from the crownprince  berlin 8th august 1736  monsieuralthough i have not the satisfaction of knowing you personally you are not the less known to me through your works they are treasures of the mind if i may so express myself and they reveal to the reader new beauties at every fresh perusal i think i have recognized in them the character of their ingenious author who does honor to our age and to human nature if ever the dispute on the comparative merits of the moderns and the ancients should be revived the modern great men will owe it to you and to you only that the scale is turned in their favor with the excellent quality of poet you join innumerable others more or less related to it never did poet before put metaphysics into rhythmic cadence to you the honor was reserved of doing it first  this taste for philosophy manifested in your writings induces me to send you a translated copy of the accusation and defence of m wolf the most celebrated philosopher of our days who for having carried light into the darkest places of metaphysics is cruelly accused of irreligion and atheism such is the destiny of great men their superior genius exposes them to the poisoned arrows of calumny and envy i am about getting a translation made of the treatise on god the soul and the worldtranslation done by an excellency suhm as has been hintedfrom the pen of the same author i will send it you when it is finished and i am sure that the force of evidence in all his propositions and their close geometrical sequence will strike you  the kindness and assistance you afford to all who devote themselves to the arts and sciences makes me hope that you will not exclude me from the number of those whom you find worthy of your instructionsit is so i would call your intercourse by correspondence of letters which cannot be other than profitable to every thinking being   beauties without number in your works your henriade delights me the tragedy of cesar shows us sustained characters the sentiments in it are magnificent and grand and one feels that brutus is either a roman or else an englishman ou un romain ou un anglais your alzire to the graces of novelty adds  monsieur there is nothing i wish so much as to possess all your writings even those not printed hitherto pray monsieur do communicate them to me without reserve if there be amongst your manuscripts any that you wish to conceal from the eyes of the public i engage to keep them in the profoundest secrecy i am unluckily aware that the faith of princes is an object of little respect in our days nevertheless i hope you will make an exception from the general rule in my favor i should think myself richer in the possession of your works than in that of all the transient goods of fortune these the same chance grants and takes away your works one can make ones own by means of memory so that they last us whilst it lasts knowing how weak my own memory is i am in the highest degree select in what i trust to it  if poetry were what it was before your appearance a strumming of wearisome idyls insipid eclogues tuneful nothings i should renounce it forever but in your hands it becomes ennobled a melodious course of morals worthy of the admiration and the study of cultivated minds des honnetes gens youin fine you inspire the ambition to follow in your footsteps but i how often have i said to myself malheureux throw down a burden which is above thy strength one cannot imitate voltaire without being voltaire  it is in such moments that i have felt how small are those advantages of birth those vapors of grandeur with which vanity would solace us they amount to little properly to nothing pour mieux dire rien nature when she pleases forms a great soul endowed with faculties that can advance the arts and sciences and it is the part of princes to recompense his noble toils ah would glory but make use of me to crown your successes my only fear would be lest this country little fertile in laurels proved unable to furnish enough of them  if my destiny refuse me the happiness of being able to possess you may i at least hope one day to see the man whom i have admired so long now from afar and to assure you by word of mouth that i amwith all the esteem and consideration due to those who following the torch of truth for guide consecrate their labors to the publicmonsieur your affectionate friend  frederic p r of prussia  oeuvres de frederic xxi 6   by what route or conveyance this letter went i cannot say in general it is to be observed these friedrichvoltaire lettersliable perhaps to be considered contraband at both ends of their coursedo not go by the post but by frenchprussian ministers by hamburg merchants and other safe subterranean channels voltaire with enthusiasm and no doubt promptly answers within three weeks  to the crownprince at reinsberg from voltaire  cirey 26th august 1736  monseigneura man must be void of all feeling who were not infinitely moved by the letter which your royal highness has deigned to honor me with my selflove is only too much flattered by it but my love of mankind which i have always nourished in my heart and which i venture to say forms the basis of my character has given me a very much purer pleasureto see that there is now in the world a prince who thinks as a man a philosopher prince who will make men happy  permit me to say there is not a man on the earth but owes thanks for the care you take to cultivate by sound philosophy a soul that is born for command good kings there never were except those that had begun by seeking to instruct themselves by knowinggood men from bad by loving what was true by detesting persecution and superstition no prince persisting in such thoughts but might bring back the golden age into his countries and why do so few princes seek this glory you feel it monseigneur it is because they all think more of their royalty than of mankind precisely the reverse is your caseand unless one day the tumult of business and the wickedness of men alter so divine a character you will be worshipped by your people and loved by the whole world philosophers worthy of the name will flock to your states thinkers will crowd round that throne as the skilfulest artisans do to the city where their art is in request the illustrious queen christina quitted her kingdom to go in search of the arts reign you monseigneur and the arts will come to seek you  may you only never be disgusted with the sciences by the quarrels of their cultivators a race of men no better than courtiers often enough as greedy intriguing false and cruel as these and still more ridiculous in the mischief they do and how sad for mankind that the very interpreters of heavens commandments the theologians i mean are sometimes the most dangerous of all professed messengers of the divinity yet men sometimes of obscure ideas and pernicious behavior their soul blown out with mere darkness full of gall and pride in proportion as it is empty of truths every thinking being who is not of their opinion is an atheist and every king who does not favor them will be damned dangerous to the very throne and yet intrinsically insignificant best way is leave their big talk and them alone speedy collapse will follow  i cannot sufficiently thank your royal highness for the gift of that little book about monsieur wolf i respect metaphysical ideas rays of lightning they are in the midst of deep night more i think is not to be hoped from metaphysics it does not seem likely that the firstprinciples of things will ever be known the mice that nestle in some little holes of an immense building know not whether it is eternal or who the architect or why he built it such mice are we and the divine architect who built the universe has never that i know of told his secret to one of us if anybody could pretend to guess correctly it is m wolf beautiful in your royal highness to protect such a man and how beautiful it will be to send me his chief book as you have the kindness to promise the heir of a monarchy from his palace attending to the wants of a recluse far off condescend to afford me the pleasure of that book monseigneur  what your royal highness thinks of poetry is just verses that do not teach men new and touching truths do not deserve to be read as to my own poor versesbut after all that henriade is the writing of an honest man fit in that sense that it find grace with a philosopher prince  i will obey your commands as to sending those unpublished pieces you shall be my public monseigneur your criticisms will be my reward it is a price few sovereigns can pay i am sure of your secrecy your virtue and your intellect must be in proportion i should indeed consider it a precious happiness to come and pay my court to your royal highness one travels to rome to see paintings and ruins a prince such as you is a much more singular object worthier of a long journey but the friendship divine emilies which keeps me in this retirement does not permit my leaving it no doubt you think with julian that great and much calumniated man who said friends should always be preferred to kings  in whatever corner of the world i may end my life be assured monseigneur my wishes will continually be for youthat is to say for a whole peoples happiness my heart will rank itself among your subjects your glory will ever be dear to me i shall wish may you always be like yourself and may other kings be like youi am with profound respect your royal highnesss most humble  voltaire  oeuvres de frederic xxi 10   the correspondence once kindled went on apace and soon burst forth finding nourishment all round into a shining little household fire pleasant to the hands and hearts of both parties consent of opinions on important matters is not wanting nor is emphasis in declaring the same the mutual admiration which is highhigh and intrinsic on friedrichs side and on voltaires high if in part extrinsicby no means wants for emphasis of statement superlatives tempered by the best art pass and repass friedrich reading voltaires immortal manuscripts confesses with a blush before long that he himself is a poor apprentice that way voltaire at sight of the princely productions is full of admiration of encouragement does a little in correcting solecisms of grammar chiefly a little by no means much but it is a growing branch of employment now and henceforth almost the one reality of function voltaire can find for himself in this beautiful correspondence for oh what a crownprince ripening forward to be the delight of human nature and realize the dream of sages philosophy upon the throne and on the other side oh what a phoebus apollo mounting the eastern sky chasing the nightmaressowing the earth with orient pearl to begin within which fine duet it must be said the prince is perceptibly the truer singer singing within compass and from the heart while the phoebus shows himself acquainted with art and warbles in seductive quavers now and then beyond the pitch of his voice we must own also friedrich proves little seducible shows himself laudably indifferent to such sirensingingperhaps more used to flattery and knowing by experience how little meal is to be made of chaff voltaire in an ungrateful france naturally plumes himself a good deal on such recognition by a foreign rising sun and of the two though so many years the elder is much more like losing head a little  elegant gifts are despatched to cirey goldamber trinkets for madame perhaps an amber inkholder for monsieur priceless at cirey as the gifts of the very gods by and by a messenger goes express the witty colonel keyserling witty but experienced whom we once named at reinsberg he is to go and see with his eyes since his master cannot what a messenger there ambassador from star to star keyserlings report at reinsberg is not given but we have grafignys which is probably the more impartial keyserlings embassy was in the end of next year 3d november 1737 as we gather from the correspondence and there is plenty of airy writing about it and him in these letters  friedrich has translated the name keyserling diminutive of kaiser into caesarionand i should have said he plays much upon names and also upon things at reinsberg in that style and has a good deal of airy symbolism and cloudwork ingeniously painted round the solidities of his life there especially a bayard order as he calls it twelve of his selectest friends made into a chivalry brotherhood the names of whom are all changed caesarion one of them with dainty devices and mimetic procedures of the due sort which are not wholly mummery but have a spice of reality to flavor them to a serious young heart for the selection was rigorous superior merit and behavior a strict condition and indeed several of these bayard chevaliers proved notable practical champions in time comingfor example captain fouquet of whom we have heard before in the dark custrin days this is a mentionable feature of the reinsberg life and of the young princes character there pleasant to know of from this distance but not now worth knowing more in detail  the friedrichvoltaire correspondence contains much incense due whiffs of it from reinsberg side to the divine emilie voltaires quasi betterhalf or worsehalf who responds always in her divinest manner to reinsberg eager for more acquaintance there the du chatelets had a lawsuit in brabant very inveterate perhaps a hundred years old or more with the house of honsbrouck lettres inedites de voltaire paris 1826 p 9 this not to speak of other causes flights from french peril and the like often brought voltaire and his dame into those parts and gave rise to occasional hopes of meeting with friedrich which could not take effect in more practical style voltaire solicits of him could not your royal highness perhaps graciously speak to some of those judicial big wigs in brabant and flap them up a little which friedrich i think did by some good means happily by one means or other voltaire got the lawsuit ended1740 we might guess but the time is not specifiedand friedrich had a new claim had there been need of new to be regarded with worship by madame record of all this left like innumerable other things there in an intrinsically dark condition lies in voltaires lettersnot much worth hunting up into clear daylight the process being so difficult to a stranger but the proposed meeting with madame could never take effect not even when friedrichs hands were free nay i notice at last friedrich had privately determined it never shouldmadame evidently an inconvenient element to him a young man not wanting in private power of eyesight and able to distinguish chaff from meal voltaire and he will meet meet and also part and there will be passages between themand the reader will again hear of this correspondence of theirs where it has a biographical interest we are to conceive it at present as a principal light of life to the young heart at reinsberg a cheerful new fire almost an altarfire irradiating the common dusk for him there  of another correspondence beautifully irradiative for the young heart we must say almost nothing the correspondence with suhm suhm the saxon minister whom we have occasionally heard of is an old friend of the crownprinces dear and helpful to him it is he who is now doing those translations of wolf of which voltaire lately saw specimens translate at large for the young mans behoof the young man restless to know the best philosophy going had tried reading of wolfs chief book found it too abstruse in wolfs german wherefore suhm translates sends it to him in limpid french fascicle by fascicle with commentaries young man doing his best to understand and admiregratefully not too successfully we can perceive that is the staple of the famous suhm correspondence staple which nobody could now bear to be concerned with  suhm is also helpful in finance difficulties which are pretty frequent works out subventions loans under a handsome form from the czarinas and other courts which is an operation of the utmost delicacy perilous should it be heard of at potsdam wherefore suhm and the prince have a covert language for it and affect still to be speaking of publishers and new volumes when they mean lenders and bankdraughts all these loans i will hope were accurately paid one day as that from george ii was in rouleaus of new gold we need not doubt the wholesome charm and blessing of so intimate a correspondence to the crownprince and indeed his real love of the amiable suhm as suhms of him comes beautifully to light in these letters but otherwise they are not now to be read without weariness even dreariness and have become a biographical reminiscence merely  concerning graf von manteufel a third literary correspondent and the only other considerable one here from a german commentator on this matter is a clipping that will suffice  manteufel was saxon by birth long a minister of august the strong but quarrelled with august owing to some frail female it is said and had withdrawn to berlin a few years ago he shines there among the fashionable philosophical classes underhand perhaps does a little in the volunteer political line withal being a very busy pushing gentleman tall of stature perfectly handsome at the age of sixty formey souvenirs dun citoyen i 3945 great partisan of wolf and the philosophies awake to the orthodoxies too writes flowing elegant french in a softly trenchant somewhat too allknowing style high manners traceable in him but nothing of the noble loyalty natural politeness and pious lucency of suhm one of his letters to friedrich has this slightly impertinent passagefriedrich just getting settled in reinsberg having transiently mentioned the quantity of fair sex that had come about him there  berlin 26th august 1736 to the crownprince i am well persuaded your royal highness will regulate all that to perfection and so manage that your fair sex will be charmed to find themselves with you at reinsberg and you charmed to have them there but permit me your royal highness to repeat in this place what i one day took the liberty of saying here at berlin nothing in the world would better suit the present interests of your royal highness and of us all than some heir of your royal highnesss making perhaps the tranquil convenience with which your royal highness at reinsberg can now attend to that object will be of better effect than all those hasty and transitory visits at berlin were at least i wish it with the best of my heart i beg pardon monseigneur for intruding thus into everything which concerns your royal highnessin truth i am a rather impudent busybodyish fellow with superabundant dashing manner speculation utterance and shall get myself ordered out of the country by my present correspondent by and bybeing ever with the due enthusiasm manteufel oeuvres de frederic xxv 487friedrichs answer is reinsberg 23d september ib 489  to which friedrichs answer is of a kind to put a gag in the foul mouth of certain extraordinary pamphleteerings that were once very copious in the world and in particular to set at rest the herr dr zimmermann and his poor puddle of calumnies and credulities got together in that weak pursuit of physiology under obscene circumstances  which is the one good result i have gathered from the manteufel correspondence continues our german friend whom i vote withor if the english reader never saw those zimmermann or other doglike pamphleteerings and surmisings let this excerpt be mysterious and superfluous to the thankful english reader  on the whole we conceive to ourselves the abundant nature of friedrichs correspondence literary and other and what kind of event the transit of that post functionary from fehrbellin northwards with his leathern bags twice a week may have been at reinsberg in those years     chapter iii  crownprince makes a morning call  thursday 25th october 1736 the crownprince with lieutenant buddenbrock and an attendant or two drove over into mecklenburg to a village and serene schloss called mirow intending a small act of neighborly civility there on which perhaps an english reader of our time will consent to accompany him it is but some ten or twelve miles off in a northerly direction reinsberg being close on the frontier there a pleasant enough morningsdrive with the october sun shining on the silent heaths on the manycolored woods and you  mirow is an apanage for one of the mecklenburgstrelitz junior branches mecklenburgstrelitz being itself a junior compared to the mecklenburgschwerin of which and its infatuated duke we have heard so much in times past mirow and even strelitz are not ina very shining statebut indeed we shall see them as it were with eyes and the english reader is to note especially those mirow people as perhaps of some small interest to him if he knew it the crownprince reports to papa in a satirical vein not ungenially and with much more freedom than is usual in those reinsberg letters of his  to his prussian majesty from the crownprince  reinsberg 26th october 1736   yesterday i went across to mirow to give my most allgracious father an idea of the place i cannot liken it to anything higher than grosskreutz term of comparison lost upon us say garrat at a venture or the clachan of aberfoyle the one house in it that can be called a house is not so good as the parsons there i made straight for the schloss which is pretty much like the gardenhouse in bornim only there is a rampart round it and an old tower considerably in ruins serves as a gateway to the house  coming on the drawbridge i perceived an old stockingknitter disguised as grenadier with his cap cartridgebox and musket laid to a side that they might not hinder him in his knittingwork as i advanced he asked whence i came and whitherward i was going i answered that i came from the posthouse and was going over this bridge whereupon the grenadier quite in a passion ran to the tower where he opened a door and called out the corporal the corporal seemed to have hardly been out of bed and in his great haste had not taken time to put on his shoes nor quite button his breeches with much flurry he asked us where we were for and how we came to treat the sentry in that manner without answering him at all we went our way towards the schloss  never in my life should i have taken this for a schloss had it not been that there were two glass lamps fixed at the doorposts and the figures of two cranes standing in front of them by way of guards we made up to the house and after knocking almost half an hour to no purpose there peered out at last an exceedingly old woman who looked as if she might have nursed the prince of mirows father the poor woman at sight of strangers was so terrified she slammed the door to in our faces we knocked again and seeing there could nothing be made of it we went round to the stables where a fellow told us the young prince with his consort was gone to neustrelitz a couple of miles off ten miles english and the duchess his mother who lives here had given him to make the better figure all her people along with him keeping nobody but the old woman to herself  it was still early so i thought i could not do better than profit by the opportunity and have a look at neustrelitz we took posthorses and got thither about noon neustrelitz is properly a village with only one street in it where chamberlains officeclerks domestics all lodge and where there is an inn i cannot better describe it to my most allgracious father than by that street in gumbinnen where you go up to the townhallexcept that no house here is whitewashed the schloss is fine and lies on a lake with a big garden pretty much like reinsberg in situation  the first question i asked here was for the prince of mirow but they told me he had just driven off again to a place called kanow which is only a couple of miles english from mirow where we had been buddenbrock who is acquainted with neustrelitz got me from a chamberlain something to eat and in the mean while that bohme came in who was adjutant in my most allgracious fathers regiment not of goltz but kings presumably bohme did not know me till i hinted to him who i was he told me the duke of strelitz was an excellent seamster fit to be tailor to your majesty in a manner had not fate been cruel and that he made beautiful dressinggowns cassaquins with his needle this made me curious to see him so we had ourselves presented as foreigners and it went off so well that nobody recognized me i cannot better describe the duke than by saying he is like old stahl famed old medical man at berlin dead last year physiognomy not known to actual readers in a blond abbesperiwig he is extremely silly blode his hofrath altrock tells him as it were everything he has to say about fifty this poor duke shrunk into needlework for a quiet life amid such tumults from schwerin and elsewhere  having taken leave we drove right off to kanow and got thither about six it is a mere village and the princes pleasurehouse lusthaus here is nothing better than an ordinary huntinglodge such as any forestkeeper has i alighted at the millers and had myself announced at the lusthaus by his maid upon which the majordomo haushofmeister came over to the mill and complimented me with whom i proceeded to the residenz that is back again to mirow where the whole mirow family were assembled the mother is a princess of schwartzburg and still the cleverest of them all still under sixty good old mother intent that her poor son should appear to advantage when visiting the more opulent serenities his aunt also mothers sister was there the lady spouse is small a niece to the prince of hildburghausen who is in the kaisers service she was in the familyway but aber seemed otherwise to be a very good princess  the first thing they entertained me with was the sad misfortune come upon their best cook who with the cart that was bringing the provisions had overset and broken his arm so that the provisions had all gone to nothing privately i have had inquiries made there was not a word of truth in the story at last we went to table and sure enough it looked as if the cook and his provisions had come to some mishap for certainly in the three crowns at potsdam worst inn one may guess in the satirical vein there is better eating than here  at table there was talk of nothing but of all the german princes who are not right in their wits nicht recht klug as mirow himself your majesty knows is reputed to be there was weimar wilhelminas acquaintance

queens and as to their early poverty ridiculous to this goldnugget generation i rather guess it may have done them benefits which the goldnugget generation in its queens and otherwise stands far more in want of than it thinks  but enough of this prince of mirow whom friedrich has accidentally unearthed for us indeed there is no farther history of him for or against he evidently was not thought to have invented gunpowder by the public and yet who knows but in his very simplicity there lay something far beyond the ill margraf to whom he was so quizzable poor downpressed brother mortal

comfortable progress friedrichs first year there just ending there come accounts from england of quarrels broken out between the britannic majesty and his prince of wales discrepancies risen now to a height and getting into the very newspapersthe rising sun too little under the control of the setting in that unquiet country  prince fred of england did not get to the rhine campaign as we saw he got some increase of revenue a household of his own and finally a wife as he had requested a sachsengotha princess who peerless wilhelmma being unattainable was welcome to prince fred she is in the familyway this summer 1737 a very young lady still result thought to be duewhen result being potential heir to the british nation there ought to have been good calculation of the time when but apparently nobody had well turned his attention that way or if fred and spouse had as is presumable fred had given no notice to the paternal majestylet paternal majesty always so cross to me look out for himself in that matter certain it is fred and spouse in the beginning of august 1737 are out at hampton court potential heir due before long and no preparation made for it august 11th in the evening out at solitary hampton court the poor young mothers pains came on no chancellor there no archbishop to see the birthin fact hardly the least medical help and of political altogether none fred in his flurry or by forethoughtinstead of dashing off expresses at a gallop as of epsom to summon the necessary persons and appliances yoked wheeled vehicles and rolled off to the old unprovided palace of st jamess london with his poor wife in person unwarned unprovided where nevertheless she was safely delivered that same nightsafely as if by miracle the crisis might have taken her on the very highway never was such an imprudence owing i will believe to freds sudden flurry in the unprovided momentunprovided by reason of prior desuetudes and discouragements to speech on papas side a shade of malice there might also be papa doubts not it was malice aforethought all of it had the potential heir of the british nation gone to wreck or been born on the highway from my quarrels with this bad fred what a scrape had i been in thinks papa and is in a towering permanence of wrath ever since the very newspapers and coffeehouses and populaces now all getting vocal with it  papa as it turned out never more saw the face of fred judicious mamma queen caroline could not help a visit one visit to the poor young mother so soon as proper coming out from the visit prince fred obsequiously escorting her to her carriage found a crowd of people and populace in front of st jamess and there knelt down on the street in his fine silk breeches careless of the mud to beg a mothers blessing and show what a son he was he for his part in this sad discrepancy that had risen mamma threw a silent glance on him containing volumes of mixed tenor drove off and saw no more of fred she either i fear

laid his plans for oczakowtakes oczakowfiery event blazing in all the newspapers at reinsberg and elsewhere concerning which will the reader accept this condensed testimony by an eyewitness  oczakow 13th july 1737 day before yesterday feldmarschall munnich got to oczakow as he had plannedstrong turkish town in the nook between the black sea and the estuary of the dnieperwith intention to besiege it siegetrain stores of every sort which he had set afloat upon the dnieper in time enough were to have been ready for him at oczakow but the flotilla had been detained by shallows by waterfalls not a boat was come nor could anybody say when they were coming meanwhile nothing is to be had here the very face of the earth the turks have burnt not a blade of grass for cavalry within eight miles nor a stick of wood for engineers not a hole for covert and the ground so hard you cannot raise redoubts on it munnich perceives he must attempt nevertheless  on his right by the seashore munnich finds some remains of gardens palisades scrapes together some vestige of shelter there five thousand or even ten thousand pioneers working desperately all that first night 11th july with only half success and on the morrow commences firing with what artillery he has much outfired by the turks insidehis enterprise as good as desperate unless the dnieper flotilla come soon july 12th all day the firing continues and all night turks extremely furious about an hour before daybreak we notice burning in the interior some wooden house kindled by us town got on fire yonderand praise to heaven they do not seem to succeed in quenching it again munnich turns out in various divisions intent on trying something had he the least engineer furniturehopes desperately there may be promise for him in that internal burning still visible  in the centre of munnichs line is one general keith a deliberate stalwart scotch gentleman whom we shall know better munnich himself is to the right could not one try it by

answers keith advances close to the glacis finds a wet ditch twelve feet broad and has not a stick of engineer furniture keith waits there two hours his men under fire all the while trying this and that to get across munnichs scalade going off ineffectual in like mannertill at length keiths men and all men tire of such a business and roll back in great confusion out of shotrange munnich gives himself up for lost and indeed says mannstein had the turks sallied out in pursuit at that moment they might have chased us back to russia but the turks did not sally and the internal conflagration is not quenched far from itand about nine am their powdermagazine conflagration reaching it roared aloft into the air and killed seven thousand of them mannstein pp 151156  so that oczakow was taken sure

can he send thirty thousand and keep them recruited in such distant expedition kaiser much meditating is advised it will be better to go frankly into the turk on his own score and try for slices of

comparison with the pfalz affair the clevejulich succession which lies so near home his majesty is uncommonly anxious to have this matter settled in peace if possible kaiser and reich with the other mediating powers go on mediating but when will they decide this year the old bishop of augsburg one brother of the older kurpfalz karl philip dies nothing now between us and the event itself but karl philip alone who is verging towards eighty the decision to be peaceable ought to be speedy friedrich wilhelm in january last sent the expert degenfeld once of london to old karl philip and has him still there with the most conciliatory offers will leave your sulzbachs a part then will be content with part instead of the whole which is mine if there be force in sealed parchment will do anything for peace to which the old kurpfalz foolish old creature is steadily deaf answers vaguely negatively always in a polite manner pushing his majesty upon extremities painful to think of we hate war but cannot quite do without justice your serenity thinks friedrich wilhelm must it be the eighty thousand iron ramrods then obstinate serenity continues deaf and friedrich wilhelms negotiations there at mannheim over in holland and through holland with england not to speak of kaiser and reich close at hand become very intense vehemently earnest about this matter for the next two years the details of which inexpressibly uninteresting shall be spared the reader  summary is these mediating powers will be of no help to his majesty not even the dutch will with whom he is specially in friendship nay in the third year it becomes fatally manifest the chief mediating powers kaiser and france listening rather to political convenience than to the claims of justice go direct in kurpfalzs favorby formal treaty of their own versailles 13th january 1739 olrich geschichte der schlesischen kriege i 13 mauvillon ii 405446 c france and the kaiser settle that the sulzbachers shall as a preliminary get provisional possession on the now serenitys decease and shall continue undisturbed for two years till law decide between his prussian majesty and them two years law decideand we know what are the ninepoints in a lawcase this at last proved too much for his majesty majestys abstruse dubitations meditations on such treatment by a kaiser and others did then it appears gloomily settle into fixed private purpose of trying it by the iron ramrods when old kurpfalz should dieof marching with eighty thousand men into the cleve countries and so welcoming any sulzbach or other guests that might arrive happily old kurpfalz did not die in his majestys time survived his majesty several years so that the matter fell into other handsand was settled very well near a century after  of certain wranglings with the little town of herstalprussian town part of the orange heritage once king pepins town if that were any matter now in the bishop of lieges neighborhood town highly insignificant otherwisewe shall say nothing here as they will fall to be treated and be settled at an after stage friedrich wilhelm was much grieved by the contumacies of that paltry little herstal and by the bishop of lieges highflown procedures in countenancing themespecially in a recruiting ease that had fallen out there and brought matters to a head december 1738 is crisis of the recruiting case heldengeschichte ii 63 17th february 1739 bishops highflown appearance in it ib 67 kaisers in consequence 10th april 1739 the kaiser too was afflictively high in countenancing the bishopfor which both kaiser and bishop got due payment in time but his prussian majesty would not kindle the world for such a paltriness and so left it hanging in a vexatious condition such things it is remarked weigh heavier on his now infirm majesty than they were wont he is more subject to fits of hypochondria to talk of abdicating all gone wrong he would say if any little flaw rose about recruiting or the like one might go and live at venice were one rid of it forster place lost and his deepstung clangorous growl against the kaisers treatment of him bursts out from time to time though he oftenest pities the kaiser too seeing him at such a pass with his turk war and otherwise  it was in this pfalz business that herr luiscius the prussian minister in holland got into trouble of whom there is a light dash of outlineportraiture by voltaire which has made him memorable to readers this fat king of prussia says voltaire was a dreadfully avaricious fellow unbeautiful to a high degree in his proceedings with mankind  he had a minister at the hague called luiscius who certainly of all ministers of crowned heads was the worst paid this poor man to warm himself had made some trees be felled in the garden of honslardik which belonged at that time to the house of prussia he thereupon received despatches from the king intimating that a year of his salary was forfeited luiscius in despair cut his throat with probably the one razor he had seul rasoir quil eut an old valet came to his assistance and unhappily saved his life in after years i found his excellency at the hague and have occasionally given him an alms at the door of the vieille cour old court a palace belonging to the king of prussia where this poor ambassador had lived a dozen years it must be owned turkey is a republic in comparison to the despotism exercised by friedrich wilhelm oeuvres de voltaire vie pricee or what they now call memoires  ii 15  here truly is a witty sketch consummately dashed off as nobody but voltaire could round as giottos o done at one stroke of which the prose facts are only as follows luiscius prussian resident not distinguished by salary or otherwise had at one stage of these negotiations been told from headquarters he might in casual extraofficial ways if it seemed furthersome give their high mightinesses the hope or notion that his majesty did not intend actual war about that clevejulich successionbeing a pacific majesty and unwilling to involve his neighbors and mankind luiscius instead of casual hint delicately dropped in some good way had proceeded by direct declaration frank assurance to the high mightinesses that there would be no war which had never been quite his majestys meaning and perhaps was now becoming rather the reverse of it disavowal of luiscius had to ensue thereupon who produced defensively his instruction from headquarters but got only rebukes for such heavyfooted clumsy procedure so unlike diplomacy with its shoes of feltand in brief was turned out of the diplomatic function as unfit for it and appointed to manage certain orange properties fragments of the orange heritage which his majesty still has in those countries this misadventure sank heavily on the spirits of luiscius otherwise none of the strongestminded of men nor did he prosper in managing the orange properties on the contrary he again fell into mistakes got soundly rebuked for injudicious conduct therecutting trees planting trees or whatever it wasand this produced such an effect on luiscius that he made an attempt on his own throat distracted mortal and was only stopped by somebody rushing in it was not the first time he had tried that feat says pollnitz and been prevented nor was it long till he made a new attempt which was again frustrated and always afterwards his relations kept him close in view majesty writing comfortable forgiveness to the perturbed creature and also settling a pension on him adequate we can hope and not excessive which luiscius continued to receive at the hague so long as he lived these are the prose facts not definitely dated to us but perfectly clear otherwise pollnitz ii 495 496the new attempt seems to have been june 1739  gentlemans magazine in mense p 331  voltaire in his dutch excursions did sometimes in after years lodge in that old vacant palace called vieille cour at the hague where he gracefully celebrates the decayed forsaken state of matters dusky vast rooms with dim gilding forgotten libraries veiled under the biggest spiderwebs in europe for the rest an uncommonly quiet place convenient for a writing man besides costing nothing a son of this luiscius a good young lad it also appears was occasionally voltaires amanuensis there him he did recommend zealously to the new king of prussia who was not deaf on the occasion this in the fire of satirical wit is what we can transiently call giving alms to a prussian excellencynot now excellent but pensioned and cracked and the reader perceives luiscius had probably more than one razor had not one been enough when he did the rash act friedrich employed luiscius junior with no result that we hear of farther and seems to have thought luiscius senior an absurd fellow not worth mentioning again ran away from the cleve country probably some madhouse there above a year ago i hear and what is the matter where such a crackbrain end voltaire oeuvres letter

upon it in such heavyfooted manner his majesty thinks a journey to holland to visit ones kinsfolk there and incidentally speak a word with the high mightinesses upon pfalz would not be amiss such journey is decided on crownprince to accompany summer of 1738 a short visit quite without fuss to last only three daysmere sequel to the reviews held in those adjacent cleve countries so that the gazetteers may take no notice all which was done accordingly crownprinces first sight of holland and one of the few reportable points of his reinsberg life and not quite without memorability to him and us  on the 8th of july 1738 the review party got upon the road for wesel all through july they did their reviewing in those cleve countries and then struck across for the palace of loo in geldern where a prince of orange countable kinsman to his prussian majesty and a princess still more nearly connectedenglish georges daughter own niece to his prussian majestyare in waiting for this distinguished honor the prince of orange we have already seen for a moment once at the siege of philipsburg four years ago when the sale of chasots horses went off so well nothing like selling horses when your company have dined well whispered he to chasot at that time since which date we have heard nothing of his highness  he is not a beautiful man he has a crooked back and features conformable but is of prompt vivacious nature and does not want for sense and goodhumor paternal george the gossips say warned his princess when this marriage was talked of you will find him very illlooking though and if i found him a baboon answered she being so heartily tired of st jamess and in fact for anything i have heard they do well enough together she is george iis eldest princessnext elder to our poor amelia who was once so interesting to us what the crownprince now thought of all that i do not know but the books say poor amelia wore the willow and specially wore the princes miniature on her breast all her days after which were many grew corpulent somewhat a huddle in appearance and equipment eyelids like upperlips for one item but when life itself fled the miniature was found in its old place resting on the old heart after some sixty years o time o sons and daughters of time  his majestys reception at loo was of the kind he likedcordial honorable unceremonious and these were three pleasant days he had pleasant for the crownprince too as the whole journey had rather been papa with covert satisfaction finding him a wise creature after all and more serious than formerly hm you dont know what things are in that fritz his majesty murmured sometimes in these later years with a fine light in his eyes  loo itself is a beautiful palace loo close by the village appeldoorn is a stately brick edifice built with architectural regularity has finely decorated rooms beautiful gardens and round are superb alleys of oak and linden busching erdbeschreibung viii 69 there saunters pleasantly our crownprince for these three daysand one glad incident i do perceive to have befallen him there the arrival of a letter from voltaire letter much expected which had followed him from wesel and which he answers here in this brick palace among the superb avenues and gardens oeuvres xxi 203 the letter cirey june 1738 ib 222 the answer to it loo 6th august 1738  no doubt a glad incident irradiating as with a sudden sunburst in gray weather the commonplace of things here is news worth listening to news as from the empyrean free interchange of poetries and proses of heroic sentiments and opinions between the unique of sages and the paragon of crownprinces how charming to both literary business we perceive is brisk on both hands at cirey the discours sur lhomme sixth discours arrives in this packet at loo surely a deathless piece of singing nor is reinsberg idle reinsberg is copiously doing verse such verse and in prose very earnestly an antimachiavel which soon afterwards filled all the then world though it has now fallen so silent again and at paris as voltaire announces with a flourish m de maupertuiss excellent book figure de la terre is out paris 1738

oranges house the demon of ambition sheds its unhappy poisons over his days he might be the most fortunate of men and he is devoured by chagrins in his beautiful palace here in the middle of his gardens and of a brilliant court it is pity in truth for he is a prince with no end of wit infiniment desprit and has respectable qualites not stadtholder unluckily that is where the shoe pinches the dutch are on the republican tack and will not have a stadtholder at present no help for it in ones beautiful gardens and avenues of oak and linden  i have talked a great deal about newton with the princessabout newton never hinted at amelia not permissiblefrom newton we passed to leibnitz and from leibnitz to the late queen of england caroline lately gone who the prince told me was of clarkes sentiment on that important theological controversy now dead to mankindand of jenkins and his ear did the princess say nothing that is now becoming a high phenomenon in england but readers must wait a little  pity that we cannot give these two letters in full that no reader almost could be made to understand them or to care for them when understood such the cruelty of time upon this voltairefriedrich correspondence and some others which were once so rosy sunny and are now fallen drearily extinctstudiable by editors only in itself the friedrichvoltaire correspondence we can see was charming very blossomy at present businesses increasing mutual admiration now risen to a great heightadmiration sincere on both sides most so on the princes and extravagantly expressed on both sides most so on voltaires     crownprince becomes a freemason and is harangued by monsieur de bielfeld  his majesty we said had three pleasant days at loo discoursing as with friends on public matters or even on more private matters in a frank unconstrained way he is not to be called majesty on this occasion but the fact at loo and by the leading mightinesses of the republic who come copiously to compliment him there is well remembered talk there was with such leading mightinesses about the julichandberg question aim of this journey earnest enough private talk with some of them but it availed nothing and would not be worth reporting now to any creature if we even knew it in fact the journey itself remains mentionable chiefly by one very trifling circumstance and then by another not important either which followed out of that the trifling circumstance isthat friedrich in the course of this journey became a freemason and the unimportant sequel was that he made acquaintance with one bielfeld on the occasion who afterwards wrote a book about him which was once much read though never much worth reading and is still citable with precaution now and then monsieur le baron de bielfeld lettres familieres et autres 1763second edition 2 vols a leide 1767 is the one we use here trifling circumstance of freemasonry as we read in bielfeld and in many books after him befell in manner following  among the dinnerguests at loo one of those three days was a prince of lippebuckeburgprince of small territory but of great speculation whose territory lies on the weser leading to dutch connections and whose speculations stretch over all the universe in a high fantastic stylehe was a dinnerguest and one of the topics that came up was freemasonry a phantasmal kind of object which had kindled itself or rekindled in those years in england first of all and was now hovering about a good deal in germany and other countries pretending to be a new light of heaven and not a bogmeteor of phosphorated hydrogen conspicuous in the murk of things bogmeteor foolish putrescent willowisp his majesty promptly defined it to be tomfoolery and kinderspiel what else whereupon ingenious buckeburg who was himself a mason man of forty by this time and had high things in him of the quixotic type ventured on defence and was so respectful eloquent dexterous ingenious he quite captivated if not his majesty at least the crownprince who was more enthusiastic for high things crownprince after table took his durchlaucht of buckeburg aside talked farther on the subject expressed his admiration his convictionhis wish to be admitted into such a hero fraternity nothing could be welcomer to durchlaucht and so in all privacy it was made up betweeen them that durchlaucht summoning as many mystic brothers out of hamburg as were needful should be in waiting with them on the crownprinces road homewardsay at brunswick night before the fair where we are to beand there make the crownprince a mason bielfeld i 1416 preuss i 111 preuss buch fur jedermann i 41  this is bielfelds account repeated ever since substantially correct except that the scene was not loo at all dinner and

north of mors in the cleve country where his majesty used often to pauseand where what will be much more remarkable to readers the crownprince and voltaire had their first meeting two years hence bielfelds report of the subsequent procedure at brunswick as he saw it and was himself part of it is liable to no mistakes at least of the involuntary kind and may for anything we know be correct in every particular  he says veiling it under discreet asterisks which are now decipherable enough the durchlaucht of lippebuckeburg had summoned six brethren of the hamburg lodge of whom we mention only a graf von kielmannsegge a baron von oberg both from hanover and bielfeld himself a merchants son of hamburg these with kielmannsegges valet to act as tiler valet being also a mason and the rule

punctually on the morrow it is fairtime all manner of traders pedlers showmen rendezvousing many neighboring nobility too as was still the habit such a bulk of light luggage said the customhouse people at the gatebut were pacified by slipping them a ducat upon which we drove to korns hotel if anybody now knew it and there patiently waited no great things of a hotel says bielfeld but can be

fine auburn hair beau brun a negligent plenty of it his large blue eyes have something at once severe sweet and gracious eligible mason indeed had better make despatch at present lest papa be getting

outlooks high enough to wed the mecklenburg princess there daughter of the unutterable duke and be as good as czar of all the russias one day little to his profit poor soulthese historically ascertainable are the aspects of the brunswick court during those three days of royal visit in fairtime and may serve to date the masonic transaction for us which the crownprince has just accomplished over at korns  as for the transaction itself there is intrinsically no harm in this initiation we will hope but it behooves to be kept well hidden from papa papas good opinion of the prince has sensibly risen in the course of this journey so rational serious not dangling about among the women as formerlyand what a shock would this of korns hotel be should papa hear of it poor papa from officious talebearers he hears many things is in distress about voltaire about heterodoxiesand summoned the crownprince by express from reinsberg on one occasion lately over to potsdam to take the communion there by way of casehardening against voltaire and heterodoxies think of it human readerswe will add the following stray particulars more or less illustrative of the masonic transaction and so end that trifling affair  the captain wartensleben fellowrecipient of the mysteries at brunswick is youngest son by a second marriage of old feldmarschall wartensleben now deceased and is consequently uncle halfuncle of poor lieutenant katte though some years younger than katte would now have been tender memories hang by wartensleben in a silent way he is captain in the potsdam giants somewhat an intimate and not undeservedly so of the crownprincesucceeds wolden as hofmarschall at reinsberg not many months after this wolden having died of an apoplectic stroke of bielfeld comes a book slightly citable from no other of the brethren or their feat at kerns comes we may say anything whatever the crownprince prosecuted his masonry at reinsberg or elsewhere occasionally for a year or two but was never ardent in it and very soon after his accession left off altogether childsplay and ignis fatuus mainly a royal lodge was established at berlin of which the new king consented to be patron but he never once entered the place and only his portrait a welcomely good one still to be found there presided over the mysteries in that establishment harmless fire but too fatuous mere flamecircles cut in the air for infants we know how  with lippebuckeburg there ensued some correspondence high enough on his serenitys side but it soon languished on the princes side and in private poetry within a two years of this brunswick scene we find lippe used proverbially for a typespecimen of fools taciturne caton avec mes bons parents aussi fou que la lippe met les jeunes gens oeuvres

son and successor something of a quixote too but notable in artillerypractice and otherwise will turn up at a future stage  nor is bielfeld with his book a thing of much moment to friedrich or to us bielfeld too has a light airy vein of talk loves voltaire and the philosophies in a light wayknows the arts of society especially the art of flattering and would fain make himself agreeable to the crownprince being anxious to rise in the world his father is a hamburg merchant hamburg sealingwax manufacturer not ill off for money son has been at schools high schools under tutors posturemasters swashes about on those terms with french esprit in his mouth and lace ruffles at his wrists still under thirty showy enough sharp enough considerably a coxcomb as is still evident he did transiently get about friedrich as we shall see and hoped to have sold his heart to good purpose therewas by and by employed in slight functions not found fit for grave ones in the course of some years he got a title of baron and sold his heart more advantageously to some rich widow or fraulein with whom he retired to saxony and there lived on an estate he had purchased a stranger to prussia thenceforth  his book lettres familieres et autres all turning on friedrich which came out in 1763 at the height of friedrichs fame and was much read is still freely cited by historians as an authority but the reading of a few pages sufficiently intimates that these letters never can have gone through a terrestrial postoffice that they are an afterthought composed from vague memory and imagination in that fine saxon retreata sorrowful ghostlike travels of anacharsis instead of living words by an eyewitness not to be cited freely at all but sparingly and under conditions they abound in small errors in misdates mistakes small fictions even and impossible pretensionsfoolish mortal to write down his bit of knowledge in that form for the man in spite of his lace ruffles and gesticulations has brisk eyesight of a superficial kind he could have done us this little service apparently his one mission in the world for which nature gave him bed and board here and he the lace ruffles having gone into his soul has been tempted into misdoing itbielfeld and bielfelds book such as they are appear to be the one conquest friedrich got of freemasonry no other result now traceable to us of that adventure

number spirit and equipment say the vienna people as never marched against the turk before and it must be owned his ill success has been unparalleled the blame was not altogether his not chiefly his except for his rash undertaking of the thing on such terms as there were but the truth is that first scene we saw of himan army all gone out trumpeting and drumming into the woods to find its commanderinchiefwas an emblem of the campaign in general excellent army but commanded by nobody in particular commanded by a hofkriegsrath at vienna by a franz duke of tuscany by feldmarschall

present kaisers lifetime friedrich wilhelm is amazed at these sudden cantings of fortunes wheel and grieves honestly as for an old friend even the crownprince finds seckendorf punished unjustly and is almost sorry for him after all that has come and gone     the ear of jenkins reemerges  we must add the following distilled from the english newspapers though it is now almost four months after date  london 1st april 1738 in the english house of commons much more in the english public there has been furious debating for a fortnight past committee of the whole house examining witnesses hearing counsel subject the termagant of spain and her westindian proceduresshe by her procedures somewhere is always cutting out work for mankind how english and other strangers fallenin with in those seas are treated by the spaniards readers have heard nay have chanced to see and it is a fact painfully known to all nations fact which england for one nation can no longer put up with walpole and the official persons would fain smooth the matter but the westindia interest the city all mercantile and navigation interests are in dead earnest committee of the whole house presided by alderman perry has not ears enough to hear the immensities of evidence offered slow public is gradually kindling to some sense of it this had gone on for two weeks whenwhat shall we saythe ear of jenkins reemerged for the second time and produced important effects  where jenkins had been all this whilesteadfastly navigating to and fro steadfastly eating tough junk with a wetting of rum not thinking too much of past labors yet privately always keeping his lost ear in cotton with a kind of ursine piety or other dumb feelingno mortal now knows but to all mortals it is evident he was home in london at this time no doubt a noted member of wapping society the muchenduring jenkins and witnesses probably not one but many had mentioned him to this committee as a case eminently in point committee as can still be read in its rhadamanthine journals orders die jovis 16 martii 17371738 that captain robert jenkins do attend this house immediately and then more specially 17 martii captious objections having risen in official quarters as we guessthat captain robert jenkins do attend upon tuesday morning next commons journals xxiii in diebus tuesday next is 21st march1st of april 1738 by our modern calendarand on that day not a doubt jenkins does attend narrates that tremendous passage we already heard of seven years ago in the entrance of the gulf of florida and produces his ear wrapt in cottonsetting all on flame except the official persons at sight of it  official persons as their wont is in the pressure of debate endeavored to deny to insinuate in their vile newspapers that jenkins lost his ear nearer home and not for nothing as one still reads in the history books tindal xx 372 coxe c sheer calumnies we now find jenkinss account was doubtless abundantly emphatic but there is no ground to question the substantial truth of him and it and so after seven years of unnoticeable burning upon the thick skin of the english public the case of jenkins accidentally burns through and sets england bellowing such a smart is there of itnot to be soothed by official wetcloths but getting worse and worse for the nineteen months ensuing and in shortbut we will not anticipate     chapter vi  last year of reinsberg journey to preussen  the idyllium of reinsbergof which except in the way of sketchy suggestion there can no history be givenlasted less than four years and is now coming to an end unexpectedly soon a pleasant arcadian summer in ones lifethough it has not wanted its occasional discords flaws of ill weather in the general sunshine papa always in uncertain health of late is getting heavier of foot and of heart under his heavy burdens and sometimes falls abstruse enough liable to bewilderments from bad people and events not much worth noticing here see pollnitz ii 509515 friedrichs letter to wilhelmina berlin 20th january 1739 in oeuvres xxvii part 1st pp 60 61 c c but the crownprince has learned to deal with all this all this is of transient nature and a bright long future seems to lie ahead at reinsbergbrightened especially by the literary element which in this year of 1739 is brisker than it had ever been distinguished visitors of a literary turn look in at reinsberg the voltaire correspondence is very lively on friedrichs part there is copious production various enterprise in the form of prose and verse thoughts even of going to press with some of it in short the literary interest rises very prominent at reinsberg in 1739 biography is apt to forget the literature there having her reasons but must at last take some notice of it among the phenomena of the year  to the young prince himself courting tranquillity as his doorlintel intimated frederico tranquillitatem colenti infra p 123 and forbidden to be active except within limits this of literature was all along the great light of existence at reinsberg the supplement to all other employments or wants of employment there to friedrich himself in those old days a great and supreme interest while again to the modern biographer of him it has become dark and vacant a thing to be shunned not sought so that the fact as it stood with friedrich differs far from any description that can be given of the fact alas we have said already and the constant truth is friedrichs literatures his distinguished literary visitors and enterprises which were once brandnew and brilliant have grown old as a garment and are a sorrow rather than otherwise to existing mankind conscientious readers who would represent to themselves the vanished scene at reinsberg in this point more especially must make an effort  as biographical documents these poetries and proses of the young man give a very pretty testimony of him but are not of value otherwise in fact they promise if we look well into them that here is probably a practical faculty and intellect of the highest kind which again on the speculative especially on the poetical side will never be considerable nor has even tried to be so this young soul does not deal in meditation at all and his tendencies are the reverse of sentimental here is no introspection morbid or other no pathos or complaint no melodious informing of the public what dreadful emotions you labor under here in rapid prompt form indicating that it is truth and not fable are generous aspirations for the world and yourself generous pride disdain of the ignoble of the dark mendacioushere in short is a swifthanded valiant steelbright kind of soul very likely for a kings if other things answer and not likely for a poets no doubt he could have made something of literature too could have written books and left some stamp of a veracious more or less victorious intellect in that strange province too but then he must have applied himself to it as he did to reigning done in the cursory style we see what it has come to  it is certain friedrichs reputation suffers at this day from his writing from his not having written nothing he stands lower with the world which seems hard measurethough perhaps it is the law of the case after all nobody in these days says my poor friend has the least notion of the sinful waste there is in talk whether by pen or tongue better probably that king friedrich had written no verses nay i know not that davids psalms did davids kingship any good which may be truer than it seems fine aspirations generous convictions purposesthey are thought very fine but it is good on various accounts to keep them rather silent strictly unvocal except on call of real business so dangerous are they for becoming conscious of themselves most things do not ripen at all except underground and it is a sad but sure truth that every time you speak of a fine purpose especially if with eloquence and to the admiration of bystanders there is the less chance of your ever making a fact of it in your poor lifeif reinsberg and its vacancy of great employment was the cause of friedrichs versewriting we will not praise reinsberg on that head but the truth is friedrichs verses came from him with uncommon fluency and were not a deep matter but a shallow one in any sense not much more to him than speaking with a will than fantasying on the flute in an animated strain ever and anon through his life on small hint from without or on great there was found a certain leakage of verses which he was prompt to utterand the case at reinsberg or afterwards is not so serious as we might imagine     pines horace and the antimachiavel  in late months friedrich had conceived one notable project which demands a word in this place did modern readers ever hear of john pine the celebrated english engraver john pine a man of good scholarship good skill with his burin did tapestries of the house of lords and other things of a celebrated nature famous at home and abroad but his peculiar feat which had commended him at reinsberg was an edition of horace exquisite old flaccus brought to perfection as it were all done with vignettes classical borderings symbolic marginal ornaments in fine taste and accuracy the text itself engraved all by the exquisite burin of pine london 1737 biographie universelle xxxiv 465 this edition had come out last year famous over the world and was by and by as rumor bore to be followed by a virgil done in the like exquisite manner  the pine horace part of the pine virgil too still exist in the libraries of the curious and are doubtless known to the proper parties though much forgotten by others of us to friedrich scanning the pine phenomenon with interest then brandnew it seemed an admirable tribute to classical genius and the idea occurred to him is not there by heavens blessing a living genius classical like those antique romans and worthy of a like tribute friedrichs idea was that voltaire being clearly the supreme of poets the henriade his supreme of poems ought to be engraved like flaccus text and all with vignettes tailpieces classical borderings beautifully symbolic and exact by the exquisite burin of pine which idea the young heroworshipper in spite of his financedifficulties had resolved to realize and was even now busy with it since his return from loo such beautiful enthusiasm say some readers and in behalf of that particular demigod alas yes to friedrich he was the best demigod then going and friedrich never had any doubt about him  for the rest this heroic idea could not realize itself and we are happy to have nothing more to do with pine or the henriade correspondences were entered into with pine and some pains taken pines high prices were as nothing but pine was busy with his virgil probably in fact had little stomach for the henriade could not for seven years to come enter upon it so that the matter had to die away and nothing came of it but a small dissertation or introductory essay which the prince had got readywhich is still to be found printed in voltaires works oeuvres xiii 393402 and in friedrichs if anybody now cared much to read it preuss says it was finished the 10th august 1739 and that minute fact in chronology with the above tale of heroworship hanging to it will suffice my readers and me  but there is another literary project on hand which did take effectmuch worthy of mention this year the whole world having risen into such a chorus of te deum at sight of it next year in this year falls what at any rate was a great event to friedrich as literary man the printing of his first bookassiduous writing of it with an eye to print the book is that celebrated antimachiavel everpraiseworthy refutation of machiavels prince concerning which there are such immensities of voltaire correspondence now become like the book itself inane to all readers this was the chosen souls employment of friedrich the flower of life to him at reinsberg through the yea 1739 it did not actually get to press till spring 1740 nor actually come out till autumnby which time a great change had occurred in friedrichs title and circumstances but we may as well say here what little is to be said of it for modern readers  the crownprince reading this bad book of machiavels years ago had been struck as all honest souls especially governors or apprentices to governing must be if they thought of reading such a thing with its badness its falsity detestability and came by degrees obliquely fishing out voltaires opinion as he went along on the notion of refuting machiavel and did refute him the best he could set down namely his own earnest contradiction to such ungrounded noxious doctrines elaborating the same more and more into clear logical utterance till it swelled into a little volume which so excellent was it so important to mankind voltaire and friends were clear for publishing published accordingly it was goes through the press next summer 1740 under voltaires anxious superintendence here gathered from friedrichs letters to voltaire is the chronology of the little enterprise1738 march 21 june 17 machiavel a baneful man thinks friedrich ought to be refuted by somebody thinks he date not known 1739 march 22 friedrich thinks of doing it himself has done it december 4a book which ought to be printed say voltaire and the literary visitors 1740 april 26 book given up to voltaire for finished book appears end of september when a great change had occurred in friedrichs title and position for the prince has at length consented and voltaire hands the manuscript with mystery yet with hints to a dutch bookseller one van duren at the hague who is eager enough to print such an article voltaire himselfsuch his magnanimous friendship especially if one have dutch lawsuits or business of ones own in those partstakes charge of correcting lodges himself in the old court prussian mansion called vieille cour at the hague where luiscius figuratively speaking may get an alms from us and therefrom corrects alters corresponds with the prince and van duren at a great rate keeps correcting altering till van duren thinks he is spoiling it for saleand privately determines to preserve the original manuscript and have an edition of that with only such corrections as seem good to van duren a treasonous step on this mule of a booksellers part thinks voltaire but mulishly persisted in by the man endless correspondence to right and left ensues intolerably wearisome to every reader and in fine there came out in autumn nextthe crownprince no longer a crownprince by that time but shining conspicuous under higher titlenot one antimachiavel only but a couple or a trio of antimachiavels as printed at the hague as reprinted at london or elsewhere the confused bibliography of which has now fallen very insignificant first there was the voltaire text authorized edition end of september 1740 then came in few weeks the van duren one then probably a third combining the two the variations given as footnotesin short i know not how many editions translations printings and reprintings all the world being much taken up with such a message from the upper regions and eager to read it in any form  as to friedrich himself who of course says nothing of the antimachiavel in public he privately to voltaire disowns all these editions and intends to give a new one of his own which shall be the right article but never did it having far other work cut out for him in the months that came but how zealous the worlds humor was in that matter no modern reader can conceive to himself in the frightful compilation called heldengeschichte which we sometimes cite there are excerpted from the then bibliotheques nouvelle bibliotheque and another shining periodicals of the time now gone quite dead two reviews of the antimachiavel which fill modern readers with amazement such a domine dimittas chanted over such an articlethese details in any other than the biographical point of view are now infinitely unimportant  truly yes the crownprinces antimachiavel final correct edition in two forms voltaires as corrected and the princes own as written stands now in clear type preuss oeuvres de frederic viii 61163 and after all that jumble of printing and counterprinting we can any of us read it in a few hours but alas almost none of us with the least interest or as it were with any profit whatever so different is present tense from past in all things especially in things like these it is sixscore years since the antimachiavel appeared the spectacle of one who was himself a king for the mysterious fact was well known to van duren and everybody stepping forth to say with conviction that kingship was not a thing of attorney mendacity to be done under the patronage of beelzebub but of human veracity to be set about under quite other patronage and that in fact a king was the born servant of his people domestique friedrich once calls it rather than otherwise this naturally enough rose upon the then populations unused to such language like the dawn of a new day and was welcomed with such applauses as are now incredible after all that has come and gone alas in these sixscore years it has been found so easy to profess and speak even with sincerity the actual herokings were long used to be silent and the shamhero kind grow only the more desperate for us the more they speak and professthis antimachiavel of friedrichs is a clear distinct treatise confutes or at least heartily contradicts paragraph by paragraph the incredible sophistries of machiavel nay it leaves us if we sufficiently force our attention with the comfortable sense that his royal highness is speaking with conviction and honestly from the heart in the affair but that is all the conquest we get of it in these days treatise fallen more extinct to existing mankind it would not be easy to name  perhaps indeed mankind is getting weary of the question altogether machiavel himself one now reads only by compulsion what is the use of arguing with anybody that can believe in machiavel asks mankind or might well ask and except for editorial purposes eschews any antimachiavel impatient to be rid of bane and antidote both truly the world has had a pother with this little nicolo machiavelli and his perverse little bookpity almost that a friedrich wilhelm taking his rounds at that point of time had not had the refuting of him friedrich wilhelms method would have been briefer than friedrichs but let us hope the thing is now practically about completed and as to the other question was the signor nicolo serious in this perverse little book or did he only do it ironically with a serious inverse purpose we will leave that to be decided any time convenient by people who are much at leisure in the world  the printing of the antimachiavel was not intrinsically momentous in friedrichs history yet it might as well have been dispensed with he had here drawn a fine program and needlessly placarded it for the street populations and afterwards there rose as could not fail on their part comparison between program and performance scornful cry chiefly from men of weak judgment is this king an antimachiavel then pfui of whichthough voltaires voice too was heard in it in angry momentswe shall say nothing the reader looking for himself will judge by and by and herewith enough of the antimachiavel composition of antimachiavel and speculation of the pine henriade lasted both of them all through this year 1739 and farther from these two items not to mention any other readers can figure sufficiently how literary a year it was     friedrich in preussen again at the stud of trakehnen a tragically great event coming on  in july this year the crownprince went with papa on the prussian reviewjourney set out 7th july oeuvres xxvii part 1st 67 n such attendance on reviewjourneys a mark of his being well with papa is now becoming usual they are agreeable excursions and cannot but be instructive as well on this occasion things went beautifully with him out in those grassy countries in the bright summer once more he had an unusually fine timeand two very special pleasures befell him first was a sight of the emigrants our salzburgers and other in their flourishing condition over in lithuania yonder delightful to see how the waste is blossoming up again busy men with their industries their steady pious husbandries making all things green and fruitful horsedroves cattleherds waving cornfieldsa very schmalzgrube butterpit of those northern parts as it is since called busching erdbeschreibung ii 1049 the crownprinces own words on this matter we will give they are in a letter of his to voltaire perhaps already known to some readersand we can observe he writes rather copiously from those localities at present and in a cheerful humor with everybody  insterburg 27th july 1739 crownprince to voltaire prussian lithuania is a country a hundred and twenty miles long by from sixty to forty broad miles english we always mean unless c it was ravaged by pestilence at the beginning of this century and they say three hundred thousand people died of disease and famine ravaged by pestilence and the neglect of king friedrich i till my father once his hands were free made personal survey of it and took it up in earnest  since that time say twenty years ago there is no expense that the king has been afraid of in order to succeed in his salutary views he made in the first place regulations full of wisdom he rebuilt wherever the pestilence had desolated thousands of families from the ends of europe seventeen thousand salzburgers for the last item were conducted hither the country repeopled itself trade began to flourish againand now in these fertile regions abundance reigns more than it ever did  there are above half a million of inhabitants in lithuania there are more towns than there ever were more flocks than formerly more wealth and more productiveness than in any other part of germany and all this that i tell you of is due to the king alone who not only gave the orders but superintended the execution of them it was he that devised the plans and himself got them carried to fulfilment and spared neither care nor pains nor immense expenditures nor promises nor recompenses to secure happiness and life to this halfmillion of thinking beings who owe to him alone that they have possessions and felicity in the world  i hope this detail does not weary you i depend on your humanity extending itself to your lithuanian brethren as well as to your french english german or otherall the more as to my great astonishment i passed through villages where you hear nothing spoken but frenchi have found something so heroic in the generous and laborious way in which the king addressed himself to making this desert flourish

oeuvres xxi 304 305  this is one pleasant scene to the crownprince and us in those grassy localities and now we have to mention that about a fortnight later at konigsberg one day in reference to a certain royal stud or horsebreeding establishment in those same lithuanian regions there had a still livelier satisfaction happened him satisfaction of a personal and filial nature the name of this royal stud inestimable on such ground is trakehnenlies south of tilsit in an upper valley of the pregel riververy extensive horseestablishment with seven farms under it say the books and all in the most perfect order they need hardly add friedrich wilhelm being master of it well the royal party was at konigsberg so far on the road homewards again from those outlying parts when friedrich wilhelm said one day to his son quite in a cursory manner i give thee that stud of trakehnen thou must go back and look to it which struck fritz quite dumb at the moment  for it is worth near upon 2000 pounds a year 12000 thalers a welcome new item in our impoverished budget and it is an undeniable sign of papas goodhumor with us which is more precious still fritz made his acknowledgments eloquent with looks eloquent with voice on coming to himself and is in fact very proud of his gift and celebrates it to his wilhelmina to camas and others who have a right to know such a thing grand useful gift and handed over by papa grandly in three business words as if it had been a brace of game i give it thee fritz a thing not to be forgotten at bottom friedrich wilhelm was not avaricious not a miser only a man grandly abhorring waste as the poor vulgar cannot do not avaricious says pollnitz once he made munificent gifts and never thought of them more this of trakehnenperhaps there might be a whiff of coming fate concerned in it withal i shall soon be dead not able to give thee anything poor fritz to the prince and us it is very beautiful a fine effulgence of the inner man of friedrich wilhelm the prince returned to trakehnen on this glad errand settled the business details there and after a few days went home by a route of his ownwell satisfied with this prussianreview journey as we may imagine       see earlierprussian reviewjourney placing of hyphen  one sad thing there was though friedrich did not yet know how sad in this reviewjourney the new fit of illness that overtook his majesty from pollnitz who was of the party we have details on that head in his majestys last bad illness five years ago when all seemed hopeless it appears the surgeons had relieved himin fact recovered him bringing off the bad humors in quantityby an incision in the foot or leg in the course of the present fatigues this old wound broke out again which of course stood much in the way of his majesty and could not be neglected as probably the causes of it were a regimental surgeon pollnitz says was called in who in two days healed the woundand declared all to be right again though in fact as we may judge it was dangerously worse than before all well here writes friedrich the king has been out of order but is now entirely recovered tout a fait remis konigsberg 30th july 1739 to his wife oeuvres xxvi 6  much reviewing and heavy business followed at konigsberggift of trakehnen and departure of the crownprince for trakehnen winding it up directly on the heel of which his majesty turned homewards the crownprince not to meet him till once at berlin again majestys first stage was at pillau where we have been at pillau or next day at dantzig pollnitz observed a change in his majestys humor which had been quite sunshiny all this journey hitherto at dantzig pollnitz first noticed it but at every new stage it grew worse evil accidents occurring to worsen it and at berlin it was worst of alland alas his poor majesty never recovered his sunshine in this world again here is pollnitzs account of the journey homewards  till now till pillau and dantzig his majesty had been in especially good humor but in dantzig his cheerfulness forsook himand it never came back he arrived about ten at night in that city wednesday 12th august or thereby slept there and was off again next morning at five he drove only thirty miles this day stopped in lupow coast road through pommern with herr von grumkow the late grumkows brother kammer president in this pommern province from lupow he went to a poor village near belgard eighty miles fartherlast village on the great road belgard lying to left a little on a side roadand stayed there overnight  at belgard next morning he reviewed the dragoon regiment von platen and was very ill content with it and nobody with the least understanding of that business but must own that never did prussian regiment manoeuvre worse conscious themselves how bad it was they lost head and got into open confusion the king did all that was possible to help them into order again he withdrew thrice over to give the officers time to recover themselves but it was all in vain the king contrary to wont restrained himself amazingly and would not show his displeasure in public he got into his carriage and drove away with the furst of anhalt old dessauer and von winterfeld captain in the giant regiment who is now majorgeneral von winterfeld majorgeneral since 1743 of high fame fell in fight 7th september 1757 not staying to dine with general von platen as was always his custom with commandants whom he had reviewed he bade prince wilhelm and the rest of us stay and dine he himself drove awaytowards the great road again and some uncertain lodging there  we stayed accordingly and did full justice to the good cheerthough poor platen would certainly look flustered one may fancy but as the prince was anxious to come up with his majesty again and knew not where he would meet him we had to be very swift with the business  we found the king with anhalt and winterfeld by and by sitting in a village in front of a barn and eating a cold pie there which the furst of anhalt had chanced to have with him his majesty owing to what he had seen on the paradeground was in the utmost illhumor hochst ubler laune next day saturday he went a hundred and fifty or two hundred miles and arrived in berlin at ten at night not expected there till the morrow so that his rooms were lockedher majesty being over in monbijou giving her children a ball pollnitz ii 534537and we can fancy what a frame of mind there was  nobody not at first even the doctors much heeded this new fit of illness which went and came changed temper deeper or less deep gloom of bad humor being the main phenomenon to bystanders but the sad truth was his majesty never did recover his sunshine from pillau onwards he was slowly entering into the shadows of the total last eclipse and his journeyings and reviewings in this world were all done ten months hence pollnitz and others knew better what it had been     chapter vii  last year of reinsberg transit of baltimore and other persons and things  friedrich had not been long home again from trakehnen and preussen when the routine of things at reinsberg was illuminated by visitors of brilliant and learned quality some of whom a certain signor algarotti for one require passing mention here algarotti who became a permanent friend or satellite very luminous to the prince and was much about him in coming years first shone out upon the scene at this timecoming unexpectedly and from the eastward as it chanced  on his own score algarotti has become a wearisome literary man to modern readers one of those halfremembered men whose books seem to claim a reading and do not repay it you when given treatises of a serious nature on the opera setting forth in earnest the potential moral uses of the opera and dedicated to chatham neutonianismo per le donne astronomy for ladies the mere titles of such things are fatally sufficient to us and we cannot without effort nor with it recall the brilliancy of algarotti and them to his contemporary world  algarotti was a rich venetian merchants son precisely about the crownprinces age shone greatly in his studies at bologna and elsewhere had written poesies rime written especially that newtonianism for the dames equal to fontenelle said fame and orthodox newtonian withal not heterodox or cartesian and had shone respected at paris on the strength of it for three or four years past friend of voltaire in consequence of voltaire and his divine emilie and a welcome guest at cirey friend of the cultivated world generally which was then laboring divine emilie in the van of it to understand newton and be orthodox in this department of things algarotti did fine poesies too once and again did classical scholarships and much else everywhere a clearheaded methodically distinct concise kind of man a high style of breeding about him too had powers of pleasing and used them a man beautifully lucent in society gentle yet impregnable there keeping himself unspotted from the world and its discrepanciesreally with considerable prudence first and last  he is somewhat of the bielfeld type a merchants son we observe like bielfeld but a venetian merchants not a hamburgs and also of better natural stuff than bielfeld concentrated himself upon his task with more seriousness and made a higher thing of it than bielfeld though after all it was the same task the two had alas our swan of padua so they sometimes called him only sailed paddling grandly nowhitheras the swangoose of the elbe did in a less stately manner one cannot well bear to read his books there is no light upon friedrich to tempt us better light than bielfelds there could have been and much of it but he prudently as well as proudly forbore such topics he approaches very near fertility and geniality in his writings but never reaches it dilettantism become serious and strenuous in those departmentswell it was beautiful to young friedrich and the world at that time though it is not to usyoung algarotti twentyseven this year has been touring about as a celebrity these four years past on the strength of his fine manners and newtonianism for the dames  it was under escort of baltimore an english milord recommended from potsdam itself that algarotti came to reinsberg the signor had much to do with english people now and after where baltimore first picked him up i know not but they have been to russia together baltimore by twelve years the elder of the two and now getting home towards england again they call at reinsberg in the fine autumn weatherand considerably captivate the crownprince baltimore playing chief in that as in other points the visit lasted five days 20th25th september 1739 oeuvres de frederic xiv p xiv there was copious speech on many thingsdiscussion about printing of the anti machiavel algarotti to get it printed in england algarotti to get pine and his engraved henriade put under way neither of which projects took effectreaders can conceive what a charming five days these were here in the crownprinces own words are some brief glimmerings which will suffice us  reinsberg 25th sept 1739 crownprince to papa that nothing new has occurred in the regiment and we have few sick here has the english milord who was at potsdam passing through stayed five days though we call it passing and suppress the algarotti baltimore being indeed chief he is gone towards hamburg to take ship for england there as i heard that my most allgracious father wished i should show him courtesy i have done for him what i could the prince of mirow has also been hereour old strelitz friend of baltimore nothing more to papa but to another correspondent to the good suhm who is now at petersburg and much in our intimacy ready to transact loans for us translate wolf or do what is wanted there is this passage next day  reinsberg 26th september 1739 to suhm we have had milord baltimore here and the young algarotti both of them men who by their accomplishments cannot but conciliate the esteem and consideration of all who see them we talked much of you suhm of philosophy of science art in short of all that can be included in the taste of cultivated people honnetes gens oeuvres de frederic xvi 378 and again to another about two weeks hence  reinsberg 10th october 1739 to voltaire we have had milord baltimore and algarotti here who are going back to england this milord is a very sensible man homme tressense who possesses a great deal of knowledge and thinks like us that sciences can be no disparagement to nobility nor degrade an illustrious rank i admired the genius of this anglais as one does a fine face through a crape veil he speaks french very ill yet one likes to hear him speak it and as for his english he pronounces it so quick there is no possibility of following him he calls a russian a mechanical animal he says petersburg is the eye of russia with which it keeps civilized countries in sight if you took this eye from it russia would fall again into barbarism out of which it is just struggling ib xxi 326 327 young algarotti whom you know pleased me beyond measure he promised that hebut baltimore promise or not is the chief figure at present  evidently an original kind of figure to us cet anglais and indeed there is already finished a rhymed epistle to baltimore epitre sur la liberte copy goes in that same letter for voltaires behoof which dates itself likewise october 10th beginninglesprit libre milord qui regne en angleterre which though it is full of fine sincere sentiments about human dignity papal superstition newton locke and aspirations for progress of culture in prussia no reader could stand at this epoch  what baltimore said in answer to the epitre we do not know probably not much it does not appear he ever saw or spoke to friedrich a second time three weeks after friedrich writing to algarotti has these words i pray you make my friendships to milord baltimore whose character and manner of thinking i truly esteem i hope he has by this time got my epitre on the english liberty of thought 29th october 1739 to algarotti in london oeuvres xviii 5 and so baltimore passes on silent in history henceforththough friedrich seems to have remembered him to late times as a kind of typefigure when england came into his head for the sake of this small transit over the suns disk i have made some inquiry about baltimore but found very littleperhaps enough  he was charles sixth lord baltimore it appears sixth and last but one first of the baltimores we know was secretary calvert 16181624 who colonized maryland last of them 1774 was the son of this charles something of a fool to judge by the face of him in portraits and by some of his doings in the world he that seventh baltimore printed one or two little volumes now of extreme raritycannot be too rare and winded up by standing an ugly trial at kingston assizes plaintiff an unfortunate female after which he retired to naples and there ended 1774 the last of these milords walpole by park catalogue of royal and noble authors london 1806 v 278  he of the kingston assizes we say was not this charles but his son whom let the reader forget charles age forty at this time had travelled about the continent a good deal once long ago we imagined we had got a glimpse of him but it was a guess merely lounging about luneville and lorraine along with lyttelton in the congressofsoissons time not long after that it is certain enough he got appointed a gentleman of the bedchamber to prince fred who was a friend of speculative talkers and cultivated people in which situation charles sixth baron baltimore continued all his days after and might have risen by means of fred as he was anxious enough to do had both of them lived but they both died baltimore first in 1751 a year before fred bubb doddington diligent laborer in the same fred vineyard was much infested by this baltimorewho drunk or sober for he occasionally gets into liquor is always putting out bubb and stands too well with our royal master one secretly fears baltimores finances i can guess were not in too good order mostly an absentee irish estates not managed in the first style while one is busy in the fred vineyard the best and honestest man in the world with a good deal of jumbled knowledge walpole calls him once but not capable of conducting a party walpoles letters to mann london 1843 ii 175 27th january 1747 see ib i 82 oh noand died at any rate spring 1751 peerage of ireland london 1768 ii 172174 and we will not mention him farther     bielfeld what he saw at reinsberg and around  directly on the rear of these fine visitors came by invitation a pair of the kornshotel people masonic friends one of whom was bielfeld whose dainty installation speech and ways of procedure had been of promise to the prince on that occasion baron von oberg was the otherhanoverian baron the same who went into the wars and was a general von oberg twenty years hence the same or another it does not much concern us nor does the visit much or at all except that bielfeld being of writing nature professes to give ocular account of it honest transcript of what a human creature actually saw at reinsberg and in the berlin environment at that date would have had a value to mankind but bielfeld has adopted the fictitious form and pretty much ruined for us any transcript there is exaggeration gesticulation fantastic uncertainty afflict the reader and prevent comfortable belief except where there is other evidence than bielfelds  at berlin the beautiful straight streets linden avenues perhaps a better sample than those of our day were notable to bielfeld bridges statues very fine grand esplanades and such military drilling and parading as was never seen he had dinnerinvitations too in quantity likes this one and that all in prudent asteriskslikes truchsess von waldburg very much and his strange mode of bachelor housekeeping and the way he dines and talks among his fellowcreatures or sits studious among his military books and paperlitters but all is loose faroff sketching in the style of anacharsis the younger and makes no solid impression  getting to reinsberg to the town to the schloss he crosses the esplanade the moat sees what we know beautiful square mansion among its woods and watersand almost nothing that we do not know except the way the moatbridge is lighted bridge furnished he says with seven statues representing the seven planets each holding in her hand a glass lamp in the form of a globewhich is a pretty object in the nighttime the house is now finished knobelsdorf rejoicing in his success pesne and others giving the last touch to some ceilings of a sublime nature on the lintel

pleasant to the mind knobelsdorf is of austere aspect austere yet benevolent and full of honest sagacity the very picture of sound sense thinks bielfeld m jordan is handsome though of small stature agreeable expression of face eye extremely vivid brown complexion bushy eyebrows as well as beard are black bielfeld abridged i 45  or did the reader ever hear of m fredersdorf head valet at this time fredersdorf will become as it were privypurse housefriend and domestic factotum and play a great part in coming years a tall handsome man much silent sense civility dexterity something magnificently clever in him thinks bielfeld now or else twenty years afterwards whom we can believe ib p 49 he was a gift from general schwerin this fredersdorf once a private in schwerins regiment at frankfurtonoderexcellent on the flute for one quality schwerin who had an eye for men sent him to friedrich in the custrin time hoping he might suit in fluting and otherwise which he conspicuously did bielfelds account we must candidly say appears to be an afterthought but readers can make their profit of it all the same  as to the crownprince and princess words fail to express their gracious perfections their affabilities polite ingenuitiesbielfelds words do give us some pleasant shadowy conceivability of the crownprincess  tall and perfect in shape bust such as a sculptor might copy complexion of the finest features ditto nose i confess smallish and pointed but excellent of that kind hair of the supremest flaxen shining like a flood of sunbeams when the powder is off it a humane ingenuous princess little negligences in toilet or the like if such occur even these set her off so ingenuous are they speaks little but always to the purpose in a simple cheerful and wise way dances beautifully heart her soubrette assures me is heavenlyand perhaps no princess living has a finer set of diamonds  of the crownprincess there is some pleasant shadow traced as on cobweb to this effect but of the crownprince there is no forming the least conception from what he saysthis is mere cobweb with nothing elaborately painted on it nor do the portraits of the others attract by their verisimilitude here is colonel keyserling for instance the witty courlander famous enough in the friedrich circle who went on embassy to cirey and much else he whirls in with uproar fracas like boreas in the ballet fowlingpiece on shoulder and in his dressinggown withal which is still stranger snatches off bielfeld unknown till that moment to sit by him while dressing and there with much capering pirouetting and indeed almost groundandlofty tumbling for accompaniment talks of horses mathematics painting architecture literature and the art of war while he dresses this gentleman was once colonel in friedrich wilhelms army is now fairly turned of forty and has been in troubles we hope he is not like in the bielfeld portraitotherwise how happy that we never had the honor of knowing him indeed the crownprinces household generally as bielfeld paints it in flourishes of panegyric is but unattractive barren to the modern onlooker partly the painters blame we doubt not he gives details about their mode of dining taking coffee doing concertand describes once an incidental drinkingbout got up aforethought by the prince which is probably in good part fiction though not ill done these fantastic sketchings rigorously winnowed into the credible and actual leave no great residue in that kind but what little they do leave is of favorable and pleasant nature  bielfeld made a visit privately to potsdam too saw the giants drill made acquaintance with important captains of theirs all in asterisks at potsdam with whom he dined not in a too credible manner and even danced among the asterisks we easily pick out captain wartensleben of the kornshotel operation and winterfeld a still more important captain whom we saw dining on cold pie with his majesty at a barndoor in pommern not long since of the giants or their life at potsdam bielfelds word is not worth hearingworth suppressing rather his knowledge being so small and hung forth in so fantastic a way this transient sight he had of his majesty in person this which is worth something to usfact being evidently lodged in it after churchparade autumn sunday afternoon day uncertain bielfelds date being fictitious and even impossible majesty drove out to wusterhausen where the quantities of game surpass all belief and bielfeld had one glimpse of him  i saw his majesty only as it were in passing if i may judge by his portraits he must have been of a perfect beauty in his young time but it must be confessed there is nothing left of it now his eyes truly are fine but the glance of them is terrible his complexion is composed of the strongest tints of red blue yellow greennot a lovely complexion at all big head the thick neck sunk between the shoulders figure short and heavy courte et ramassee bielfeld p 35  going

this night there was a very splendid appearance at the masquerade but among the many humorous and whimsical characters what seemed most to engage attention was a spaniard who called himself knight of the ear as badge of which order he wore on his breast the form of a star with its points tinged in blood and on the body of it an ear painted and in capital letters the word jenkins encircling it across his shoulder there hung instead of ribbon a large halter which he held up to several persons dressed as english sailors who seemed in great terror of him and falling on their knees suffered him to rummage their pockets which done he would insolently dismiss them with strokes of his halter several of the sailors had a bloody ear hanging down from their heads and on their hats were these words

bedbed and wheeledchair drearily alternating suffers muchand again in diplomatic circles the rumors are rife and sinister ever from this chill at schulenburgs the medicines did him no good says pollnitz if he rallied it was the effect of nature and only temporary he does daily with punctuality his official business perhaps the best two hours he has of the fourandtwenty for the time hangs heavy on him his old generals sit round his bed talking smoking as it was five years ago his feekin and his children much about him out and in the heavyladen weary hours roll round as they can in

we often say friends are encouraged to smoke especially to keep up a stream of talk if at any time he fall into a doze and they cease talking the silence will awaken him  he is worst off in the night sleep very bad and among his sore bodily pains ennui falls very heavy to a mind so restless he can paint he can whittle chisel at last they even mount him a table in his bed with joiners tools mallets

on record for it is the kings private thought ever and anon borne in upon him that death itself is in this business  queen and children mostly hoping hitherto though fearing too live in much anxiety and agitation the crownprince is often over from reinsberg must not come too often nor even inquire too much his affectionate solicitude might be mistaken for solicitude of another kind it is certain he is in no haste to be king to quit the haunts of the muses and embark on kingship certain too he loves his father shudders at the thought of losing him and yet again there will gleams intrude of a contrary thought which the filial heart disowns with a kind of horror down thou impious thoughtwe perceive he manages in general to push the crisis away from him to believe that real danger is still distant his demeanor so far as we can gather from his letters or other evidence is amiable prudent natural altogether that of a human son in those difficult circumstances poor papa is heavyladen let us help to bear his burdenslet us hope the crisis is still far off  once on a favorable evening probably about the beginning of april when he felt as if improving friedrich wilhelm resolved to dress

only to return on the instant with the kings order that you instantly quit the palace all of you and dont come back solemn respectful message to his majesty was of no effect or of less they had to go

ungenial for the sick man this winter of 1740 had been the coldest on record it extended itself into the very summer and brought great distress of every kindof which some oral rumor still survives in all countries friedrich wilhelm heard complaints of scarcity among the people admonitions to open his corngranaries such as he always has in store against that kind of accident but he still hesitated and refused unable to look into it himself and fearing deceptions  for the rest he is struggling between death and life in general persuaded that the end is fast hastening on he sends for chief preacher roloff out to potsdam has some notable dialogues with roloff and with two other potsdam clergymen of which there is record still left us in these as in all his demeanor at this supreme time we see the big rugged block of manhood come out very vividly strong in his simplicity in his veracity friedrich wilhelms wish is to know from roloff what the chances are for him in the other worldwhich is not less certain than potsdam and the giant grenadiers to friedrich wilhelm and where he perceives never half so clearly before he shall actually peel off his kinghood and stand before god almighty no better than a naked beggar roloffs prognostics are not so encouraging as the king had hoped surely this king never took or coveted what was not his kept true to his marriagevow in spite of horrible examples everywhere believed the bible honored the preachers went diligently to church and tried to do what he understood gods commandments were to all which roloff a courageous pious man answers with discreet words and shakings of the head did i behave ill then did i ever do injustice roloff mentions baron schlubhut the defalcating amtmann hanged at konigsberg without even a trial he had no trial but was there any doubt he had justice a public thief confessing he had stolen the taxes he was set to gather insolently offering as if that were all to repay the money and saying it was not manier good manners to hang a nobleman roloff shakes his head too violent your majesty and savoring of the tyrannous the poor king must repent  wellis there anything more out with it then better now than too latemuch oppression forcing men to build in berlinoppression was it not their benefit as well as berlins and the countrys i had no interest in it other derschau you who managed it and his majesty turned to derschau for all the smoking generals and company are still here nor will his majesty consent to dismiss them from the presence and be alone with roloff what is there to conceal they are people of honor and my friends derschau whose feats in the building way are not unknown even to us answers with a hard face it was all right and orderly nothing out of square in his building operations to which roloff shakes his head a thing of public notoriety herr generali will prove everything before a court answers the herr general with still harder face roloff still austerely shaking his head hmand then there is forgiveness of enemies your majesty is bound to forgive all men or how can you ask to be forgiven well i will i do you feekin write to your brother

work solid though stupid consists nearly altogether of multifarious beylagen appendices and notes which are creditably accurate and often curious and as usual have no index for an unfortunate reader which are to the same effect so far as they concern us and exhibit the same rugged son of nature looking with all his eyesight into the near eternity and sinking in a human and not inhuman manner amid the floods of time wa wa what great god is this that pulls down the strength of the strongest kings  the poor kings state is very restless fluctuates from day to day he is impatient of bed sleeps very ill is up whenever possible rolls about in his wheeledchair and even gets into the air at one time looking strong as if there were still months in him and anon sunk in fainting weakness as if he had few minutes to live friedrich at reinsberg corresponds very secretly with dr eller has other friends at potsdam whose secret news he very anxiously reads to the last he cannot bring himself to think it serious letter to eller 25th may 1740 oeuvres  xvi 184  on thursday 26th of may an express from eller or the potsdam friends arrives at reinsberg he is to come quickly if he would see his father again alive the step may have danger too but friedrich a world of feelings urging him is on the road next morning before the sun his journey may be fancied the like of it falls to all men arriving at last turning hastily a corner of the potsdam schloss friedrich sees some gathering in the distance it is his father in his rollwagen wheeledchairnot dying but out of doors giving orders about founding a house or seeing it done house for one philips a crabbed englishman he has whose tongue is none of the best not even to majesty itself but whose merits as a groom of english and other horses are without parallel in those parts without parallel and deserve a house before we die let us see it set agoing this blessed mayday of philips who survived deep into friedrichs time and uttered rough sayings in mixed intelligible dialect when put upon in his grooming or otherwise disturbed i could obtain no farther account the man did not care to be put in history a very small service to a man cared to have a house with trim fittings and to do his grooming well the fortunate philips  at sight of his son friedrich wilhelm threw out his arms the son kneeling sank upon his breast and they embraced with tears my father my father my son my son it was a scene to make all bystanders and even philips weepprobably the emotion hurt the old king he had to be taken in again straightway his show of strength suddenly gone and bed the only place for him this same friday he dictated to one of his ministers boden who was in close attendance the instruction for his funeral a rude characteristic piece which perhaps the english reader knows too long and rude for reprinting here copy of it in seyfarth ubi supra i 1924 translated in mauvillon ii 432437 in c c  he is to be buried in his uniform

decency is what the tenant of that oak coffin wants as he always did when owner of wider dominions the coffin which he has ready and beside him in the palace this good while is a stout piece of carpentry with leather straps and other improvements he views it from time to time solaces his truculent imagination with the look of it i shall sleep right well there he would say the image he has of his burial we perceive is of perfect visuality equal to what a defoe could do in imagining all is seen settled to the last minuteness the coffin is to be borne out by so and so at such and such a door this detachment is to fallin here that there in the attitude of cover arms musket inverted under left arm and the band is to play with all its blackamoors o haupt voll blut und wunden o head all bleeding wounded a dirge his majesty had liked who knew music and had a love for it after his sort good son of nature a dumb poet as i say always most dumb but real the value of him great and unknown in these babbling times it was on this same friday night that cochius was first sent for cochius and oesfeld with him about nine oclock  for the next three days saturday to monday when his cough and many sufferings would permit him friedrich wilhelm had long private dialogues with his son instructing him as was evident in the mysteries of state in what knowledge as to persons and to things he reckoned might be usefulest to him what the lessons were we know not the way of taking them had given pleasure to the old man he was heard to say perhaps more than once when the generals were called in and the dialogue interrupted for a while am not i happy to have such a son to leave behind me and the grimly sympathetic generals testified assent endeavored to talk a little could at least smoke and look friendly till the king gathered strength for continuing his instructions to his successor all else was as if settled with him this had still remained to do this once done finished monday night why not abdicate altogether and die disengaged be it in a day or in a month since that is now the one work left friedrich wilhelm does so purpose  his state now as all along was fluctuating uncertain restless he was heard murmuring prayers he would say sometimes pray for me betet betet and more than once in deep tone lord enter not into judgment with thy servant for in thy sight shall no man living be justified the wild son of nature looking into life and death into judgment and eternity finds that these things are very great this too is a characteristic trait in a certain german hymn why fret or murmur then the title of it which they often sang to him or along with him as he much loved it are these words naked i came into the world and naked shall i gono said he always with vivacity at this passage not quite nakid i shall have my uniform on let us be exact since we are at it after which the singing proceeded again the late graf alexander von wartenbergcaptain wartenberg whom we know and whose opportunitieswas wont to relate this busching in 1786 beitrage iv 100  tuesday 31st may about one in the morning cochius was again sent for he found the king in very pious mood but in great distress and afraid he might yet have much pain to suffer cochius prayed with him talked piously i can remember nothing said the king i cannot pray i have forgotten all my prayersprayer is not in words but in the thought of the heart said cochius and soothed the heavyladen man as he could fare you well said friedrich wilhelm at length most likely we shall not meet again in this world whereat cochius burst into tears and withdrew about four the king was again out of bed wished to see his youngest boy who had been ill of measles but was doing well poor little ferdinand adieu then my little child this is the father of that fine louis ferdinand who was killed at jena concerning whom berlin in certain emancipated circles of it still speaks with regret he the louis ferdinand had fine qualities but went far aroving into radicalism into romantic love into champagne and was cut down on the threshold of jena desperately fightingperhaps happily for him  from little ferdinands room friedrich wilhelm has himself rolled into queen sophies feekin o my feekin thou must rise this day and help me what thou canst this day i am going to die thou wilt be with me this day the good wife rises i know not that it was the first time she had been so called but it did prove the last friedrich wilhelm has decided as the first thing he will do to abdicate and all the official persons and companions of the sickroom pollnitz among them not long after sunrise are called to see it done pollnitz huddling on his clothes arrived about five in a corridor he sees the wheeledchair and poor sick king steps aside to let him pass it is over das ist vollbracht said the king looking up to me as he passed he had on his nightcap and a blue mantle thrown round him he was wheeled into his anteroom there let the company assemble many of them are already there  the royal stables are visible from this room friedrich wilhelm orders the horses to be ridden out you old furst of anhaltdessau my oldest friend you colonel hacke faithfulest of adjutantgenerals take each of you a horse the best you can pick out it is my last gift to you dessau in silence with dumbshow of thanks points to a horse any horse you have chosen the very worst said friedrich wilhelm take that other i will warrant him a good one the grim old dessauer thanks in silence speechless grief is on that stern gunpowder face and he seems even to be struggling with tears nay nay my friend friedrich wilhelm said this is a debt we have all to pay  the official people queen friedrich minister boden minister podewils and even pollnitz being now all present friedrich wilhelm makes his declaration at considerable length old general bredow repeating it aloud pollnitz ii 561 sentence by sentence the kings own voice being too weak so that all may hear that he abdicates gives up wholly in favor of his good son friedrich that foreign ambassadors are to be informed that you are all to be true and loyal to my son as you were to meand what else is needful to which the judicious podewils makes answer that there must first be a written deed of his high transaction executed which shall be straightway set about the deed once executed signed and sealedthe high royal will in all points takes effect alas before podewils has done speaking the king is like falling into a faint does faint and is carried to bed too unlikely any deed of abdication will be needed  ups and downs there still were sore fluctuating labor as the poor king struggles to his final rest this morning he was at the window again when the wachtparade grenadiers on guard turned out he saw them make their evolutions for the last time pauli viii 280 after which new relapse new fluctuation it was about eleven oclock when cochius was again sent for the king lay speechless seemingly still conscious in bed cochius prays with fervor in a loud tone that the dying king may hear and join not so loud says the king rallying a little he had remembered that it was the season when his servants got their new liveries they had been ordered to appear this day in full new costume o vanity o vanity said friedrich wilhelm at sight of the ornamented plush pray for me pray for me my trust is in the saviour he often said his pains his weakness are great the cordage of a most tough heart rending itself piece by piece at one time he called for a mirror that is certainrugged wild man son of nature to the last the mirror was brought what he said at sight of his face is variously reported not so worn out as i thought is pollnitzs account and the likeliestthough perhaps he said several things ugly face as good as dead already and continued the inspection for some moments pollnitz ii 564 wilhelmina ii 321 a grim strange thing  feel mv pulse pitsch said he noticing the surgeon of his giants tell me how long this will lastalas not long answered pitschsay not alas but how do you he knowthe pulse is goneimpossible said he lifting his arm how could i move my fingers so if the pulse were gone pitsch looked mournfully steadfast herr jesu to thee i live herr jesu to thee i die in life and in death thou art my gain du bist mein gewinn these were the last words friedrich wilhelm spoke in this world he again fell into a faint eller gave a signal to the crownprince to take the queen away scarcely were they out of the room when the faint had deepened into death and friedrich wilhelm at rest from all his labors slept with the primeval sons of thor  no baresark of them nor odins self i think was a bit of truer human stuffi confess his value to me in these sad times is rare and great considering the usual histrionic papinsdigester truculentcharlatan and other species of kings alone attainable for the sunk flunky populations of an era given up to mammon and the worship of its own belly what would not such a population give for a friedrich wilhelm to guide it on the road back from orcus a little would give i have written but alas it ought to have been should give what they would give is too mournfully plain to me in spite of ballotboxes a steady and tremendous truth from the days of barabbas downwards and upwardstuesday 31st may 1740 between one and two oclock in the afternoon friedrich wilhelm died age fiftytwo coming 15th august next same day friedrich his son was proclaimed at berlin quilted heralds with sound of trumpet and the like doing what is customary on such occasions  on saturday 4th june the kings body is laid out in state all potsdam at liberty to come and see he lies there in his regimentals in his oaken coffin on a raised place in the middle of the room decent mortuary draperies lamps garlands banderols furnishing the room and him at his feet on a blackvelvet tabouret stool are the chivalry emblems helmet gauntlets spurs and on similar stools at the right hand and the left lie his military insignia hat and sash sword guidon and what else is fit around in silence sit nine veteran military dignitaries buddenbrock waldau derschau einsiedel and five others whom we omit to name silent they sit a grim earnest sight in the shine of the lamplight as you pass out of the june sun many went all day looked once again on the face that was to vanish precisely at ten at night the coffinlid is screwed down twelve potsdam captains take the coffin on their shoulders fourandtwenty corporals with wax torches fourandtwenty sergeants with inverted halberts lowered certain generals on order and very many following as volunteers these perform the actual burialcarry the body to the garrison church where are clergy waiting which is but a small step off see it lodged oak coffin and all in a marble coffin in the side vault there which is known to tourists pauli viii 281 it is the end of the week and the actual burial is donehastened forward for reasons we can guess  filial piety by no means intends to defraud a loved father of the spartan ceremonial contemplated as obsequies by him very far from it filial piety will conform to that with rigor only adding what musical and other splendors are possible to testify his love still more and so almost three weeks hence on the 23d of the month with the aid of dresden artists of latin cantatas and other pomps not inexcusable though somewhat out of keeping the due funeral is done no corpse but a wax effigy present in itand in all points that of the potsdam grenadiers not forgotten there was rigorous conformity to the instruction left in all points even to the extensive funeral dinner and drinking of the appointed cask of wine the best cask in my cellar adieu o king  the potsdam grenadiers fired their three volleys not plackering as i have reason to believe but well got their allowance dinnerliquor and appointed coin of money it was the last service required of them in this world that same night they were dissolved the whole four thousand of them at a stroke and ceased to exist as potsdam grenadiers colonels captains all the officers known to be of merit were advanced at least transferred of the common men a minority of not inhuman height and of worth otherwise were formed into a new regiment on the common terms the stupid splayfooted eightfeet mass were allowed to stalk off whither they pleased or vegetate on frugal pensions irish kirkman and a few others neither knockkneed nor without head were appointed heyducs that is porters to the kings or other palaces and did that duty in what was considered an ornamental manner  here are still two things capable of being fished up from the sea of nugatory matter and meditated on by readers till the following books open  the last breath of friedrich wilhelm having fled friedrich hurried to a private room sat there all in tears looking back through the gulfs of the past upon such a father now rapt away forever sad all and soft in the moonlight of memorythe lost loved one all in the right as we now see we all in the wrongthis it appears was the sons fixed opinion seven years hence here is how friedrich concludes the history of his father written with a loyal admiration throughout we have left under silence the domestic chagrins of this great prince readers must have some indulgence for the faults of the children in consideration of the virtues of such a father oeuvres i 174 memoires de brandebourg finished about 1747 all in tears he sits at present meditating these sad things  in a little while the old dessauer about to leave for dessau ventures in to the crownprince crownprince no longer embraces his knees offers weeping his condolence his congratulationhopes withal that his sons and he will be continued in their old posts and that he the old dessauer will have the same authority as in the late reign friedrichs eyes at this last clause flash out tearless strangely olympian in your posts i have no thought of making change in your posts yesand as to authority i know of none there can be but what resides in the king that is sovereign which as it were struck the breath out of the old dessauer and sent him home with a painful miscellany of feelings astonishment not wanting among them  at an after hour the same night friedrich went to berlin met by acclamation enough he slept there not without tumult of dreams one may fancy and on awakening next morning the first sound he heard was that of the regiment glasenap under his windows swearing fealty to the new king he sprang out of bed in a tempest of emotion bustled distractedly to and fro wildly weeping pollnitz who came into the anteroom found him in this state halfdressed with dishevelled hair in tears and as if beside himself these huzzaings only tell me what i have lost said the new kinghe was in great suffering suggested pollnitz he is now at rest true he suffered but he was here with us and now ranke ii 46 47 from certain fragments still in manuscript of pollnitss memoiren
