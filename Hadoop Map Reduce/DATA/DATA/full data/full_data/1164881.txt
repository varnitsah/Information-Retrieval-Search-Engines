1164881	the middy and the moors an algerine tale of piracy and slavery by rm ballantyne    robert michael ballantyne was born in 1825 and died in 1894  he was educated at the edinburgh academy and in 1841 he became a clerk with the hudson bay company working at the red river settlement in northen canada until 1847 arriving back in edinburgh in 1848  the letters he had written home were very amusing in their description of backwoods life and his family publishing connections suggested that he should construct a book based on these letters  three of his most enduring books were written over the next decade the young fur traders ungava the hudson bay company and were based on his experiences with the hbc  in this period he also wrote the coral island and martin rattler both of these taking place in places never visited by ballantyne  having been chided for small mistakes he made in these books he resolved always to visit the places he wrote about  with these books he became known as a great master of literature intended for teenagers  he researched the cornish mines the london fire brigade the postal service the railways the laying down of submarine telegraph cables the construction of lighthouses the lightship service the lifeboat service south africa norway the north sea fishing fleet ballooning deepsea diving algiers and many more experiencing the lives of the men and women in these settings by living with them for weeks and months at a time and he lived as they lived  he was a very truetolife author depicting the often squalid scenes he encountered with great care and attention to detail  his young readers looked forward eagerly to his next books and through the 1860s and 1870s there was a flow of books from his pen sometimes four in a year all very good reading  the rate of production diminished in the last ten or fifteen years of his life but the quality never failed  he published over ninety books under his own name and a few books for very young children under the pseudonym comus  for todays taste his books are perhaps a little too religious and what we would nowadays call pi  in part that was the way people wrote in those days but more important was the fact that in his days at the red river settlement in the wilds of canada he had been a little dissolute and he did not want his young readers to be unmindful of how they ought to behave as he felt he had been  some of his books were quite short little over 100 pages  these books formed a series intended for the children of poorer parents having less pocketmoney  these books are particularly wellwritten and researched because he wanted that readership to get the very best possible for their money  they were published as six series three books in each series  one of these series is on the coast which includes saved by the lifeboat  recreated as an etext by nick hodson july 2003    the middy and the moors an algerine tale of piracy and slavery by rm ballantyne    chapter one  an algerine story  the hero is blown away captured crushed comforted and astonished  one beautiful summer night about the beginning of the present century a young naval officer entered the public drawingroom of a hotel at nice and glanced round as if in search of some one  many people were assembled theresome in robust others in delicate health many in that condition which rendered it doubtful to which class they belonged but all engaged in the quiet buzz of conversation which in such a place is apt to set in after dinner  the young englishman for such he evidently was soon observed an elderly lady beckoning to him at the other end of the salon and was quickly seated between her and a fragile girl whose hand he gently took hold of  mother he said to the elderly lady im going to have a row on the mediterranean  the night is splendid the air balmy the stars gorgeous  now george interrupted the girl with a little smile dont be flowery  we know all about that  too bad returned the youth i never rise to poetry in your presence minnie without being snubbed  but you cannot cure me  romance is too deeply ingrained in my soul  poetry flows from me likelike anything i am a midshipman in the british navy a position which affords scope for the wildest enthusiasm andandill astonish you yet see if i dont  i am sure you will dear boy said his mother and she believed that he would  of course you will added his sister and she at least hoped that he would  to say truth there was nothing about the youthas regards appearance or characterwhich rendered either the assurance or the hope unwarrantable  he was not tall but he was strong and active  he was not exactly handsome but he was possessed of a genial hearty disposition a playful spirit and an earnest soul also a modestly reckless nature which was quite captivating  you wont be anxious about me mother if i dont return till pretty late he said rising  i want a good long refreshing pull but ill be back in time to say goodnight to you minnie before you go to sleep  your leave expires on thursday mind said his sister we cannot spare you long  i shall be back in good time trust me  au revoir he said with a pleasant nod as he left the room  and they did trust him for our midshipman george foster was trustworthy but those circumstances over which people have no control are troublesome derangers of the affairs of man  that was the last the mother and sister saw of george for the space of nearly two years  taking his way to the pebbly shore young foster hired a small boat or punt from a man who knew him well declined the owners services pushed off seized the oars and rowed swiftly out to sea  it was as he had said a splendid night  the stars bespangled the sky like diamonddust  the water was as clear as a mirror and the lights of nice seemed to shoot far down into its depths  the hum of the city came off with everdeepening softness as the distance from the shore increased  the occasional sound of oars was heard not far off though boats and rowers were invisible for there was no moon and the night was dark notwithstanding the starlight  there was no fear however of the young sailor losing himself while the city lights formed such a glorious beacon astern  after pulling steadily for an hour or more he rested on his oars gazed up at the bright heavens and then at the land lights which by that time resembled a twinkling line on the horizon  must bout ship now he muttered  wont do to keep minnie waiting  as he rowed leisurely landward a sudden gust of wind from the shore shivered the liquid mirror into fragments  it was the advanceguard of a squall which in a few minutes rushed down from the mountains of the riviera and swept out upon the darkening sea  young foster as we have said was strong  he was noted among his fellows as a splendid oarsman  the squall therefore did not disconcert him though it checked his speed greatly  after one or two lulls the wind increased to a gale and in half an hour the youth found with some anxiety that he was making no headway against it  the shore at that point was so much of a straight line as to render the hope of being able to slantin a faint one  as it was better however to attempt that than to row straight in the teeth of the gale he diverged towards a point a little to the eastward of the port of nice and succeeded in making better way through the water though he made no perceptible approach to land  pooh  its only a squallbe over in a minute said the middy by way of encouraging himself as he glanced over his shoulder at the flickering lights which were now barely visible  he was wrong  the gale increased  next time he glanced over his shoulder the lights were gone  dark clouds were gathering up from the northward and a short jabble of sea was rising which occasionally sent a spurt of spray inboard  feeling now that his only chance of regaining the shore lay in a strong steady persevering pull straight towards it he once more turned the bow of the little boat into the winds eye and gave way with a will  but what could human muscle and human will however powerful do against a rampant norwester  very soon our hero was forced to rest upon his oars from sheer exhaustion while his boat drifted slowly out to sea then the thought of his mother and minnie flashed upon him and with a sudden gush as it were of renewed strength he resumed his efforts and strained his powers to the uttermostbut all in vain  something akin to despair now seized on him for the alternative was to drift out into the open sea where no friendly island lay between him and the shores of africa  the necessity for active exertion however gave him no time either to rest or think  as the distance from land increased the seas rose higher and broke so frequently over the boat that it began to fill  to stop rowingat least to the extent of keeping the bow to the windwould have risked turning broadsideon and being overturned or swamped there was nothing therefore to be done in the circumstances except to keep the boats head to the wind and drift  in the midst of the rushing gale and surging seas he sat there every gleam of hope almost extinguished when there came to his mind a brief passage from the biblehope thou in god  many a time had his mother tried in days gone by to impress that text on his mind but apparently without success  now it arose before him like a beaconstar  at the same time he thought of the possibility that he might be seen and picked up by a passing vessel  he could not but feel however that the chances of this latter event occurring were small indeed for a passing ship or boat would not only be going at great speed but would be very unlikely to see his cockleshell in the darkness or to hear his cry in the roaring gale still he grasped that hope as the drowning man is said to clutch at a straw  and the hope was quickly fulfilled for scarcely had another halfhour elapsed when he observed a sailthe highpeaked sail peculiar to some mediterranean craftrise ghostlike out of the driving foam and spray  the vessel was making almost straight for him he knew that it would pass before there could be time to heave a rope  at the risk of being run down he rowed the punt in front of it as if courting destruction but at the same time guided his little craft so skilfully that it passed close to leeward where the vessels bulwarks were dipping into the water  our middys aim was so exact that the vessel only grazed the boat as it flew past  in that moment young foster sprang with the agility of a cat capsized the boat with the impulse caught the bulwarks and rigging of the vessel and in another moment stood panting on her deck  hallo  neptune what do you want here cried a gruff voice at fosters elbows  at the same time a powerful hand grasped his throat and a lantern was thrust in his face  let go and i will tell you gasped the youth restraining his indignation at such unnecessary violence  the grasp tightened however instead of relaxing  speak out babyface roared the voice referring in the latter expression no doubt to our heros juvenility  instead of speaking out george foster hit out and the voice with the lantern went down into the lee scuppers  then the glare of the lantern being removed from his eyes george saw by the light of the binnacle lamp that his adversary a savagelooking turkat least in dresswas gathering himself up for a rush and that the steersman a huge negro was grinning from ear to ear  go below said a deep stern voice in the arabic tongue  the effect of this order was to cause the turk with the broken lantern to change his mind and retire with humility while it solemnised the negro steersmans face almost miraculously  the speaker was the captain of the vessel a man of grave demeanour herculean mould and clothed in picturesque eastern costume  turning with quiet politeness to foster he asked him in broken french how he had come on board  the youth explained in french quite as much broken as that of his interrogator  dyou speak english he added  to this the captain replied in english still more shattered than his french that he could a ver leetil but that as he the youth was a prisoner there would be no occasion for speech at all the proper attitude of a prisoner being that of absolute silence and obedience to orders  a prisoner ejaculated foster on recovering from the first shock of surprise  do you know that i am an officer in the navy of his majesty the king of great britain  a gleam of satisfaction lighted up the swarthy features of the turk for a moment as he replied  ver goot  ransum all de more greater  as he spoke a call from the lookout at the bow of the vessel induced him to hurry forward  at the same instant a slight hissing sound caused foster to turn to the steersman whose black face was alive with intelligence while an indescribable hitch up of his chin seemed to beckon the youth to approach with caution  foster perceived at once that the man wished his communication whatever it was to be unobserved by any one he therefore moved towards him as if merely to glance at the compass  massa said the negro without looking at foster or changing a muscle of his now stolid visage yous in a dreffle fix  dis yer am a pirit but is not a pirit bress you  is wuss nor dat is a awrful hyperkrite an i wants to give you good adwice  wotiver you doos dont resist  youll ony git whacked if you do  thank you sambo  but what if i do resist in spite of being whacked  den you bery soon change your mind das all  moreober my names not sambo  it am peter de great  as he said so peter the great drew himself up to his full height and he drew himself up to six feet four when he did that  the captain coming aft at that moment put an abrupt end to the conversation  two powerful moorish seamen accompanied him  these without uttering a word seized foster by the arms  in the strength of his indignation our middy was on the point of commencing a tremendous struggle when peter the greats dont resist and the emphasis with which it had been spoken came to mind and he suddenly gave in  his hands were tied behind his back and he was led down into a small dimlylighted cabin where being permitted to sit down on a locker he was left to his own reflections  these were by no means agreeable as may well be supposed for he now knew that he had fallen into the hands of those pests the algerine pirates who at that time infested the mediterranean  with the thoughtlessness of youth foster had never troubled his mind much about the piratical city of algiers  of course he knew that it was a stronghold on the northern coast of africa inhabited by moorish rascals who taking advantage of their position issued from their port and pounced upon the merchantmen that entered the mediterranean confiscating their cargoes and enslaving their crews and passengers or holding them to ransom  he also knew or had heard that some of the great maritime powers paid subsidies to the dey of algiers to allow the vessels of their respective nations to come and go unmolested but he could scarcely credit the latter fact  it seemed to him as indeed it was preposterous  for said he to the brother middy who had given him the information would not the nations whom the dey had the impudence to tax join their fleets together pay him an afternoon visit one fine day and blow him and his moors and turks and city into a heap of rubbish  what the middy replied we have now no means of knowing but certain it is that his information was correct for some of the principal nations did at that time submit to the degradation of this tax and they did not unite their fleets for the extinction of the pirates  poor george foster now began to find out that the terrible truths which he had refused to believe were indeed great realities and had now begun to affect himself  he experienced an awful sinking of the heart when it occurred to him that no one would ever know anything about his fate for the little boat would be sure to be found bottom up sooner or later and it would of course be assumed that he had been drowned  shall it be said that the young midshipman was weak or wanting in courage because he bowed his head and wept when the full force of his condition came home to him  nay verily for there was far more of grief for the prolonged agony that was in store for his mother and sister than for the fate that awaited himself  he prayed as well as wept  god help meand them he exclaimed aloud  the prayer was brief but sincereperhaps the more sincere because so brief  at all events it was that acknowledgment of utter helplessness which secures the help of the almighty arm  growing weary at last he stretched himself on the locker and with the facility of robust health fell into a sound sleep  youth strength and health are not easily incommoded by wet garments  besides the weather was unusually warm at the time  how long he slept he could not tell but the sun was high when he awoke and his clothes were quite dry  other signs there were that he had slept long such as the steadiness of the breeze and the more regular motion of the vessel which showed that the gale was over and the sea going down  there was also a powerful sensation in what he styled his breadbasketthough it might with equal truth have been called his meatandvegetable basketwhich told him more eloquently than anything else of the lapse of time  rising from his hard couch and endeavouring to relieve the aching of the bound arms by change of position he observed that the cabin hatch was open and that nothing prevented his going on deck if so disposed accordingly he ascended though with some difficulty owing to his not having been trained to climb a ladder in a rough sea without the use of his hands  a moor he observed had taken his friend peter the greats place at the tiller and the captain stood near the stern observing a passing vessel a stiffish but steady breeze carried them swiftly over the waves which we might say laughingly reflected the bright sunshine and the deepblue sky  several vessels of different rigs and nationalities were sailing in various directions both near and far away  going straight to the captain with an air of goodhumoured sang froid which was peculiar to him foster said  captain dont you think ive had these bits of ropeyarn on my wrists long enough  im not used you see to walking the deck without the use of my hands and a heavy lurch as like as not would send me slap into the lee scupperssailor though i be  besides i wont jump overboard without leave you may rely upon that  neither will i attempt singlehanded to fight your whole crew so you neednt be afraid  the stern moor evidently understood part of this speech and he was so tickled with the last remark that his habitual gravity gave place to the faintest flicker of a smile while a twinkle gleamed for a moment in his eye  only for a moment however  pointing over the side he bade his prisoner look  foster looked and beheld in the far distance a threemasted vessel that seemed to bear a strong resemblance to a british manofwar  you promise said the captain not shout or roar  i promise answered our middy neither to shout nor roarfor my doing either even though like a bull of bashan would be of no earthly use at this distance  inglesemans said the captain niver brok the word  after paying this scarcelydeserved compliment he gave an order to a sailor who was coiling up ropes near him and the man at once proceeded to untie fosters bonds  my good fellow said the midshipman observing that his liberator was the man whom he had knocked down the night before im sorry i had to floor you but it was impossible to help it you know  an englishman is like a bulldog  he wont suffer himself to be seized by the throat and choked if he can help it  the turk who was evidently a renegade briton made no reply whatever to this address but after casting the lashings loose returned to his former occupation  foster proceeded to thank the captain for his courtesy and make him acquainted with the state of his appetite but he was evidently not in a conversational frame of mind  before a few words had been spoken the captain stopped him and pointing down the skylight said sharply  brukfust  go  both look and tone admonished our hero to obey  he descended to the cabin therefore without finishing his sentence and there discovered that brukfust consisted of two seabiscuits and a mug of water  to these dainties he applied himself with infinite relish for he had always been spartanlike as to the quality of his food and hunger makes almost any kind of dish agreeable  while thus engaged he heard a hurried trampling of feet on deck mingled with sharp orders from the captain  at first he thought the sounds might have reference to taking in a reef to prepare for a squall but as the noise rather increased his curiosity was roused and he was about to return on deck when peter the great suddenly leaped into the cabin and took hurriedly from the opposite locker a brace of highly ornamented pistols and a scimitar  whats wrong peter asked foster starting up  wes agoin to fight groaned the negro  oh  is a awrful hyperkrite  you stop where you am massa else youll get whacked  despite the risk of being whacked the youth would have followed the negro on deck had not the hatch been slammed in his face and secured next moment he heard a volley of musketry on deck  it was instantly replied to by a distant volley and immediately thereafter groans and curses showed that the firing had not been without effect  that the pirate had engaged a vessel of some sort was evident and our hero being naturally anxious to see if not to share in the fight tried hard to get out of his prison but without success  he was obliged therefore to sit there inactive and listen to the wild confusion overhead  at last there came a crash followed by fiercer shouts and cries  he knew that the vessels had met and that the pirates were boarding  in a few minutes comparative silence ensued broken only by occasional footsteps and the groaning of the wounded    chapter two  among piratesenslaved  when george foster was again permitted to go on deck the sight that he beheld was not calculated to comfort him in his misfortunes  several moorish seamen were going about with bared legs and arms swishing water on the decks and swabbing up the blood with which they were bespattered  most of these men were more or less wounded and bandaged for the crew of the merchantman they had attacked had offered a desperate resistance knowing well the fate in store for them if captured  the said merchantman a large brig sailed close alongside of the pirate vessel with a prize crew on board  her own men who were russians had been put in chains in the fore part of their vessel under the forecastle so as to be out of sight  her officers and several passengers had been removed to the pirates quarterdeck  among them were an old gentleman of dignified bearing and an elderly lady who seemed to be supported physically as well as mentally by a tall darkcomplexioned noblelooking girl who was evidently the daughter of the old gentleman though whether also the daughter of the elderly lady young foster could not discover there being little or no resemblance between them  the memory of his mother and sister strongly inclined the sympathetic midshipman to approach the party and offer words of consolation to the ladies  as he advanced to them for that purpose a doubt as to which language he should use assailed him  french he knew was the language most likely to be understood but a girl with such magnificent black eyes must certainly be spanish  his knowledge of spanish was about equal to that of an illtrained parrot but what of that  was he not a briton whose chief characteristic is to go in for anything and stick at nothing  we do not venture to write down what he said but when he had said it the blank look of the elderly lady and the peculiar look of the girl induced him to repeat the speech in his brokenhis very much broken french whereupon the old gentleman turned to him gravely and said  my vife is engleesh an my datter is danishno not joostvell she is afanaf  speak to dem in your nattif tong  you are not english anyhow old boy thought foster as he turned with a mingled feeling of confusion and recklessness to the elderly lady  pardon me madam he said but from the appearance ofofyour  he was interrupted at this point by the captain who flushed and bloodbespattered from the recent fight came aft with a drawn scimitar in his hand and sternly ordered the young midshipman to go forward  it was a humiliating position to be placed in yet despite the stickatnothing spirit he felt constrained to obey but did so nevertheless with an air of defiant ferocity which relieved his feelings to some extent  the said feelings were utterly ignored by the pirate captain who did not condescend even to look at him after the first glance but turned to the other captives and ordered them in rather less stern tones to go below an order which was promptly obeyed  on reaching the fore part of the vessel foster found several of the crew engaged in bandaging each others wounds and from the clumsy way in which they went to work it was very clear that they were much more accustomed to inflict wounds than to bandage them  now it must be told that although george foster was not a surgeon he had an elder brother who was and with whom he had associated constantly while he was studying and practising for his degree hence he became acquainted with many useful facts and modes of action connected with the healing art of which the world at large is ignorant  perceiving that one of the pirates was bungling a very simple operation he stepped forward and with that assurance which results naturally from the combination of conscious power and cheek took up the dressing of the wound  at first the men seemed inclined to resent the interference but when they saw that the christian knew what he was about and observed how well and swiftly he did the work they stood aside and calmly submitted  foster was interrupted however in the midst of his philanthropic work by peter the great who came forward and touched him on the shoulder  sorry to trupt you sar but you come wid me  maynt i finish this operation first said foster looking up  no sar  my orders is prumptory  our amateur surgeon dropped the bandage indignantly and followed the negro who led him down into the hold at the further and dark end of which he saw several wounded men lying and beside them one or two whose motionless and straightened figures seemed to indicate that death had relieved them from earthly troubles  amongst these men he spent the night and all next day with only a couple of biscuits and a mug of water to sustain him  next evening peter the great came down and bade him follow him to the other end of the hold  now sar you go in dere said the negro stopping and pointing to a small door in the bulkhead inside of which was profound darkness  foster hesitated and looked at his big conductor  bey orders sar said the negro in a loud stern voice of command then stooping as if to open the little door he added in a low voice don be a fool massa  submit  das de word if you don want a whackin  its a friend advises you  deres one oder prisoner dere but hes wounded an wont hurt you  go in wont you  peter the great accompanied the last words with a violent thrust that sent the hapless middy headlong into the dark hole but as he closed and fastened the door he muttered don mind my leetle ways massa  you know is bound to be a hyperkrite  having thus relieved his conscience peter returned to the deck leaving the poor prisoner to rise and as a first consequence to hit his head on the beams above him  the hole into which he had been thrust was truly a black hole though neither so hot nor so deadly as that of calcutta  extending his arms cautiously he touched the side of the ship with his left hand with the other he felt about for some time but reached nothing until he had advanced a step when his foot touched something on the floor and he bent down to feel it but shrank hastily back on touching what he perceived at once was a human form  pardon me friend whoever you are he said quickly i did not mean toi did not knoware you badly hurt  but no reply came from the wounded mannot even a groan  a vague suspicion crossed fosters mind  the man might be dying of his wounds  he spoke to him again in french and spanish but still got no reply  then he listened intently for his breathing but all was as silent as the tomb  with an irresistible impulse yet instinctive shudder he laid his hand on the man and passed it up until it reached the face  the silence was then explained  the face was growing cold and rigid in death  drawing back hastily the poor youth shouted to those outside to let them know what had occurred but no one paid the least attention to him he was about to renew his cries more loudly when the thought occurred that perhaps they might attribute them to fear  this kept him quiet and he made up his mind to endure in silence  if there had been a ray of light however feeble in the hold he thought his condition would have been more bearable for then he could have faced the lifeless clay and looked at it but to know that it was there within a foot of him without his being able to see it or to form any idea of what it was like made the case terrible indeed  of course he drew back from it as far as the little space allowed and crushed himself up against the side of the vessel but that did no good for the idea occurred to his excited brain that it might possibly come to life again rise up and plunge against him  at times this thought took such possession of him that he threw up his arms to defend himself from attack and uttered a halfsuppressed cry of terror  at last nature asserted herself and he slept sitting on the floor and leaning partly against the vessels side partly against the bulkhead but horrible dreams disturbed him  the corpse became visible the eyes glared at him the bloodstained face worked convulsively and he awoke with a shriek followed immediately by a sigh of relief on finding that it was all a dream  then the horror came again as he suddenly remembered that the dead man was still there a terrible reality  at last pure exhaustion threw him into a dreamless and profound slumber the plunging of the little craft as it flew southward before a stiff breeze did not disturb him and he did not awake until some one rudely seized his arm late on the following day  then in the firm belief that his dream had come true at last he uttered a tremendous yell and struggled to rise but a powerful hand held him down and a dark lantern revealed a coalblack face gazing at him  hallo massa hold on  i did tink you mus be gone dead for i hollerd in at you nuff to bust de kittledrum ob your earif you hab one  look there peter said foster pointing to the recumbent figure while he wiped the perspiration from his brow  ah poor feller  he gone de way ob all flesh but he hoed sooner dan dere was any occasion fortanks to de captain  as he spoke he held the lantern over the dead man and revealed the face of a youth in eastern garb on whose head there was a terrible swordcut  as they looked at the sad spectacle and endeavoured to arrange the corpse the negro explained that the poor fellow had been a greek captive who to save his life had joined the pirates and become a mussulman but on thinking over it had returned to the christian faith and refused to take part in the bloody work which they were required to do  it was his refusal to fight on the occasion of the recent attack on the merchantman that had induced the captain to cut him down  he had been put into the prison in the hold and carelessly left there to bleed to death  now you come along massa said the negro taking up the lantern wes all goin on shore  on shore  where have we got to  to algiers de city ob pirits de hotbed ob wickedness de home ob de moors an turks an cabyles and de cuss ob de whole wurld  poor fosters heart sank on hearing this for he had heard of the hopeless slavery to which thousands of christians had been consigned there in time past and his recent experience of moors had not tended to improve his opinion of them  a feeling of despair impelled him to seize the negro by the arm as he was about to ascend the ladder and stop him  peter he said i think you have a friendly feeling towards me because youve called me massa more than once though you have no occasion to do so  dats cause im fond o you  i always was fond o a nice smood young babby face an i tooked a fancy to you de moment i see you knock joe spinks into de lee scuppers  sohe was an englishman that i treated so badly eh  yes massa ony you didnt treat him bad nuff  but you obsarve dat i ony calls you massa wen wes alone an friendly like  wen wes in public i calls you sar an speak gruff an shove you into black holes  and why do you act so peter  cause dont you see is a hyperkrite  i tole you dat before  well i can guess what you mean  you dont want to appear too friendly  just so  well now i have got nobody to take my part here so as you are a free man i wish you would keep an eye on me when we go ashore and see where they send me and speak a word for me when it is in your power  you see theyll give me up for drowned at home and never find out that im here  a free man repeated the negro with an expansion of his mouth that is indescribable  you tink is a free man but is a slabe same as yourself ony de diffrence am dat deres nobody to ransum me so dey dont boder deir heads bout me slong as i do my work  if i dont do my work im whacked if i rebel and kick up a shindy im whacked wuss if i tries to run away im whacked till im dead  das all  but is not free  no no not at all  howsever is freeaneasy an dat make de pirits fond o me which goes a long way for deres nuffin like lub  foster heartily agreed with the latter sentiment and added  well now peter i will say no more for as you profess to be fond of me and as i can truly say the same in regard to you we may be sure that each will help the other if he gets the chance  but tell me are you really one of the crew of this pirate vessel  no massa only for dis viage  i blongs to a old sinner called hassan what libs in de country not far from de town  he not a bad feller but hes obsnitoh as obsnit as a deaf an dumb mule  if you want im to go one way just tell him to go toder wayan youve got im  at that moment the captains voice was heard shouting down the hatchway demanding to know what detained the negro and his prisoners  he spoke in that jumble of languages in use at that time among the mediterranean nations called lingua franca for the negro did not understand arabic  comin captain comin cried the negro in his own peculiar englishwhich was indeed his mother tongue for he had been born in the united states of america  now den sar to foster wen you goin to move you stumps  up wid you  peter emphasised his orders with a real kick which expedited his prisoners ascent and at the same time justified the negros claim to be a thoroughpaced hyperkrite  wheres the other one demanded the captain angrily  escaped captain answered peter  how  you must have helped him cried the captain drawing his everready sword and pointing it at the breast of the negro who fell upon his knees clasped his great hands and rolled his eyes in an apparent agony of terror  dont captain  i isnt wuth killin an wen is gone whod cook for you like me  de man escaped by jumpin out ob his body  hes gone dead  fool muttered the pirate returning his sword to its sheath bind that prisoner and have him and the others ready to go on shore directly  in a few seconds all the prisoners were ranged between the cabin hatchway and the mast  the hands of most of the men were loosely tied to prevent trouble in case desperation should impel any of them to assault their captors but the old dane and the women were left unfettered  and now george foster beheld for the first time the celebrated city which was at that period the terror of the merchant vessels of all nations that had dealings with the mediterranean shores  a small pier and breakwater enclosed a harbour which was crowded with boats and shipping  from this harbour the town rose abruptly on the side of a steep hill and was surrounded by walls of great strength which bristled with cannon  the houses were small and squarelooking and in the midst here and there clusters of datepalms told of the almost tropical character of the climate while numerous domes minarets and crescents told of the moor and the religion of mohammed  but religion in its true sense had little footing in that piratical city which subsisted on robbery and violence while cruelty and injustice of the grossest kind were rampant  whatever islamism may have taught them it did not produce men or women who held the golden rule to be a virtue and certainly few practised it  yet we would not be understood to mean that there were none who did so  as there were christians in days of old even in caesars household so there existed men and women who were distinguished by the christian graces even in the pirate city  even there god had not left himself without a witness  as the vessel slowly entered the harbour under a very light breeze she was boarded by several stately officers in the picturesque costume turbans red leathern boots etceterapeculiar to the country  after speaking a few minutes with the captain one of the officers politely addressed the old dane and his family through an interpreter but as they spoke in subdued tones foster could not make out what was said soon he was interrupted by a harsh order from an unknown moor in an unknown tongue  an angry order invariably raised in our hero the spirit of rebellion he flushed and turned a fierce look on the moor but that haughty and grave individual was accustomed to such looks  he merely repeated his order in a quiet voice at the same time translating it by pointing to the boat alongside  foster felt that discretion was the better part of valour all the more that there stood at the moors back five or six powerful arabs who seemed quite ready to enforce his instructions  the poor middy glanced round to see if his only friend peter the great was visible but he was not so with a flushed countenance at thus being compelled to put his pride in his pocket he jumped into the boat not caring very much whether he should break his neck by doing so with tied hands or fall into the sea and end his life in a sharks maw  in a few minutes he was landed on the mole or pier and made to join a band of captives apparently from many nations who already stood waiting there  immediately afterwards the band was ordered to move on and as they marched through the great gateway in the massive walls foster felt as if he were entering the portals of dantes inferno and had left all hope behind  but his feelings misled him  hope thank god is not easily extinguished in the human breast  as he tramped along the narrow and winding streets which seemed to him an absolute labyrinth he began to take interest in the curious sights and sounds that greeted him on every side and his mind was thus a little taken off himself  and there was indeed much there to interest a youth who had never seen eastern manners or customs before  narrow and steep though the streets werein some cases so steep that they formed flights of what may be styled broad and shallow stairsthey were crowded with bronzed men in varied eastern costume moors in fez and gay vest and red morocco slippers turks with turban and pipe cabyles from the mountains arabs from the plains watercarriers with jar on shoulder jews in sombre robes jewesses with rich shawls and silk kerchiefs as headgear donkeys with panniers that almost blocked the way camels and veiled women and many other strange sights that our hero had up to that time only seen in picturebooks  presently the band of captives halted before a small door which was thickly studded with large nails  it seemed to form the only opening in a high dead wall with the exception of two holes about a foot square which served as windows  this was the bagnio or prison in which the slaves were put each evening after the days labour was over there to feed and rest on the stone floor until daylight should call them forth again to renewed toil  it was a gloomy courtyard with cells around it in which the captives slept  a fountain in the middle kept the floor damp and seemed to prove an attraction to various centipedes scorpions and other noisome creatures which were crawling about  here the captives just arrived had their bonds removed and were left to their own devices each having received two rolls of black bread before the jailor retired and locked them up for the night  taking possession of an empty cell george foster sat down on the stone floor and gazed at the wretched creatures around him many of whom were devouring their black bread with ravenous haste  the poor youth could hardly believe his eyes and it was some time before he could convince himself that the whole thing was not a dream but a terrible reality    chapter three  the bagnioour hero sees something of misery and is sold as a slave  there are some things in this world so unbelievable that even when we know them to be true we still remain in a state of semiscepticism  when our unfortunate midshipman awoke next morning raised himself on his elbow and felt that all his bones and muscles were stiff and pained from lying on a stone floor it was some time before he could make out where he was or recall the events of the last few days  the first thing that revived his sluggish memory was the scuttling away in anxious haste of a scorpion that had sought and found comfortable quarters during the night under the lee of his right leg  starting up he crushed the reptile with his foot  you will get used to that said a quietly sarcastic voice with a slightly foreign accent close to him  the speaker was a middleaged man with grey hair hollow cheeks and deep sunken eyes  they trouble us a little at first he continued but as i have said we get used to them  it is long since i cared for scorpions  have you then been long here asked foster  yes  twelve years  a prisonera slave asked the midshipman anxiously  a prisoner yes  a slave yesa mummified man a dead thing with life enough to work but not yet quite a brute mores the pity for then i should not care  but here i have been for twelve yearslong long years  it has seemed to me an eternity  it is a long time to be a slave  god help you poor man exclaimed foster  you will have to offer that prayer for yourself young man returned the other you will need help more than i  at first we are fools but time makes us wise  it even teaches englishmen that they are not unconquerable  the man spoke pointedly and in a harsh sarcastic tone which tended to check fosters newborn compassion nevertheless he continued to address his fellowsufferer in a sympathetic spirit  you are not an englishman i think he said though you speak our language well  no i am french but my wife is english  your wife  is she here also  thank godno replied the frenchman with a sudden burst of seriousness which was evidently genuine  she is in england trying to make up the sum of my ransom  but she will never do it  she is poor she has her daughter to provide for besides herself and we have no friends  no i have hoped for twelve years and hope is now dead nearly dead  the overwhelming thoughts that this information raised in fosters mind rendered him silent for a few minutes  the idea of the poor wife in england toiling for twelve years almost hopelessly to ransom her husband filled his susceptible heart with pity  then the thought of his mother and minniewho were also poortoiling for years to procure his ransom filled him with oppressive dread  to throw the depressing subject off his mind he asked how the frenchman had guessed that he was an englishman before he had heard him speak  i know your countrymen he answered by their bearing  besides you have been muttering in your sleep about mother and minnie  if the latter is as i suppose your sweetheartyour fianceethe sooner you get her out of your mind the better for you will never see her more  again foster felt repelled by the harsh cynicism of the man yet at the same time he felt strangely attracted to him a fact which he showed more by his tones than his words when he said  my friend you are not yet enrolled among the infallible prophets whether i shall ever again see those whom i love depends upon the will of god  but i dont wonder that with your sad experience you should give way to despair  for myself i will cling to the hope that god will deliver me and i would advise you to do the same  how many i have seen who had the sanguine temperament like yours awakened and crushed returned the frenchman  see there is one of them he added pointing to a cell nearly opposite in which a form was seen lying on its back straight and motionless  that young man was such another as you are when he first came here  is he dead asked the midshipman with a look of pity  yeshe died in the night while you slept  it was attending to him in his last moments that kept me awake  he was nothing to me but a fellowslave and sufferer but i was fond of him  he was hard to conquer but they managed it at last for they beat him to death  then they did not conquer him exclaimed foster with a gush of indignant pity  to beat a man to death is to murder not to conquer but you called him a young man  the corpse that lies there has thin grey hair and a wrinkled brow  nevertheless he was youngnot more than twentysevenbut six years of this life brought him to what you see  he might have lived longer as i have had he been submissive  before foster could reply the grating of a rusty key in the door caused a movement as well as one or two sighs and groans among the slaves for the keepers had come to summon them to work  the frenchman rose and followed the others with a hook of sullen indifference  most of them were without fetters but a few strong young men wore chains and fetters more or less heavy and foster judged from this circumstance as well as their expressions that these were rebellious subjects whom it was difficult to tame  much to his surprise the youth found that he was not called on to join his comrades in misfortune but was left behind in solitude  while casting about in his mind as to what this could mean he observed in a corner the two rolls of black bread which he had received the previous night and which not being hungry at the time he had neglected  as a healthy appetite was by that time obtruding itself on his attention he took hold of one and began to eat  it was not attractive but not being particular he consumed it  he even took up the other and ate that also after which he sighed and wished for more  as there was no more to be had he went to the fountain in the court and washed his breakfast down with water  about two hours later the door was again opened and a man in the uniform of a janissary entered  fixing a keen glance on the young captive he bade him in broken english rise and follow  by this time the lesson of submission had been sufficiently impressed on our hero to induce him to accord prompt obedience  he followed his guide into the street where he walked along until they arrived at a square on one side of which stood a large mosque  here marketing was being carried on to a considerable extent and as he threaded his way through the various groups he could not help being impressed with the extreme simplicity of the mode of procedure for it seemed to him that all a man wanted to enable him to set himself up in trade was a few articles of any kindold or new it did not matter whichwith a days lease of about four feet square of the market pavement  there the retail trader squatted smoked his pipe and calmly awaited the decrees of fate  one of these small traders he noted particularly while his conductor stopped to converse with a friend  he was an old man evidently a descendant of ishmael and clothed in what seemed to be a ragged castoff suit that had belonged to abraham or isaac  he carried his shop on his arm in the shape of a basket out of which he took a little bit of carpet and spread it close to where they stood  on this he sat down and slowly extracted from his basket and spread on the ground before him a couple of old locks several knives an old brass candlestick an assortment of rusty keys a flatiron and half a dozen other articles of household furniture  before any purchases were made however the janissary moved on and foster had to follow  passing through two or three tortuous and narrow lanes which however were thickly studded with shopsthat is with holes in the wall in which merchandise was displayed outside as well as inthey came to a door which was strictly guarded  passing the guards they found themselves in a court beyond which they could see another court which looked like a hall of justiceor injustice as the case might be  what strengthened foster in the belief that such was its character was the fact that at the time they entered an officer was sitting crosslegged on a bench smoking comfortably while in front of him a man lay on his face with his soles turned upwards whilst an executioner was applying to them the punishment of the bastinado  the culprit could not have been a great offender for after a sharp yell or two he was allowed to rise and limp away  our hero was led before the functionary who looked like a judge  he regarded the middy with no favour  we should have recorded that foster when blown out to sea as already described had leaped on the pirates deck without coat or vest  as he was still in this dismantled condition and had neither been washed nor combed since that event occurred his appearance at this time was not prepossessing  who are you and where do you come from was the first question put by an interpreter  of course foster told the exact truth about himself  after he had done so the judge and interpreter consulted together glancing darkly at their prisoner the while  then the judge smiled significantly and nodded his head  the interpreter turned to a couple of negroes who stood ready to execute any commands apparently and said a few words to them  they at once took hold of foster and fastened a rope to his wrist  as they did so the interpreter turned to the poor youth and said  what you tell is all lies  indeed indeed it is not exclaimed the midshipman fervently  go said the interpreter  a twitch from the rope at the same moment recalled our hero to his right mind and the remembrance of the poor wretch who had just suffered the bastinado and also of peter the greats oftrepeated reference to whacking had the effect of crushing the spirit of rebellion which had just begun to arise in his breast  thus he was conducted ignominiously into the street and back to the marketsquare where he was made to stand with a number of other men who like himself appeared to be slaves  for what they were there waiting he could not tell but he was soon enlightened as after half an hour a dignifiedlooking moor in flowing apparel came forward examined one of the captives felt his muscles made him open his mouth and otherwise show his paces after which he paid a sum of money for him and a negro attendant led him away  im to be sold as a slave foster involuntarily groaned aloud  like all the rest of us growled a stout sailorlike man who stood at his elbow  foster turned quickly to look at him but a sudden movement in the group separated them after the first glance at each other  by way of relieving his overcharged feelings he tried to interest himself in the passersby  this however he found very difficult until he observed a sturdy young cabyle coming along with two enormous feathery bundles suspended over his right shoulder one hanging before the other behind  to his surprise these bundles turned out to be living fowls tied by the legs and hanging with their heads down  there could not he thought have been fewer than thirty or forty birds in each bundle and it occurred to him at once that they had probably been carried to market thus from some distance in the country  at all events the young cabyle seemed to be dusty and warm with walking  he even seemed fatigued for when about to pass the group of slaves he stopped to rest and flung down his load  the shock of the fall must have snapped a number of legs for a tremendous cackle burst from the bundles as they struck the ground  this raised the thought in fosters mind that he could hope for no mercy where such wanton cruelty was not even deemed worthy of notice by the bystanders but the sound of a familiar voice put all other thoughts to flight  dis way massa yous sure to git fussrate fellers here  we brought im in ony yesterdayall fresh like newlaid eggs  the speaker was peter the great  the man to whom he spoke was a moor of tall stature and of somewhat advanced years  delighted more than he could express in his degraded and forlorn condition at this unlookedfor meeting with his black friend foster was about to claim acquaintance when the negro advanced to the group among whom he stood exclaiming loudly  here dey am massa dis way  then turning suddenly on foster with a fierce expression he shouted what you lookin at you babbyfaced ijit  hab you nebber seen a handsome nigger before dat you look all tunderstruck of a heap  cant you hold your tongue you chatterin monkey and with that although foster had not uttered a syllable the negro fetched him a sounding smack on the cheek to the great amusement of the bystanders  well was it then for our middy that it flashed into his mind that peter the great being the most astounding hyperkrite on earth was at work in his deceptive way else would he have certainly retaliated and brought on himself swift punishmentfor slaves were not permitted to resent injuries or create riots  as it was he cast down his eyes flushed scarlet and restrained himself  now massa continued the negro turning to the fine sailorlike man who had spoken to foster a few minutes before heres a nicelookin man  strong an healfyfit for anyting no doubt  ask him if he understands gardening said the moor  we may remark in passing that peter the great and his owner had a peculiar mode of carrying on conversation  the latter addressed his slave in the lingua franca while peter replied in his own nigger english which the moor appeared to understand perfectly  why they carried it on thus we cannot explain but it is our duty to record the fact  understand gardening exclaimed the sailor in supreme contempt i should think not  wot dyou take me for you black baboon  do i look like a gardener  ploughin an diggin i knows nothin about wotsomever though i have ploughed the waves many a day an im considered a fustrate hand at diggin into wittles  oh massa das de man for your money  buy him quick cried the negro with a look of earnest entreaty at his master  he say hes ploughed many a day ans a fussrate hand at diggin  do buy im  but the moor would not buy him  either he understood the sailors language to some extent or that inveterate obstinacy of which peter had made mention as being part of his character was beginning to assert itself  ask this one what he knows about it said the moor pointing to a thin young man whose sprightly expression showed that he had not yet fully realised what fate was in store for him in the pirates stronghold  wich is it you mean massa dis one said peter purposely mistaking and turning to foster  oh you neednt ask about him  he not wuff his salt  i could tell him at a mile off for a lazy useless feller gib more trouble dan hes wuff  dere now dis looks a far better man he added laying hold of the thin sprightly youth and turning him round what dye tink ob dis one  i told you to ask that one replied the moor sharply  can you do gardenin you feller asked peter  oui ouiun peu replied the youth who happened to be french but understood english  none ob your weewees an poopoos to me  cant you speak english  oui yes i gardin ver leetle  jus so  das de man for us massa if you wont hab de oder  i likes de look ob im  i dont tink hell be hard on de wittles an hes so tin dat he wont puspire much when he works in de sun in summer  do buy him massa  but massa would not buy him and looked hard for some time at our hero  i see how it am said the negro growing sulky  you set your heart on dat useless ijit  do come away massa it ud break my heart to lib wid sich a feller  this seemed to clinch the matter for the moor purchased the objectionable slave ordered peter the great to bring him along and left the marketplace  didnt i tell you is de greatest hyperkrite as ever was born said peter in a low voice when sufficiently far in rear to prevent being overheard by his master  you certainly did replied foster who felt something almost like satisfaction at this change in his fate you are the most perfect hypocrite that i ever came across and i am not sorry for it  only i hope you wont deceive your friends  honour bright said the negro with a roll of the eyes and a solemnity of expression that told far more than words could express  can you tell me asked the middy as they walked along what has become of that finelooking girl that was captured with her father and mother by your captain  dont say my captain sar replied peter sternly  he no captain ob mine  i was ony loaned to him  but i knows nuffin ob de gall  bery likely shes de deys fortysecond wife by dis time  hush look sulky he added quickly observing that his master was looking back  poor foster found himself under the necessity of following his black friends lead and acting the hyperkrite in order to prevent their friendship being discovered  he did it with a bad grace it is true but felt that for his friends sake if not his own he was bound to comply  so he put on an expression which his cheery face had not known since that period of infancy when his frequent demands for sugar were not gratified  wheels worked within wheels however for he felt so disgusted with the part he had to play that he got into the sulks naturally  fussrate whispered peter yous amost as good as myself  by this time they had reached one of the eastern gates of the city  it was named babazoun  as they passed through it the negro told his brotherslave that the large iron hooks which ornamented the wall there were used for the purpose of having criminals cast on them the wretched victims being left to hang there by whatever parts of their bodies chanced to catch on the hooks till they died  having reached the open country outside the walls they walked along a beautiful road from which were obtained here and there splendid views of the surrounding country  on one side lay the blue mediterranean with its picturesque boats and shipping and the white city descending to the very edge of the sea on the other side rose the wooded slopes of a suburb named mustapha with numerous white moorish houses in the midst of luxuriant gardens where palms bananas cypresses aloes lemontrees and orange groves perfumed the balmy air and afforded grateful shade from the glare of the african sun  into one of those gardens the moor at last turned and led the way to a house which if not in itself beautiful according to european notions of architecture was at least rendered cheerful with whitewash and stood in the midst of a beauty and luxuriance of vegetation that could not be surpassed  opening a door in this building the turk entered  his slaves followed and foster to his surprise found what may be styled a miniature garden in the courtyard within    chapter four  our middy is put to workalso put on his wordofhonour and receives a great shock of surprise  george foster soon found that his master and owner benahmed was a stern and exacting but by no means an illnatured or cruel man  he appeared to be considerably over sixty years of age but showed no signs of abated vigour  in character he was amiable and just according to his light but dignified and reticent  his first act after seating himself crosslegged on a carpet in a marble and tessellated recess was to call for a hookah  he smoked that for a few minutes and contemplated the courtyard on which the recess opened  it was a pleasant object of contemplation being filled with young orangetrees and creeping plants of a tropical kind which were watered by a stone fountain in the centre of the court  this fountain also served to replenish a marble bath to cool the sultry air and to make pleasant tinkling music  of course the nose was not forgotten in this luxurious assemblage of things that were gratifying to ear and eye flowers of many kinds were scattered around and sweetscented plants perfumed the air  benahmeds next act after having lighted his pipe was to summon peter the great and his new slavethe former to act as interpreter for it was a peculiarity of this moor that though he appeared to understand english he would not condescend to speak it  after asking several questions as to our heros name age and calling in life he told peter to inform foster that escape from that country was impossible that any attempt to escape would be punished with flogging and other torture that perseverance in such attempts would result in his being sent to work in chains with the bagnio slaves and would probably end in death from excessive toil torture and partial starvation  having said this the moor asked several questionsthrough the negro and always in the lingua franca  massa bids me ax said peter if you are a gentleman an if you know it am de custom in england for gentlemanprisners to give dere wordobhonour dat dey not run away an den go about as if dey was free  tell him that every officer in the service of the king of england is considered a gentleman  come now sar interrupted peter sternly you know das not true  i bin in england myselfcook to a french restrung in londonan i nebber hear dat a pleece officer was a gentleman  well i mean every commissioned officer in the army and navy returned foster and when such are taken prisoner i am aware that they are always allowed a certain amount of freedom of action on giving their word of honour that they will not attempt to escape  when this was explained to benahmed he again said a few words to the negro who translated as before  massa say dat as you are a gentleman if you will gib your wordobhonour not to escape he will make you free  not kite free ob course but free to work in de gardin widout chains free to sleep in de outhouse widout bein locked up ob nights an free to enjoy youself wen you gits de chance  foster looked keenly at the negro being uncertain whether or not he was jesting but the solemn features of that arch hyperkrite were no index to the working of his eccentric mindsave when he permitted them to speak then indeed they were almost more intelligible than the plainest language  and what if i refuse to pledge my word for the sake of such freedom asked our hero  wy den youll git whacked an youll sperience uncommon hard times an youll change you mind bery soon so i tink on de whole you better change im at once  seems to me yous a remarkably obsnit young feller  with a sad feeling that he was doing something equivalent to locking the door and throwing away the key foster gave the required promise and was forthwith conducted into the garden and set to work  his dark friend supplied him with a new striped cotton shirthis own having been severely torn during his recent adventuresalso with a pair of canvas trousers a linen jacket and a straw hat with a broad rim all of which fitted him badly and might have caused him some discomfort in other circumstances but he was too much depressed just then to care much for anything  his duty that day consisted in digging up a piece of waste ground  to relieve his mind he set to work with tremendous energy insomuch that peter the great who was looking on exclaimed  hi what a digger you is  youll bust up altogidder if you goes on like dat  de moles is nuffin to you  but foster heeded not  the thought that he was now doomed to hopeless slavery perhaps for life was pressed home to him more powerfully than ever and he felt that if he was to save himself from going mad he must work with his muscles like a tiger and if possible cease to think accordingly he went on toiling till the perspiration ran down his face and all his sinews were strained  poor boy muttered the negro in a low tone hes tryin to dig his own grave  but he not succeed  many a man try dat before now and failed  howsomeber its blowin a hard gale wid him just nowan de harder it blow de sooner its ober  arter de storm comes de calm  with these philosophic reflections peter the great went off to his own work leaving our hero turning over the soil like a steamplough  strong though foster wasboth of muscle and willhe was but human after all  in course of time he stopped from sheer exhaustion flung down the spade and raising himself with his hands stretched up and his face turned to the sky he cried  god help me what shall i do  then dropping his face on his hands he stood for a considerable time quite motionless  what a fool i was to promise not to try to escape he thought and a feeling of despair followed the thought but a certain touch of relief came when he reflected that at any time he could go boldly to his master withdraw the promise and take the consequences  he was still standing like a statue with his hands covering his face when he felt a light touch on his shoulder  it was the negro who had returned to see how he was getting on  look yar now geoge he said in quite a fatherly manner disll neber do  my massa buy you to work in de gardin not to stand like a statoo washin its face widout soap or water  we dont want no more statoos  got moren enuff ob marble ones all around  besides you dont make a good statooleastwise not wid dem slop cloes on  now come yar geoge  i wants a little combersation wid you  ill preach you a small sarmin if youll allow me  so saying peter led his assistant slave into a cool arbour where benahmed was wont at times to soothe his spirits with a pipe  now look yar geoge dis wont do  i say it once and for alldis wont do  i know it wont peter replied the almost heartbroken middy with a sad smile youre very kind  i know you take an interest in me and ill try to do better but im not used to spadework you know and  spadework shouted peter laying his huge black hand on fosters shoulder and giving him a squeeze that made him wince das not what i mean  work wy yous done moren a days work in one hour judging by de work ob ornary slabes  no das not it  whats wrong is dat you dont rightly understand your privleges  das de word your privleges now look yar  i dont want you to break your heart before de time an fur dat

good grub what you gits yar  he make you work widout stoppin all day and whack you on de sole ob your foots if you dar say one word  was you eber whacked on de sole ob your foots  no never replied foster amused in spite of himself by the negros earnest looks and manner  ho den you dont know yet what paradise am  paradise peter  you mean the other place i suppose  no sar i mean noting ob de sort  i mean de paradise what comes arter its ober an you gins to git well again  hah but youll find it out some day  but to continoo yous got eberyting whats comfrable here  if you ony sawd de bagnio slabes at workill take you to see em some dayden youll be content an pleased wid your lot till de time comes when you escape  escape  how can i escape peter now that i have given my word of honour not to try  noting easier replied the negro calmly yous ony got to break your wordobhonour  im sorry to hear you say that my friend returned foster for it shakes my confidence in you  you must know that an english gentleman never breaks his wordthat is he never should break itand you may rest assured that i will not break mine  if your view of such matters is so loose peter what security have i that you wont deceive me and betray me when it is your interest or your whim to do so  security massa  i lub you  is fond o your smood babby face  isnt dat security enough  foster could not help admitting that it was as long as it lasted  but what he asked what security has benahmed that you wont be as false to him as you recommend me to be  i lub massa too answered the negro with a bland smile  what love a man whom you have described to me as the most obstinate fellow you ever knew  ob course i do returned peter  wy not  a obsnit man may be as good as anoder man what can be shoved about any way you please  ha you not know yit what it is to hab a bad massa  wait a bit you find it out praps soon enough  look yar  he bared his bosom as he spoke and displayed to his wondering and sympathetic friend a mass of old scars and gashes and healedup sores  dis what my last massa do to me cause i not quite as smart as he wish  de back am wuss  oh if you knowd a bad massa youd be thankful today for gettin a good un  now what i say is nobody never knows whats agoin to turn up  you just keep quiet an wait  some slabes yar hab waited patiently for tenfifteen year an more  what den  sure to scape sooner or later  many are ransum in a year or two oders longer  lots ob em die an scape dat way  keep up your heart geoge whateber you do and if you wont break your wordobhonour something elsell be sure to turn up  although the negros mode of affording comfort and encouragement was not based entirely on sound principles his cheery and hopeful manner went a long way to lighten the load of care that had been settling down like a dead weight on young fosters heart and he returned to his work with a happier spirit than he had possessed since the day he leaped upon the deck of the pirate vessel  that night he spent under the same roof with his black friend and a number of the other slaves none of whom however were his countrymen or could speak any language that he understood  his bed was the tiled floor of an outhouse but there was plenty of straw on it  he had only one blanket but the nights as well as days were warm and his food although of the simplest kind and chiefly vegetable was good in quality and sufficient in quantity  the next day at the first blush of morning light he was aroused with the other slaves by peter the great who he found was the moors overseer of domestics  he was put to the same work as before but that day his friend the negro was sent off on a mission that was to detain him several days from home  another man took peters place but as he spoke neither english nor french no communication passed between the overseer and slave except by signs  as however the particular job on which he had been put was simple this did not matter  during the period of peters absence the poor youth felt the oppression of his isolated condition keenly  he sank to a lower condition than before and when his friend returned he was surprised to find how much of his happiness depended on the sight of his jovial black face  now geoge was the negros first remark on seeing him yous down in de blues again  well i confess i have not been very bright in your absence peter not a soul to speak a word to nothing but my own thoughts to entertain me and poor entertainment they have been  dyou know peter i think i should die if it were not for you  nebber a bit ob it massa  yous too cheeky to die soon  is noticed in my sperience dat de young slabes as has got most selfconceit an imprence is allers hardest to kill  i scarce know whether to take that as encouragement or otherwise returned foster with the first laugh he had given vent to for a long time  take it how you please geoge as de doctor said to de dyin man wont matter much in de longrun  but come long wid me an lets hab a talk ober it all  lets go to de bower  in the bower the poor middy found some consolation by pouring his sorrows into the great black sympathetic breast of peter the great though it must be confessed that peter occasionally took a strange way to comfort him  one of the negros perplexities lay in the difficulty he had to convince our midshipman of his great goodfortune in having fallen into the hands of a kind master and having escaped the terrible fate of the many who had cruel tyrants as their owners who were tortured and beaten when too ill to work who had bad food to eat and not too much of it and who were whipped to death sometimes when they rebelled  although foster listened and considered attentively he failed to appreciate what his friend sought to impress and continued in a state of almost overwhelming depression because of the simple fact that he was a slavea bought and sold slave  now look yar geoge said the negro remonstratively you is a slabe das a fact an no application ob fut rule or compasses or the mulplication table or any oder table kin change dat  dere you ama slabe  but you aint a bused slabe a whacked slabe a tortered slabe a dead slabe  youre all alibe an kickin geoge  so you cheer up an someting sure to come ob it an if noting comes ob it wy de cheerin up hab come ob it anyhow  foster smiled faintly at this philosophical view of his case and did make a brave effort to follow the advice of his friend  das right now geoge you laugh an grow fat  moreober you go to work now for if massa come an find us here hes bound to know de reason why  go to work geoge an forgit your troubles  das my wayan is got a heap o troubles bress you  so saying peter the great rose and left our forlorn midshipman sitting in the arbour where he remained for some time ruminating on past present and future instead of going to work  apart from the fact of his being a slave the youths condition at the moment was by no means disagreeable for he was seated in a garden which must have borne no little resemblance to the great original of eden in a climate that may well be described as heavenly with a view before him of similar gardens which swept in all their rich luxuriance over the slopes in front of him until they terminated on the edge of the blue and sparkling sea  while seated there lost in reverie he was startled by the sound of approaching footstepsvery different indeed from the heavy tread of his friend peter  a guilty conscience made him glance round for a way of escape but there was only one entrance to the bower  while he was hesitating how to act an opening in the foliage afforded him a passing glimpse of a female in the rich dress of a moorish lady  he was greatly surprised being well aware of the jealousy with which mohammedans guard their ladies from the eyes of men  the explanation might lie in this that benahmed being eccentric in this as in most other matters afforded the inmates of his harem unusual liberty before he had time to think much on the subject however the lady in question turned into the arbour and stood before him  if the word thunderstruck did justice in any degree to the state of mind which we wish to describe we would gladly use it but it does not every language from gaelic to chinese equally fails to furnish an adequate word  we therefore avoid the impossible and proceed merely remarking that from the expression of both faces it was evident that each had met with a crushing surprise  we can understand somewhat the midshipmans state of mind for the being who stood before him waswaswell we are again nonplussed  suffice it to say that she was a girl of fifteen summersthe other fortyfive seasons being of course understood  beauty of feature and complexion she had but these were lost as it were and almost forgotten in her beauty of expressiontenderness gentleness urbanity simplicity and benignity in a state of fusion  now do not run away reader with the idea of an eastern princess with gorgeous black eyes raven hair tall and graceful form etcetera  this apparition was fair blueeyed goldenhaired girlish sylphlike  she was graceful indeed as the gazelle but not tall and with an air of suavity that was irresistibly attractive  she had a good face as well as a beautiful and there was a slightly pitiful look about the eyebrows that seemed to want smoothing away  how earnestly george foster desiredwith a gush of pity or something of that sortto smooth it away  but he had too much delicacy of feeling as well as common sense to offer his services just then  oh sir exclaimed the girl in perfect english as she hastily threw a thin gauze veil over her face forgive me  i did not know you were hereelsemy veilbut why should i mind such customs  you are an englishman i think  foster did not feel quite sure at that moment whether he was english irish scotch or dutch so he looked foolish and said  yyes  i knew it  i was sure of it  oh  i am so glad exclaimed the girl clasping her delicate little hands together and bursting into tears  this was such a very unexpected climax and so closely resembled the conduct of a child that it suddenly restored our midshipman to selfpossession  stepping quickly forward he took one of the girls hands in his laid his other hand on her shoulder and said  dont cry my poor child  if i can help you in any way ill be only too glad but pray dont dont cry so  iicant help it sobbed the girl pulling away her handnot on account of propriety by any means that never entered her young head but for the purpose of searching for a kerchief in a pocket that was always undiscoverable among bewildering folds  ififyou only knew how long long it is since i heard an englishwhere is that thingan english voice you would not wonder  and my father my dear dear darling fatheri have not heard of him forfor  here the poor thing broke down again and sobbed aloud while the midshipman looked on imbecile and helpless  pray dont cry said foster again earnestly  who are you where did you come from  who and where is your father  do tell me and how i can help you for we may be interrupted  this last remark did more to quiet the girl than anything else he had said  you are right she replied drying her eyes quickly  and do you know the danger you run if found conversing with me  nonot great danger i hope  the danger of being scourged to death perhaps she replied  then pray do be quick for id rather not get such a whippingeven for your sake  but our owner is not cruel continued the girl  he is kind  owner  is he not then your husband  oh no  he says he is keeping me for his son who is away on a long voyage  i have never seen himandi have such a dread of his coming back  but you are english are you not  yes  and your father  he is also english and a slave  we have not met nor have i heard of him since we were parted on board ship many months ago  listen    chapter five  the maidens storypeter the great and the middy go for a holiday and see awful things  during the conversation detailed in the last chapter the young english girl had spoken with her veil down  she now threw it carelessly back and sitting down on a bench opposite our midshipman folded her hands in her lap and remained silent for a few seconds during which george foster saidnot aloud but very privately to himself although your eyes are swelled and your little nose is red with crying i neverno i neverdid see such a dear sweet pretty little innocent face in all my life  all unconscious of his thoughts and still giving vent now and then to an irresistible sob the poor childfor she was little morelooked up and began her sad tale  about eight months ago my dear father who is a merchant resolved to take me with him on a voyage to some of the mediterranean ports  my fathers name is hugh sommers  and yours asked foster  is hester  we had only just entered the mediterranean when one of those dreadful algerine pirates took our vessel and made slaves of us all  my darling father being a very big strong and brave man fought like a tiger  oh  i never imagined that his dear kind face could have looked as it did that awful day  but although he knocked down and i fear killed many men it was all of no use they were so numerous and our men so few  the last i saw of my father was when they were lowering him into a boat in a state of insensibility with an awful cut all down his brow and cheek from which the blood was pouring in streams  i tried to get to him but they held me back and took me down into the cabin  there i met our owner who when he saw me threw a veil over my head and bade me sit still  i was too terrified and too despairing about my father to think of disobeying  i think benahmed our owner must be a man of power for everybody seemed to obey him that day as if he was the chief man though he was not the captain of the ship  after a time he took my hand put me into a small sailing boat and took me ashore  i looked eagerly for my father on landing but he was nowhere to be seen andi have not seen him since  nor heard of or from him asked foster  no  at this point as there were symptoms of another breakdown our middy became anxious and entreated hester to go on  with a strong effort she controlled her feelings  well then benahmed brought me here and introducing me to his wiveshe has four of them only thinksaid he had brought home a little wife for his son osman  of course i thought they were joking for you know girls of my age are never allowed to marry in england but after a time i began to see that they meant it and dyou knowby the way what is your name  fostergeorge foster  well mr foster i was going to say that i cannot help wishing and hoping that their son may never come home  isnt that sinful  i dont know much about the sin of it said foster but i fervently hope the same thing from the very bottom of my heart  and oh continued hester whimpering a little you cant think what a relief it is to be able to talk with you about it  it would have been a comfort to talk even to our big dog here about it if it could only have understood english  but now continued the poor little creature while the troubled look returned to her eyebrows what is to be done  escapesomehow said foster promptly  but nothing would induce me to even try to escape without my father said hester  this was a damper to our midshipman  to rescue a little girl seemed to him a mere nothing in the glowing state of his heroic soul at that moment but to rescue her very big strong and brave father at the same time did not appear so easy  still something must be attempted in that way  tell me he said what is your father like  tall handsome sweet ex  yes yes  i know  but i mean colour of hair kind of nose etcetera be more particular and do be quick  i dont like to hurry you but remember the possible scourging to death that hangs over me  well he is very broad and strong a roman nose large sweet mouth always smiling large grey eyessuch loving eyes toowith irongrey hair moustache and beard  you see although it is not the fashion in england to wear beards my dear father thinks it right to do so for he is fond he says of doing only those things that he can give a good reason for and as he can see no reason whatever for shaving off his moustachios and beard any more than the hair of his head and eyebrows he lets them grow  ive heard people say that my father is wild in his notions and some used to say as if it was very awful that she lowered her voice here he is a radical  you know what a radical is i suppose  oh yes said foster with the first laugh he had indulged in during the interview a radical is a man who wants to have everything his own way to have all the property in the world equally divided among everybody who wants all the power to be equally shared and in short who wants everything turned upside down  hush dont laugh so loud said hester looking anxiously round and holding up one of her pretty little fingers some one may hear you and find us  strange she added pensively surely you must be under some mistake for i heard my dear father try to explain it once to a friend who seemed to me unwilling to understand  i remember so well the quiet motion of his large firm but sweet mouth as he spoke and the look of his great earnest eyesa radical he said is one who wishes and tries to go to the root of every matter and put all wrong things right without delay  what george foster might have said to this definition of a radical coming as it did from such innocent lips we cannot say for the abrupt closing of a door at the other end of the garden caused hester to jump up and run swiftly out of the bower  foster followed her example and returning to the scene of his labours threw off his coat and began to dig with an amount of zeal worthy of his friend the incorrigible hyperkrite himself  a few minutes later and benahmed approached in close conversation with peter the great  hallo exclaimed the latter in stern tones as they came up what you bin about sar what you bin doin  noting done since i was here more an hour pasteh sar  the midshipman explained with a somewhat guilty look and blush that he had been resting in the bower and that he had stayed much longer than he had intended  you just hab you rascal  but i cure you ob dat said the negro catching up a piece of cane that was lying on the ground with which he was about to administer condign chastisement to the idle slave when his master stopped him  hurt him not he said raising his hand is not this his first offence  yes massa de bery fust  well tell him that the rod shall be applied next time he is found idling  enough follow me  with a stately step the amiable moor passed on  with a much more stately port peter the great followed him but as he did so he bestowed on foster a momentary look so ineffably sly yet solemn that the latter was obliged to seize the spade and dig like a very sexton in order to check his tendency to laugh aloud  half an hour later the negro returned to him  what you bin do all dis time he asked in surprise  i was moren half tink you desarve a lickin  perhaps i do peter answered the young slave in a tone so hearty and cheerful that the negros great eyes increased considerably in size  well geoge he said with a sudden change in his expression i wouldnt hab expeck it ob you no i wouldnt if my own mudder was to tell me  to tink dat one so young too would go on de sly to de rumbottle  but where you kin find ims moren i kin tell  i have not been at the rumbottle at all returned the middy resting on his spade but i have had something to raise my spirits and brace my energies and take me out of myself  come let us go to the bower and i will explainthat is if we may safely go there  go whar  to the bower  do you know sar replied peter drawing himself up and expanding his great chestdo you know sar dat is kimmanderinchief ob de army in dis yar gardin an kin order em about whar i please an do what i like  go up to de bower you small brish officer an look sharp if you dont want a whackin  the slave obeyed with alacrity and when the two were seated he described his recent interview with hester sommers  no words can do full justice to the varied expressions that flitted across the negros face as the midshipmans narrative went on  so he said slowly when it was concluded yous bin an had a long privit convissation wid one ob benahmeds ladies  my you know what dat means if it found out  well miss sommers herself was good enough to tell me that it would probably mean flogging to death  floggin to deaf echoed peter  praps so wid massa for hes a kind man but wid most any oder man it ud mean roastin alibe ober a slow fire  geoge yous little bettern a dead man  i hope its not so bad as that for no one knows about it except the lady and yourself  das so an youre in luck let me tell you  now you go to work an ill retire for some meditationsee whats to come ob all dis  truly the changes that take place in the feelings and mind of man are not less sudden and complete than the physical changes which sometimes occur in lands that are swept by the tornado and desolated by the earthquake  that morning george foster had risen from his straw bed a miserable white slave hopeless heartless and down at spiritual zero or below it  that night he lay down on the same straw bed a free man in soul if not in bodya hero of the most ardent characterup at feverheat in the spiritual thermometer or above it and all because his heart throbbed with a noble purposebecause an object worthy of his efforts was placed before him and because he had made up his mind to do or die in a good cause  what that cause was he would have found it difficult to define clearly in detail  sufficient for him that an unknown but stalwart father with radical tendencies and a wellknown and lovely daughter were at the foundation of it and that escape was the talismanic word which formed a battery as it were with which to supply his heart with electric energy  he lived on this diet for a week with the hope of again seeing hester but he did not see her again for many weeks  one morning peter the great came to him as he was going out to work in the garden and said  you git ready and come wid me into town dis day  indeed returned foster as much excited by the order as if it had been to go on some grand expedition  for what purpose  you bey orders sar an make your mind easy about purpisses  in a few minutes foster was ready  no part of his original costume now remained to him  a bluestriped cotton jacket with pants too short and too wide for him a broadbrimmed straw hat deeply sunburnt face and hands with a pair of old boots two sizes too large made him as unlike a british naval officer as he could well be  but he had never been particularly vain of his personal appearance and the high purpose by which he was now actuated set him above all such trifling considerations  is your business a secret asked foster as he and his companion descended the picturesque road that led to the city  no it am no secret cause is got no business  you seem to be in a mysterious mood this morning peter  what do you mean  i mean dat you an mes out for a holidaytwo slabes out for a holiday  tink ob dat  the negro threw back his head opened his capacious jaws and gave vent to an almost silent chuckle  that does indeed mound strange returned foster how has such a wonderful event been brought about  by lub geoge  dint i tell you before dat hub am eberyting  yes and my dear old mother told me long before you did that love is the fulfilling of the law  well i dun know much about law xcep dat i blieve its a passel o nonsense for what wes got here ant o no useleastwise not for slabes  but my mother did not refer to human laws returned foster  she quoted what the bible says about gods laws  oh das a bery diffrent ting massa an i spose your mudder was right  anyway it was lub what obercame benahmed  you see i put it to im bery tender like  massa says i here is bin wid you night an day for six year an yous nebber say to me yet peter de great go out for de day an enjoy youself  now massa i wants to take dat small raskil geoge fuster to de town an show him a few tings asll make him do his work better an datll make you lub im more an so well all be more comfrable  das what i say an when i was sayin it i see de wrinkles acomin round massas eyes so i feel sure for wen dem wrinkles come to de eyes it is all right  an massa he say gonuffin more only go but ob course das nuff for me so i hoed an nowwere bof goin  at this point in the conversation they came to a place where the road forked  here they met a number of arabs hasting towards the town in a somewhat excited frame of mind  following these very slowly on a mule rode another arab whose dignified gravity seemed to be proof against all excitement  he might have been the dey of algiers himself to judge from his bearing and the calm serenity with which he smoked a cigar yet neither his occupation nor position warranted his dignified air for he was merely a seller of oranges and sat on a huge marketsaddle somewhat in the ladyfashionsidewise with the baskets of golden fruit on either side of him  going humbly towards this arab the negro asked him in lingua franca if there was anything unusual going on in the town  the arab replied by a calm stare and a puff of smoke as he rode by  i ope his pride wont bust im muttered peter as he fell behind and rejoined his companion  do you think anything has happened then  deres no sayin  wonderful geese dey is in dis city  dey seem to tink robbery on the sea is just an robbery ob de poor an helpless is just but robbery ob de rich in algiersoh dat awrful wicked not to be tololerated on no account wasomever  konsikence isde poor an de helpless git some ob de strong an de clebber to go on dere side an den dey bust up strangle de dey rob de jews an set up another guvment  rob the jews peter  why do they do that  dun know massa  please dont call me massa any more peter for im not massa in any sensebeing only your friend and fellowslave  well i wont geoge  is agoin to say i spose dey plunder de jews cause deys got lots o money an got no friends  eberybody rob de jews wen deres a big rumpus  but i dont tink deres a row jus nowonly a scare  the scare if there was one had passed away when they reached the town on approaching the babazoun gate peter got ready their passports to show to the guard  as he did so foster observed with a shudder that shreds of a human carcass were still dangling from the large hooks on the wall  suddenly their steps were arrested by a shriek and several men immediately appeared on the top of the wall holding fast a struggling victim  but the poor wretchs struggles were vain  he was led to the edge of the wall by four strong men and not hurled but dropped over so that he should not fail to be caught on one of the several hooks below  another shriek of terror burst from the man as he fell  it was followed by an appalling yell as one of the hooks caught him under the armpit passed upwards right through his shoulder and into his jaws while the blood poured down his convulsed and naked limbs  that yell was the poor mans last  the action of the hook had been mercifully directed and after a few struggles the body hung limp and lifeless  oh it is terrible to think of the cruelty that man is capable of practising on his fellows  the sight was enough one would think to rouse to indignation a heart of stone yet the crowds that beheld this did not seem to be much affected by it  true there were several faces that showed traces of pity but few words of disapproval were uttered  come come cried our midshipman seizing his companion by the arm and dragging him away let us go  horrible  they are not men but devils come away  they passed through the gate and along the main street of the city a considerable distance before foster could find words to express his feelings and then he had difficulty in restraining his indignation on finding that the negro was not nearly as much affected as he himself was by the tragedy which they had just witnessed  wes used to it you know said peter in selfdefence  is seen em hangin alibe on dem hooks for hours  but dats nuffin to what some on em do  look dar you see dat ole man asittin ober dere wid de small tings for salehim whats adoin nuffin an sayin nuffin an almost expectin nuffin  well i once saw dat ole man whacked for nuffinor next to nuffinon de sole ob his foots sos he couldnt walk for bout two or tree monts  they had reached the marketsquare by that time and foster saw that the man referred to was the identical old fellow with the blue coat and hood the white beard and the miscellaneous old articles for sale whom he had observed on his first visit to the square  the old arab gave peter the great a bright look and a cheerful nod as they passed  he seems to know you remarked foster  oh yes  he know me  i used to carry him on my back ebery mornin to his place here dat time when he couldnt walk  bress you dars lots o peepil knows me here  come ill troduce you to some more friends an well hab a cup o coffee  saying this he conducted our middy into a perfect labyrinth of narrow streets through which he wended his way with a degree of certainty that told of intimate acquaintance  foster observed that he nodded familiarly to many of those who crowded themto jews arabs watercarriers and negroes as well as to the dignified men who kept little stalls and shops many of which shops were mere niches in the sides of the houses  so close were the fronts of these houses to each other that in many places they almost met overhead and obscured much of the light  at last the middy and his friend stopped in front of a stair which descended into what appeared to be a dark cellar  entering it they found themselves in a low arab coffeehouse    chapter six  our hero sees the moors in several aspects and makes a great discovery  whatever may be said of mohammedanism as a religion there can be no question we should think that it has done much among the eastern nations to advance the cause of temperance  we make no defence of mohammedvery much the reversebut we hold that even a false prophet cannot avoid teaching a certain modicum of truth in his system and when mohammed sternly put his foot down upon strong drink and enforced the principle of total abstinence therefrom he did signal service to a large portion of the human family  although for want of better teaching mohammedans cling to many vices one never sees them howling through the streets in a state of wild ferocity or staggering homewards in a condition of mild imbecility from the effects of intoxicating drink  instead of entering a low den where riot and revelry with bad language and quarrelling might be expected to prevail george foster found himself in a small whitewashed apartment where there sat several grave and sedate men wrapped in the voluminous folds of eastern drapery sipping very small cups of coffee and enjoying very large pipes of tobacco  the room was merely a cellar the walls being thickly stuccoed and whitewashed and the ceiling arched but although plain the place was reasonably clean and eminently quiet  the drinkers did not dispute conversation flowed in an undertone and an air of respectability pervaded the whole place  at the further end of the apartment there was a curiouslooking fireplace which seemed to have been formed without the use of square or plummet and around which were scattered and hung in comfortable confusion the implements and utensils of cookery  nothing of the cook was visible except his bare legs and feet the rest of him being shrouded in a recess  beside the fireplace an arab sat crosslegged on a bench sipping his coffee  beyond him in a recess another arab was seated  he appeared to be sewing while he conversed with a negro who stood beside him  elsewhere in more or less remote and dim distances other customers were seated indulging in the prevailing beverage  you sit down here geoge drink an say noting but wait for me  with this admonition peter the great whispered a few words to the man who owned the establishment and hurriedly left the place  the middy naturally felt a little disconcerted at being thus left alone among strangers but knowing that in the circumstances he was absolutely helpless he wisely and literally obeyed orders  sitting down on a bench opposite the fire from which point of observation he could see the entrancedoor and all that went on around him he waited and said nothing until the chief of the establishment presented him with a white cup of coffee so very small that he felt almost equal to the swallowing of cup and coffee at one gulp  with a gracious bow and thank you he accepted the attention and began to sip  the dignified arab who gave it to him did not condescend upon any reply but turned to attend upon his other customers  fosters first impulse was to spit out the sip he had taken for to his surprise the coffee was thick with grounds  he swallowed it however and wondered  then on taking another sip and considering it he perceived that the grounds were not as grounds to which he had been accustomed but were reducedno doubt by severe poundingto a pasty condition which made the beverage resemble chocolate  coffeesoup with sugarbut no milk he muttered as he tried another sip  this third one convinced him that the ideas of arabs regarding coffee did not coincide with those of englishmen so he finished the cup at the fourth sip much as he would have taken a dose of physic and thereafter amused himself with contemplating the other coffeesippers  at the time when our hero first arrived at benahmeds home he had been despoiled of his own garments while he was in bedthe slave costume having been left in their place  on application to his friend peter however his pocketknife pencil letters and a few other things had been returned to him  thus while waiting he was able to turn his time to account by making a sketch of the interior of the coffeehouse to the great surprise and gratification of the negroes thereperhaps also of the moorsbut these latter were too reticent and dignified to express any interest by word or look whatever they might have felt  he was thus engaged when peter returned  hallo geoge exclaimed the negro what you bin up tomakin picturs  only a little sketch said foster holding it up  a skitch repeated peter grasping the letter and holding it out at arms length with the air of a connoisseur while he compared it with the original  you call dis a skitch  well  i neber see de like ob disno neber  its lubly  deres de kittles an de pots an de jars anha ha deres de man wid dedewart on is nose  oh das fustrate  massas awrful fond ob skitchin  he wouldnt sell you now for ten tousand dollars  fortunately the arab with the wart on his nose was ignorant of english otherwise he might have had some objection to being thus transferred to paper and brought as arabs think under the power of the evil eye before the exact nature of what had been done however was quite understood peter had paid for the coffee and with the amateur artist had left the place  nothing surprises me more said foster as they walked along than to see such beautiful wells and fountains in streets so narrow that one actually has not enough room to step back and look at them properly look at that one now with the negress the moor and the watercarrier waiting their turn while the little girl fills her waterpot  see what labour has been thrown away on that fountain  what elegance of design what columns of sculptured marble and fine tessellated work stuck up where few people can see it even when they try to  true geoge  de water would run as well out ob a ugly fountain as a pritty one  but its not that i wonder at peter its the putting of such splendid work in such dark narrow lanes that surprises me  why do they go to so much expense in such a place as this  oh as to expense geoge  dey dont go to none  you see we hab no end ob slabes here ob all kinds an trades an purfessions what cost nuffin but a leetle black bread to keep em alibe an a whackin now an den to make em work  bress you dem marble fountains an tings cost the pirits nuffin  now wes goin up to see the kasba  what is that peter  what you not know what de kasba am  my how ignorant you is  de kasba is de citadlde fortwhere all de money an tingstreasure you call itam kep safe  strong place de kasbaawrful strong  ill be glad to see that said foster  ho yes  you be glad to see it wid me returned the negro significantly but not so glad if you go dere wid chains on you legs an pick or shovel on you shoulder  seedere dey go  as he spoke a band of slaves was seen advancing up the narrow street standing aside in a doorway to let them pass foster saw that the band was composed of men of many nations  among them he observed the fair hair and blue eyes of the saxon the dark complexion and hair of the spaniard and italian and the black skin of the negrobut all resembled each other in their looks and lines of care and in the weary anxiety and suffering with which every countenance was stampedalso in the more or less dejected air of the slaves and the soiled ragged garments with which they were covered  but if some of the resemblances between these poor creatures were strong some of their differences were still more striking  among them were men whose robust frames had not yet been broken down whose vigorous spirits had not been quite tamed and whose scowling eyes and compressed lips revealed the fact that they were dangerous  these walked along with clanking chains on their limbschains which were more or less weighty according to the strength and character of the wearer others there were so reduced in health strength and spirit that the chain of their own feebleness was heavy enough for them to drag to their daily toil  among these were some with hollow cheeks and sunken eyes whose weary pilgrimage was evidently drawing to a close but all whether strong or weak fierce or subdued were made to tramp smartly up the steep street being kept up to the mark by drivers whose cruel whips cracked frequently on the shoulders of the lagging and the lazy  with a heart that felt as if ready to burst with conflicting emotions the poor midshipman looked on clenching his teeth to prevent unwise exclamations and unclenching his fists to prevent the tendency to commit assault and battery  this is dreadful he said in a low voice when the gang had passed  yes geoge it is dreffulbut wes used to it you know  come well foller dis gang  keeping about twenty yards behind they followed the slaves into the kasba where they met with no interruption from the guards who seemed to be well acquainted with peter the great though they did not condescend to notice him except by a passing glance  how is it that every one lets you pass so easily asked foster when they had nearly reached the southern wall of the fortress  eberybody knows me so welldas one reason answered the negro with a grin of selfsatisfaction  is quite a public krakter in dis yar city you mus know  den anoder ting is dat our massa am a man ob power  he not got no partikler office in de state cause he not require it for hes a rich man but hes got great power wid de deywes bof got dat  indeed how so  stand here under dis doorway and i tell youdis way where you can see de splendid view ob de whole city an de harbour an sea byond  we kin wait a bit here while de slabes are gittin ready to work  you see de bit ob wall dats damaged dere  well deyre goin to repair dat well go look at em byanby  as the incident which peter narrated might prove tedious if given in his own language we take the liberty of relating it for him  one fine morning during the previous summer the dey of algiers mounted his horsea fiery little araband attended by several of his courtiers cantered away in the direction of the suburb which is now known by the name of mustapha superieur  when drawing near to the residence of benahmed the deys horse became unmanageable and ran away being the best horse of the party the courtiers were soon left far behind  it chanced that benahmed and his man peter the great were walking together towards the city that day  on turning a sharp bend in the road where a high bank had shut out their view they saw a horseman approaching at a furious gallop  it is the dey exclaimed benahmed  so it am responded peter  he cant make the turn of the road and live cried the moor all his dignified selfpossession vanishing as he prepared for action  i will check the horse he added in a quick low voice  you break his fall peter  hell come off on the left side  das so massa said peter as he sprang to the other side of the narrow road  he had barely done so when the dey came thundering towards them  stand aside he shouted as he came on for he was a fearless horseman and quite collected though in such peril  but benahmed would not stand aside  although an old man he was still active and powerful  he seized the reins of the horse as it was passing and bringing his whole weight and strength to bear checked it so far that it made a false step and stumbled  this had the effect of sending the dey out of the saddle like a bomb from a mortar and of hurling benahmed to the ground  ill would it have fared with the dey at that moment if peter the great had not possessed a mechanical turn of mind and a big powerful body as well as a keen quick eye for possibilities  correcting his distance in a moment by jumping back a couple of paces he opened his arms and received the chief of algiers into his broad black bosom  the shock was tremendous for the dey was by no means a light weight and peter the great went down before it in the dust while the great man arose shaken indeed and confused but unhurt by the accident  benahmed also arose uninjured but peter lay still where he had fallen  wen i cometo to myself continued peter on reaching this point in his narrative de fus ting i tink was dat id been busted  den i look up an i sees our black cook  shes a nigger like myself only a she one  hallo angelica says i wass de matter  matter says she yous deadamost an dey lef you here wid me wid strik

i know peter for you never call her anything but cook but im glad you have told me for ill regard her now with increased respect from this day forth  das right geoge  you cant pay er too much respec  now well go an look at de works  the part of the wall which the slaves were repairing was built of great blocks of artificial stone or concrete which were previously cast in wooden moulds left to harden and then put into their assigned places by slavelabour  as foster was watching the conveyance of these blocks it suddenly occurred to him that hester sommerss father might be amongst them and he scanned every face keenly as the slaves passed to and fro but saw no one who answered to the description given him by the daughter  from this scrutiny he was suddenly turned by a sharp cry drawn from one of a group who were slowly carrying a heavy stone to its place  the cry was drawn forth by the infliction of a cruel lash on the shoulders of a slave  he was a thin delicate youth with evidences of fatal consumption upon him  he had become faint from overexertion and one of the drivers had applied the whip by way of stimulus  the effect on the poor youth was to cause him to stumble and instead of making him lift better made him rest his weight on the stone thus overbalancing it and bringing it down  in falling the block caught the ankle of the youth who fell with a piercing shriek to the ground where he lay in a state of insensibility  at this a tall bearded man with heavy fetters on his strong limbs sprang to the young mans side went down on his knees and seized his hand  oh  henri my son he cried in french but before he could say more a whip touched his back with a report like a pistolshot and the torn cotton shirt that he wore was instantly crimsoned with his blood  the man rose and making no more account of his fetters than if they had been straws sprang like a tiger at the throat of his driver  he caught it and the eyes and tongue of the cruel monster were protruding from his head before the enraged frenchman could be torn away by four powerful janissaries  as it was they had to bind him hand and foot ere they were able to carry him offto torture and probably to death  at the same time the poor helpless form of henri was borne from the place by two of his fellowslaves  of course a scene like this could not be witnessed unmoved by our midshipman  indeed he would infallibly have rushed to the rescue of the bearded frenchman if peters powerful grip on his shoulder had not restrained him  dont be a fool geoge he whispered  remember we must submit  fortunately for george the guards around were too much interested in watching the struggle to observe his state of mind and it is doubtful whether he would have been held back even by the negro if his attention had not at the moment been attracted by a tall man who came on the scene just then with another gang of slaves  one glance sufficed to tell who the tall man was  hester sommerss portrait had been a true onetall handsome strong and even in the haggard worn and profoundly sad face there shone a little of the sweetness which his daughter had emphasised  there were also the large grey eyes the roman nose the irongrey hair moustache and beard and the large mouth although the smile had fled from the face and the lovingness from the eyes  foster was so sure of the man that as he drew near to the place where he stood he stepped forward and whispered sommers  the man started and turned pale as he looked keenly at our heros face  no time to explain said the middy quickly  hester is well and safe  see you again  hope on  what are you saying there thundered one of the drivers in arabic  what you say to dat feller you raskil you white slabe  come long home cried peter the great seizing foster by the collar and dragging him forcibly away at the same time administering several kicks so violent that his entire frame seemed to be dislocated while the janissaries burst into a laugh at the big negros seeming fury  oh  geoge geoge continued peter as he dragged the middy along shaking him from time to time youll be de deaf ob me an ob yourself too if you dont larn to submit  an see too what a hyperkrite you make me  is bliged to kick hard or dey wouldnt blieve me in arnist  well well peter returned our hero who at once understood his friends ruse to disarm suspicion and get him away safely you need not call yourself a hypocrite this time at all events for your kicks and shakings have been uncommonly realmuch too real for comfort  didnt i say i was bleeged to do it retorted peter with a pout that might have emulated that of his wife on the occasion of their engagement  dyou spose dem raskils don know a real kick from a sham one  i was marciful too for if id kicked as i could dere wouldnt be a whole bone in your carcass at dis momint  yous got to larn to be grateful geoge  come along  conversing thus pleasantly the white slave and the black left the kasba together and descended into the town    chapter seven  the middy obtains a decided advance and makes peter the great his confidant  many months passed after the events narrated in the last chapter before george foster had the goodfortune to meet again with hugh sommers and several weeks elapsed before he had the chance of another interview with the daughter  indeed he was beginning to despair of ever again seeing either the one or the other and it required the utmost energy and the most original suggestions of a hopeful nature on the part of his faithful friend to prevent his giving way altogether and having as peter expressed it anoder fit ob de blues  at last fortune favoured him  he was busy in the garden one day planting flowers when peter came to him and said  is got news for you today geoge  indeed said the middy with a weary sigh what may your news be  you member dat pictur ob de coffeehouse in de town what you dood  yes now you mention it i do though i had almost forgotten it  ah but i not forgit im  well yesterday i tuk it to massa an he bery much pleased  he say bring you up to de house an he gib you some work to do  i wish returned foster that hed ask me to make a portrait of little hester sommers  you forgit geoge de moors neber git deir portraits dood  dey fraid ob de evil eye  well when are we to go up  nowi jist come for you  throwing down his garden tools foster followed the negro to the house and was ushered into a small chamber the light of which was rendered soft and mellow by the stained glass windows through which it passed these windows were exceedingly smallnot more than a foot high by eight inches broadand they were placed in the walls at a height of nine feet or more from the ground  the walls of the room were decorated with richlycoloured tiles and the floor was of white marble but the part that attracted our hero most was the ceiling which was arched according to moorish form and enriched with elaborate designs in stuccoif not in white marble the difference being difficult to distinguish  on the marble floor lay several shawls richly embroidered in coloured silk and gold a pair of small scarlet slippers covered with gold thread a thin veil and several cushions of different sizes on one of these last reposed a little tame gazelle whose bright eyes greeted the two slaves with an inquiring look as they entered  from all these things foster judged that this was one of the womens apartments and wondered much that he had been admitted into such a jealouslyguarded sanctuary but relieved his mind by setting it down to that eccentricity for which benahmed was noted  he had just arrived at this conclusion when a door opened and benahmed himself entered with the sketch of the coffeehouse in his hand  tell him said the moor to peter that i am much pleased with this drawing and wish him to make one a little larger in size of this room  let him put into it everything that he sees  he will find paper in that portfolio and all else that he requires on this ottoman  let him take time and do it well  he need not work in the garden while thus employed  pointing to the various things to which he referred the moor turned and left the apartment  now geoge what you tink ob all dat asked peter with a broad grin when he had translated the moors orders  really i dont know what to think of it  undoubtedly it is a step upwards as compared with working in the garden but then dont you see peter it will give me much less of your company which will be a tremendous drawback  das well said  yous kite right  i hab notice from de fus dat you hab a wellconstitooted mind an appruciates de value ob friendship  i lub your smood face geoge  i hope you love more of me than my smooth face peter returned the middy otherwise your love wont continue for there are certain indications on my upper lip which assure me that the smoothness wont last long  hol your tongue sar  what you go on jabberin so to me when yous got work to do sar said peter fiercely with a threatening motion of his fist  go to work at once you white slabe  our hero was taken aback for a moment by this sudden explosion but the presence of a negro girl who had entered softly by a door at his back at once revealed to him the truth that peter the great had donned the garb of the hypocrite  although unused and very much averse to such costume he felt compelled in some degree to adopt it and bowing his head not only humbly but in humiliation he went silently towards his drawing materials while the girl placed a tumbler of water on a small table and retired  turning round he found that peter had also disappeared from the scene  at first he imagined that the water was meant for his refreshment but on examining the materials on the ottoman he found a box of watercolour paints which accounted for its being sent  although george foster had never been instructed in painting he possessed considerable natural talent and was intensely fond of the art  it was therefore with feelings of delight which he had not experienced for many a day that he began to arrange his materials and set about this new and congenial work  among other things he found a small easel which had a very anglican aspect about it  wondering how it had got there he set it up with a sheet of paper on it tried various parts of the room in order to find out the best position for a picture and went through that interesting series of steppings back and puttings of the head on one side which seem to be inseparably connected with true art  while thus engaged in the profound silence of that luxurious apartment with its dim religious light now glancing at the rich ceiling anon at the fair sheet of paper he chanced to look below the margin of the latter and observed through the legs of the easel that the gorgeous eyes of the gazelle were fixed on him in apparent wonder  he advanced to it at once holding out a hand coaxingly  the pretty creature allowed him to approach within a few inches and then bounded from its cushion like a thing of indiarubber to the other end of the room where it faced about and gazed again  you gaze well pretty creature thought the embryo artist  perhaps thats the origin of your name  humph you wont come to me  the latter part of his thoughts he expressed aloud but the animal made no response  it evidently threw the responsibility of taking the initiative on the man  our middy was naturally persevering in character  laying aside his pencil he sat down on the marble floor put on his most seductive expression held out his hand gently and muttered soft encouragements such as now then spunkie come here an dont be silly and the like  but spunkie still stood immovable and gazed  then the middy took to advancing in a sitting postureafter a manner known to infantsat the same time intensifying the urbanity of his look and the wheedlement of his tone  the gazelle suffered him to approach until his fingers were within an inch of its nose  there the middy stopped  he had studied animal nature  he was aware that it takes two to love as well as to quarrel  he resolved to wait  seeing this the gazelle timidly advanced its little nose and touched his finger  he scratched gently  spunkie seemed to like it  he scratched progressively up its forehead  spunkie evidently enjoyed it  he scratched behind its ear andthe victory was gained  the gazelle dismissing all fear advanced and rubbed its graceful head on his shoulder  well you are a nice little beast said foster as he fondled it whoever owns you must be very kind to you but i cant afford to waste more time with you  must get to work  he rose and returned to his easel while the gazelle trotted to its cushion and lay downto sleep perchance to dreamno to gaze as before but in mitigated wonder  the amateur painterslave now applied himself diligently to his work with everincreasing interest yet not altogether without an uncomfortable and humiliating conviction that if he did not do it with reasonable rapidity and give moderate satisfaction he ran the chance of being whacked if not worse  let not the reader imagine that we are drawing the longbow here and making these moors to be more cruel than they really were  though benahmed was an amiable specimen he was not a typical algerine for cruelty of the most dreadful kind was often perpetrated by these monsters in the punishment of trivial offences in those days  at the present hour there stands in the great square of algiers an imposing mosque which was designed by a christian slavean architectwhose head was cut off because he had built itwhether intentionally or accidentally we know notin the form of a cross  for some hours foster worked uninterruptedly with his pencil for he believed like our great turner in his earlier days though turners sun had not yet arisen that the preliminary drawing for a picture cannot be too carefully or elaborately done  after having bumped himself against the wall twice and tripped over an ottoman onceto the gazelles intense surprisein his efforts to take an artistic view of his work foster at last laid down his pencil stretched himself to his full height with his hands in the air by way of relaxation and was beginning to remember that midday meals were not unknown to man when the negress before mentioned entered with a small round brass tray on which were two covered dishes  the middy lowered his hands in prompt confusion for he had not attained to the moors sublime indifference to the opinion or thought of slaves  he was about to speak but checked the impulse  it was wiser to hold his tongue  a kindliness of disposition however induced him to smile and nodattentions which impelled the negress as she retired to display her teeth and gums to an extent that no one would believe if we were to describe it  on examination it was found that one of the dishes contained a savoury compound of rice and chicken with plenty of butter and other substancessome of which were sweet  the other dish contained little rolls of bread  both dishes appeared to foster to be made of embossed goldor brass but he knew and cared not which  coffee in a cup about the size and shape of an egg was his beverage  while engaged with the savoury and altogether unexpected meal our hero felt his elbow touched  looking round he saw the gazelle looking at him with an expression in its beautiful eyes that said plainly give me my share  you shall have it my dear said the artist handing the creature a roll with which it retired contentedly to its cushion  perhaps thought the youth as he pensively sipped his coffee this room may be sometimes used by hester  it obviously forms part of the seraglio  strange old fellow benahmed to allow men like me to invade such a place  the thought of the ladies of the harem somehow suggested his mother and sister and when poor george got upon this pair of rails he was apt to be run away with and to forget time and place  the reverie into which he wandered was interrupted however by the gazelle asking for more as there was no more it was fain to content itself with a pat on the head as the painter rose to resume his work  the drawing was by this time all pencilled in most elaborately and the middy opened the watercolour box to examine the paints  as he did so he again remarked on the familiar english look of the materials and was about to begin rubbing down a little of one of the cakesmoist colours had not been inventedwhen he observed some writing in red paint on the back of the palette  he started and flushed while his heart beat faster for the writing was expect me  rub this out  hs  what could this mean  hs  hester sommers of course  it was simple too simple  he wished for morelike the gazelle  like it too he got no more  after gazing at the writing until every letter was burnt into his memory he obeyed the order and rubbed it out  then in a disturbed and anxious frame of mind he tried to paint casting many a glance not only at his subject but at the two doors which opened into the room  at last one of the doors openednot the one he happened to be looking at however  he started up overturned his stool and all but knocked down the easel as the negress reentered to remove the refreshmenttray  she called to the gazelle as she went out  it bounded lightly after her and the young painter was left alone to recover his composure  ass that i am he said knitting his brows clenching his teeth and putting a heavy dab of crimsonlake on the ceiling  at that moment the other door opened yet so gently and slightly that he would not have observed it but for the sharp line of light which it let through  determined not to be again taken by surprise he became absorbed in putting little unmeaning lines round the dab of lakenot so busily however as to prevent his casting rapid furtive glances at the opening door  gradually something white appeared in the apertureit was a veil something blueit was an eye  something quite beyond description lovelyit was hester herself lookingif such be conceivablelike a scared angel  oh mr foster she exclaimed in a halfwhisper running lightly in and holding up a finger by way of caution i have so longed to see you  so have i interrupted the delighted middy  dear hahmiss sommers i mean i felt sure thatthatthis must be your roomno whats its name boudoir and the gazelle  yes yesoh never mind that interrupted the girl impatiently  my fatherdarling fatherany news of him  blushing with shame that he should have thought of his own feelings before her anxieties foster dropped the little hand which he had already grasped and hastened to tell of the meeting with her father in the kasbathe ease with which he had recognised him from her description and the few hurried words of comfort he had been able to convey before the slavedriver interfered  tears were coursing each other rapidly down hesters cheeks while he was speaking yet they were not tears of unmingled grief  oh mr foster she said seizing the middys hand and kissing it how shall i ever thank you  before she could add another word an unlucky touch of fosters heel laid the easel with an amazing clatter flat on the marble floor hester bounded through the doorway more swiftly than her own gazelle slammed the door behind her and vanished like a vision  poor foster  although young and enthusiastic he was not a coxcomb the thrill in the hand that had been kissed told him plainly that he was hopelessly in love  but a dull weight on his heart told him he thought as plainly that hester was not in the same condition  dear child he said as he slowly gathered up the drawing materials if that innocent transparent almost infantine creature had been old enough to fall in love she would sooner have hit me on the nose with her lovely fist than have kissed my great ugly paweven though she was overwhelmed with joy at hearing about her father  having replaced the easel and drawing he seated himself on an ottoman put his elbows on his knees laid his forehead in his hands and began to meditate aloud  yes he said with a profound sigh i love herthats as clear as daylight and she does not love methats clearer than daylight unrequited love  thats what ive come to  nevertheless im not in wild despair  hows that  i dont want to shoot or drown myself hows that  on the contrary i want to live and rescue her  i could serve or die for that child with pleasurewithout even the reward of a smile  there must be something peculiar here  is itcan it be platonic love  of course that must be it  yes ive often heard and read of that sort of love before  i know it now andandi rather like it  you dont look as if you did geoge said a deep voice beside him  george started up with a face of scarlet  peter he exclaimed fiercely did you hear me speak  what did you hear  halo  geoge dont squeeze my arm so  yous hurtin me  i hear you say someting bout plotummik lub but what sort o lub that may be is moren i kin tell  are you sure that is all youbut come peter i should have no secrets from you  the truth is he whispered low here i have seen hester sommershere in this room not half an hour agoandand i feel that i am hopelessly in love with herplatonically that isbut i fear you wont understand what that means  the midshipman stopped abruptly  for the first time since they became acquainted he saw a grave expression of decided disapproval on the face of his sable friend  geoge said peter solemnly you tell me you hab took vantage ob bein invited to your masters house to make lubploplotummikilly or oderwiseto your masters slabe  no peter i told you nothing of the sort  the meeting with hester was purely accidentalat least it was none of my seekingand i did not make love to her  did she make lub to you geogeploplotummikilly  certainly not  she came to ask about her poor father and i saw that she is far too young to think of falling in love at all  what i said was that i have fallen hopelessly in love and that as i cannot hope that she will ever bebe mine i have made up my mind to love her hopelessly but loyally to the end of life and serve or die for her if need be  oh das all right geoge  if dats what you calls ploplotummik lublub away my boy as hards you kin  same time is not kite so sure dat shes too young to hub  an tings aint allers as hopeless as dey seems  but now whats dis you bin do here  my  how pritty  oh das real bootiful  but whats you got in de ceilingde sun eh  he pointed to the dab of crimsonlake  foster explained that it was merely a bit of colour  ob course  a cow wid half an eye could see dat  wellbut i meanits a sort ofa kind oftone to paint up to  hm das strange now  i dont hear no sound nowhar  well then its a shadow peter  geoge said the negro with a look of surprise i do tink your ploplotummik lub hab disagreed wid you  come long to de kitchen an hab your supperits all ready  so saying he went off with his friend and confidant to the culinary region which was also the salle a manger of the slaves    chapter eight  a severe trialsecret communication under difficulties and sudden flight  the devotion of our middy to the fine arts was so satisfactory in its results that benahmed set him to work at various other apartments in his dwelling when the first drawing was nearly finished  we say nearly finished because owing to some unaccountable whim the moor would not allow the first drawing to be completed  when foster had finished a painting of the central court his master was so pleased with the way in which he had drawn and coloured the various shrubs and flowers which grew there that he ordered him forthwith to commence a series of drawings of the garden from various points of view  in one of these foster introduced such a lifelike portrait of peter the great that benahmed was charmed and immediately gave orders to have most of his slaves portrayed while engaged in their various occupations  in work of this kind many months were spent for foster was a painstaking worker  he finished all his paintings with minute care having no capacity for offhand or rapid sketching  during this period the engrossing nature of his workof which he was extremely fond tended to prevent his mind from dwelling too much on his condition of slavery but it was chiefly the knowledge that hester sommers was under the same roof and the expectation that at any moment he might encounter her which reconciled him to his fate and even made him cheerful under it  but as week after week passed away and month after month without even a flutter of her dress being seen by him his heart failed him again and he began to fear that benahmeds son osman might have returned and carried her off as his bride or that she might have been sold to some rich mooreven to the dey himself  of course his black friend comforted him with the assurance that osman had not returned and that benahmed was not the man to sell a slave he was fond of but such assurances did not afford him much comfort  his mind was also burdened with anxiety about his mother and sister  he was sitting one day while in this state at an angle of the garden trying to devote his entire mind to the portrayal of a treefern and vainly endeavouring to prevent hester sommers from coming between him and the paper when he was summoned to attend upon benahmed  as this was an event of by no means uncommon occurrence he listlessly gathered up his materials and went into the house  he found the moor seated crosslegged on a carpet smoking his hookah with only a negress in attendance  his easel he found was already placed and to his surprise he observed that the original drawing with which his career as a painter had commenced was placed upon it  i wish you to finish that picture by introducing a figure said benahmed with solemn gravity  he spoke in lingua franca which foster understood pretty well by that time  it now became evident to him why the drawing of the room had been left unfinished and he thought it probable that modestyor perhaps a difficulty in overcoming the moslems dislike to being transferred to canvas at allhad caused the delay  in what attitude do you wish to be painted asked the middy as he moved the easel a little and took a professional headononeside look at his subject  in no attitude returned the moor gravely  pardon me said foster in surprise  did you not say thatthat  i said that i wish you to finish the drawing by introducing a figure returned benahmed taking a long draw at the hookah  just soand may i ask  the figure resumed the moor taking no notice of the interruption is to be one of my women slaves  here he turned his head slightly and gave a brief order to the negress in waiting who retired by the door behind her  the middy stood silent for a minute or so lost in wonder and expectation when another door opened and a female entered  she was gorgeously dressed and closely veiled so that her face was entirely concealed nevertheless george fosters heart seemed to bound into his throat and half choke him for he knew the size air and general effect of that female as well as if she had been his own mother  the moor rose led her to a cushion and bade her sit down  she did so with the grace of venus and then the moor removed her veillooking fixedly at the painter as he did so  but the middy had recovered selfpossession by that time  he was surprised as well as deeply concerned to observe that hesters beautiful face was very pale and her eyes were red and swollen as if from much crying but not a muscle in his stolid countenance betrayed the slightest emotion  he put his head a little to one side in the orthodox manner and looked steadily at her  then he looked at his painting and frowned as if considering the best spot in which to place this figure  then he began to work  meanwhile the moor sat down to smoke in such a position that he could see both painter and sitter  it was a severe test of our middys capacity to act the hyperkrite his heart was thumping at his ribs like a sledgehammer anxious to get out  his hand trembled so that he could scarcely draw a line and he was driven nearly mad with the necessity of presenting a calm thoughtful exterior when the effervescence within as he afterwards admitted almost blew his head off like a champagne cork  by degrees he calmed down ceased breaking the point of his pencil and used his indiarubber less frequently  then he took to colour and the brush and here the tide began to turn in his favour  such a subject surely never before sat to painter since the world began  he became engrossed in his work  the eyes became intent the hand steady the heart regular the whole man intense while a tremendous frown and compressed lips told that he meant business  not less intense was the attention of the moor  of course we cannot tell what his thoughts were but it seemed not improbable that his eccentric recklessness in violating all his mohammedan habits and traditions as to the seclusion of women by thus exposing hester to the gaze of a young infidel had aroused feelings of jealousy and suspicion which were not natural to his kindly and unmoorish cast of soul  but while young foster was employed in the application of his powers to energetic labour the old moor was engaged in the devotion of his powers to the consumption of smoke  the natural results followed while the painter became more and more absorbed so as to forget all around save his sitter and his work the moor became more and more devoted to his hookah till he forgot all around save the soporific influences of smoke  an almost oppressive silence ensued broken only by the soft puffing of benahmeds lips and an occasional change in the attitude of the painter  and oh how earnestly did that painter wish that benahmed would retireeven for a minuteto give him a chance of exchanging a word or two with his subject  but the moor was steady as a rock  indeed he was too steady for the curtains of his eyes suddenly fell and shut in the owlish glare with which he had been regarding the middy  at the same moment a sharp click and clatter sent an electric thrill to the hearts of all  the moors mouthpiece had fallen on the marble floor  benahmed picked it up and replaced it with severe gravity yet a faint flicker of red in his cheek and a very slight air of confusion showed that even a magnificent moor objects to be caught napping by his slaves  this incident turned fosters thoughts into a new channel  if the moor should again succumb to the demands of natureor the influence of tobaccohow could he best make use of the opportunity  it was a puzzling question  to speakin a whisper or otherwisewas not to be thought of  detection would follow almost certainly  the dumb alphabet would have been splendid though dangerous but neither he nor hester understood it  signs might do  he would try signs though he had never tried them before  what then  did not never venture never win faint heart never won etcetera and a host of similar proverbs assure him that a midshipman of all men should never say die  a few minutes more gave him the chance  again the mouthpiece fell but this time it dropped on the folds of the moors dress and in another minute steady breathing told that benahmed was in the land of nodif not of dreams  a sort of lightning change took place in the expressions of the young people  hesters face beamed with intelligence  fosters blazed with mute interrogation  the little maid clasped her little hands gazed upwards anxiously looked at the painter entreatingly and glanced at the moor dubiously  foster tried hard to talk to her only with his eyes  he even added some amazing motions of the lips which were meant to conveywhats the matter with you but they conveyed nothing for hester only shook her head and looked miserable  a mild choke at that moment caused the maid to fall into statuesque composure and the painter to put his frowning head tremendously to one side as he stepped back in order to make quite sure that the last touch was really equal if not superior to michael angelo himself  the moor resumed his mouthpiece with a suspicious glance at both slaves and foster with the air of a man who feels that michael was fairly overthrown stepped forward to continue his work  truly if peter the great had been there at the time he might have felt that he also was fairly eclipsed in his own particular line  foster now became desperate and his active mind began to rush wildly about in quest of useful ideas while his steady hand pursued its labour until the moor smoked himself into another slumber  availing himself of the renewed opportunity the middy wrapped a small piece of pencil in a little bit of paper and with the reckless daring of a man who had boarded a pirate singlehanded flung it at his ladylove  his aim was trueas that of a midshipman should be  the little bomb struck hester on the nose and fell into her lap  she unrolled it quickly and an expression of blank disappointment was the result for the paper was blank and she had expected a communication  she looked up inquiringly and beaming intelligence displaced the blank when she saw that foster made as though he were writing large text on his drawing she at once flattened the bit of paper on her kneeeyeing the moor anxiously the whileand scribbled a few words on the paper  a loud cough from foster followed by a violent sneeze caused her to crush the paper in her hand and again become intensely statuesque prompt though she was this would not have saved her from detection if the violence of fosters sneeze had not drawn the moors first glance away from her and towards himself  pardon me said the middy with a deprecatory air a sneeze is sometimes difficult to repress  does painting give englishmen colds asked the moor sternly  sometimes it doesespecially if practised out of doors in bad weather returned foster softly  hm  that will do for today  you may return to your painting in the garden  it will perhaps cure your cold  go he added turning to hester who immediately rose pushed the paper under the cushion on which she had been sitting and left the room with her eyes fixed on the ground  as the cat watches the mouse foster had watched the girls every movement while he bent over his paintbox  he saw where she put the paper  in conveying his materials from the room strange to say he slipped on the marble floor close to the cushion secured the paper as he rose and picking up his scattered things with an air of selfcondemnation retired humblyyet elatedfrom the presencechamber  need we say that in the first convenient spot he could find he eagerly unrolled the paper and read  i am lost  oh save me  osman has come  i have seen him hateful  he comes tomorrow to  the writing ended abruptly  my hideous sneeze did that growled foster savagely  but if i had been a moment later benahmed might havewell well no matter  she must be saved  she shall be saved  having said this clenched his teeth and hands and glared he began to wonder how she was to be saved  not being able to arrive at any conclusion on this point he went off in search of his friend peter the great  he found that worthy man busy mending a rake in a toolhouse and in a few eager words explained how matters stood  at first the negro listened with his wonted cheerful smile and helpful look which hitherto had been a sort of beaconlight to the poor midshipman in his troubles but when he came to the piece of paper and read its contents the smile vanished  osman home he said  if osman come back its a black lookout for poor hester  and the paper says tomorrow cried foster to take her away and marry her no doubt  peter i tell you she must be saved tonight  you and i must save her  if you wont aid me i will do it aloneor die in the attempt  geoge if you was to die a tousan times dat wouldnt sabe her  you know de kasba  yes yesgo on  well if you was to take dat on your shoulders an pitch im into de sea dat wouldnt sabe her  yes it would

eyes an mout an trust all to me  you understand geoge  i think i do said the relieved middy seizing the negros right hand and wringing it gratefully  bless your black face  i trust you from the bottom of my soul  it was indeed a source of immense relief to poor foster that his friend not only took up the matter with energy but spoke in such a cheery hopeful tone for the more he thought of the subject the more hopeless did the case of poor hester sommers appear  he could of course die for herand would if need werebut this thought was always followed by the depressing question what good would that do to her  two hours after the foregoing conversation occurred peter the great was seated in a dark little back court in a low coffeehouse in one of the darkest narrowest and most intricate streets of algiers  he sat on an empty packingbox  in front of him was seated a stout negress in whom an ethiopian might have traced some family likeness to peter himself  now dinah said he continuing an earnest conversation which had already lasted for some time you understand de case properlyeh  ob course i does said dinah  well den you must go about it at once  not a minute to lose  youll find me at de gardin door  ill let you in  you know who yous got to sabe an you must find out your own way to sabe her annow hol your tongue  yous just agoin to speaki must know nuffin  don tell me one

replied this pattern wife  an youssefwhat ob him  hes moren tree quarters blind  kin see noting an understans less  dinah yous a good woman remarked her appreciative brother as he rose to depart  now remember dis am de most important job you an i hab had to do since we was took by de pirits out ob de same ship  an i do tink de lord hab bin bery good to us for hes gin us good massas at last though we had some roughish ones at fust  foller me as quick as you can  dinah being a warmhearted woman and very sympathetic did not waste time  she reached benahmeds villa only half an hour later than her brother with a basket of groceries and other provisions that peter had purchased in town  peter took care that the young negress whom we have already introduced as an attendant in the house should be sent to receive the basket and dinah took care that she should not return to the house until she had received a bouquet of flowers to present to the young english girl in the harem  inside of this bouquet was a little note written by peter  it ran thus  tri an git owt to de gardin soons yoo kan  when hester sommers discovered this note the first ray of hope entered into her fluttering heart and she resolved to profit by it  meanwhile dinah instead of quitting the place after delivering her basket hid herself in the shrubbery  it was growing dark by that time and peter made a noisy demonstration of sending one of the slaves to see that the garden gate was locked for the night  thereafter he remained all the rest of the evening in his own apartments in pretty loud conversation with the slaves  suddenly there was a cry raised and several slaves belonging to the inner household rushed into the outer house with glaring eyes shouting that the english girl could not be found  not in de house cried peter starting up in wild excitement  nonowhar in de house  to de gardin quick shouted peter leading the way while benahmed himself with undignified haste joined in the pursuit  lanterns were lighted and were soon flitting like fireflies all over the garden but no trace of the fugitive was found  peter entered into the search with profound interest being as yet utterly ignorant of the method of escape devised by his sister  suddenly one of the slaves discovered it  a pile of empty casks laid against the wall in the form of a giant staircase showed how hester had climbed and a crushed bush on the other side testified to her mode of descent  benahmed and peter ran up to the spot together  dey cant hab gone far massa  you want de horses eh asked the latter  yes  two horses quick  peter went off to the stables in hot haste remarking as he ran  what a hyperkrite i is to be sure    chapter nine  hester introduced to a new home and new friends under peculiar circumstances and a new name  long before their flight was discovered hester sommers and dinah had penetrated into a dense thicket where the negress proceeded to produce a wonderful metamorphosis  now my dear she said hastily undoing a large bundle which she carried while hester panting and terrified sat down on the grass beside her dont you be frighted  is your frind  is dinah de sister ob peter de great an de frind also ob geoge  so you make your mind easy  my mind is quite easy said hester and even if you were not peters sister id trust you because of the tone of your kind voice  but who is geoge  dinah opened her eyes very wide at this question for peter had already enlightened her mind a little as to the middys feelings towards hester  you not know geoge she asked  never heard of him before dinah  geoge foster  oh i understand  it was your way of pronouncing his name that puzzled me returned the girl with a faint smile  im glad you are his friend too poor fellow  well you is a babby exclaimed dinah who had been mixing up what appeared to be black paint in a wooden bowl  now look yar dont you be frighted  its a matter ob life an deaf you know but is your frind  jest you do zackly what i tells you  yes dinah said hester alarmed notwithstanding by the earnestness and solemnity of her new friend what am i to do  you come yar an dont moob whateber i does to you  dere is goin to make you a nigger  she applied a large brush to hesters forehead and drew it thence down her left cheek under her chin up the right cheek and back to the starting point thus producing a black band or circle two inches broad  now shut your bootiful eyes she said and proceeded to fill up the circle  in a quarter of an hour hester was as black as the ace of spadesneck hands and arms as well as faceher fair hair was effectually covered and concealed by a cotton kerchief and then her dress was changed for the characteristic costume of negro women  now your own mudder wouldnt know you said dinah stepping back to survey her work and strange to say putting her black head quite artistically a little on one side  yous amost as goodlookin as myselfif you was ony a little fatter  now mind yous a dumb gal cant speak a word  dont forgit dat  an your names geogiana  come along  leaving her fine clothes concealed in a deep hole hester followed her companion as fast as she could  on returning to the road dinah took her friend by the hand and helped her to run for a considerable distance then they walked and then ran again until poor hester was almost exhausted  resuming their walk after a short rest they gained the main road and met with several people who paid no attention to them whatever much to hesters relief for she had made sure of being detected  at last they reached the city gate which was still open as the sun had not yet set passing through unchallenged dinah at once dived into a maze of narrow streets and for the first time since starting felt comparatively safe  fortunately for the success of their enterprise the negress costume fitted loosely so that the elegance of hesters form was not revealed and her exhaustion helped to damage the grace of her carriage  now dearie you come in yar an rest a bit said dinah turning into a dark cellarlike hole from which issued both sounds and smells that were not agreeable  it was the abode of one of dinahs friendsalso a negresswho received her with effusive goodwill  retiring to the coalholeor some such dark receptacledinah held her friend in conversation for about a quarter of an hour during which time several hearty ethiopian chuckles were heard to burst forth  then returning to the cellar dinah introduced her friend to hester as missis lilly and hester to missis lilly as miss geogiana  wondering why her friend had selected for her the nameif she remembered rightlyof one of blue beards wives hester bowed and was about to speak when dinah put her flat nose close to hers and sternly said dumb  moreober she continued you mustnt bow like a lady or youll be diskivered mediately  you must bob  sally  this last word was shouted  the instant effect was the abrupt stoppage of one of the disagreeable sounds before referred toa sound as of poundingand the appearance of a black girl who seemed to rise out of a pit in the floor at the darkest end of the cellar  sally show dis yar stoopid gal how to bob  the girl instantly broke off so to speak at the knees for a moment and then came straight again  now geogiana you bob  hester entered into the spirit of the thing and broke off admirably whereat dinah and lilly threw back their heads and shook their sides with laughter  sally so far joined them as to show all her teeth and gums  otherwise she was expressionless  now you come yar wid me into dis room said dinah taking hesters hand and heading her along a passage which was so profoundly dark that the very walls and floor were invisible  turning suddenly to the left dinah advanced a few paces and stood still  you stop where you is geogiana till i gits a light  dont stir she said and left her  a feeling of intense horror began to creep over the poor girl when she was thus left alone in such a horrible place and she began almost to regret that she had forsaken the comfortable home of the moor and to blame herself for ingratitude  in her agony she was about to call aloud to her negro friend not to forsake her when the words call upon me in the time of trouble occurred to her and falling on her knees she cast herself upon god  she was not kept waiting long  only a minute or two had elapsed when dinah returned with a candle and revealed the fact that they stood in a small lowroofed room the brick floor of which was partially covered with casks packingcases and general lumber  dis am to be your room geogiana said her friend holding the candle over her head and surveying the place with much satisfaction  poor hester shuddered  it is an awful place she said faintly  yes it am a awrful good place said dinah with satisfaction  not easy to find you yar an if dey did git dis lengt widout breakin dere legs deres a nice leetil hole yar what you could git in an larf to youself  she led the poor girl to the other end of the room where in a recess there was a boarded part of the wall  removing one of the boards she disclosed an opening  das a small hole geogiana but its big enough to hold you an when yous inside youve ony got to pull de board into its place and fix itso  setting down the candle the woman stepped into the hole and went through the performance that would devolve upon hester in case of emergency  but why leave me here at all pleaded hester when dinah had exhausted her eulogy of the hidingplace  why not take me to your own home  cause its not so safe as dis answered dinah  praps in time you may come derenot now  moreober missis lilly is a fussrate creetur most as good as myself if her temper was a leetil more eavenly  but shes a winged serubim wid dem as dont rile er an shell be awrful good to you for my sake an peters  you see we was all on us took by the pints at de same time and were all christns but ob course we dont say much about dat yar  and am i to be always dumbnever to speak at all asked hester in a rather melancholy tone  oh nobress you  its ony when youre in de front or outside dat yous dumb  when yous back yar you may speak to lilly an sally much as you like ony not too loud an keep your eyes open an your ears sharp always  if you dont its lost you will be  dont forgit osman  hester shuddered again said that she would never forget osman and would be as careful and attentive to orders as possible  an deyll gib you a little work to donot muchony a little  when peepil speak to you just point to your ears and mout an shake your head  das enuff  dey wont boder you arter dat  now dearie i must go  ill come an see you sometimesneber fear  whats to become ob you in de longruns moren i kin tell for its peter de great asll hab to settle dat kestion  yous in his hands  i knows noting so youll hab to be patient  patient indeed  little did that poor painted slave think what demands would yet be made upon her patience  full two months elapsed before she again saw peter or heard anything about benahmed and her former friends at mustapha  meanwhile dinah having departed she wisely set herself to make the most of her new friends  mrs lilly she soon found to be quite as amiable as dinah had described her  she and sally were slaves to the moor who dwelt in the house which formed the superstructure of their cellars but unlike white slaves they were allowed a good deal of personal liberty first because there was no danger of their running away as they had no place to run to second because their master wanted them to buy and sell vegetables and other things in order that he might reap the profit and last because being an easygoing man the said master had no objection to see slaves happy as long as their happiness did not interfere in any way with his pleasure  now geogiana said mrs lilly in the course of their first conversation my massa he neber come down yar nor trouble his head about us as longs i take him a leetle money ebery day an nobody else hab got a right to come so yous pretty safe if dey dont send de janissaries to make a sarchan if dey do you know whar to go  ill tell massa we make more money if i gits anoder slabegal an hell agree for he agrees to eberyting ob dat sort  den hell forgit all about it an den you an sally kin go about town what you like  but i fear mrs lilly that i wont be able to help you to make more money objected hester timidly  oh yes you will  youll larn to broider de red an blue slippers das pay well when neatly done an i kin see by de shape ob your fingers you do it neatly  yous hungry now i darsay so go to work at your grub an den ill show you what to do  somewhat comforted by the kindly tone and motherly bearing of mrs lilly hester went into one of the dark cellarlike rooms of the interior of her new home and found it to be a sort of kitchen which borrowed its light from the outer room by means of a convenient wall that was whitewashed for the purpose of transmitting it  this reflector was not an eminent success but it rendered darkness visible at the time we write of however the sun having set the kitchen was lighted by a smoky oillamp of classic form and dimness  here she found sally busy with her evening meal  sally was apparently about as little of a human being as was consistent with the possession of a human form and the power of speech  most of her qualities seemed to be negativeif we may say so  she was obviously not unamiable she was not unkind and she was not sulky though very silent  in fact she seemed to be the nearest possible approach to a human nonentity  she may be described as a black maidofallwork but her chief occupation was the pounding of roasted coffeebeans  this operation she performed in the pit in the floor before mentioned which may be described as a hole into which you descended by four steps from the front room  as the front room itself was below the level of the street it follows that the pit penetrated considerably deeper into the bowels of the earth  in this pit sally laboured hard almost day and night pounding the coffeebeans in an iron mortar with an iron pestle so heavy that she had to stand up and use it with both hands  she had got into the habit of relieving herself by an audible gasp each time she drove the pestle down  it was not a necessary gasp only a remonstrative one as it were and conveyed more to the intelligent listener than most of the girls average conversation did  this gasp was also one of the disagreeable sounds which had saluted the ears of hester on her first entrance into the new home  mrs lilly is very kind said hester as she sat down at a small table beside her fellowslave  sally stopped eating for a moment and stared  supposing that she had not understood the remark hester repeated it  yes assented sally and then stopped the vocal orifice with a huge wooden spoonful of rice  judging that her companion wished to eat in undisturbed silence hester helped herself to some rice and quietly began supper  sally eyed her all the time but was too busy feeding herself to indulge in speech  at last she put down her spoon with a sigh of satisfaction and said das good with such an air of honest sincerity that hester gave way to an irresistible laugh  yes it is very good indeed  did you cook it asked hester anxious to atone for her impoliteness  yes  i cook im  i do all de cookin in dis yar ousean most ob de eatin too  by the way sally what is it that you keep pounding so constantly in thatthat hole off the front room  coffee answered sally with a nod  indeed  surely not the household coffee  you cannot drink such a quantity  sally stared for a minute then opened her mouth shut her eyes threw back her head and chuckled  no she said with sudden gravity if we drinkd it all wed all bust right off  i pounds it missis lilly sells it an massa pockets de money  do you pound much asked hester in a tone of sympathy  oh housefuls said sally opening her eyes wide  gin at daylight work till dark cept when doin oder tings  de moors drink it awrful drinkers am de moors  mornin noon an night dey swill leetle cups ob coffee  das de reason deys all so brown  indeed  i never heard before that the brownness of their complexion was owing to that  are you sure  oh yes kite sure  coffee comes troo de skindas it returned sally with perfect confidence of tone and manner  suddenly she was smitten with a new idea and stared for some time at her fellowslave  at last she got it out  missis lilly say dat yous dumb  how kin you speak so well if yous dumb  poor hester was greatly perplexed  she did not know how far her companion had been let into the secret reason of her being there and was afraid to answer  at last she made up her mind  i am not really dumb you know i have only to be dumb when in the street or when any visitor is in the house here but when alone with mrs lilly or you i am allowed to speak low  a gleam of intelligence beamed on the black girls face as she said no yous not dumb  moreober yous not black  oh sally exclaimed hester in quite a frightened tone how did you find that out  hasnt i got eyes an ears demanded sally  your voice aint nigger your plexion aint nigger an your mout an nose aint nigger  does you tink sallys an ass  no indeed i am sure you are not butbut youyou wont betray me sally  whas dat  you wont tell upon me  oh you cant think what dreadful punishment i shall get if i am found out  you wont tell on me dear sallywont you not entreated hester with tears in her eyes  dere stop dat  dont cry  das wuss dan speakin for de tearzll wash all de black off your face  tell on you  dee see dat  hester certainly did see dat for sally had suddenly protruded we fear to say how many inches of red flesh from her mouth  i cut dat off wid de carvinknife sooner dan tell on you for yous my frind because peter de great am your frind  but you muss be dumb dumb as you kin anyhowan you mus neberneber cry  the earnestness of this remark caused hester to laugh even when on the verge of weeping so she grasped sallys hand and shook it warmly thus cementing the friendship which had so auspiciously begun  after the meal mrs lilly took her lodger into the front room and gave her embroidery work to do  she found it by no means difficult having learned something like it during her residence with benahmeds household  at night she retired to the dark lumberroom but as sally owned one of the corners of it hester did not feel as lonely as she had feared and although her bed was only made of straw it was by no means uncomfortable being spread thickly and covered with two blankets  she dreamed of course and it may easily be understood that her dreams were not pleasant and that they partook largely of terrible flights from horrible dangers and hairbreadth escapes from an ogre who whatever shape he might assume always displayed the head and features of the hated osman  next morning however she arose pretty well refreshed and inexpressibly thankful to find that she was still safe  for a long time she remained thus in hiding  then as it was considered probable that search for her had been given up as useless mrs lilly resolved to send her out with sally to one of the obscurer marketplaces to purchase some household necessaries  you see chile said the motherly woman you git sick on my hands if you not go out an deres no danger  just keep your shawl well ober your face an hold your tongue  dont forgit dat  let em kill you if dey likes but dont speak  with this earnest caution ringing in her ears hester went forth with sally to thread the mazes of the town  at first she was terribly frightened and fancied that every one who looked at her saw through her disguise but as time passed and no one took the least notice of her her natural courage returned and gradually she began to observe and take an interest in the strange persons and things she saw everywhere around her    chapter ten  torture is applied in vain and true love is not to be deceived  we must return now to the residence of benahmed at mustapha  when his son osmanwho had seen hester only once and that for but a few minutesdiscovered that the fair slave had fled his rage knew no bounds  he immediately sent for peter the great and sternly asked him if he knew how the english girl had escaped  their intercourse we may remark was carried on in the same curious manner as that referred to in connection with benahmed  osman spoke in lingua franca and peter replied in his ordinary language  oh yes massa i know said the latter with intense earnestness she escaped ober de wall  blockhead exclaimed the irate osman who was a sturdy but illfavoured specimen of moslem humanity  of course i know that but how did she escape over the wall  don know dat massa  you see is not dere at de time so cant zactly say  moreober it was bery dark an eben if is dar i couldnt see peepil in de dark  you lie you black scoundrel and you know that you do  you could tell me much more about this if you chose  no indeed i dont lieif a slabe may dar to counterdick his massa returned peter humbly  but yous right when you say i could tell you much more  oh  i could tell you heaps more  in de fuss place i was sotin wid de oder slabes in de kitchen enjoyin ourselves arter supper wen we hear a cry  oh my how my heart jump  den all our legs jump and out we hoed wid lanterns an  fool dont i know all that  now tell me the truth has the english slave george fosfosi forget his name  geoge foster suggested the negro with an amiable look  yes has foster had no hand in the matter  unpossible i tink said peter  you see he was wid me and all de oder slabes when de girl hoed off an i dont tink eben a englishman kin be in two places at one time  but you kin ax him hes in de gardin  go fetch him growled the young moor and tell four of my men to come here  they are waiting outside  the negro retired and soon after four stout moorish seamen entered they seemed worthy of their gruff commander who ordered them to stand at the inner end of the room  as he spoke he took up an iron instrument somewhat like a poker and thrust it into a brazier which contained a glowing charcoal fire  presently peter the great returned with young foster  osman did not condescend to speak directly to him but held communication through the negro  of course our hero could throw no light on the subject being utterly ignorant of everythingas peter had wisely taken the precaution to ensureexcept of the bare fact that hester was gone  now it is my opinion said osman with a savage frown that you are both deceiving me and if you dont tell the truth i will take means to force it out of you  saying this he turned to the brazier and pulled out the iron poker to see that it was becoming redhot  the countenance of the negro became very grave as he observed this and the midshipmans heart sank within him  so you deliberately tell me said the moor abruptly as he wheeled round and confronted peter the great that you have no knowledge as to where or with whom this girl is  no massa answered the negro with solemn sincerity  if you was to skin me alive i not able to tell you whar she is or who she is wid  peter said no more than this aloud but he added internally that he would sooner die than give any further information even if he had it to give  osman made a motion with his hand as a signal to the four seamen who advancing quickly seized the negro and held him fast  one of the men then stripped off the poor mans shirt  at the same moment osman drew the redhot iron from the fire and deliberately laid it on peters back the skin of which hissed and almost caught fire while a cloud of smoke arose from it  the hapless victim did not struggle  he was well aware that resistance would be useless  he merely clenched his teeth and hands  but when osman removed the iron and applied it to another part of his broad back a deep groan of agony burst from the poor fellow and beads of perspiration rolled from his brow  at first george foster could scarcely believe his eyes  he was almost paralysed by an intense feeling of horror  then there came a tremendous rebound  rage astonishment indignation fury and a host of cognate passions met and exploded in his bosom  uttering a yell that harmonised therewith he sprang forward hit osman a straight english lefthander between the eyes and followed it up with a righthander in the gullet which sent the cruel monster flat on the floor and his head saluted the bricks with an effective bump  in his fall the moor overturned the brazier and brought the glowing fire upon his bosom which it set alighthis garments being made of cotton  to leap up with a roar of pain and shake off the glowing cinders was the work of a moment  in the same moment two of the stout seamen threw themselves on the roused midshipman and overcame himnot however before one of them had received a black eye and the other a bloody nose for moors do not understand the art of selfdefence with the fists  down with him shouted osman when he had extinguished the flames  he seized a supple cane or wand as the seamen threw foster down and held his feet in the air after tearing off his shoes  wild with fury osman brought the cane down on the poor youths soles it was his first taste of the bastinado  the agony took him by surprise and extorted a sharp yell  next moment his teeth were in the calf of one of the mens legs and his right hand grasped the baggy trousers of the other  a compound kick and plunge overturned them both and as they all fell into a heap the cheek of one seaman received a stinging blow that was meant for the middys soles  things had reached this crisis and peter the great having hurled aside his two assailants was on the point of rushing to the rescue of his friend when the door burst open and benahmed stood before them quivering with indignation  is this your return for my forbearance  begone he shouted to his son in a voice of thunder  osman knew his father too well to require a second bidding  he left the room angrily and a look from benahmed sent the four sailors after him  the moor was too well accustomed to his wild sons ways to require any explanation of the cause of the fracas  just giving one glance at his slaves to make sure that neither was killed he left the room as hastily as he had entered it  my poor friend exclaimed the middy grasping the negros hand with a gush of mingled enthusiasm and pity i trust you have not been much injured by that inhuman brute  oh bress you no  it do smart a bit returned peter as he put on his shirt uneasily an is used to it geoge you know  but hows your poo feet  well im not vary sure replied foster making a wry face as he sat down to examine them  how it did sting peter  i owe a heavy debt of gratitude to old benahmed for cutting it short  no the skins not damaged i see but there are two or three most awful weals  dyou know i never before this day felt sorry that i wasnt born a dog  whys dat geoge  because then i should have been able to make my teeth meet in yon fellows leg and would have held on  yes i dont know what i would not have given just at that time to have been born a mastiff or a huge saint bernard or a thoroughbred british bulldog with double the usual allowance of canines and grinders  the negro threw back his head and began one of his silent laughs but suddenly stopped opened his eyes wide pursed his lips and moved his broad shoulders uneasily  i mus laugh easy for some time to come he remarked  poor fellow said foster i fear you must  i sayhow my soles do sting  oh yes i knows returned peter with a remarkably intelligent nod but come  we mus go an see what massas agoin to do for you bery sure he wont rest quiet till hes turned ebery stone to find missy hester  peter the great left the room with a brave effort to suppress a groan while our middy followed with an equally valorous determination not to limp  in both efforts they were but partially successful  as peter had prophesied benahmed did indeed leave no stone unturned to recover hester sommers but there was one consideration which checked him a good deal and prevented his undertaking the search as openly as he wished and that was the fear that the dey himself might get wind of what he was about and so become inquisitive as to the cause of the stir which so noted a man was making about a runaway slave  for benahmed fearedand so did osmanthat if the dey saw hester he might want to introduce her into his own household  the caution which they had therefore to observe in prosecuting the search was all in favour of the runaway  as time passed by hester alias geogiana began to feel more at ease in her poor abode and among her new friends who although unrefined in manners were full to overflowing with the milk of human kindness so that at last the unfortunate english girl began to entertain positive affection for mrs lilly and her black handmaiden  she also began to feel more at ease in traversing the intricate streets of the city for the crowds that passed her daily had evidently too much to do attending to their own business to bestow more than an indifferent glance at two negro girls  and if the features of one of the two was not according to the familiar negro type it is probable that all the inhabitants of algiers were aware of the fact that some of the tribes of black people in the interior of africa possess the wellformed features and comparatively thin lips of europeans  as hesters anxieties about herself began to abate however her desire to find out where and how her father was became more and more intense but the poor child was doomed to many months of hope deferred before that desire was gratified  peter the great did indeed make a few efforts to meet with him again sometimes in company with george foster more frequently alone and occasionally he visited hesterhaving been informed by his sister dinah where to find herin order to tell of his want of success and to comfort her with earnest assurances that he would neber forsake her but would keep up a constant lookout for her fadder an an eye on herself  consideration for the girls safety rendered it necessary that these visits should be few and far between and of course owing to the same necessity our middy was not permitted to visit her at all  indeed peter refused to tell him even where she was hiding all the information he condescended to give being that she was safe  you see my dear said peter to hester in a paternal tone on the occasion of the first of these visits if i was to come yar oftin massaspecally osmanwould gin to wonder an de moment a man gins to wonder he gins to suspec an den he gins to watch an if it comes to dat its all up wid you an me  so you mus jest keep close an say nuffin till de tide gins to turn an de wind blow fair  de good lord kin turn wind an tide when he likes so keep your heart up geogiana  as he uttered the last word the negro put his great hand on the girls shoulder and patted it  what a good name geogiana am he continued bringing his eyes to bear on the slender little black creature before him an what a good nigger you would make if ony you had an elegant flat nose an bootiful thick hips  neber mind yous better lookin dan sally anyhow an no mortal could guess who you was eben if he was told to look hard at you  but oh peter this is such an anxious weary life began hester with a trembling lip  now hold on dar interrupted the negro almost sternly you mus not cry whateber you do for it washes off de black  you mus larn to cumtroul your feelins  i will try returned hester attempting to smile  but it is not that i am discontented with my lot for they are as kind to me here as if they were my mother and sister and i like doing the embroidery work very muchits not that  it is the weary waiting and hoping for and expecting news of my darling fathernews which never comes  now dont you tink like dat geogiana but larn to submitsubmit das de word  de newsll come all in good time  an news allers comes in a heapsuddently so to speak  it neber comes slow  now look yar  i wants you to make me a solum promise  what is that asked hester smiling in spite of herself at the intensity of her dark friends look and manner  it am dis  dat you will neber look surprised nor speak surprised no matter howeber much you may feel surprised  you impose a difficult task on me peter  ob course i do geogiana but as your lifean praps mine but dat aint muchdepends on it youll see de needcessity  i will certainly tryfor your sake as well as my own returned hester fervently  well i tink you will but it aint easy an ill test you some day  it was more than a month after that before peter the great paid her another visit and to the poor girls grief he still came without news of her father  he had been all over the kasba he said and many other places where the slaves worked but he meant to persevere  the city was big and it would take time but geogiana was to cheer up for he would neber gib in  one morning peter announced to foster that he was going into town to make purchases and he wanted his assistance to carry the basket  are we going to make another search for poor mr sommers asked the middy as he walked along the road holding one handle of the empty basket  no wes got no time for dat today  i mus be back early  got time ony for one call on a friend ob mine  das all  as the negro did not seem inclined for conversation foster forebore to trouble him but observed without remarking on the circumstance that instead of taking their accustomed way to the marketplace they passed along many narrow steep and intricate streets until they reached what the midshipman conceived to be the very heart of the city  dis am de house ob my friend said peter stopping in front of an opening which descended into a cellar  foller me geoge an bring down de baskit wid you  hallo missis lilly  is you widin  hi  das you peter de great came in shrill tones from below as they descended  dumb exclaimed peter with peculiar emphasis on reaching the cellar how you do missis lilly  oberjoyed to see you lookin so fresh  just looked in to ax how yous gettin along  need we say that peters warning word was not thrown away on hester sommers who was seated in her corner embroidering with gold thread a pair of red morocco slippers  but forewarned though she was her presence of mind was put to a tremendous test when all unexpectedly george foster descended the steps and stood before her  fortunately while the youth was bestowing a hearty nautical greeting on mrs lilly for his greeting was always hearty as well to new acquaintances as to old friendshester had time to bend over her work and thus conceal the sudden pallor followed by an equally sudden flush which changed her complexion from a bluish grey to a burnt sienna  when george turned to glance carelessly at her she was totally absorbed in the slipper  the negro watched the midshipmans glance with keen interest  when he saw that only a passing look was bestowed on hester and that he then turned his eyes with some interest to the hole where sally was pounding coffee and gasping away with her wonted energy he said to himself mentally ho dinah but you am a cleber woman  geoge dont rignise her moren if she was a rigler coloured gal  i do blieve her own fadder wouldnt know her  he then proceeded to have a talk with mrs lilly and while he was thus engaged the middy who had an inquiring disposition began to look round the cellar and take mentalartistic notes of its appearance  then he went up to hester and taking up one of the finished slippers examined it  most beautiful  exquisite he said  does it take you long to do this sort of thing  the girl did not reply  shes dumb said peter quickly  ah poor thing returned foster in a voice of pity  deaf too i suppose  well i dont know as to dat geoge  is this one dumb too asked the middy pointing to the coffeehole  oh dear no interposed lilly  sally ant dumb shes awrful sharp with er tongue  she ought to be deaf anyhow considering the row she kicks up down there  come now geoge its time we was goin  so pick up de baskit an go ahead  bidding mrs lilly an affectionate adieu the two shaves left the cellar to the intense relief of poor hester who scarce knew whether to laugh or cry over the visit  she had been so eagerly anxious to speak to foster yet had managed to keep her promise in spite of the peculiarly trying circumstances  peter said the middy when they had got well out of the town on their way home what made you say dumb so emphatically when you descended into that cellar  did i say dumb returned the negro with an inquiring look at the clouds  you certainly did  phatically too  yes most emphatically  well now das most remarkably strange  not so strange as my finding hester sommers in a coalhole making golden slippers  at this peter set down the basket threw back his head and took a prolonged silent laugh  now dat is de strangest ting ob all  didnt i tink you not rignise her one bit  peter returned the midshipman gravely you ought to know from experience that true love pierces every disguise  das troo geoge said peter as he lifted his end of the basket and resumed the journey  lub is a wonderful ting an i aint sure what might come ob it if i was took unawares to see my angelica arter shed bin painted white  but deres one ting as comforts me a leetle an dat is dat peter de great aint de biggest hyperkrite in de world arter all for de way you purtended not to know dat gal an de way she purtended not to know you hab took de wind out ob my sails altogidder    chapter eleven  dangers vicissitudes escapes new surroundings hopes and fears  it was probably an advantage to hester sommers that she had been subjected to so severe a test at that time for not many weeks afterwards she experienced a shock which put her powers of selfrestraint to a much severer trial  it happened thus  sally and she were on their way home from market one day the former with a large basket of vegetables on her head and the latter with a lighter basket of oranges on her arm for the use of the master at home  they had come to one of the wider of the narrow streets of the town where the small shops were numerous and the throng of passersby was considerableas also was the noise for jews moors cabyles and negroes were conversing and jostling each other in all directions  presently a band of slaves approached and as it passed hester nearly fainted for among them she beheld her father with irons on his legs and a shovel and pick on his shoulder  father she exclaimed in a faint voice and stretching out her arms made an effort to run towards him  quick as lightning sally grasped the situation and rising to the occasion with that prompt energy which betokens true genius she seized hester by the nape of the neck hurled her to the ground and sent her oranges flying in all directions  at the same time she began to storm at her with a volubility of invective that astonished herself as well as the amused bystanders  as for poor hugh sommers the noise had prevented him from hearing the word father and all that met his eyes was one black girl roughly using another  alas the poor man had been by that time so much accustomed to witness acts of cruelty that the incident gave him little concern  he passed doggedly onward to his thankless unremitting toil which had been rendered all the more severe of late in consequence of his despairing violence having compelled his drivers to put the heavy irons on his limbs  meanwhile sally having made hester pick up some of the oranges seized her by an arm and hurried her away  nor did she desist scolding until she had her fairly down in the back regions of their cellarhome  i will never forgive you exclaimed hester with flashing eyes doubling up her small fists and apparently wishing that at least for one quarter of an hour she might be transformed into a female samson  oh yes you will returned the negress coolly youll forgib me when i tells you dat i hab sab your fadders life an praps your own too  how  what do you mean demanded hester relaxing her little fists slightly though still coruscating in the region of the eyes  i means dat if you got hold ob yer fadder dat time he bery likely grip you tight an refuse to part wid you at no price ebermore so den ob course dey tear him away an he kick up a shindy an try to kill somebodypraps do it  oh itss allers de way  is oftin seen it wid the big strong menan your fadder am big  dat was him wasnt it wid de broad shoulders an de nice facea leetle wildlike praps but no wonderan de grey beard  yes that was himmy darling father  well ob course dey take him away an bastinado him till he die or strangle him or frow him on de hooks an dey take you right away back to osman or wuss  i dood it for de best geogiana  oh  sally dear dear sally forgive me  but it was such an awful disappointment to be hurried away so just as i saw him  iiam very wicked sally will you forgive me said poor little hester bursting suddenly into tears throwing her arms round her friends neck and kissing her  forgib you geogiana  das not difficult to do but ill neber forgib you if you go slobberin like dat an dirtyin my face wid your black cheeks  dar now is got to polish you up again  this polishing up it may be remarked was a duty which sally was called on to perform rather frequently in consequence of hesters inveterate tendency to think of her father and shed tears  but her sable friend whose stolid exterior concealed a wealth of affection rather enjoyed the process of polishing up and while engaged in it broke out into quite eloquent dissertations as to the impropriety of washing ones face with tears when there was plenty of soap and water coupled with earnest exhortations to keep up heart and recommendations not to gib in neber to say die and the like  on this particular occasion the sympathetic sally gave her friend inexpressible comfort by assuring her that having at last seen her father and the gang to which he belonged she could now easily follow them up and find out where they were set to work  and so geogiana said she in conclusion someting may come ob dis meetin praps moren you tink  something certainly did come of it as we shall see presently but just now we must turn to another danger which threatened our english slave and in regard to which the previous testing of her powers of selfrestraint was but a trifle  one morning hester was seated in the usual corner busily engaged with her embroidery and with her mind still more busily employed in devising all sorts of impossible schemes for the deliverance of her fatherfor sally had discovered the exact spot on the fortifications where hugh sommers was at work and only prevented hester from rushing out at once to see him by resolutely refusing for a time to tell where that spot was  mrs lilly and hester were alone at the time we refer to sally having gone out to the market  dearie i specs peter de great dis arternoon said mrs lilly raising herself from a culinary pot to which she had been devoting her attention  dis am about de time he ornarly comes to see you and tell you how de land lies  now dat he knows yous seed your fadder hell likely hab someting tickler to say to you  god grant that he may have something hopeful to suggest said hester without looking up from her work  you may be sure dat prayer is answered dearie for you trust de lord an no one does dat in vain  as the woman spoke the familiar voice was heard outside hi missis lilly hows you all git along down dar  at the same moment the opening to the street was darkened by peters bulky form as he descended the narrow stair  shaking hands with hester who rose eagerly to greet him the negro was about to begin an earnest talk with her as to how she should act in regard to her father if she should again meet him when a voice was heard that sent a deadly chill alike to the hearts of hester and the negro  is the cellar far from this asked the voice which was that of osman  no here it is  guard your feet the second step is broken and the place is rather dark replied the owner of the house  osman whispered peter glaring and clenching his fists in an agony of uncertainty how to act  mrs lilly however blackwomanlike rose to the occasion  go down dar you black wretch she cried thrusting hester quickly down into the coffeehole how you spose massa git his dollars if you not work  go to work or ill skin you  truly those negroes male and female seemed to possess most effective capacity for and original methods of coming to the rescue of their friends in moments of danger  as mrs lilly uttered the last words the two visitors stood in the cellar  at the same instant the thud of the great pestle began and so intelligently did hester perform her part that the familiar gasp of sallyadmirably imitatedcame up with every blow  what peter the great  you here cried osman in extreme surprise  yes massa is here on a little bit ob business wid missis lilly shes a frind ob my sister dinah answered peter humbly  oh indeed  with my fathers permission i suppose  yes massa osman  i neber dar to come in de town widout your fadders purmission  osman turned and addressed a few words in an undertone to the master of the house who thereupon turned to mrs lilly  you are a wise woman lilly he said so i have come to consult you it seems that one of the slaves belonging to benahmed of mustapha has made her escape and it is rumoured that she has taken refuge with some one in this very street or in one not far from it  now as you are well acquainted with almost every one in the neighbourhood i thought it best to come in the first place to you to ask your advice about the matter  the gasp that came from the coffeehole when this speech was made had something very real in it and immediately afterwards the pounding was redoubled  was the slabe white or black asked mrs lilly with childlike simplicity and more for the purpose of gaining time to think than anything else  she was white interposed osman and very beautifulin fact one of the ladies of the harem  on hearing this mrs lilly looked inquiringly upwards as if she expected inspiration to flow from the bricks that formed the vaulted ceiling  then she looked suddenly at peter the great and said  das mus be de lady you was tole me about peteristerhisterwat you call er  yeshester  das so  de same as i tole you all about her scape answered peter quaking with anxiety and astonishment at the womans calm boldness yet ready to fall in with any plan that her words might suggest  at the same time the gasping in the hole became more and more genuine and the pounding more and more emphatic  no massa i don know of no white slabe as hab took refuge wid any ob our neighbours  indeed is kite sure dat none ob de neighbours knows noting at all about dis iseswat you call her  ester  das so peter  yes das so missis lilly  stop that horrible noise in the hole there  what is it said osman impatiently  it is only one of my negro slaves said the master of the house call her up lilly and set her to something quieter until we go  rendered desperate now peter the great started forward with glaring eyes  massa he said an idea hab just struck me  will you come out a momint  i wants to tell you someting bery hard  the appearance not less than the earnestness of the negro inclined osman to comply with his request but hesitating he said  why not tell me here peter  we are all friends you know  oh yes i know dat massa osman but womans can never be trusted wid tings ob importance specially black womans  but ob course if you not fraid ob missis lilly i ant fraid ob her lettin de secret out i darsay shes as good a creetur as de best ob um  this readiness to give in was a politic stroke  osman agreed to go outside with the negro and while the latter was ascending the short stair to the street he was making superhuman efforts to invent something for as yet he had not the faintest idea what his intended communication should be  but peter the great was a genius and it is one of the characteristics of genius to be bold even to recklessness  trusting to some sort of inspiration he began with looks and tones of the deepest solemnity i spose you guess massa osman dat ive been inwestigatin that coorious business ob de english gal what runned away  no i did not guess that answered the moor shortly  oh but its true said peter  eber since she flooed away is bin goin about dem suspekid places lookin arter her and do you know massa osman dat at last here he dropped his voice and looked unutterable thingsat last is found  wellfound what asked the moor eagerly  found her fadder  bah  what do i care for her father you fool  das troo massa but dont you tink dat praps shed be likely to try for find her fadder an if she find im shed be likely to remain wid her fadder  an so all dat wed hab to do would be to find her fadder too  ob course i dont say shes dood all dat but suppose for de sake ob argiment dat she hab dood it all wont wewont wewe no is lost de tread ob my discoorse  ill begin again fro de beginning  das de ony way i kin  is that all you had to tell me interrupted the moor in rising wrath  nonot kite all returned peter humbly  dey do say dat de fadder is at work on de forfications on de sout side ob de kasba  well you are a greater fool than i took you for said osman in whom contempt was quickly taking the place of anger  i spose i is massa  an i spose it am part ob my foolishness to be lookin arter dis yar galbut den you see i lubs benahmed so  well well peter i believe you mean well  is sure i does massa osman  dont interrupt me you black villain  cant you see that if hesters father is a bagnio slave there is no chance of her having found refuge with him  das true massa  i do spose yous right  is a born ijit altogidder but you know when a man gits off de scent ob a ting anyting dat looks de least bit like a clue should be follered up  an deres no sayin what might come ob seein de fadderfor wes off de scent entirely jist now  theres little doubt of that peter said osman pausing and looking meditatively at the ground  moreober suggested the negro when a man wid a cleber head an a purswavis tongue like you tackles a ting its bery strange indeed if noting comes ob it  well you may be right after all returned the moor slowly  i will go and see this father  at all events it can do no harm  none whateber massa  an i better run back and send ali arter you  why  what has he to do with it  oh  i only tought dat you was huntin togidder  its ob no consikence  but i tink he knows de janissary officer what has charge ob de gang an if you dont know him ali might be useful  there is wisdom in what you say  eben zough i is a fool asked the negro simply  osman laughed  at all events you are an honest fool peter and im sorry i burned your back the other day  you didnt deserve it  oh nebber mind dat returned peter feeling really uneasy  de backs all right now  moreober i did deserb it for is an awrful sinner  wuss dan you tink  now if you keep right up as you go an when you comes to de kasba turn to de right an keep so till you comes to de right angle ob de sout wall  de fadder he work dar  ill send ali arter you quicks i can  they parted and while the moor stalked sedately up the street the negro hurried back to the cellar with a message to ali to follow osman without a moments delay  meanwhile ali had been cleverly engaged by the readywitted mrs lilly who after fiercely ordering the coffeepounder to stop her noise come out of the hole and retire to the kitchen drew forth a large leathern purse which she wisely chinked and going towards the stairs invited her master to come to de light an receibe de money which she hab made by de last sale ob slippers  of course the bait tooknone other could have been half so successful but hester apparently had not courage to take advantage of the opportunity for she did not quit the hole  fortunately peter arrived before the cash transaction was completed  on receiving osmans message ali balanced accounts promptly by thrusting the purse and its contents into his pocket and hastening away  then peter the great and lilly sat down took a long grave look at each other threw back their heads opened their cavernous mouths and indulged in a quiet but hearty laugh  now you kin come out dearie said lilly turning to the coffeehole on recovering composure  but no response came from the vasty deep  de coasts clar my dear said peter rising  still no response so peter descended the few steps and found hester lying insensible on a heap of coffeebeans and still firmly grasping the big pestle  the trial had been too much for the poor child who had fainted and peter emerged with her in his arms and an expression of solemn anxiety on his countenance  in a few minutes however she revived and then peter hurrying her away from a locality which he felt was no longer safe placed her under the charge of his sister dinahto the inexpressible regret of mrs lilly and her black maidofallwork  in her new home the fugitives circumstances were much improved  dinah and her husband had great influence over their owner youssef the proprietor of the small coffeehouse already described  they not only managed most of its details for him but were permitted a good deal of personal liberty  among other things they had been allowed to select the top of the house as their abode  to european ears this may sound rather strange but those who have seen the flat roofs of eastern lands will understand it  youssefs house like nearly all the other houses of the city had a flat roof with a surrounding parapet nearly breasthigh  here had been placed a few wooden boxes filled with earth and planted with flowering shrubs  these formed quite a little garden to which youssef had been wont to retreat of an evening for meditative and we may add smokative purposes  but as youssef had grown old his eyes had nearly and his legs had quite failed him  hence being unable to climb to his roof he had latterly given it up entirely to the use of his black slaves samson and dinah white  there was a small excrescence or hut on the roofabout ten feet by six in dimensionswhich formedtheir residence  behind this hiding itself as it were and almost invisible nestled a smaller excrescence or offshoot  it was a mere bandbox of a thing measuring five feet by four it had a window about twelve inches square and was entered by a door inside the larger hut  this was the apartment now assigned to hester who was quietly introduced into the household without the knowledge or consent of its blind proprietor  there was a little bed in the small room  true it was only a trestle frame and a strawstuffed mattress with a couple of blankets but it was clean and the whole room was neat and the sun shone brightly in at the small window at the moment that the new occupant was introduced poor hester fell on her knees laid her head on the bed and thanked god fervently for the blessed change  almost in the same moment she forgot herself and prayed still more fervently for the deliverance of her father  the view over the housetops from the little window was absolutely magnificent including as it did domes minarets mosques palmtrees shipping and sea  here for a considerable time hester worked at her former occupation for dinah had a private plan to make a little money for her own pocket by means of embroidery  in this pleasant retreat our fugitive was visited one day by peter the great the expression of whose visage betokened business  after some conversation he said that he had come for the express purpose of taking hester to see her father  but not to talk to him he added quicklynot eben to make youself known to him for if you did noting would keep im quiet an you an he would be parted for eber  mind datfor eber  yes yes i will remember said the poor girl who was profoundly agitated at the mere thought of such a meeting  but you mus promise said peter solemnly  promise on you word ob honour dat you not say one word not make a sound not gib an unornary look not try in any way to attrack his attention  comespeak else i go home agin  i promise said hester in a low voice  an you wont cry  ill try not to  come long den wid me an see you poor fadder    chapter twelve  the middy becoming defiant and violent comes to grief and hesters black friends devise strange things  on the afternoon of the day in which peter the great paid his visit to hester sommers in the little boudoir benahmed sent for george foster and bade him make a portrait of a favourite dog  it so happened that our artist had run short of some of his drawing materials and said that he could not get on well without them  go to the town then got a supply and return quickly said benahmed who was smoking his hookah in the court at the time and playing gently with the lost hesters pet gazelle  the graceful little creature had drooped since the departure of his mistress as if he felt her loss keenly  perhaps it was sympathy that drew it and benahmed more together than in times past  certainly there seemed to be a bond of some sort between them at that time which had not existed before and the moor was decidedly more silent and sad since hesters flight  in his efforts to recover the runaway he had at first taken much trouble but as time passed he left it in the hands of osman who seemed even more anxious than his father to recover the lost slave  as the midshipman was leaving the court the moor called him back addressing him as usual in lingua franca while the youth taking his cue from peter the great answered in english  you know something about this english girl he suddenly said with a steady look at his slave  iiyes i do know something about her replied foster in some confusion  do you know where she hides  nno i do not  i have been led to understand that british officers never tell lies returned the moor sternly  the blood rushed to the middys face as he replied boldly you have been correctly informedat least in regard to those officers who are true gentlemen  why then do you hesitate retorted the moor  do englishmen blush and stammer when they tell the truth  tell me the truth now  do you know where the english girl hides  the moor spoke very sternly but his slave instead of becoming more confused suddenly drew himself up and replied in a voice and with a look as stern as his own  benahmed i told you the truth at first  i do not know where she is hiding  i did indeed know some time ago but the place of her abode has been changed and i do not know now  i may as well however say at once that if i did know nothing that you can do would induce me to tell you where she hides  you may imprison torture or slay me if you choose but in regard to hester sommers i am from this moment dumb  there was a curious smile on the moors lips while the midshipman delivered this speech with flashing eyes and energetic action but there was no anger in his tone as he replied  englishman he said quietly you love this girl  if a bombshell had exploded under his feet our middy could hardly have been taken more by surprise  but he had been put on his mettle now and scorned to show again a wavering front  yes moor he replied i do love her though i have never told her so nor have i the slightest reason to believe that she cares a fig for me  but i now tell you plainly that i will take advantage of every opportunity that comes in my way to serve her and help her to escape  i now also recall the promisethe word of honouri gave you not to try to escape  there was a time continued the middy in a softened tone when i thought of recalling this promise with defiance to you to do your worst but benahmed i have lived to learn that after a fashion you have been kind to me that i might have fallen into worse hands therefore i am not ungrateful and i now recall the promise only with regret  all the same my resolve is fixed  the curious smile still lingered on the moors lips as he said almost in a jesting tone  but you will not try to escape today if i let you go into the town for colours  i make no promise benahmed  yet this i may safely say that i will not try to clear off on my own account  unless to save hester i will not at present try to escape so far you may be sure of my return but if i get the chance i will either rescue her or die for hergod helping me  the smile vanished from the moors lips as he turned and said gravely  it is well young man that you confess to the true and only source of all help  you christians as you call yourselves have ever seemed to me unwilling to mention the name of god save when cursing your fellows and then you misuse it glibly enough  yet there are some among you who are more consistent in their professions  go fulfil your commission i will trust you  thank you benahmed returned the middy but remember if i never return you will understand that i have not broken my word of honour  the moor bowed his head in acquiescence and took a long pull at his pipe as the midshipman went away  george foster was halfway to the town before he recovered from his astonishment at the strange and unexpected way in which benahmed had received his very plain speaking  he had expected that chains and the bastinado if not worse would certainly follow but he had made up his mind to go through with itif need be to diefor hesters sake  to find himself therefore free to go where he pleased and to help hester to escape if the opportunity to do so should come in his way was an amazing state of things which he could scarcely bring himself to believe  of course our hero had not the slightest expectation of encountering hester that day when he thus freed himself from his parole and we need scarcely add that even if he had met her he could not have devised any sudden scheme for her deliverance  nevertheless the mere fact that he was at liberty to act as he pleased in her behalf had such an effect on him that he entered the town with a lighter heart than he had possessed for many a day  humming a nautical air as he walked along and almost if not quite for the moment oblivious of the fact of his condition of slavery he became keenly interested in all that he saw as he passed through the crowded streets now stopping to admire a picturesque group of figures with jars and pitchers awaiting their turn to draw water from a public fountain or pausing in front of a turners shop to observe with curiosity and interest the deft way in which the workman used his toes as well as his fingers in the operations of his trade  he was thus engaged in calm contemplation with his back to the street when he was very slightly jostled by a passerby  he scarcely noticed the incident but if he had known who it was that touched him he would not have remained so placid for it was hester herself in company with peter the great on their way to the city walls  as hesters eyes were fixed on the ground and her thoughts on her father while fosters attention was concentrated on the turners toes neither observed the other but peters sharp eyes had noted the middy and he hurried past to prevent a recognition which might be awkward if not dangerous at the moment  presently fosters attention was attracted by a moor who was riding along the street sitting sidewise as was the wont of algerines of the tradingclass  what struck foster particularly about this man and his donkey was that the latter was trotting very fast although it was a very small animal and the man on its back a very large one  he also observed that the donkey tossed its head and put back its ears as if it were suffering pain  as the moors hand rested on the donkeys haunch the reason at once occurred to foster for he had noticed the same thing before  it was the practice among cruel men to create and keep open a small sore on the haunch of each animal by irritating which with a little bit of stick they managed to make their donkeys go in a way that a spur or a thick stick could not accomplish  now our middy possessed a tender heart which shrank sensitively from the idea of giving pain to any living creature and which almost exploded with indignation at the sight of wanton cruelty to dumb animals  when therefore the moor came alongside of him foster gave him a look of tremendous indignation at the same time exclaiming shame on you  the moor turned on him a look of mingled surprise and scorn  at the same time muttering christian dog he brought a stick smartly down on the middys shoulders  this was too much to bear meekly  the boiling blood in the youths heart boiled over into his face  he leaped forward seized the donkeys rein with one hand caught the mans left leg with the other and hurled the rider backward to the ground  the bump with which the moors head came down had the effect of keeping it low but the spectators of the incident who were numerous rushed upon the poor middy seized him and carried him straight to a court of justice  they had a summary method of transacting business in those courts especially in simple cases like that of which we treat  the investigation was rapid the evidence of the witnesses emphatic  almost before he had recovered breath our hero was thrown down his feet were raised by two strong attendants his shoes plucked off and the soles of his feet made to tingle as if they had been set on fire  after a few strokes which he bore in silence he was led to the common prison thrust into it and left to his meditations  meanwhile peter the great conducted hester to that part of the city wall where her father was at work among the other slaves  it chanced to be the hour when the wretched creatures were allowed to cease work for a brief space in order to rest and eat  poor hugh sommers chanced to have seated himself a little apart from the others so as to get the benefit of a large stone for a seat  his figure was therefore prominent as he sat there worn weary and dejected consuming his allowance of black bread  peter the great knew him at once having already as the reader knows seen him in his slave garb but hesters anxious eyes failed for a few moments to pick out the emaciated frame and strangely clad ragged figure which represented her once jovial stalwart and wellclothed father  das him whispered peter as he loosely grasped the girls arm by way of precaution  whereoh where asked the poor creature glancing round among the slaves  now member your promise  spoil eberyting if you screech or run to him  look dis way  de man whats settin on de stone  yes yes i see  oh  she stopped abruptly and trembled for at the moment her father turned his woebegone face unconsciously towards her  even the muchincreased grey tinge in the hair and beard the lines of despair on the brow and the hollow cheeks could not disguise the face that she loved so well  a sharp cry burst from her and she made an attempt to rush towards him but the iron grip of peter restrained her  its a dead man hell be if you do he said in a stern but low tone dont you see de janissary  your promise  yes yes  ill restrain myself now peter  do let me stay a minutejust to look  no no  come long wid youidle ting he exclaimed with sudden severity and apparent though not real violence for at the moment his watchful eye had observed one of the slave guards approaching them  as the two went hurriedly past the place where hugh sommers was sitting he looked up with an expression of pity  poor thing he said  the black scoundrel is cruel to you and i am powerless to kick him  he clinked the fetters on his legs significantly as he spoke  the mingled pathos and indignation of the loved voice was too much for poor hester  she was on the point of exclaiming father when peters great black paw extinguished her mouth and was not removed till they were out of danger  yous like all de rest ob de womans said the negro as they hurried through the streets awrful difcult to manidge  come long well go home and hab a talk ober it  hester was too miserable to reply  she did not again speak till they were both safe in the boudoir  there she sat down on the bed laid her face in her hands and burst into a passion of tears while peter stood looking on his head nearly touching the low ceiling his bulky frame filling half the remainder of the little room and two mighty unbidden tears in his great eyes  das right geogiana he said in a soft voice cry away itll do you good  nuffin like cryin wen yous fit to bust  an wen yous got it ober well talk all about it  oh peter cried hester drying her eyes somewhat impatiently how could you be so cruel  whywhy could you not have waited just one minute to let me look at him  because my dear de man wid de whip was comin an hed bery soon hab laid it across my back replied the negro gently  and what if he had done so demanded hester with a slight touch of indignation could you not have suffered a little whipping for my sake  yes geogiana returned peter with much humility i could suffer great deal moren dat for your sake but deres no sich tings as little whippins knowd ob in dis yar town  wen de lash am goin he usully makes de hair fly  moreober dey whip womans as well as mans an if he was to took de bit out

your arms round your fadders neck an rub all de black ober his face what would hab bin de consikence  peter felt his position so strong at this point that he put the question almost triumphantly and hester was constrained to acknowledge that he had acted wisely after all  but continued she with still a little of reproach in her tone what was the use of taking me to see my darling father at all if this is all that is to come of it  yous a leetle obstropolous in you fancies geogiana  dis am not all whats to come ob it  you see i has pity on your poo heart so i tink you might go ebery oder day an

youll git took up for sartin an deyll whip your fadder till hes dead or frow him on de hooks or skin him alive or  oh horrible  dont say such dreadful things peter exclaimed hester covering her face with her hands  feeling that he had said quite enough to impress the poor girl with the absolute necessity of being careful he promised earnestly never again to allude to such dreadful things  but geogiana he added impressively you mus promise me on your word ob honour wich geoge foster says english genlemans neber breakan i spose hes right  yes quite right peter true gentlemen never break their word  an i spose female genlemans am de same  of course  go on replied the girl with a faint smile  well as i was bout to say you mus promise me on your word ob honour dat youll neber go alone

reasonableness of them all and promiseat least i promise to do my best  das nuff geogiana  neezer man nor womans kin do moren deir best now i mus bid you goodday so keep up your heart an youll see eberyting come right in de end  with these cheering words the sympathetic negro took his leave and hester resuming her embroidery sat down at her little window not to work but to gaze dreamily at the beautiful sea and cast about in her mind how she should act in order to alleviate if possible her fathers sad condition  that very afternoon she received a visit from her stolid but affectionate friend sally who at once said that she knew of a splendid plan for doing him a great deal of good  and what is your plan asked hester eagerly  gib him two or tree biscuits said sally  her friend received the suggestion with a look of disappointment  what a stupid thing you are sally  how could that do him any good  sally looked at her friend with an air of pity  didnt you say he was awrful tin she asked  thin  oh yesdreadfully thin  well den isnt dat cause he not hab nuff to eat  i knows it bress you  is bin wid a missis as starved me  sometimes i tink i could eat my shoes  ob course i

idea after this explanation youre a clever girl sally  you say is stoopid jest now  so i did sally  forgive me  i was stupid besides unkind for saying so  but how shall we manage it  wont the guards

two biskits in his lap  but wont he be taken by surprise sally  de fust timeyes but dat wont prevent him gobblin up de biskits quick  neber fear you an mell manidge it tween us  thank you dear sally ill never never forget your kindness and we will try your plan tomorrow    chapter thirteen  hester and her father severely tested  the very next day accordingly hester sommers and her friend sallied forth to present hugh sommers with a couple of biscuits  it was arranged that the two girls should carry baskets of fruit on their heads and that hester should have the biscuits conveniently in her right hand so as to be able to drop them into her fathers lap without stopping or even checking her pace as they passed  of course hester was by this time thoroughly alive to the danger of her intended proceedings both to herself and her father and was firmly resolved to restrain her feelings  nevertheless she could not help trembling when she came in sight of the gang with which her father worked  sally observed this and grasped her by the arm  geogiana she said if you gibs way or speaks or trembles or busts up in any way i grips you by de neck as i once did before an shobes you along wid scolds and whacksso you look out  anxiety for my darling father will be a much more powerful restraint sally than your threats replied the poor girl  nevertheless the threat was not without its effect for it showed hester that she must have been on the point of giving way and impressed on her more than ever the necessity of selfrestraint  wich am him  i dont see him said the negress as they advanced  there he is dont you see just before us replied hester in a low hurried voice  no is growin blind i tink  therelook by himself on the stone  he seems always to sit on the same spot at dinnertime  oh yes i sees  now you go onstiddy  mind what yous about  with a brief prayer for help to control herself hester went straight to where her father sat  he was languidly chewing a piece of the regulation black bread at the time and looked up at her with the vacant indifference born of despair  the desire to fall on his neck and kiss him was need we say almost irresistible but the poor girl had received strength for the duty in hand  she went close to himeven brushed past himand dropped the biscuits into his lap  at first the poor man was so astonished that he gazed after the retiring figure and made no effort to conceal this unexpected addition to his meal  fortunately his wits revived before any of the guards observed him  he slid the biscuits into his shirt bosom with conjurerlike facility and at the same moment broke off a large bit of one which he devoured with unwonted satisfaction  the addition did not indeed furnish the unfortunate slave with a full meal but it at least tended towards that desirable end and sent him to work with a full heart because of the assurance that there was in the city at all events one human beingand that being strange to say a negresswho pitied him in his forlorn condition  during the remainder of that day hugh sommers almost forgot his toils in consequence of his mind being so thoroughly taken up with meditation on the wonderful incident  at night although wearied almost worn out and anxious to sleep he found it impossible to rest in the dismal bagnio  it chanced that he occupied the cell which had formerly been apportioned to george foster on the occasion of his first visit to that cheerless prison and his next neighbour was the despairing frenchman who had given such poor comfort to the middy in his distress  finding that this frenchman spoke english so well and that they worked together in the same gang during the day hugh sommers had struck up an acquaintance with him which after they had spent some weeks together in toiling by day and groaning side by side at night ripened into a curious sort of growling friendship  this friendship began with a quarrel  the night in which they were first placed in neighbouring cells or niches followed a day in which sommers had received an application of the bastinado and been put into irons for fierce rebellion  being a man of strong emotions he had groaned a little as he lay trying to sleep in spite of his suffering feet  failing of his purpose he took to thinking about hester and the groans which had been but feeble for himself became more intense on her account  can you not stop that noise growled the irate frenchman who was kept awake by it  im sorry to disturb you friend said sommers gently for he was really an unselfish man but if you knew all ive had to suffer you would excuse me  oh i know what you have had to suffer said his comrade testily i saw you get the bastinado ive had it often myself butit is bearable  its not that man returned the englishman with a touch of indignation  if i had nothing to worry me but the pain of my feet id have been asleep by now  i have worse things to groan about than you can guess maybe  well well monsieur said the frenchman in a resigned tone as he raised himself on one elbow and leaned his back against the stone wall since you have driven sleep from my eyes perhaps you will give employment to my ears by telling me for what it is that you groan  there was something so peculiar in the tone and manner in which this was saidso cool and offhand yet withal so kindthat sommers at once agreed  ill do it he said if you will treat me to the same thing in return  fair exchange  you see i am by profession a merchant and must have value for what i give  and thus on that night the two unfortunates had exchanged confidences and formed the friendship to which we have referred  to this man thenwhose name was edouard larondesommers related the incident that had occurred that day during the noontide period of rest  it is strange  i know not what to think said laronde when his friend concluded  if it had been a white girl i could have understood that it might be your daughter in disguise though even in this case there would have been several reasons against the theory for in the first place you tell me that your daughteryour hesteris very pretty and no pretty english girl could go about this city in any disguise without being discovered at once  now you tell me that this girl was blacka negress  ay as black as a coal responded the merchant  well if as you say your hester is pretty  pretty man  shes not pretty interrupted the englishman impatiently i tell you she is beautiful  of course i understand returned the other with a smile that the darkness of the place concealed i should have said beautiful  well thick lips and flat nose and high cheekbones and woolly hair are you know incompatible with beauty as understood by englishmen  or frenchmen either added sommers  thats quite true laronde though i must confess that i paid no attention to her face when she was approaching me and after she dropped the biscuits in my lap she was so far past that i only saw a bit of her black cheek and her back which latter you know was enveloped from head to foot in that loose blue cotton thing which does not tell much about the wearer  true true returned the frenchman and after all even if the girls features had not been negrolike you could not have been sure that it was her for some of the blacks who come from the interior of africa have features quite as classical as our own  laronde said the merchant impressively i wonder to hear you who have a daughter of your own suggest that i could fail to recognise my hester in any disguise  why if she were to paint her face scarlet and her nose peagreen id see through it by the beautiful shape of the features and the sweet expression of her face  forgive me monsieur sommers i doubt not that you would  as to your reference to my daughter you forget that she was a little child when i last saw her so i have no experience of a fathers powers of penetrating disguises  laronde sighed deeply at this point and then hurriedly continued as if to prevent further reference to his own sorrows  it is possible however he said that she may pass you again tomorrow and so give you another opportunity of seeing her features but let me ask my friend what will you do if you discover that she is your hester  do exclaimed the merchant with an energetic action that caused his fetters to rattle  iiillwelli dont know what ill do  of course you dont returned laronde with something of the old cynicism in his tone  you englishmen are always so cocksureas you express itof success that you make no provision for defeat or failure it may seem very heroic but it is mere pride and folly  now if you will take a real friends advice you will go out tomorrow with the determination to curb yourself and refrain from taking any notice whatever of this girl whether she turns out to be your daughter or not and leave her to work out her plan for you may be quite sure she has some end in view  just consider what would be the consequence of your giving way to your feelings and embracing her  you would by so doing expose her disguise cause her to be taken up and sent to the harem of some one of the notables and get heavier irons put on yourself besides another touch perhaps of the bastinado  be wise and consider well what you intend to do  thank you friend for your warning  it is well timed  if you had not spoken i would certainly have gone forth tomorrow unprepared  but what is your preparation  what will you do persisted the frenchman  what can i do replied sommers  have you not just shown me that i am utterly helpless  in such a case there is only one course left namely to go to him who can succour the helpless  i will ask counsel of god  the pride you have referred to i admit though it is by no means confined to my own countrymen  too long have i given way to it and acted independently of my maker  perhaps god sent me here to convince me of my sin and helplessness  there is no god  i do not believe in a god said laronde calmly  why not asked sommers in surprise  because replied laronde bitterly if there was a god he could not stand by and see me suffering such prolonged and awful misery  if instead of misery you had been placed during the last twelve years in supreme felicity would you have believed in a god asked sommers  laronde was silent  he saw that the reason which he had given for disbelief was untenable and he was too straightforward to quibble about it  i dont know he said at last angrily  no doubt there are hundreds of men in happy and favourable circumstances who say as i do that they dont believe in a god  i dont know  all i do know is that i am supremely miserable  now you are reasonable returned the merchant for you talk of what you do know and you admit that in regard to god you dont know but you began by stating that there is no god  ah my friend i sympathise with you in your terrible sorrow even as you have sympathised with me in mine but dont let us give way to despair and cast the only refuge that remains to us behind our backs  i will not ask you to join me in praying to one in whom you say you do not believe but i will pray for you  hugh sommers got upon his knees and then and therein the dark and dank prisonhouseprayed most earnestly for guidance and spiritual light in the name of jesus  at first the frenchman listened with what we may style kindly contempt and then with surprise for the englishman drew to the conclusion of his very brief prayer without any mention of his own name  just at the close however sommers said o god show to my friend here that he is wrong and that thou art love  it was with eager and trembling heart next day that hugh sommers watched during the noontide meal for the coming of his mysterious black friend and it was with no less anxiety and trembling of heart that hester approached her father at the same hour  now mind how you doos said the doubtful sally as she glanced keenly at hesters face  mind ill hab no marcy on you if you gibs way  hester made no reply for she was drawing near to her father and saw that he was gazing at her with fixed intensity  she raised her heart to god and received strength to pass without a word or look dropping the biscuits as on the previous day  the man however proved less capable of selfrestraint than the girl for he could not resist whispering hester  the poor girl turned towards him as if by an irresistible impulse but her black guardian angel was equal to the emergency  seizing hester by the shoulder she pushed her violently forward storming at her loudly as on the former occasion  what you black ting  hab you neber seen slabes before  you no bettern de white folk wastin ob your purcious time  my wont you get a whackin fro missis wen you gits home  recovering herself hester at once submitted  at first the poor father was about to start up and run to embrace his child as well as to rescue her from her rude companion but being what is termed a sharp man of business he received into his mind as it were a flash of light and sat still  if this flash had been analysed it would probably have produced the following thoughtsbiscuits kindness companion a friend ignorance impossible violence unaccountable a ruse perhaps sit still  thought they say is swifter than light  at all events it was swift enough on the present occasion to prevent the shadow of a suspicion arising in the minds either of slaves or guards who seemed to be rather amused at what they fancied was the bad temper of sally  next day the biscuitdropping was repeated without the scene that had followed and so wisely was this affair managed by all the parties concerned that it was carried on for several weeks without a hitch under the influence of hope and improved fare hugh sommers became so much brighter in spirits and better in health and so much more tractable that his guards at length removed his heavy fetters and allowed him to toil with free limbs like the majority of the slaves hester also became almost cheerful under the wonderful influence of hope  but hester and her father were each overwhelmed more or less by a wet blanket at that time and strange to say their wet blankets happened to be their best friends  in the case of hester it was sally  the more hopeful and cheery hester became the more did her black friend shake her woolly head and look dismal  why sally dear whats the matter with you asked the former one day as they sat together in the bower on the roof after returning from their visit to the slavegang  a shake of the girls head and an unutterable expression in her magnificent black eyes made hester quite uneasy  do tell me sally  is there anything the matter with you  de matter wid me  oh no  notings neber de matter wid mecept when i eats too muchbut its you an your fadder is tinkin ob  but we are both getting on very well sally are we not  i am quite safe here and darling father is growing stronger and fatter every day thank god and then our hope is very strong  why should you be anxious  sally prefaced her reply with one of the professional gasps wherewith she was wont to bring down the iron pestle  well now you white folks am de greatest ijits eber was born  do you tink youll deliber your fadder from de moors by feedin him on biscuits an hope  whats de end ob all dis to come to das what i want to know  ob course you cant go on for eber  you sure to be cotched at last and de whole affairll bust up  youll be tooked away an your fadderll be trowed on de hooks or whacked to deaf  oh  is most misrable  the poor creature seemed inclined to howl at this point but she constrained herself and didnt  in the gloom of the cheerless bagnio hugh sommers found his wet blanket in edouard laronde  but it is unwise to look only at the bright side of things said the frenchman after sympathising with his friends joy in having discovered his daughter so unexpectedly and in such a curious manner  no doubt from her disguise she must as you say be in hiding and in comparative safety with friends else she could not be moving so freely about this accursed city but what is to be the end of it all  laronde unconsciously echoed sallys question to hester but hugh sommers had not as much to say in reply as his daughter for he was too well acquainted with the possibilities of life to suppose that biscuits and hope would do much towards the end although valuable auxiliaries in the meantime  i see not the end laronde he said after a pause but the end is in the hands of god and i will trust him  so is the middle and so is the beginning as well as the end returned laronde cynically why then are you so perplexed and anxious about these if the end is as you seem to think so sure  why dont you trust god all through  i do trust god all through my friend but there is this difference that with the end i have nothing to do save to wait patiently and trustfully whereas with the beginning and middle it is my duty to act and energise hopefully  but why your anxiety if the whole matter is under safe guidance persisted the frenchman  because while i am absolutely certain that god will do his part wisely and well i am by no means sure that i shall do my part either well or wisely  you forget laronde that we are free agents as well as sinful and foolish more or less so that there is legitimate room for anxiety which only becomes evil when we give way to it or when it goes the length of questioning the love wisdom and power of the creator  all mystery all mystery sommers you are only theorising about what you do not cannot know anything  you have no ground for what you hold  as you confess never to have studied or even seriously contemplated the ground on which i hold it there isdont you thinka slight touch of presumption on your part in criticising so severely what you do not cannot understand  i profess to have good reasons for what i hold you profess merely to disbelieve it  is there not a vast difference here  perhaps there is but im too sleepy to see it  would you oblige me by putting your foot on that centipede  he has made three ineffectual attempts to pass the night under my wing  make sure work of him thanks  now i will try to sleep  oh the weary heartsickness of hope deferred  goodnight sommers  goodnight    chapter fourteen  a brave dash for life and freedom  geoge come wid me said peter the great one afternoon with face so solemn that the heart of the young midshipman beat faster as he followed his friend  they were in benahmeds garden at the timefor the middy had been returned to his owner after a night in the common prison and a threat of much severer treatment if he should ever again venture to lay his infidel hands on one of the faithful  having led the middy to the familiar summer house where most of their earnest or important confabulations were held peter sat down and groaned  whats wrong now asked the middy with anxious looks  oh  geoge eberytings wrong he replied flinging himself down on a rustic seat with a reckless air and rolling his eyes horribly eberytings wrong  de worlds all wrong togidderupside down and inside out  the middy might have laughed at peters expression if he had not been terribly alarmed  come peter tell me  is hester safe  i don know geoge  dont know  why dyou keep me in such anxiety  speak man speak what has happened  how kin i speak geoge wen is amost busted wid runnin out here to tell you  the perspiration that stood on peters sable brow and the heaving of his mighty chest told eloquently of the pace at which he had been running  dis is de way ob it geoge  i had it all fro de lips ob sally herself what saw de whole ting  as the narrative which peter the great had to tell is rather too long to be related in his own lingo we will set it down in ordinary language  one day while hester was as usual passing her father and in the very act of dropping the customary supply of food she observed that one of the slaves had drawn near and was watching her with keen interest  from the slaves garb and bearing any one at all acquainted with england could have seen at a glance that he was a british seaman though hard service and severe treatment with partial starvation had changed him much  he was in truth the stout sailorlike man who had spoken a few words to foster the day he landed in algiers and who had contemptuously asserted his utter ignorance of gardening  the slaves we need hardly say were not permitted to hold intercourse with each other for fear of their combining to form plans of rebellion and escape but it was beyond the power of their drivers to be perpetually on the alert so that sometimes they did manage to exchange a word or two without being observed  that afternoon it chanced that sommers had to carry a stone to a certain part of the wall  it was too heavy for one man to lift the sailor was therefore ordered to help him  while bearing the burden towards the wall the following whispered conversation took place  i say old man observed the sailor the little girl that gives you biscuits every day is no more a nigger than i am  right whispered the merchant anxiously for he had supposed that no one had observed the daily gift she is my daughter  i guessed as much by the cut o your jibs  but shes in danger for i noticed that one o the drivers looked at her suspiciously today and once suspicion is roused the villains never rest  is there no means of preventing her coming this way tomorrow  none  i dont even know where she comes from or goes to  god help her  if suspected she is lost for she will be sure to come tomorrow  dont break down old man theyll observe you  if she is taken are you willing to fight  yes answered the merchant sternly  i am with you then  your name  sommers  yours  brown  a driver had been coming towards them so that the last few words had been spoken in low whispers  a sharp cut of the whip on the shoulders of each showed that the driver had observed them talking  they received it in absolute silence and without any outward display of feeling  to that extent at all events they had both been tamed  but the stout seaman had been for many weeks acting a part  at first like sommers he had been put in heavy irons on account of his violence and ferocity but after many weeks of childlike submission on his part the irons were removed  despite the vigilance of the guards a plot had been hatched by the gang to which brown belonged and it was almost though not quite ripe for execution when the events we are describing occurred  poor hesters action next day precipitated matters and caused the failure of the plotat least to some extent  she had gone as usual with sally to visit the slavegang and had dropped her biscuits when her anxious father said in a low but hurried voice pass quickly and dont come again for some time  hester involuntarily stopped  darling father she said restraining herself with difficulty from leaping into his arms whyoh why am i not  she had only got thus far when the janissary whose suspicions had been aroused pounced upon her and seizing her by the wrist looked keenly into her face  ho ho he exclaimed glancing from the girl to her sire what mystery have we here  come we must investigate this  poor hester winced from the pain of the rude soldiers grip as he proceeded to drag her away  her father seeing that further concealment was impossible and that final separation was inevitable became desperate  with the bound of an enraged tiger he sprang on the soldier and throttled him  both being powerful men they fell on the ground in a deadly struggle at which sight hester could only look on with clasped hands in helpless terror  but the british seaman was at hand  he had feared that some such mischief would arise  seeing that two other soldiers were running to the aid of their fallen comrade he suddenly gave the signal for the revolt of the slaves  it was premature  taken by surprise the halfhearted among the conspirators paid no attention to it while the timid stood more or less bewildered  only a few of the resolute and reckless obeyed the call but these furnished full employment for their guards for knowing that failure meant death if not worse they fought like fiends  meanwhile the first of the two soldiers who came running sword in hand towards sommers was met by brown  with a piece of wood in his left hand that worthy parried the blow that was delivered at his head  at the same time he sent his right fist into the countenance of his adversary with such force that he became limp and dropped like an empty topcoat  this was fortunate for the companion janissary was close to him when he wheeled round  the blazing look of the seaman however induced so much caution in the turk that instead of using his sword he drew a long pistol from his girdle and levelled it  brown leaped upon him caught the pistol as it exploded just in time to turn the muzzle aside wrenched the weapon from his foes grasp and brought the butt of it down with such a whack on his head that it laid him beside his comrade  turning quickly to the still struggling pair he saw that the janissary was black in the face and that sommers was compressing his throat with both hands and had his knee on his stomach while hester and sally were looking on horrified but hopeful  at the same time he saw fresh soldiers running up the street to reinforce the guard  hester he said sharply and seizing the girls hand come bolt with me  ive knowed your father a good while  quick  impossible she cried drawing back  i will not leave my father now  youll have to leave him anyhow cried the sailor  you can do him no good  if free you might  a shout at the moment caused him to glance round  it proceeded both from slaves and guards for both at the same moment caught sight of the approach of the reinforcements  the former scattered in all directions and the latter gave chase while pistolshots and yells rent the air  instead of wasting more breath in useless entreaty brown seized the light form of hester in his arms and ran with her to the ramparts  in the confusion of the general skirmish he was not observedor if observed unheededby any one but sally who followed him in anxious haste thinking that the man was mad for there could be no possible way of escape she thought in that direction  she was wrong  there was method in browns madness  he had for a long time previously studied all the possibilities with reference to the meditated uprising and had laid down for himself several courses which he might pursue according to the success failure or partial failure of their plans  there was one part of the rampart they were engaged in repairing at that time which had given way and partly fallen into the ditch outside  the portion of the wall still remaining had been further demolished in order that a more secure foundation might be laid  the broken wall here had been but partially rebuilt and was not nearly as high as the completed wall  a jump from this might be possible to a strong active man if the ground below were soft or even levelthough the risk of broken limbs was considerable  brown had observed however that at this place a small tree grew out from a mass of rock which had been incorporated as part of the wall and that just below it there stood a huge bush of the cactus kind  to these two he had made up his mind to intrust himself in the event of things coming to the worst  accordingly it was to this part of the rampart he ran with hester in his strong arms  we have said that sally ran after the sailor with anxiety but that feeling was deepened into dismay when she saw him approach the portion of the wall just described and she gave out one of her loudest coffeepestle gasps when she saw him jump straight off the wall without a moments hesitation  craning her neck and gazing downward she saw the sailor go crashing through the little tree and alight with a squash in the heart of the watery cactus out of which he leaped with such agility that sally was led to exclaim under her breath  hoh dont de spikes make im jump  whether it was the spikes or other influences we cannot tell but certain it is that brown did jump with wonderful activity considering the burden he carried dashed up the opposite bank cut across country like a hunted hare and found shelter in a neighbouring wood before the revolt in the city was completely quelled  here he pulled up and set the terrified hester down  youll excuse me miss he said pantingly as he wiped his brows with the sleeve of his shirtwhich garment with a pair of canvas trousers a grass hat and thin carpet shoes constituted his costume  im wery sorry to carry you off agin your will but youll thank me for it yet maybe for if i had left you behind you couldnt have helped your poor father and theyd have took you off for sartin to be a slave  now dye see if you an i manage to escape theres no sayin what we may do in the way o raisin ransom to buy back your father  anyway he has been so anxious about you an afraid o your bein catched an the terrible fate in store for you if you are that i made up my mind for his sake to carry you off  to this explanation hester listened with varying feelings  i believe from the honesty of your look and tone she said at last that you have acted for the best whether wisely or not remains to be seen but i thank you heartily for your intentions and especially for your kind feelings towards my dear father but now i must claim the right to use my own judgment  i will return to the city and succour my father or perish with him  yet rest assured i will never forget the brave seaman who has so nobly risked his life to save me  your name is  brown missat your service  well goodbye brown and gods blessing attend you she said extending her black little hand  the seaman gently took it and gave it a timid pressure as if he feared to crush it in his brawny hand  ill shake hands with you he said but i wont say goodbye for ill steer back to the city with you  brown this is sheer madness  there is no reason in what you propose to do  you cannot help me by sacrificing yourself  thats exactly what yer father would say to you miss if he was alongside of usyou cant help me by sacrificin of yerself  then praps he would foller up that obsarvation by sayin but you may an can help me if you go wi that sailorfriend o mine who may be rough and ready but is sartinly trueblue who knows the coast hereaway an all its hidinplaces an wholl wentur his life to do me a good turn cause why  i once wentured my life to do him a good turn o the same kind  is this true brown  did you know my father before meeting him here and did he really render you some service  yes indeed miss i have sailed in one o your fathers wessels an once i was washed overboard by a heavy sea and he flung over a lifebuoy arter me and jumped into the water himself to keep me afloat till a boat picked us up for i couldnt swim  now look ere miss if youll consent to sail under my orders for a short spell youll have a better chance o doin your father a sarvice than by returnin to that nest o pirates  moreover youll have to make up your mind pretty quick for weve lost too much time already  go on brown i will trust you said hester placing her hand in that of the seaman who without another word led her swiftly into the bush  now all this and a great deal more was afterwards related by hester herself to her friends but at the time all that was known to sallythe only witness of the exploitwas that hester sommers had been carried off in the manner related by an apparently friendly british sailor this she told soon after to peter the great and this was the substance of the communication which peter the great with glaring eyes and bated breath made to george foster who received it with feelings and expressions that varied amazingly as the narrative proceeded  is that all he asked when the negro at length came to a decided stop  das allan its enuff too  pears to me yous not so much cut up about dis leetle business as i spected you would be  i am anxious of course about hester returned the middy but at the same time greatly relieved first to know that she is in the hands of a respectable british sailor and second that she is not in the hands of these bloodthirsty piratical moors  but what about her father nothing more i suppose is known about his fate  noting ony its as sure as if we did know it  if his carcass isnt on de hooks by dis time itll soon be  as the negro spoke the midshipman started up with flashing eyes exclaimed angrily it shall never be and ran out of the bower  entering the house he went straight to benahmeds private chamber which he entered boldly without even knocking at the door  the moor was seated crosslegs on a mat solacing himself as usual with a pipe  he was not a little surprised and at first was inclined to be angry at the abrupt entrance of his slave  benahmed said the middy with vehemence the father of the english girl you are so fond ofand whom i loveis in terrible danger and if you are a true manas i firmly believe you areyou will save him  the moor smiled very slightly at the youths vehemence pointed with the mouthpiece of his hookah to a cushion and bade him sit down and tell him all about it  the middy at once squatted a la turk not on the cushion but on the floor in front of his master and with earnest voice and gesture related the story which peter the great had just told him  benahmed was visibly affected by it  but how can i save him he asked with a look of perplexity  did you not once save the life of the dey asked foster  i did  how came you to know that  i heard it from peter the great who aided you on the occasion  and he told me that the dey has often since then offered to do you some good turn but that you have always declined  that is true said benahmed with the look of a man into whose mind a new idea had been introduced  yes something may be done in that way and it would grieve me that the father of my poor little hester should die  i will try  go have my horse saddled and send peter to me  our midshipman bounded rather than rose from the floor and uttered an irresistible god bless you as he vanished through the doorway on his errand  peter he criedencountering that worthy as he ranwell manage it go to benahmed  he wants youquick  im off to fetch his horse  foster was much too anxious to have the thing done quickly to give the order to the head groom  he ran direct to the stable and choosing the fleetest of the moors arab steeds quickly put on its crimson saddle with its uneuropean peaks before and behind and the other gay portions of harness with which easterns are wont to caparison their horses  in a wonderfully short space of time he had the steed round to the front door and sent another slave to tell his master that it was ready  the moor had also caparisoned himself if we may say so for the intended visit and he had evidently done it in haste  nevertheless his gait was stately and his movements were slow as he gravely mounted the horse and rode away  the impatience of the middy was somewhat relieved however when he saw that benahmed on reaching the main road put spurs to his horse and rode towards the city at full gallop    chapter fifteen  a strange visit a strange commission and a strange display of temper  after benahmed had departed on his mission to the dey of algiers george foster and peter the great reentered the house and in the seclusion of the bower continued to discuss the hopes fears and possibilities connected with the situation  dat was a clebber dodge ob yours geoge remarked the negro an is got good hope dat someting will come ob it for massas pretty sure to succeed wen he take a ting in hand  im glad you think so peter  and to say truth i am myself very sanguine  but deres one ting dat plexes me bery much  what is we to do about poo hesters fadder wen hes pardoned  de dey can spare his life but he wont set him freean if he dont set him free de slabedrivers ll be sure to kill im out ob spite  the middy was silent for he could not see his way out of this difficulty  perhaps he said benahmed may have thought of that and will provide against it for of course he knows all the outs and ins of moorish life and he is a thoughtful man  das true geoge  he am a toughtful man  anyhow we kin do noting more cept wait an see  but is much more plexed about hester for eben if de sailor am a good an true man as you say he cant keep her or hisself alibe on noting in de mountains no moren he could swim wid her on his back across de mederainyon  again the middy was silent for a time  he could by no means see his way out of this greater difficulty and his heart almost failed him as he thought of the poor girl wandering in the wilderness without food or shelter  praps suggested peter she may manage to git into de town an pass for a nigger as shes dood before an make tracks for her old place wid missis lillyor wid dinah  no doubt she may cried foster grasping at the hope as a drowning man grasps at a plank  nothing more likely  wouldnt it be a good plan for you to go into town at once and make inquiry  dessay it would returned the negro  das just what ill do an if shes not dere dinah may gib my intlec a jog  shes a wonderful woman dinah for workin up de human mind wen its like goin to sleep  poo samson hab diskivered dat many times  ill go at once  do peter my fine fellow and youll lay me for ever under the deepest ob  he was interrupted by a slave who at the moment approached the bower and said that a man wanted to see peter the great  to see benahmed you mean said peter  noto see yourself returned the slave  sen im here said the negro with a magnificent wave of the hand  in a few minutes the slave returned accompanied by a negro who limped so badly that he was obliged to use a stick and whose head was bandaged up with a blue cloth  arrived at the bower he stood before peter the great and groaned  you may go said peter to the slave who lingered as if anxious to hear the news of the visitor  when he was out of hearing peter turned to the lame man looked him sharply in the face and said  yous bery black in de face my frind but yous much blacker in de hart  what business hab you to come here widout washin your white face clean  well youre a pretty smart chap for a nigger  an i dare say youll understand that id have had some difficulty in fetchin this here port at all if id washed my face answered the lame man in excellent nautical english  while he spoke foster ran towards him laid a hand on his shoulder and looked earnestly into his face  you are the british sailor he said who rescued hesmiss sommers from the janissaries  thats me to a tee replied the sailor with a broad grin  is miss sommers safe asked the middy anxiously  ay safe as any woman can be in this world  leastwise shes in a cave wi three o the toughest seadogs as any man could wish to seeone o them bein a maltese an the other two bein trueblue john bulls as well as jack tars  but miss sommers gave me orders to say my say to peter the great so if this nigger is him ill be obleeged if hell have a little private conversation wi me  did miss sommers say that i was not to hear the message asked the middy in some surprise  she made no mention o you or anybody else at all as i knows on returned the sailor firmly an as my orders was to peter the great an as this seems to be him from sallys descriptiona monstrous big finelookin nigger with a lively faceill say my say to him alone with your leave  you may say it where you is for dis yar genlemn is a frind ob mine an a hofficer in the brish navy an a most tickler friend of hester sommers so we all frinds togidder  youll excuse me sir said the seaman touching his forelock but you dont look much like a officer in your present costoom  well then heres wot ive got to say  dont waste your time brown in spinning the yarn of your rescue of the girl said foster interrupting weve heard all about it already from sally and can never sufficiently express our thanks to you for your brave conduct  tell us now what happened after you disappeared from sallys view  the sailor thereupon told them all about his subsequent proceedingshow he had persuaded hester to accompany him through the woods and by a round about route to a part of the coast where he expected ere long to find friends to rescue him  from some reason or other best known to himself he was very secretive in regard to the way in which these friends had managed to communicate with him  you see im not free to speak out all i knows he said  but surely its enough to say that my friends have not failed me that i found them waitin there with a small boat so light that they had dragged it up an concealed it among the rocks an that id have bin on my way to old england at this good hour if it hadnt bin for poor miss sommers whom we couldnt think of desartin  then she refused to go with you said foster  refused  i should think she did  nothing she said would indooce her to leave algiers while her father was in it  one o my mates was for forcing her into the boat an carryin her off willin or not willin but i stood out agin him as id done enough o that to the poor thing already  then she axed me to come along here an ax peter the great if he knowed anything about her father  but i dont know peter the great says i nor where he lives  go to sally says she an youll get all the information you need  but ill never get the length o sally without being nabbed says i  oh says she no fear o that  just you let me make a nigger of you  i always keep the stuff about me in my pocket for i so often cry it off that i need to renew it frequently  an with that she out with a parcel o black stuff and made me into a nigger before you could say jack robinson  fortnately ive got a pretty fat lump of a nose of my own an my lips are pretty thick by natur so that with a little what you may call hard poutin when i had to pass guards janissaries an such like i managed to get to where missis lilly an sally lived an they sent me on here  an now the question is whats to be done for its quite clear that my mates an me cant remain for ever hidin among the rocks  we must be off an i want to know are we to take this poor gal with us or are we to leave her behind an if so what are her friends agoin to do for her  theres no fear of your friends going off without you i suppose  well as they risked their precious lives to rescue me it aint likely returned the seaman  would it not be well to keep brown here till benahmed returns asked foster turning to peter the great  the negro knitted his brows and looked vacantly up through the leafy roof of the bower as if in profound meditation  some of the brighter stars were beginning to twinkle in the darkening sky by that time and one of them seemed to wink at him encouragingly for he suddenly turned to the middy with all the energy of his nature exclaiming is got it and brought his great palm down on his greater thigh with a resounding slap  if its in your breeches pocket you must have squashed it then said brownreferring to the slap  anyhow if youve got it hold on to it an lets hear what it is  nonot now  all in good time  patience my frind is a virtoo wuf cultivation  you neednt go for to tell that to a bagnio slave like me mister peter  your greatness might have made you aware o that returned the sailor quietly  an eyeshutting grin was peters reply to this and further converse was stopped by the sound of clattering hoofs  massa exclaimed the negro listening  das good  no time lost come wid me you sham nigger an is gib you someting to tickle you stummik  you go an look arter de hoss geoge  while the middy ran to the gate to receive his master peter the great led the sham nigger to the culinary regions where in a sequestered corner he supplied him with a bowl containing a savoury compound of chicken and rice  i hope that all has gone well  foster ventured to ask as the moor dismounted  all well  send peter to me immediately he replied and without another word hurried into the house  calling another slave and handing over the smoking horse to him foster ran to the kitchen  peter youre  wanted meeditlyyes yesi knows dat  what a ting it is to be inspensible to anybody  i dont know how hell eber git along widout me  saying which he hurried away leaving the middy to do the honours of the house to the sailor  i spose sir you havent a notion what sort o plans that nigger has got in his head asked the latter  not the least idea  all i know is that he is a very clever fellow and never seems very confident about anything without good reason  well whatever hes agoin to do i hope hell look sharp about it for poor miss sommerss fate and the lives o my mates to say nothin of my own is hangin at this moment on a hairso to speak returned the sailor as he carefully scraped up and consumed the very last grain of the savoury mess murmuring as he did so that it was out o sight the wery best blowout hed had since he enjoyed his last christmas dinner in old england  will you have some more asked the sympathetic middy  no more sir thankee  im loaded fairly down to the waterline another grain would bust up the hatches but if i might ventur to putt forth a wish now a glass ono well no matter a drop o waterll do  im well used to it now havin drunk enough to float a seventyfour since i come to this city o pirates  you will find coffee much more agreeable as well as better for you  i have learned that from experience said the middy pouring out a tiny cupful from an earthen coffeepot that always stood simmering beside the charcoal fire  another of that same sir if you please said the seaman tossing off the cupful which indeed scarcely sufficed to fill his capacious mouth  why they should take their liquor in these parts out o things that aint much bigger than my old mothers thimble passes my comprehension  you wouldnt mind anotherthankee  as many as you please brown said the middy laughing as he poured out cupful after cupful theres no fear of your getting halfseasover on that tipple  i only wish i was halfseasover or even a quarter that length your health sir returned brown with a sigh as he drained the last cup  just then peter the great burst into the kitchen in a very elated condition  geoge he cried you be off  massa wants youmeeditly  but fust let me axyou understan de place among de rocks whar browns mates and de boat am hidden  yes i know the place well  you knows how to get to it  of course i do  das all right now come alongcome along you sham nigger wid me has you got enuff  bustinall but  das good now you follow me do what yous tol hol you tongue an look sharp if you don want your head cut off  heave ahead capn im your man  the two left the house together and took the road that led to the hill country in rear of the dwelling  meanwhile george foster went to the chamber of the moor  he found his master seated as was his wont with the hookah before him but with the mouthpiece lying idly on his knee and his forehead resting on one hand so deeply was he absorbed in communing with his own thoughts that he did not observe the entrance of his slave until he had been twice addressed  then looking up as if he had been slightly startled he bade him sit down  george foster he began impressively at the same time applying a light to his hookah and puffing sedately you will be glad to hear that i have been successful with my suit to the dey  god has favoured me but a great deal yet remains to be done and that must be done by youelse  he stopped here looked pointedly at the middy and delivered the remainder of his meaning in pufflets of smoke  i suppose you would say sir that unless it is done by me it wont be done at all  to this the moor nodded twice emphatically and blew a thin cloud towards the ceiling  then you may count upon my doing my utmost if that which i am to do is in the interest of hester sommers or her father as no doubt it is  yes it is in their interest rejoined benahmed  i have done my part but dare not go further for much though i love little hesterwho has been to me as a sweet daughteri must not risk my neck for her unnecessarily  but if i mistake not you are not unwilling to risk that  ay fifty necks would i risk for her sake if i had them returned our middy with enthusiasm for he was in that stage of love which glories in the acknowledgment of thraldom  benahmed looked at him with interest sighed and sought solace in the pipe  after a few meditative puffs he continued  after all you run little risk as you shall see  when i asked the dey with whom i am familiar for the pardon of the slave sommers he did not seem pleased and objected that there had been too many revolts of late that this mans case was a bad one and that it was necessary to make an example or two  very true your highness i replied but may i beg you to make an example of some other slaves and forgive sommers  why do you take so much interest in this man demanded the dey who seemed to me rather short in his temper at the time  because he is the father of one of my female slaves your highness i replied and it is the fear that they will be separated for ever that makes the man desperate and the girl miserable  if you will permit me i should like to reunite them  your highness has often expressed a wish to do me some kindness for the privilege i once had of saving your highnesss life  will you now refuse me this mans life  nay i will not refuse you benahmed  but i do not see that my granting your request will reunite the father and child unless indeed you are prepared to purchase the man  i am prepared to do so your highness i said  in that case you are at liberty to go to the bagnio and take him out here is my ring  now foster continued the moor drawing the ring in question from his vestpocket take this  show it to the captain of the guard at the bagnio who will admit you  tell him that i sent you for one of the slaves  after that your own intelligence must guide you  go and god go with you  i will do as you command benahmed said foster but i must tell you frankly that i will not  silence thundered the moor with a look of ferocity which the amazed midshipman could not account for  have you not understood me  yes sir perfectly but  when a slave receives a command cried benahmed in rising wrath it is his duty to obey in silence  again i saygo  the middy bowed with feelings of indignation but on reaching the door paused and again essayed to speak  i give you fair warning benahmed that i will not  silence again roared the moor seizing an ornamental box and hurling it violently at his slave who dipping his head allowed it to go crashing against the wall while he went out and shut the door  well old boy im absolved from any allegiance to you he muttered as he walked smartly down the garden walk towards the gate so if i do a good deal more than your bidding you mustnt be surprised  but your sudden burst of anger is incomprehensible  however thats not my business now  had any one been there to observe the moor after the middy had taken his departure he would have seen that the passion he had displayed evaporated as rapidly as it had arisen and that he resumed the amber mouthpiece of his hookah with a peculiar smile and an air of calm contentment  thereafter he ordered out his horse mounted it in his usual dignified manner and quietly rode away into the darkness of the night  it may be observed here our middy had improved greatly in the matter of costume since his appointment to the rank of limner to benahmed  the old canvas jacket straw hat etcetera had given place to a picturesque moorish costume which with the middys fine figure and natural bearing led people to suppose him a man of some note so that his appearance was not unsuited to the mission he had in hand  we need scarcely say that his spirit was greatly agitated as he walked towards the town by uncertainty as to how he ought to act in the present emergency and his mind was much confused by the varied and to some extent inexplicable incidents of the evening  his thoughts crystallised however as he went along and he had finally made up his mind what to do by the time he passed the portals babazoun and entered the streets of algiers    chapter sixteen  mysterious and daring deeds are crowned with success  threading his way carefully through the badly lighted streets our middy went straight to the kasba and rapping boldly at the gate demanded admittance  show me to the guardroom  i wish to speak with the officer in command he said in the tone of one accustomed to obedience  the soldier who admitted him introduced him to the officer in charge for the night  i come sir said foster with quiet gentlemanly assurance to demand an escort for slaves  by whose orders asked the officer  the order of his highness the dey answered foster producing the ring  the officer examined it touched his forehead with it in token of submission and asked how many men were required  six will do returned the middy in a slow meditative manner as if a little uncertain on the pointyes six will suffice  i only wish their escort beyond the gates  friends might attempt a rescue in the town  when i have them a short distance beyond the gates i can manage without assistance  he touched as he spoke the handle of a silvermounted pistol which he carried in his belt  of course as he spoke lingua franca the officer of the guard knew quite well that he was a foreigner but as the notables and deys of algiers were in the habit of using all kinds of trusted messengers and agents to do their work he saw nothing unusual in the circumstance  six armed soldiers were at once turned out and with these obedient unquestioning slaves he marched down the tortuous streets to the bagnio  the ring procured him admittance at once and the same talisman converted the head jailer into an obsequious servant  i have come for one of your slaves said the middy walking smartly into the court where most of the miserable creatures had already forgotten their wretchedness in the profound sleep of the weary  the tramp of the soldiers on the stone pavement and the clang of their arms awoke some of them  the name of the man i want is hugh sommers  on hearing this one of the slaves was observed to reach out his hand and shake another slave who still slumbered  rouse up sommers  you are wanted my poor friend  what say you laronde exclaimed the merchant starting up and rubbing his eyes  get up and follow me said foster in a stern commanding tone  and who are you that orders me as if i were a dog fiercely returned sommers who since the day of the unsuccessful mutiny had again become desperate and was in consequence heavily ironed  the dey of algiers gives the order through me replied foster pointing to the soldiers and it will be your highest wisdom to obey without question  knock off his irons he added turning abruptly to the chief jailer  the air of insolent authority which our hipperkritical middy assumed was so effective that even sommers was slightly overawed  while the irons were being removed the unhappy frenchman edouard laronde sought to console him  i told you it would soon come to this he said in english  i only wish i was going to die with you  knock off this mans irons also said the middy to whom a new idea had suddenly occurred and who was glad to find that his altered costume and bearing proved such a complete disguise that his old comrade in sorrow did not recognise him  i thought said the jailer that you said only one slave was wanted  i say two slaves are wanted growled the midshipman with a look so fierce that the jailer promptly ordered the removal of larondes fetters  did i not often tell you muttered hugh sommers that your unguarded tongue would bring you to grief  it matters not  i submit and am ready returned the frenchman in a sad tone  if it were not for my poor wife and child the world would be well rid of such a useless rebel as i  when the two slaves were ready foster demanded a piece of rope with which he fastened the left and right wrists of the two men together then placing them in the midst of the soldiers he led them out of the prison and along the main street in the direction of the western gate of the city  passing through this the little party advanced into the suburbs until they reached a part of the road beyond which pedestrians usually found it convenient not to travel after dark  here foster called a halt  i thank you he said to the leader of the soldiers at the same time giving him a piece of money  there is no further occasion for your services all danger of rescue being past  i can now take care of them myself being armed as you see while they are bound  convey my thanks and compliments to your commanding officer  the soldier acknowledged the piece of money with a grave inclination of the head ordered his men to rightaboutface and marched back to the kasba leaving the three slaves standing not far from the seashore and gazing at each other in silence  you seem to have forgotten me friends said the middy in english pulling a claspknife out of his pocket  yet you have both met me before when we were slaves  were slaves repeated the frenchman who was the first to recover from his astonishment are we not still slaves he asked glancing at the cords that bound their wrists  not now said foster cutting the cords with his knifeat least we shall soon be free if we make good use of our opportunities  free exclaimed both men together with the energy of a sudden and almost overwhelming hope  ay free  but this is no time for explanation  follow me closely and in silence  scarcely crediting their senses and more than half disposed to believe that the whole affair was one of their too familiar dreams yet strangely convinced at the same time that it was a reality the two men followed their young leader with alacrity  the reader will remember that before parting from foster that day peter the great had taken special care to ascertain that he knew the whereabouts of the rocks where the boat belonging to brown and his friends was concealed  as foster walked along in the dark he thought a good deal about this and felt convinced that peter must have had some idea of the event that was likely to follow from his mission to the bagnio  but he was much perplexed in attempting to account for his reticence in the matter  altogether there was mystery about it which he could not see through so he wisely gave up thinking about it and braced his energies to the carrying out of his own little plot  this was to lead hugh sommers to his daughter and assist them to escape in the boat along with brown the sailor and his companionsintending of course to escape along with them  his taking advantage of the opportunity to free edouard laronde was the result of a sudden inspirationa mere afterthought  the distance to the spot for which they were making was considerable and at first the fugitives proceeded with caution and in silence but as their distance from the pirate city increased and the danger of pursuit diminished the middy relaxed a little gave his companions interjectional scraps of information and finally revealed to them all that he knew and purposed  suddenly their conversation was interrupted by the sight of something moving at the side of the road  it looked too small for a man yet its movements seemed too intelligent for a dog or a stray donkey  stay here i will soon find out whispered foster drawing his pistol and bounding towards the object in question  it ran from him but our middy was swift of foot  he quickly overtook it and seized firmly by the arm what in the dark he thought to be a boy  a slight scream undeceived him and at the same time caused his heart to bound  oh you hurt me exclaimed a wellremembered voice  hester cried the youth and next moment folding her in his arms he kissed herquite unintentionally but irresistibly  thrusting him away with indignation the maiden said with flashing eyes you forget yourself sir and take advantage of my defenceless position  nono indeed  i did not intend to frighten you dear child in his desperation the middy assumed the paternal role  pray forgive me it was only my joy at the prospect of reuniting you to your father and  my father cried hester forgetting her offended dignity  where is he  you are alone  peter the great sent me here to meet him but he did not say i should meet you  peter the great sent you hereand alone exclaimed foster in amazement  yes he went out first to make sure that my father was coming and then sent me to meet him that we might be alone  but peter is close at hand  ho yis bery close at hand geoge said peter himself suddenly emerging from a place of concealment  now you come along wid me sar an let dat poo chile meet her fadder in private  but she cannot do that peter for edouard laronde is with him  whon all de wurlds eddard larongd  before foster could reply hester had bounded from his side and next moment was locked in her fathers arms  come away geogean you too eddard lalawhateveritis cried the negro grasping the latter by the arm and hurrying him along the road in the direction of the seashore while the reunited father and child knelt down together and poured out their gratitude to god  deyll foller us in a minnit or two continued the negro  what kep you so long geoge  couldnt manage it sooner  but can you guess peter why benahmed behaved in the strange way he has done  he got into a rage when i attempted to tell him honestly that i did not intend to go back to him or to take sommers to his house and that id try to escape along with him if i could but he would not listen or let me say a word  did you tink ob tellin him all dat asked peter  i certainly did  well youre not half such a hipperkrite as i tink you was  im glad to hear you say so for i dont like to play the part of a hypocrite peter i like to be all fair and aboveboard  was it all fair an aboveboard geoge to kiss dat leetle gal when she was all alone and unpurtected  was it all fair an aboveboard to call her you dear chile as if you was her fadder  come come peter everything is fair you know in love and war but thats not the point  can you guess i ask benahmeds motive for acting so oddly  oh yis geoge i kin guess amost anybodys motives zough praps i mightnt guess right  i shouldnt wonder now if benahmed will hab to account to do dey for de tottle disappearance of hugh sommersto say noting ob eddard lalawhatsisnamean praps hed like to be able to say hed no notion o what de man he sent to fetch de slabe was goin to do  now he couldnt hab say dat you know if he let you tell him all about itlike a goose as you was  so he let you go off dye see gib you your orders so far an labes de rest to your good sense zough dere wasnt too much ob dat to leab it to or you wouldnt hab bring away eddard lalatingumbob  but do you really mean to tell me peter that benahmed intended me and hugh sommers to escape  das really what i means to tell you geoge  then why didnt you tell me all this before and save me from a deal of uncertainty  cause in de fuss place i had no time to tell you in de second place i was ordered not to tell you in de tird place its good for midshipmen to be put on deir mettle an lef to find deir own way out ob diffikilties an in de fourf place slabes hab no business to be axin de outs an ins de whys an de wherefores of deir massas affairs  well i always knew benahmed had a kind heart but little thought it was so kind and selfsacrificing as to buy sommers for the very purpose of setting him free  i regret deeply that i did not know this sooner and that i cannot now have the chance of thanking him with all my heart and soul and bidding the good man farewell  it is one comfort however that ill be able to send a message back by you  and im also glad that i shall not have to part from you my dear peter without telling you how much i love you and how sorry very very sorry i am to say goodbye  geoge returned the negro earnestly dont you count your cheekins afore deys hatched  youre not away yit  foster made no reply  to say truth he felt a little hurt by the way in which his protestations of regard were received and by way of changing the subject he asked if peter had ever heard anything about the old dane and his wife and daughter who had been captured at the same time with himself  deys bin ransomd all ob dem  got rich friends you see  hole your tongue now geoge wes comin to de place  by that time sommers and his daughter had overtaken the party  as they all proceeded silently along the road wondering how the matter would end they observed a figure like that of a female glide as it were out of the darkness and taking peter quietly by the arm walk along with him  impelled by curiosity foster went forward and looked into her face  angelica he exclaimed in surprise  ob course answered her husband for her you dont suppose de wife ob peter de great would let geoge foster go away widout comin to de boat to see him off  ere the middy could recover from his astonishment the party came suddenly upon a small cavern in which a light glimmered  at its entrance lay a boat and beside it engaged in putting it to rights were brown and his three companionsthe two british tars and the maltese seaman  is all right asked brown in a low voice as they approached  all right answered peter  now geoge you go in  the middy entered the cave and with if possible increased surprise he found benahmed standing there  you are astonished my friend said the moor with a gentle smile as he extended his hand  i am indeed returned the middy heartily grasping and warmly shaking it but i am also rejoiced that i have the opportunitywhich i had not hoped forof thanking you for all your great kindness to me in time pastespecially for this crowning act  you have not to thank me returned the moor you have to thank the little english girl as he spoke he made a graceful motion of the hand towards hester who with her father entered the cave at the moment little hester has taught menot by word but by examplethe grand lesson of your christian scriptures that a man should do to others what he would have others do to him  i have resolved to keep no more slaves and as a first step i now set you all free  gods blessing rest on you for that sir said hugh sommers stepping forward and grasping the hand that foster had relinquished  have you then forsaken the faith of mohammed and adopted that of christ  be not overcurious said the moor reprovingly  sufficient for you to know that fresh water cannot spring from a salt fountain  we must not waste time  the boat is in the water by this time  farewell  kiss me my child  we may not meet again on earth butwe shall certainly meet hereafter  hester who saw the moor assume all shapes and sizes through the tears that filled her eyes ran to him and throwing her arms round his neck gave him a hug that made even her father jealous  now away all of you cried benahmed when he was released and may the god of abraham and isaac and jacob go with you  while he was yet speaking the clatter of horses hoofs in the distance was heard  instantly the party made for the boat  there was no time for last adieux  benahmed helped to shove off the boat and bundle them in  you will hear pistolshots he cried but fear not for me  my horse can outrun the best in algiers  i will only fire to decoy them away farewell  he ran up into the shrubbery that bordered the road and next minute the sound of the horses feet was heard in the distance as the boat skimmed swiftly out to sea under the powerful impulse of its stalwart crew  a few minutes later and as the moor had prophesied pistolshots were heard on shore  from the sound they appeared to come from a short distance in the interior of the land but musketshots were also heard among them and from the flashes on the beach it became evident that the moor had not succeeded in turning all their pursuers off the scenta fact which was further illustrated by the skipping of a musket ball close past the boat  just then it struck george foster that peter the great and his wife were seated beside him  hallo peter he exclaimed how are you and angelica to get on shore  wes not goin on shore at all geoge  what do you mean peter  i means what i says  de fact is geoge dat is come to de conclusion dat i couldnt lib widout you  angelicas ob de same opinion so wes made up our minds wid massas purmission to go wid you to ole england wes all goin togidder geoge  aint dat jolly  but how can we ever get to england in a small boat like this asked the middy in much anxiety for in the hurry and excitement of the start the difficulty had not occurred to him  no fear about that sir answered brown who pulled the bow oar we aint such fools as to make the voyage in a cockleshell like this  the boat blongs to a privateer as is owned by a friend o mine an the wessels lyin off an on waitin for us  there she goes said one of the sailors  look out  as he spoke a large schooner loomed up against the dark sky and was hailed  a gruff voice replied  another moment the sails flapped and the boat was towing alongside  our middy was first to leap on deckand not without a purpose in view for he was thus in a position to hand up the passengers  do you forgive me hester he whispered humbly as he stooped to grasp her little hand  i forgive you she whispered timidly as she passed him and was led by her father into the vessels cabin  that night two of the swiftest of the piratical warvessels were seen to warp out from the mole and put to sea but long before the land breeze filled their peaked sails the privateer was cleaving her way homeward bound through the dark waters of the mediterranean    chapter seventeen  the last  geoge your mudder wants you  such were the words which aroused george foster from a reverie one morning as he stood at the window of a villa on the coast of kent fastening his necktie and contemplating the sea  nothing wrong i hope said the middy turning quickly round and regarding with some anxiety the unusually solemn visage of peter the great  wheder deres anyfing wrong or not snot for me to say massa but i tink deres suffin up for she seems in a carfuffle  tell her i shall be with her instantly  completing his toilet hastily our hero repaired to his mothers apartment where he found her seated in dishabille with an open letter in her hand and some excitement in her face  is laronde better this morning she asked as her son sat down on a sofa at the foot of her bed  i dont know motherhavent been to his room this morning  why do you ask  has anything happened  i will tell you presently but first let me know what success you have had in your search  nothing but failure said the middy in a desponding tone  if there had been anything good to tell you i would have come to your room last night despite the lateness of the hour  we were later than usual in arriving because a trace broke and after that one of the horses cast a shoe  where did you make inquiries george  at the solicitors office of course  it is through them that we obtained what we hoped would be a clue and it is to them that poor marie laronde used to go to inquire whether there was any chance of her husband being released for a smaller sum than was at first demanded they had heard of a dressmaker who employed a girl or woman named laronde in the west end so i hunted her up with rather sanguine expectations but she turned out to be a girl of sixteen dark instead of fair and unmarried  but again i ask mother what news for i see by your face that you have something to tell me  that is a letter from minnie is it not  it is george and i am very hopeful that while you have been away on the wrong scent in the west end of london minnie has fallen quite unexpectedly on the right scent in one of the low quarters of liverpool  you know that she has been nursing aunt jeanette there for more than a fortnight  yes i know it only too well answered the middy  it is too bad that aunt jeanette should take it into her head to get ill and send for minnie just three weeks after my return from slaverybut what do you mean by her having fallen on the right scent  surely she has not found leisure and strength both to hunt and nurse at the same time  yes indeed she has  our last winter in that charming south of france has so completely restored herthrough the blessing of godthat she has found herself equal to almost anything  it happens that aunt jeanette has got a friend living close to her who is an enthusiastic worker amongst the poor of the town and she has taken your sister several times to visit the districts where the very poor people live it was while she was thus engaged probably never thinking of poor larondes wife at all that shebut here is the letter  read it for yourself you need not trouble yourself to read the last pagejust down to here  retiring to the window the middy read as follows    darling motheri must begin at once with what my mind is full of   just remarking by the way that aunt jeanette is improving steadily   and that i hope to be home again in less than a week    well i told you in my last that miss lovewho is most appropriately   namedhad taken me out once or twice on her visits among the poor   and do you know it has opened up a new world of ideas and feelings   to me  it is such a terrible revelation of the intensity of sorrow   and suffering that is endured by a large mass of our fellowcreatures   i am persuaded that thousands of the welltodo and the rich have no   conception of it for it must be seen to be understood  i feel as if   my heart had become a great fountain of pity  and i can wellat   least betterunderstand how our dear saviour when he wanted to give   evidence of the truth and character of his mission said the poor   have the gospel preached unto them for if any class of beings on the   face of this earth stand in need of good news it is the poor  god   help and bless them    well the other day miss love came to ask me to go out with her to   visit some of her poor people among others onea very singular   charactera woman who was reported to be a desperate miser insomuch   that she starved herself and her child for the sake of saving money   it was said that she was very ill at the timethought to be dying   and seemed to be in a wretched state of destitution  her name miss   love told me was lundy    as auntie was pretty well that day i gladly accompanied my friend to   her district  and it was an awful place  i shudder even now when i   think of the sights and sounds and dreadful language i saw and heard   therebut i must not turn aside from what i have to tell  i pass   over our visits to various families and come at once to the reputed   miser  she was in bed and from her flushed face and glittering eyes   i could see that she was in high fever  she started raised herself   on an elbow and glared at us as we entered    i was deeply interested in her from the first moment  although worn   and thin with lines of prolonged suffering indelibly stamped on her   she had a beautiful and refined face  her age appeared to be about   thirtyfive  a lovely but wretchedly clothed girl of about fourteen   years of age sat on a low stool at her bedside  and oh such a bed   it was  merely a heap of straw with a piece of sacking over it on a   broken bedstead  one worn blanket covered her thin form  besides   these things a small table and a corner cupboard there was   literally nothing else in the room    the girl rose to receive us and expressed regret that she had no   chairs to offer  while miss love went forward and talked tenderly to   the mother i drew the girl aside took her hand affectionately and   said you have not always been as poor as you now are    no indeed she said while tears filled her eyes but work failed   us in london where we once lived and mother came to liverpool to a   brother who said he would help her but he died soon after our   arrival and then mother got ill and i had to begin and spend our   savingssavings that darling mother had scraped and toiled so hard to   gainand this made her much worse for she was so anxious to save   money    this last remark reminded me of the reports about the mothers   miserly nature so i asked a question that made the poor girl reply   quickly    oh you mustnt think that darling mother is a miser  people so   often fall into that mistake  she has been saving for ever so many   years to buy father back    buy father back  i repeated with a sudden start    yes to buy him from the algerine pirates    i waited for no more but running to the bedside looked the poor   woman steadily in the face  there could be no doubt about it  there   was the fair hair blue eyes and clear complexion though the last   was sadly faded from illhealth    you should have seen the look of surprise she gave me  but i had   been foolishly precipitate  her mind had been wandering a little   before we came in  the shock seemed to throw it further off the   balance for she suddenly looked at me with a calm sweet smile    yes she said he always called me marie though my name was mary   being a frenchman you knowhis little marie he called me  i often   think how pleased he will be to see another little marie grown big   when we get him backbut oh how longhow long they are about   sending him though i have sent the money over and over again  hush    she looked round with a terrified expression and clutched my shawl   with her thin hand  you wont tell will you she went on you   have a kind face i am sure you will not tell but i have been   savingsavingsaving to send more money to the moors  i keep it in   a bag here under my pillow but i often fear that some one will   discover and steal it  oh these moors must have hard hard hearts to   keep him from me so longso very long    here she thrust me from her with unexpected violence burst into a   wild laugh and began in her delirium to rave against the moors  yet   even in the midst of her reproaches the poor thing prayed that god   would soften their hearts and forgive her for being so revengeful    now mother i want to know what is to be done for when we sent for   a doctor he said that not a word must be said about the return of her   husband until she is out of danger and restored to some degree of   health  thus far the middy read the letter  mother he said firmly the doctor may say what he likes but i am convinced that the best cure for fever and every other disease under the sun is joyadministered judiciously in small or large doses as the patient is able to bear it  now the primary cause of poor maries illness is the loss of her husband therefore the removal of the cause that is the recovery of her husband  with gods blessing interjected mrs foster  admittedwith the blessing of the great physicianthat is the natural cure  very true george but you wisely spoke of small doses  i am not sure that it would be safe to tell monsieur laronde that we have actually found his wife and child  he also is too weak to bear much agitation  not so weak as you think mother though the sufferings of slavelife and subsequent anxiety have brought him very near to the grave  but i will break it to him judiciously  we will get my dear little hester to do it  your hester exclaimed mrs foster in surprise  i trust george that you a mere midshipman have not dared to speak to that child of  make your mind easy mother replied the middy with a laugh i have not said a word  havent required to  we have both spoken to each other with our eyes and that is quite enough at present  i feel as sure of my little hester as if we were fairly spliced  there goes the breakfastbell  will you be down soon  no  i am too happy today to be able to eat in public george  send it up to me  the breakfastroom in that seaside villa presented an interesting company for the fugitives had stuck together with feelings of powerful sympathy since they had landed in england  hugh sommers was there but it was not easy to recognise in the fine massive genial gentleman in a shooting suit of grey the ragged wretched slave who not long before had struggled like a tiger with the janissaries on the walls of algiers  and hester was there of course with her sunny hair and sunny looks and general aspect of human sunniness all over as unlike to the veiled and timid moorish lady or the little thinnosed negress as chalk is to cheese  edouard laronde was also there and he like the others had undergone wonderful transformation in the matter of clothing but he had also changed in body for a severe illness had seized him when he landed and it required all mrs fosters careful nursing to pull him through as the middy styled it  brown the sailor was also there for being a pleasant as well as a sharp man young foster resolved to get him into the navy and if possible into the same ship with himself  meanwhile he retained him to assist in the search for marie laronde and her daughter  last but by no means least peter the great was therenot as one of the breakfast party but as a waiter  peter had from the first positively refused to sit down to meals in a diningparty room  no geoge he said when our middy proposed it to him on the occasion of their arrival at his mothers homeno geoge  i wont do it  das flat  is not bin used to it  my proper speer is de kitchen  besides do you tink id forsake my angelica an leabe her to feed alone downstairs wile her husband was agorgin of hisself above  neber  its no use for you geoge to say youd be happy to see her too for she wouldnt do it an shes as obsnit as mean more  now you make your mind easy ill be your mudders black flunkeyfor lub not for munny  so you hole your tongue geoge  thus the arrangement came to be madeat least for a time  the middy was unusually grave that morning as he sat down to breakfast they were all aware that he had returned from london late the previous night and were more or less eager to know the result of his visit but on observing his gravity they forbore to ask questions  only the poor frenchman ventured to say sadly failed again i see  not absolutely said foster who was anxious that the invalid should not have his breakfast spoilt by being excited  the visit i paid to the solicitor did indeed turn out a failure butbut i have still strong hopes he added cheerily  so hab i geoge remarked peter the great from behind the chair of miss sommers who presided at the breakfast table for although peter had resigned his right to equality as to feeding he by no means gave up his claim to that of social intercourse  come laronde  cheer up my friend said hugh sommers heartily i feel sure that well manage it amongst us for we have all entered on the search heart and soul  right you are sir ejaculated brown through a mouthful of buttered toast  it only requires patience said the middy for london is a big place you know and cant be gone over in a week or two  das so geoge said peter nodding approval  after breakfast foster sought a private interview with hester who undertook with much fear to communicate the news to laronde  you see i think it will come best from you hester said george in a grave fatherly manner because a woman always does these sort of things better than a man and besides poor laronde is uncommonly fond of you as  he was going to have said as everybody is but with much sagacity he stopped short and sneezed instead  he felt that a commonplace cough from a man with a sound chest would inevitably have betrayed himso he sneezed  a hyperkrite as usual he thought and continued aloud  so you see hester it is very important that you should undertake it and it will be very kind of you too  i would gladly undertake a great deal more than that for the poor man said hester earnestly  when must i do it  nowat once  the sooner the better  he usually goes to the bower at the foot of the garden after breakfast  without a word but with a glance that spoke volumes the maiden ran to the bower  what she said to the frenchman we need not write down in detail  it is sufficient to note the result  in the course of a short time after she had entered the bower a loud shout was heard and next moment laronde was seen rushing towards the house with a flushed countenance and the vigour of an athlete  my little girl has been too precipitate i fear remarked hugh sommers to the middy  your little girl is never tooanything replied the middy to hugh with much gravity  the exbagnio slave smiled but whether at the reply or at the rushing frenchman we cannot tell  when laronde reached his room he found peter the great there on his knees packing a small valise  hallo  peter what are you doing  i want that  yes eddard i know dat  das why is packin  youre a good fellow peter a true friend but let me do it im in terrible haste  no sar yous not in haste  deres lots ob time  he pulled out a watch of the warmingpan type and consulted it de coach dont start till one oclock its now eleben so deres no hurry  you jest lie down on de bed an ill pack de bag  instead of lying down the poor frenchman fell on his knees beside the bed and laid his face in his hands  yesdas better  deres some sense in dat muttered the negro as he quietly continued to pack the valise  two hours later and laronde was dashing across country as fast as four good horses could take him with george foster on one side peter the great on the other and brown on the boxseatthe focsl he called itbeside the redcoated driver  whatever may be true of your modern fortymileanhour iron horse there can be no question that the tenmileanhour of those days behind a spanking team with clattering wheels and swaying springs and cracking whip and sounding horn felt uncommonly swift and satisfactory laronde shut his eyes and enjoyed it at first  but the strength engendered by excitement soon began to fail  the long weary journey helped to make things worse and when at last they arrived at the journeys end and went with miss love and minnie to the lodging poor laronde had scarcely strength left to totter to his wifes bedside this was fortunate however for he was the better able to restrain his feelings  she has had a long satisfactory sleepis still sleepingand is much better was the nurses report as they entered  the daughter looked with surprise at the weak worn man who was led forward  laronde did not observe her  his eyes were fixed on the bed where the pale thin figure lay  one of maries hands lay outside the blanket  the husband knelt took it gently and laid his cheek on it  then he began to stroke it softly  the action awoke the sleeper but she did not open her eyes  go on she murmured gently you always used to do that when i was ill or tireddont stop it yet as you always do now and go away  the sound of her own voice seemed to awake her  she turned her head and her eyes opened wide while she gazed in his face with a steady stare uttering a sharp cry she seized him round the neck exclaiming praise the lord  yes mariemy own  praise the lord for he has been merciful to mea sinner  the unbeliever whom lash torture toil and woe could not soften was broken now for the goodness of the lord had led him to repentance  did the middy after all marry hester alias geogiana sommers  no of course he did not  he was a fullfledged lieutenant in his majestys navy when he did that  but it was not longonly a couple of years after his return from slaverywhen he threw little hester into a state of tremendous consternation one day by abruptly proposing that they should get spliced immediately and thenceforward sail the sea of life in company  hester said timidly she couldnt think of it  george said boldly he didnt want her to think of it but to do it  this was putting the subject in quite a new light so she smiled blushed and hurriedly hid her face on his shoulder  of course all the fugitive slaves were at the wedding  there was likewise a large quantity of darkblue cloth gold lace and brass buttons at it  peter the great came out strong upon that occasion  although he consented to do menial work he utterly refused to accept a menial position  indeed he claimed as much right to and interest in the bride as her own radiant fadder for had he not been the chief instrument in sabing dem bof from de moors  as no one ventured to deny the claim peter retired to the privacy of the back kitchen put his arm round angelicas neck told her that he had got a gift of enough money to ransom his sister dinah laid his woolly head on her shoulder and absolutely howled for joy  it may be well to remark in conclusion that peter the great finally agreed to become mrs fosters gardener as being the surest way of seeing geoge during his periodical visits home  for much the same reason hugh sommers settled down in a small house near them  laronde obtained a situation as french master in an academy not far off and his wife and daughter soon gave evidence that joy is indeed a wonderful medicine  as for george foster himself he rose to the top of his profession  how could it be otherwise with such an experienceand such a wife  and when in after years his sons and daughters clamoured as they were often wont to do for stories from father he would invariably send for peter the great in order that he might listen and corroborate or correct what he related of his wonderful adventures when he was a middy among the moors  the end
