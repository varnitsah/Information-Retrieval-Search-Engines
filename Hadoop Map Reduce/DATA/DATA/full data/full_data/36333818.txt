paraffin candle how wide an interval between them how vast a contrast the means adopted by man to illuminate his home at night stamp at once his position in the scale of civilisation the fluid bitumen of the far east blazing in rude vessels of baked earth the etruscan lamp exquisite in form yet ill adapted to its office the whale seal or bear fat filling the hut of the esquimaux or lap with odour rather than light the huge wax candle on the glittering altar the range of gas lamps in our streetsall have their stories to tell all if they could speak and after their own manner they can might warm our hearts in telling how they have ministered to mans comfort love of home toil and devotion  surely among the millions of fireworshippers and fireusers who have passed away in earlier ages some have pondered over the mystery of fire perhaps some clear minds have guessed shrewdly near the truth think of the time man has lived in hopeless ignorance think that only during a period which might be spanned by the life of one man has the truth been known  atom by atom link by link has the reasoning chain been forged some links too quickly and too slightly made have given way and been replaced by better work but now the great phenomena are knownthe outline is correctly and firmly drawncunning artists are filling in the rest and the child who masters these lectures knows more of fire than aristotle did  the candle itself is now made to light up the dark places of nature the blowpipe and the prism are adding to our knowledge of the earths crust but the torch must come first  among the

course of these lectures the chemical history of a candle i have taken this subject on a former occasion and were it left to my own will i should prefer to repeat it almost every yearso abundant is the interest that attaches itself to the subject so wonderful are the varieties of outlet which it offers into the various departments of philosophy there is not a law under which any part of this universe is governed which does not come into play and is touched upon in these phenomena there is no better there is no more open door by which you can enter into the study of natural philosophy than by considering the physical phenomena of a candle i trust therefore i shall not disappoint you in choosing this for my subject rather than any newer topic which could not be better were it even so good  and before proceeding let me say this alsothat though our subject be so great and our intention that of treating it honestly seriously and philosophically yet i mean to pass away from all those who are seniors amongst us i claim the privilege of speaking to juveniles as a juvenile myself i have done so on former occasionsand if you please i shall do so again and though i stand here with the knowledge of having the words i utter given to the world yet that shall not deter me from speaking in the same familiar way to those whom i esteem nearest to me on this occasion  and now my boys and girls i must first tell you of what candles are made some are great curiosities i have here some bits of timber branches of trees particularly famous for their burning and here you see a piece of that very curious substance taken out of some of the bogs in ireland called candlewooda hard strong excellent wood evidently fitted for good work as a resister of force and yet withal burning so well that where it is found they make splinters of it and torches since it burns like a candle and gives a very good light indeed and in this wood we have one of the most beautiful illustrations of the general nature of a candle that i can possibly give the fuel provided the means of bringing that fuel to the place of chemical action the regular and gradual supply of air to that place of actionheat and lightall produced by a little piece of wood of this kind forming in fact a natural candle  but we must speak of candles as they are in commerce here are a couple of candles commonly called dips they are made of lengths of cotton cut off hung up by a loop dipped into melted tallow taken out again and cooled then redipped until there is an accumulation of tallow round the cotton in order that you may have an idea of the various characters of these candles you see these which i hold in my handthey are very small and very curious they are or were the candles used by the miners in coal mines in olden times the miner had to find his own candles and it was supposed that a small candle would not so soon set fire to the firedamp in the coal mines as a large one and for that reason as well as for economys sake he had candles made of this sort20 30 40 or 60 to the pound they have been replaced since then by the steelmill and then by the davylamp and other safetylamps of various kinds i have here a candle that was taken out of the royal george1 it is said by colonel pasley it has been sunk in the sea for many years subject to the action of salt water it shews you how well candles may be preserved for though it is cracked about and broken a good deal yet when lighted it goes on burning regularly and the tallow resumes its natural condition as soon as it is fused  mr field of lambeth has supplied me abundantly with beautiful illustrations of the candle and its materials i shall therefore now refer to them and first there is the suetthe fat of the oxrussian tallow i believe employed in the manufacture of these dips which gay lussac or some one who entrusted him with his knowledge converted into that beautiful substance stearin which you see lying beside it a candle you know is not now a greasy thing like an ordinary tallow candle but a clean thing and you may almost scrape off and pulverise the drops which fall from it without soiling anything this is the process he adopted2the fat or tallow is first boiled with quicklime and made into a soap and then the soap is decomposed by sulphuric acid which takes away the lime and leaves the fat rearranged as stearic acid whilst a quantity of glycerin is produced at the same time glycerinabsolutely a sugar or a substance similar to sugarcomes out of the tallow in this chemical change the oil is then pressed out of it and you see here this series of pressed cakes shewing how beautifully the impurities are carried out by the oily part as the pressure goes on increasing and at last you have left that substance which is melted and cast into candles as here represented the candle i have in my hand is a stearin candle made of stearin from tallow in the way i have told you then here is a sperm candle which comes from the purified oil of the spermaceti whale here also are yellow beeswax and refined beeswax from which candles are made here too is that curious substance called paraffin and some paraffin candles made of paraffin obtained from the bogs of ireland i have here also a substance brought from japan since we have forced an entrance into that outoftheway placea sort of wax which a kind friend has sent me and which forms a new material for the manufacture of candles  and how are these candles made i have told you about dips and i will shew you how moulds are made let us imagine any of these candles to be made of materials which can be cast cast you say why a candle is a thing that melts and surely if you can melt it you can cast it not so it is wonderful in the progress of manufacture and in the consideration of the means best fitted to produce the required result how things turn up which one would not expect beforehand candles cannot always be cast a wax candle can never be cast it is made by a particular process which i can illustrate in a minute or two but i must not spend much time on it wax is a thing which burning so well and melting so easily in a candle cannot be cast however let us take a material that can be cast here is a frame with a number of moulds fastened in it the first thing to be done is to put a wick through them here is onea plaited wick which does not require snuffing3supported by a little wire it goes to the bottom where it is pegged inthe little peg holding the cotton tight and stopping the aperture so that nothing fluid shall run out at the upper part there is a little bar placed across which stretches the cotton and holds it in the mould the tallow is then melted and the moulds are filled after a certain time when the moulds are cool the excess of tallow is poured off at one corner and then cleaned off altogether and the ends of the wick cut away the candles alone then remain in the mould and you have only to upset them as i am doing when out they tumble for the candles are made in the form of cones being narrower at the top than at the bottom so that what with their form and their own shrinking they only need a little shaking and out they fall in the same way are made these candles of stearin and of paraffin it is a curious thing to see how wax candles are made a lot of cottons are hung upon frames as you see here and covered with metal tags at the ends to keep the wax from covering the cotton in those places these are carried to a heater where the wax is melted as you see the frames can turn round and as they turn a man takes a vessel of wax and pours it first down one and then the next and the next and so on when he has gone once round if it is sufficiently cool he gives the first a second coat and so on until they are all of the required thickness when they have been thus clothed or fed or made up to that thickness they are taken off and placed elsewhere i have here by the kindness of mr field several specimens of these candles here is one only halffinished they are then taken down and well rolled upon a fine stone slab and the conical top is moulded by properly shaped tubes and the bottoms cut off and trimmed this is done so beautifully that they can make candles in this way weighing exactly four or six to the pound or any number they please  we must not however take up more time about the mere manufacture but go a little further into the matter i have not yet referred you to luxuries in candles for there is such a thing as luxury in candles see how beautifully these are coloured you see here mauve magenta and all the chemical colours recently introduced applied to candles you observe also different forms employed here is a fluted pillar most beautifully shaped and i have also here some candles sent me by mr pearsall which are ornamented with designs upon them so that as they burn you have as it were a glowing sun above and a bouquet of flowers beneath all however that is fine and beautiful is not useful these fluted candles pretty as they are are bad candles they are bad because of their external shape nevertheless i shew you these specimens sent to me from kind friends on all sides that you may see what is done and what may be done in this or that direction although as i have said when we come to these refinements we are obliged to sacrifice a little in utility  now as to the light of the candle we will light one or two and set them at work in the performance of their proper functions you observe a candle is a very different thing from a lamp with a lamp you take a little oil fill your vessel put in a little moss or some cotton prepared by artificial means and then light the top of the wick when the flame runs down the cotton to the oil it gets extinguished but it goes on burning in the part above now i have no doubt you will ask how is it that the oil which will not burn of itself gets up to the top of the cotton where it will burn we shall presently examine that but there is a much more wonderful thing about the burning of a candle than this you have here a solid substance with no vessel to contain it and how is it that this solid substance can get up to the place where the flame is how is it that this solid gets there it not being a fluid or when it is made a fluid then how is it that it keeps together this is a wonderful thing about a candle  we have here a good deal of wind which will help us in some of our illustrations but tease us in others for the sake therefore of a little regularity and to simplify the matter i shall make a quiet flamefor who can study a subject when there are difficulties in the way not belonging to it here is a clever invention of some costermonger or street stander in the marketplace for the shading of their candles on saturday nights when they are selling their greens or potatoes or fish i have very often admired it they put a lampglass round the candle supported on a kind of gallery which clasps it and it can be slipped up and down as required by the use of this lampglass employed in the same way you have a steady flame which you can look at and carefully examine as i hope you will do at home  you see then in the first instance that a beautiful cup is formed as the air comes to the candle it moves upwards by the force of the current which the heat of the candle produces and it so cools all the sides of the wax tallow or fuel as to keep the edge much cooler than the part within the part within melts by the flame that runs down the wick as far as it can go before it is extinguished but the part on the outside does not melt if i made a current in one direction my cup would be lopsided and the fluid would consequently run overfor the same force of gravity which holds worlds together holds this fluid in a horizontal position and if the cup be not horizontal of course the fluid will run away in guttering you see therefore that the cup is formed by this beautifully regular ascending current of air playing upon all sides which keeps the exterior of the candle cool no fuel would serve for a candle which has not the property of giving this cup except such fuel as the irish bogwood where the material itself is like a sponge and holds its own fuel you see now why you would have had such a bad result if you were to burn these beautiful candles that i have shewn you which are irregular intermittent in their shape and cannot therefore have that nicelyformed edge to the cup which is the great beauty in a candle i hope you will now see that the perfection of a processthat is its utilityis the better point of beauty about it it is not the best looking thing but the best acting thing which is the most advantageous to us this goodlooking candle is a bad burning one there will be a guttering round about it because of the irregularity of the stream of air and the badness of the cup which is formed thereby you may see some pretty examples and i trust you will notice these instances of the action of the ascending current when you have a little gutter run down the side of a candle making it thicker there than it is elsewhere as the candle goes on burning that keeps its place and forms a little pillar sticking up by the side because as it rises higher above the rest of the wax or fuel the air gets better round it and it is more cooled and better able to resist the action of the heat at a little distance now the greatest mistakes and faults with regard to candles as in many other things often bring with them instruction which we should not receive if they had not occurred we come here to be philosophers and i hope you will always remember that whenever a result happens especially if it be new you should say what is the cause why does it occur and you will in the course of time find out the reason  then there is another point about these candles which will answer a questionthat is as to the way in which this fluid gets out of the cup up the wick and into the place of combustion you know that the flames on these burning wicks in candles made of beeswax stearin or spermaceti do not run down to the wax or other matter and melt it all away but keep to their own right place they are fenced off from the fluid below and do not encroach on the cup at the sides i cannot imagine a more beautiful example than the condition of adjustment under which a candle makes one part subserve to the other to the very end of its action a combustible thing like that burning away gradually never being intruded upon by the flame is a very beautiful sight especially when you come to learn what a vigorous thing flame iswhat power it has of destroying the wax itself when it gets hold of it and of disturbing its proper form if it come only too near  but how does the flame get hold of the fuel there is a beautiful point about thatcapillary attraction4 capillary attraction you saythe attraction of hairs well never mind the name it was given in old times before we had a good understanding of what the real power was it is by what is called capillary attraction that the fuel is conveyed to the part where combustion goes on and is deposited there not in a careless way but very beautifully in the very midst of the centre of action which takes place around it now i am going to give you one or two instances of capillary attraction it is that kind of action or attraction which makes two things that do not dissolve in each other still hold together when you wash your hands you wet them thoroughly you take a little soap to make the adhesion better and you find your hand remains wet this is by that kind of attraction of which i am about to speak and what is more if your hands are not soiled as they almost always are by the usages of life if you put your finger into a little warm water the water will creep a little way up the finger though you may not stop to examine it i have here a substance which is rather porousa column of saltand i will pour into the plate at the bottom not water as it appears but a saturated solution of salt which cannot absorb more so that the action which you see will not be due to its dissolving anything we may consider the plate to be the candle and the salt the wick and this solution the melted tallow i have coloured the fluid that you may see the action better you observe that now i pour in the fluid it rises and gradually creeps up the salt higher and higher and provided the column does not tumble over it will go to the top  illustration fig 1  if this blue solution were combustible and we were to place a wick at the top of the salt it would burn as it entered into the wick it is a most curious thing to see this kind of action taking place and to observe how singular some of the circumstances are about it when you wash your hands you take a towel to wipe off the water and it is by that kind of wetting or that kind of attraction which makes the towel become wet with water that the wick is made wet with the tallow i have known some careless boys and girls indeed i have known it happen to careful people as well who having washed their hands and wiped them with a towel have thrown the towel over the side of the basin and before long it has drawn all the water out of the basin and conveyed it to the floor because it happened to be thrown over the side in such a way as to serve the purpose of a syphon5 that you may the better see the way in which the substances act one upon another i have here a vessel made of wire gauze filled with water and you may compare it in its action to the cotton in one respect or to a piece of calico in the other in fact wicks are sometimes made of a kind of wire gauze you will observe that this vessel is a porous thing for if i pour a little water on to the top it will run out at the bottom you would be puzzled for a good while if i asked you what the state of this vessel is what is inside it and why it is there the vessel is full of water and yet you see the water goes in and runs out as if it were empty in order to prove this to you i have only to empty it the reason is thisthe wire being once wetted remains wet the meshes are so small that the fluid is attracted so strongly from the one side to the other as to remain in the vessel although it is porous in like manner the particles of melted tallow ascend the cotton and get to the top other particles then follow by their mutual attraction for each other and as they reach the flame they are gradually burned  here is another application of the same principle you see this bit of cane i have seen boys about the streets who are very anxious to appear like men take a piece of cane and light it and smoke it as an imitation of a cigar they are enabled to do so by the permeability of the cane in one direction and by its capillarity if i place this piece of cane on a plate containing some camphin which is very much like paraffin in its general character exactly in the same manner as the blue fluid rose through the salt will this fluid rise through the piece of cane there being no pores at the side the fluid cannot go in that direction but must pass through its length already the fluid is at the top of the cane now i can light it and make it serve as a candle the fluid has risen by the capillary attraction of the piece of cane just as it does through the cotton in the candle  now the only reason why the candle does not burn all down the side of the wick is that the melted tallow extinguishes the flame you know that a candle if turned upside down so as to allow the fuel to run upon the wick will be put out the reason is that the flame has not had time to make the fuel hot enough to burn as it does above where it is carried in small quantities into the wick and has all the effect of the heat exercised upon it  there is another condition which you must learn as regards the candle without which you would not be able fully to understand the philosophy of it and that is the vaporous condition of the fuel  in order that you may understand that let me shew you a very pretty but very commonplace experiment if you blow a candle out cleverly you will see the vapour rise from it you have i know often smelt the vapour of a blownout candleand a very bad smell it is but if you blow it out cleverly you will be able to see pretty well the vapour into which this solid matter is transformed  i will blow out one of these candles in such a way as not to disturb the air around it by the continuing action of my breath and now if i hold a lighted taper two or three inches from the wick you will observe a train of fire going through the air till it reaches the candle i am obliged to be quick and ready because if i allow the vapour time to cool it becomes condensed into a liquid or solid or the stream of combustible matter gets disturbed  now as to the shape or form of the flame it concerns us much to know about the condition which the matter of the candle finally assumes at the top of the wickwhere you have such beauty and brightness as nothing but combustion or flame can produce  illustration fig 2  you have the glittering beauty of gold and silver and the still higher lustre of jewels like the ruby and diamond but none of these rival the brilliancy and beauty of flame what diamond can shine like flame it owes its lustre at nighttime to the very flame shining upon it the flame shines in darkness but the light which the diamond has is as nothing until the flame shine upon it when it is brilliant again the candle alone shines by itself and for itself or for those who have arranged the materials now let us look a little at the form of the flame as you see it under the glass shade it is steady and equal and its general form is that which is represented in the diagram varying with atmospheric disturbances and also varying according to the size of the candle it is a bright oblongbrighter at the top than towards the bottomwith the wick in the middle and besides the wick in the middle certain darker parts towards the bottom where the ignition is not so perfect as in the part above  illustration fig 3  i have a drawing here sketched many years ago by hooker when he made his investigations it is the drawing of the flame of a lamp but it will apply to the flame of a candle the cup of the candle is the vessel or lamp the melted spermaceti is the oil and the wick is common to both upon that he sets this little flame and then he represents what is truea certain quantity of matter rising about it which you do not see and which if you have not been here before or are not familiar with the subject you will not know of he has here represented the parts of the surrounding atmosphere that are very essential to the flame and that are always present with it there is a current formed which draws the flame outfor the flame which you see is really drawn out by the current and drawn upward to a great heightjust as hooker has here shewn you by that prolongation of the current in the diagram you may see this by taking a lighted candle and putting it in the sun so as to get its shadow thrown on a piece of paper how remarkable it is that that thing which is light enough to produce shadows of other objects can be made to throw its own shadow on a piece of white paper or card so that you can actually see streaming round the flame something which is not part of the flame but is ascending and drawing the flame upwards now i am going to imitate the sunlight by applying the voltaic battery to the electric lamp you now see our sun and its great luminosity and by placing a candle between it and the screen we get the shadow of the flame  illustration fig 4  you observe the shadow of the candle and of the wick then there is a darkish part as represented in the diagram and then a part which is more distinct curiously enough however what we see in the shadow as the darkest part of the flame is in reality the brightest part and here you see streaming upwards the ascending current of hot air as shewn by hooker which draws out the flame supplies it with air and cools the sides of the cup of melted fuel  i can give you here a little further illustration for the purpose of shewing you how flame goes up or down according to the current i have here a flameit is not a candle flamebut you can no doubt by this time generalise enough to be able to compare one thing with another what i am about to do is to change the ascending current that takes the flame upwards into a descending current this i can easily do by the little apparatus you see before me the flame as i have said is not a candle flame but it is produced by alcohol so that it shall not smoke too much i will also colour the flame with another substance6 so that you may trace its course for with the spirit alone you could hardly see well enough to have the opportunity of tracing its direction by lighting this spiritofwine we have then a flame produced and you observe that when held in the air it naturally goes upwards  illustration fig 5  you understand now easily enough why flames go up under ordinary circumstancesit is because of the draught of air by which the combustion is formed but now by blowing the flame down you see i am enabled to make it go downwards into this little chimneythe direction of the current being changed before we have concluded this course of lectures we shall shew you a lamp in which the flame goes up and the smoke goes down or the flame goes down and the smoke goes up you see then that we have the power in this way of varying the flame in different directions  there are now some other points that i must bring before you many of the flames you see here vary very much in their shape by the currents of air blowing around them in different directions but we can if we like make flames so that they will look like fixtures and we can photograph themindeed we have to photograph themso that they become fixed to us if we wish to find out everything concerning them that however is not the only thing i wish to mention if i take a flame sufficiently large it does not keep that homogeneous that uniform condition of shape but it breaks out with a power of life which is quite wonderful i am about to use another kind of fuel but one which is truly and fairly a representative of the wax or tallow of a candle i have here a large ball of cotton which will serve as a wick and now that i have immersed it in spirit and applied a light to it in what way does it differ from an ordinary candle why it differs very much in one respect that we have a vivacity and power about it a beauty and a life entirely different from the light presented by a candle you see those fine tongues of flame rising up you have the same general disposition of the mass of the flame from below upwards but in addition to that you have this remarkable breaking out into tongues which you do not perceive in the case of a candle now why is this i must explain it to you because when you understand that perfectly you will be able to follow me better in what i have to say hereafter i suppose some here will have made for themselves the experiment i am going to shew you am i right in supposing that anybody here has played at snapdragon i do not know a more beautiful illustration of the philosophy of flame as to a certain part of its history than the game of snapdragon first here is the dish and let me say that when you play snapdragon properly you ought to have the dish wellwarmed you ought also to have warm plums and warm brandy which however i have not got when you have put the spirit into the dish you have the cup and the fuel and are not the raisins acting like the wicks i now throw the plums into the dish and light the spirit and you see those beautiful tongues of flame that i refer to you have the air creeping in over the edge of the dish forming these tongues why because through the force of the current and the irregularity of the action of the flame it cannot flow in one uniform stream the air flows in so irregularly that you have what would otherwise be a single image broken up into a variety of forms and each of these little tongues has an independent existence of its own indeed i might say you have here a multitude of independent candles you must not imagine because you see these tongues all at once that the flame is of this particular shape a flame of that shape is never so at any one time never is a body of flame like that which you just saw rising from the ball of the shape it appears to you it consists of a multitude of different shapes succeeding each other so fast that the eye is only able to take cognisance of them all at once in former times i purposely analysed a flame of that general character and the diagram shews you the different parts of which it is composed they do not occur all at once it is only because we see these shapes in such rapid succession that they seem to us to exist all at one time  illustration fig 6  it is too bad that we have not got further than my game of snapdragon but we must not under any circumstances keep you beyond your time it will be a lesson to me in future to hold you more strictly to the philosophy of the thing than to take up your time so much with these illustrations     lecture ii  a candle brightness of the flameair necessary for combustionproduction of water   we were occupied the last time we met in considering the general character and arrangement as regards the fluid portion of a candle and the way in which that fluid got into the place of combustion you see when we have a candle burning fairly in a regular steady atmosphere it will have a shape something like the one shewn in the diagram and will look pretty uniform although very curious in its character and now i have to ask your attention to the means by which we are enabled to ascertain what happens in any particular part of the flamewhy it happens what it does in happening and where after all the whole candle goes to because as you know very well a candle being brought before us and burned disappears if burned properly without the least trace of dirt in the candlestickand this is a very curious circumstance in order then to examine this candle carefully i have arranged certain apparatus the use of which you will see as i go on here is a candle i am about to put the end of this glass tube into the middle of the flameinto that part which old hooker has represented in the diagram as being rather dark and which you can see at any time if you will look at a candle carefully without blowing it about we will examine this dark part first  illustration fig 7  now i take this bent glass tube and introduce one end into that part of the flame and you see at once that something is coming from the flame out at the other end of the tube and if i put a flask there and leave it for a little while you will see that something from the middle part of the flame is gradually drawn out and goes through the tube and into that flask and there behaves very differently from what it does in the open air it not only escapes from the end of the tube but falls down to the bottom of the flask like a heavy substance as indeed it is we find that this is the wax of the candle made into a vaporous fluidnot a gas you must learn the difference between a gas and a vapour a gas remains permanent a vapour is something that will condense if you blow out a candle you perceive a very nasty smell resulting from the condensation of this vapour that is very different from what you have outside the flame and in order to make that more clear to you i am about to produce and set fire to a larger portion of this vapourfor what we have in the small way in a candle to understand thoroughly we must as philosophers produce in a larger way if needful that we may examine the different parts and now mr anderson will give me a source of heat and i am about to shew you what that vapour is here is some wax in a glass flask and i am going to make it hot as the inside of that candleflame is hot and the matter about the wick is hot the lecturer placed some wax in a glass flask and heated it over a lamp now i dare say that is hot enough for me you see that the wax i put in it has become fluid and there is a little smoke coming from it we shall very soon have the vapour rising up i will make it still hotter and now we get more of it so that i can actually pour the vapour out of the flask into that basin and set it on fire there this then is exactly the same kind of vapour as we have in the middle of the candle and that you may be sure this is the case let us try whether we have not got here in this flask a real combustible vapour out of the middle of the candle taking the flask into which the tube from the candle proceeded and introducing a lighted taper see how it burns now this is the vapour from the middle of the candle produced by its own heat and that is one of the first things you have to consider with respect to the progress of the wax in the course of its combustion and as regards the changes it undergoes i will arrange another tube carefully in the flame and i should not wonder if we were able by a little care to get that vapour to pass through the tube to the other extremity where we will light it and obtain absolutely the flame of the candle at a place distant from it  now look at that is not that a very pretty experiment talk about laying on gaswhy we can actually lay on a candle and you see from this that there are clearly two different kinds of actionone the production of the vapour and the other the combustion of itboth of which take place in particular parts of the candle  illustration fig 8  i shall get no vapour from that part which is already burnt if i raise the tube fig 7 to the upper part of the flame so soon as the vapour has been swept out what comes away will be no longer combustible it is already burned how burned why burned thusin the middle of the flame where the wick is there is this combustible vapour on the outside of the flame is the air which we shall find necessary for the burning of the candle between the two intense chemical action takes place whereby the air and the fuel act upon each other and at the very same time that we obtain light the vapour inside is destroyed if you examine where the heat of a candle is you will find it very curiously arranged suppose i take this candle and hold a piece of paper close upon the flame where is the heat of that flame do you not see that it is not in the inside it is in a ring exactly in the place where i told you the chemical action was and even in my irregular mode of making the experiment if there is not too much disturbance there will always be a ring this is a good experiment for you to make at home take a strip of paper have the air in the room quiet and put the piece of paper right across the middle of the flame i must not talk while i make the experiment and you will find that it is burnt in two places and that it is not burnt or very little so in the middle and when you have tried the experiment once or twice so as to make it nicely you will be very interested to see where the heat is and to find that it is where the air and the fuel come together  this is most important for us as we proceed with our subject air is absolutely necessary for combustion and what is more i must have you understand that fresh air is necessary or else we should be imperfect in our reasoning and our experiments here is a jar of air i place it over a candle and it burns very nicely in it at first shewing that what i have said about it is true but there will soon be a change see how the flame is drawing upwards presently fading and at last going out and going out why not because it wants air merely for the jar is as full now as it was before but it wants pure fresh air the jar is full of air partly changed partly not changed but it does not contain sufficient of the fresh air which is necessary for the combustion of a candle these are all points which we as young chemists have to gather up and if we look a little more closely into this kind of action we shall find certain steps of reasoning extremely interesting for instance here is the oillamp i shewed youan excellent lamp for our experimentsthe old argand lamp i now make it like a candle obstructing the passage of air into the centre of the flame there is the cotton there is the oil rising up it and there is the conical flame it burns poorly because there is a partial restraint of air i have allowed no air to get to it save round the outside of the flame and it does not burn well i cannot admit more air from the outside because the wick is large but if as argand did so cleverly i open a passage to the middle of the flame and so let air come in there you will see how much more beautifully it burns if i shut the air off look how it smokes and why we have now some very interesting points to study we have the case of the combustion of a candle we have the case of a candle being put out by the want of air and we have now the case of imperfect combustion and this is to us so interesting that i want you to understand it as thoroughly as you do the case of a candle burning in its best possible manner i will now make a great flame because we need the largest possible illustrations here is a larger wick burning turpentine on a ball of cotton all these things are the same as candles after all if we have larger wicks we must have a larger supply of air or we shall have less perfect combustion look now at this black substance going up into the atmosphere there is a regular stream of it i have provided means to carry off the imperfectly burned part lest it should annoy you look at the soots that fly off from the flame see what an imperfect combustion it is because it cannot get enough air what then is happening why certain things which are necessary to the combustion of a candle are absent and very bad results are accordingly produced but we see what happens to a candle when it is burnt in a pure and proper state of air at the time when i shewed you this charring by the ring of flame on the one side of the paper i might have also shewn you by turning to the other side that the burning of a candle produces the same kind of sootcharcoal or carbon  but before i shew that let me explain to youas it is quite necessary for our purposethat though i take a candle and give you as the general result its combustion in the form of a flame we must see whether combustion is always in this condition or whether there are other conditions of flame and we shall soon discover that there are and that they are most important to us i think perhaps the best illustration of such a point to us as juveniles is to shew the result of strong contrast here is a little gunpowder you know that gunpowder burns with flamewe may fairly call it flame it contains carbon and other materials which altogether cause it to burn with a flame and here is some pulverised iron or iron filings now i purpose burning these two things together i have a little mortar in which i will mix them before i go into these experiments let me hope that none of you by trying to repeat them for funs sake will do any harm these things may all be very properly used if you take care but without that much mischief will be done well then here is a little gunpowder which i put at the bottom of that little wooden vessel and mix the iron filings up with it my object being to make the gunpowder set fire to the filings and burn them in the air and thereby shew the difference between substances burning with flame and not with flame here is the mixture and when i set fire to it you must watch the combustion and you will see that it is of two kinds you will see the gunpowder burning with a flame and the filings thrown up you will see them burning too but without the production of flame  they will each burn separately the lecturer then ignited the mixture there is the gunpowder which burns with a flame and there are the filingsthey burn with a different kind of combustion you see then these two great distinctions and upon these differences depend all the utility and all the beauty of flame which we use for the purpose of giving out light when we use oil or gas or candle for the purpose of illumination their fitness all depends upon these different kinds of combustion  there are such curious conditions of flame that it requires some cleverness and nicety of discrimination to distinguish the kinds of combustion one from another for instance here is a powder which is very combustible consisting as you see of separate little particles it is called lycopodium7 and each of these particles can produce a vapour and produce its own flame but to see them burning you would imagine it was all one flame i will now set fire to a quantity and you will see the effect we saw a cloud of flame apparently in one body but that rushing noise referring to the sound produced by the burning was a proof that the combustion was not a continuous or regular one this is the lightning of the pantomimes and a very good imitation the experiment was twice repeated by blowing lycopodium from a glass tube through a spiritflame this is not an example of combustion like that of the filings i have been speaking of to which we must now return  suppose i take a candle and examine that part of it which appears brightest to our eyes why there i get these black particles which already you have seen many times evolved from the flame and which i am now about to evolve in a different way i will take this candle and clear away the gutterage which occurs by reason of the currents of air and if i now arrange a glass tube so as just to dip into this luminous part as in our first experiment only higher you see the result in place of having the same white vapour that you had before you will now have a black vapour there it goes as black as ink it is certainly very different from the white vapour and when we put a light to it we shall find that it does not burn but that it puts the light out well these particles as i said before are just the smoke of the candle and this brings to mind that old employment which dean swift recommended to servants for their amusement namely writing on the ceiling of a room with a candle but what is that black substance why it is the same carbon which exists in the candle how comes it out of the candle it evidently existed in the candle or else we should not have had it here and now i want you to follow me in this explanation you would hardly think that all those substances which fly about london in the form of soots and blacks are the very beauty and life of the flame and which are burned in it as those iron filings were burned here here is a piece of wire gauze which will not let the flame go through it and i think you will see almost immediately that when i bring it low enough to touch that part of the flame which is otherwise so bright that it quells and quenches it at once and allows a volume of smoke to rise up  i want you now to follow me in this pointthat whenever a substance burns as the iron filings burnt in the flame of gunpowder without assuming the vaporous state whether it becomes liquid or remains solid it becomes exceedingly luminous i have here taken three or four examples apart from the candle on purpose to illustrate this point to you because what i have to say is applicable to all substances whether they burn or whether they do not burnthat they are exceedingly bright if they retain their solid state and that it is to this presence of solid particles in the candleflame that it owes its brilliancy  here is a platinumwire a body which does not change by heat if i heat it in this flame see how exceedingly luminous it becomes i will make the flame dim for the purpose of giving a little light only and yet you will see that the heat which it can give to that platinumwire though far less than the heat it has itself is able to raise the platinumwire to a far higher state of effulgence this flame has carbon in it but i will take one that has no carbon in it there is a material a kind of fuela vapour or gas whichever you like to call itin that vessel and it has no solid particles in it so i take that because it is an example of flame itself burning without any solid matter whatever and if i now put this solid substance in it you see what an intense heat it has and how brightly it causes the solid body to glow this is the pipe through which we convey this particular gas which we call hydrogen and which you shall know all about next time we meet and here is a substance called oxygen by means of which this hydrogen can burn and although we produce by their mixture far greater heat8 than you can obtain from the candle yet there is very little light if however i take a solid substance and put that into it we produce an intense light if i take a piece of lime a substance which will not burn and which will not vaporise by the heat and because it does not vaporise remains solid and remains heated you will soon observe what happens as to its glowing i have here a most intense heat produced by the burning of hydrogen in contact with the oxygen but there is as yet very little lightnot for want of heat but for want of particles which can retain their solid state but when i hold this piece of lime in the flame of the hydrogen as it burns in the oxygen see how it glows this is the glorious limelight which rivals the voltaiclight and which is almost equal to sunlight i have here a piece of carbon or charcoal which will burn and give us light exactly in the same manner as if it were burnt as part of a candle the heat that is in the flame of a candle decomposes the vapour of the wax and sets free the carbon particlesthey rise up heated and glowing as this now glows and then enter into the air but the particles when burnt never pass off from a candle in the form of carbon they go off into the air as a perfectly invisible substance about which we shall know hereafter  is it not beautiful to think that such a process is going on and that such a dirty thing as charcoal can become so incandescent you see it comes to thisthat all bright flames contain these solid particles all things that burn and produce solid particles either during the time they are burning as in the candle or immediately after being burnt as in the case of the gunpowder and ironfilingsall these things give us this glorious and beautiful light  i will give you a few illustrations here is a piece of phosphorus which burns with a bright flame very well we may now conclude that phosphorus will produce either at the moment that it is burning or afterwards these solid particles here is the phosphorus lighted and i cover it over with this glass for the purpose of keeping in what is produced what is all that smoke that smoke consists of those very particles which are produced by the combustion of the phosphorus here again are two substances this is chlorate of potassa and this other sulphuret of antimony i shall mix these together a little and then they may be burnt in many ways i shall touch them with a drop of sulphuric acid for the purpose of giving you an illustration of chemical action and they will instantly burn9 the lecturer then ignited the mixture by means of sulphuric acid now from the appearance of things you can judge for yourselves whether they produce solid matter in burning i have given you the train of reasoning which will enable you to say whether they do or do not for what is this bright flame but the solid particles passing off  illustration fig 9  mr anderson has in the furnace a very hot cruciblei am about to throw into it some zinc filings and they will burn with a flame like gunpowder i make this experiment because you can make it well at home now i want you to see what will be the result of the combustion of this zinc here it is burningburning beautifully like a candle i may say but what is all that smoke and what are those little clouds of wool which will come to you if you cannot come to them and make themselves sensible to you in the form of the old philosophic wool as it was called we shall have left in that crucible also a quantity of this woolly matter but i will take a piece of this same zinc and make an experiment a little more closely at home as it were you will have here the same thing happening here is the piece of zinc there pointing to a jet of hydrogen is the furnace and we will set to work and try and burn the metal it glows you see there is the combustion and there is the white substance into which it burns and so if i take that flame of hydrogen as the representative of a candle and shew you a substance like zinc burning in the flame you will see that it was merely during the action of combustion that this substance glowedwhile it was kept hot and if i take a flame of hydrogen and put this white substance from the zinc into it look how beautifully it glows and just because it is a solid substance  i will now take such a flame as i had a moment since and set free from it the particles of carbon here is some camphine which will burn with a smoke but if i send these particles of smoke through this pipe into the hydrogen flame you will see they will burn and become luminous because we heat them a second time there they are those are the particles of carbon reignited a second time they are those particles which you can easily see by holding a piece of paper behind them and which whilst they are in the flame are ignited by the heat produced and when so ignited produce this brightness when the particles are not separated you get no brightness the flame of coalgas owes its brightness to the separation during combustion of these particles of carbon which are equally in that as in a candle i can very quickly alter that arrangement here for instance is a bright flame of gas supposing i add so much air to the flame as to cause it all to burn before those particles are set free i shall not have this brightness and i can do that in this wayif i place over the jet this wiregauze cap as you see and then light the gas over it it burns with a nonluminous flame owing to its having plenty of air mixed with it before it burns and if i raise the gauze you see it does not burn below10 there is plenty of carbon in the gas but because the atmosphere can get to it and mix with it before it burns you see how pale and blue the flame is and if i blow upon a bright gasflame so as to consume all this carbon before it gets heated to the glowing point it will also burn blue the lecturer illustrated his remarks by blowing on the gaslight the only reason why i have not the same bright light when i thus blow upon the flame is that the carbon meets with sufficient air to burn it before it gets separated in the flame in a free state the difference is solely due to the solid particles not being separated before the gas is burnt  you observe that there are certain products as the result of the combustion of a candle and that of these products one portion may be considered as charcoal or soot that charcoal when afterwards burnt produces some other product and it concerns us very much now to ascertain what that other product is we shewed that something was going away and i want you now to understand how much is going up into the air and for that purpose we will have combustion on a little larger scale from that candle ascends heated air and two or three experiments will shew you the ascending current but in order to give you a notion of the quantity of matter which ascends in this way i will make an experiment by which i shall try to imprison some of the products of this combustion for this purpose i have here what boys call a fireballoon i use this fireballoon merely as a sort of measure of the result of the combustion we are considering and i am about to make a flame in such an easy and simple manner as shall best serve my present purpose this plate shall be the cup we will so say of the candle this spirit shall be our fuel and i am about to place this chimney over it because it is better for me to do so than to let things proceed at random  illustration fig 10  mr anderson will now light the fuel and here at the top we shall get the results of the combustion what we get at the top of that tube is exactly the same generally speaking as you get from the combustion of a candle but we do not get a luminous flame here because we use a substance which is feeble in carbon i am about to put this balloonnot into action because that is not my objectbut to shew you the effect which results from the action of those products which arise from the candle as they arise here from the furnace the balloon was held over the chimney when it immediately commenced to fill you see how it is disposed to ascend but we must not let it up because it might come in contact with those upper gaslights and that would be very inconvenient the upper gaslights were turned out at the request of the lecturer and the balloon was allowed to ascend does not that shew you what a large bulk of matter is being evolved now there is going through this tube placing a large glass tube over a candle all the products of that candle and you will presently see that the tube will become quite opaque suppose i take another candle and place it under a jar and then put a light on the other side just to shew you what is going on you see that the sides of the jar become cloudy and the light begins to burn feebly it is the products you see which make the light so dim and this is the same thing which makes the sides of the jar so opaque if you go home and take a spoon that has been in the cold air and hold it over a candlenot so as to soot ityou will find that it becomes dim just as that jar is dim if you can get a silver dish or something of that kind you will make the experiment still better and now just to carry your thoughts forward to the time we shall next meet let me tell you that it is water which causes the dimness and when we next meet i will shew you that we can make it without difficulty assume the form of a liquid     lecture iii  products water from the combustionnature of watera compoundhydrogen   i dare say you will remember that when we parted we had just mentioned the word products from the candle for when a candle burns we found we were able by nice adjustment to get various products from it there was one substance which was not obtained when the candle was burning properly which was charcoal or smoke and there was some other substance that went upwards from the flame which did not appear as smoke but took some other form and made part of that general current which ascending from the candle upwards becomes invisible and escapes there were also other products to mention you remember that in that rising current having its origin at the candle we found that one part was condensable against a cold spoon or against a clean plate or any other cold thing and another part was incondensable  we will first take the condensable part and examine it and strange to say we find that that part of the product is just waternothing but water on the last occasion i spoke of it incidentally merely saying that water was produced among the condensable products of the candle but today i wish to draw your attention to water that we may examine it carefully especially in relation to this subject and also with respect to its general existence on the surface of the globe  now having previously arranged an experiment for the purpose of condensing water from the products of the candle my next point will be to shew you this water and perhaps one of the best means that i can adopt for shewing its presence to so many at once is to exhibit a very visible action of water and then to apply that test to what is collected as a drop at the bottom of that vessel i have here a chemical substance discovered by sir humphrey davy which has a very energetic action upon water which i shall use as a test of the presence of water if i take a little piece of itit is called potassium as coming from potashif i take a little piece of it and throw it into that basin you see how it shews the presence of water by lighting up and floating about burning with a violent flame i am now going to take away the candle which has been burning beneath the vessel containing ice and salt and you see a drop of watera condensed product of the candlehanging from under the surface of the dish  illustration fig 11  i will shew you that potassium has the same action upon it as upon the water in that basin in the experiment we have just tried see it takes fire and burns in just the same manner i will take another drop upon this glass slab and when i put the potassium on to it you see at once from its taking fire that there is water present now that water was produced by the candle in the same manner if i put this spiritlamp under that jar you will soon see the latter become damp from the dew which is deposited upon itthat dew being the result of combustion and i have no doubt you will shortly see by the drops of water which fall upon the paper below that there is a good deal of water produced from the combustion of the lamp i will let it remain and you can afterwards see how much water has been collected so if i take a gaslamp and put any cooling arrangement over it i shall get waterwater being likewise produced from the combustion of gas here in this bottle is a quantity of waterperfectly pure distilled water produced from the combustion of a gaslampin no point different from the water that you distil from the river or ocean or spring but exactly the same thing water is one individual thingit never changes we can add to it by careful adjustment for a little while or we can take it apart and get other things from it but water as water remains always the same either in a solid liquid or fluid state here again holding another bottle is some water produced by the combustion of an oillamp a pint of oil when burnt fairly and properly produces rather more than a pint of water here again is some water produced by a rather long experiment from a wax candle and so we can go on with almost all combustible substances and find that if they burn with a flame as a candle they produce water you may make these experiments yourselves the head of a poker is a very good thing to try with and if it remains cold long enough over the candle you may get water condensed in drops on it or a spoon or ladle or anything else may be used provided it be clean and can carry off the heat and so condense the water  and nowto go into the history of this wonderful production of water from combustibles and by combustioni must first of all tell you that this water may exist in different conditions and although you may now be acquainted with all its forms they still require us to give a little attention to them for the present so that we may perceive how the water whilst it goes through its protean changes is entirely and absolutely the same thing whether it is produced from a candle by combustion or from the rivers or ocean  first of all water when at the coldest is ice now we philosophersi hope that i may class you and myself together in this casespeak of water as water whether it be in its solid or liquid or gaseous statewe speak of it chemically as water water is a thing compounded of two substances one of which we have derived from the candle and the other we shall find elsewhere water may occur as ice and you have had most excellent opportunities lately of seeing this ice changes back into waterfor we had on our last sabbath a strong instance of this change by the sad catastrophe which occurred in our own house as well as in the houses of many of our friendsice changes back into water when the temperature is raised water also changes into steam when it is warmed enough the water which we have here before us is in its densest state11 and although it changes in weight in condition in form and in many other qualities it still is water and whether we alter it into ice by cooling or whether we change it into steam by heat it increases in volumein the one case very strangely and powerfully and in the other case very largely and wonderfully for instance i will now take this tin cylinder and pour a little water into it and seeing how much water i pour in you may easily estimate for yourselves how high it will rise in the vessel it will cover the bottom about two inches i am now about to convert the water into steam for the purpose of shewing to you the different volumes which water occupies in its different states of water and steam  let us now take the case of water changing into ice we can effect that by cooling it in a mixture of salt and pounded ice12 and i shall do so to shew you the expansion of water into a thing of larger bulk when it is so changed these bottles holding one are made of strong cast iron very strong and very thicki suppose they are the third of an inch in thickness they are very carefully filled with water so as to exclude all air and then they are screwed down tight we shall see that when we freeze the water in these iron vessels they will not be able to hold the ice and the expansion within them will break them in pieces as these pointing to some fragments are broken which have been bottles of exactly the same kind i am about to put these two bottles into that mixture of ice and salt for the purpose of shewing that when water becomes ice it changes in volume in this extraordinary way  in the mean time look at the change which has taken place in the water to which we have applied heatit is losing its fluid state you may tell this by two or three circumstances i have covered the mouth of this glass flask in which water is boiling with a watchglass do you see what happens it rattles away like a valve chattering because the steam rising from the boiling water sends the valve up and down and forces itself out and so makes it clatter you can very easily perceive that the flask is quite full of steam or else it would not force its way out you see also that the flask contains a substance very much larger than the water for it fills the whole of the flask over and over again and there it is blowing away into the air and yet you cannot observe any great diminution in the bulk of the water which shews you that its change of bulk is very great when it becomes steam  i have put our iron bottles containing water into this freezing mixture that you may see what happens no communication will take place you observe between the water in the bottles and the ice in the outer vessel but there will be a conveyance of heat from the one to the other and if we are successfulwe are making our experiment in very great hastei expect you will byandby so soon as the cold has taken possession of the bottles and their contents hear a pop on the occasion of the bursting of the one bottle or the other and when we come to examine the bottles we shall find their contents masses of ice partly enclosed by the covering of iron which is too small for them because the ice is larger in bulk than the water you know very well that ice floats upon water if a boy falls through a hole into the water he tries to get on the ice again to float him up why does the ice floatthink of that and philosophise because the ice is larger than the quantity of water which can produce it and therefore the ice weighs the lighter and the water is the heavier  to return now to the action of heat on water see what a stream of vapour is issuing from this tin vessel you observe we must have made it quite full of steam to have it sent out in that great quantity and now as we can convert the water into steam by heat we convert it back into liquid water by the application of cold and if we take a glass or any other cold thing and hold it over this steam see how soon it gets damp with water it will condense it until the glass is warmit condenses the water which is now running down the sides of it  i have here another experiment to shew the condensation of water from a vaporous state back into a liquid state in the same way as the vapour one of the products of the candle was condensed against the bottom of the dish and obtained in the form of water and to shew you how truly and thoroughly these changes take place i will take this tin flask which is now full of steam and close the top we shall see what takes place when we cause this water or steam to return back to the fluid state by pouring some cold water on the outside the lecturer poured the cold water over the vessel when it immediately collapsed  you see what has happened  if i had closed the stopper and still kept the heat applied to it it would have burst the vessel yet when the steam returns to the state of water the vessel collapses there being a vacuum produced inside by the condensation of the steam i shew you these experiments for the purpose of pointing out that in all these occurrences there is nothing that changes the water into any other thingit still remains water and so the vessel is obliged to give way and is crushed inwards as in the other case by the further application of heat it would have been blown outwards  illustration fig 12  and what do you think the bulk of that water is when it assumes the vaporous condition you see that cube pointing to a cubic foot there by its side is a cubic inch exactly the same shape as the cubic foot and that bulk of water the cubic inch is sufficient to expand into that bulk the cubic foot of steam and on the contrary the application of cold will contract that large quantity of steam into this small quantity of water  illustration fig 13  one of the iron bottles burst at that moment ah there is one of our bottles burst and here you see is a crack down one side an eighth of an inch in width the other now exploded sending the freezing mixture in all directions this other bottle is also broken although the iron was nearly halfaninch thick the ice has burst it asunder these changes always take place in water they do not require to be always produced by artificial meanswe only use them here because we want to produce a small winter round that little bottle instead of a long and severe one but if you go to canada or to the north you will find the temperature there out of doors will do the same thing as has been done here by the freezing mixture  to return to our quiet philosophy we shall not in future be deceived therefore by any changes that are produced in water water is the same everywhere whether produced from the ocean or from the flame of the candle where then is this water which we get from a candle i must anticipate a little and tell you it evidently comes as to part of it from the candle but is it within the candle beforehand no it is not in the candle and it is not in the air round about the candle which is necessary for its combustion it is neither in one nor the other but it comes from their conjoint action a part from the candle a part from the air and this we have now to trace so that we may understand thoroughly what is the chemical history of a candle when we have it burning on our table how shall we get at this i myself know plenty of ways but i want you to get at it from the association in your own minds of what i have already told you  i think you can see a little in this way we had just now the case of a substance which acted upon the water in the way that sir humphrey davy shewed us13 and which i am now going to recall to your minds by making again an experiment upon that dish it is a thing which we have to handle very carefully for you see if i allow a little splash of water to come upon this mass it sets fire to part of it and if there were free access of air it would quickly set fire to the whole now this is a metala beautiful and bright metalwhich rapidly changes in the air and as you know rapidly changes in water i will put a piece on the water and you see it burns beautifully making a floating lamp using the water in the place of air again if we take a few iron filings or turnings and put them in water we find that they likewise undergo an alteration they do not change so much as this potassium does but they change somewhat in the same way they become rusty and shew an action upon the water though in a different degree of intensity to what this beautiful metal does but they act upon the water in the same manner generally as this potassium i want you to put these different facts together in your minds i have another metal here zinc and when we examined it with regard to the solid substance produced by its combustion we had an opportunity of seeing that it burned and i suppose if i take a little strip of this zinc and put it over the candle you will see something halfway as it were between the combustion of potassium on the water and the action of ironyou see there is a sort of combustion it has burned leaving a white ash or residuum and here also we find that the metal has a certain amount of action upon water  by degrees we have learned how to modify the action of these different substances and to make them tell us what we want to know and now first of all i take iron it is a common thing in all chemical reactions where we get any result of this kind to find that it is increased by the action of heat and if we want to examine minutely and carefully the action of bodies one upon another we often have to refer to the action of heat you are aware i believe that ironfilings burn beautifully in the air but i am about to shew you an experiment of this kind because it will impress upon you what i am going to say about iron in its action on water if i take a flame and make it hollowyou know why because i want to get air to it and into it and therefore i make it hollowand then take a few ironfilings and drop them into the flame you see how well they burn that combustion results from the chemical action which is going on when we ignite those particles and so we proceed to consider these different effects and ascertain what iron will do when it meets with water it will tell us the story so beautifully so gradually and regularly that i think it will please you very much  i have here a furnace with a pipe going through it like an iron gunbarrel and i have stuffed that barrel full of bright ironturnings and placed it across the fire to be made redhot we can either send air through the barrel to come in contact with the iron or we can send steam from this little boiler at the end of the barrel here is a stopcock which shuts off the steam from the barrel until we wish to admit it there is some water in these glass jars which i have coloured blue so that you may see what happens now you know very well that any steam i might send through that barrel if it went through into the water would be condensed for you have seen that steam cannot retain its gaseous form if it be cooled down  illustration fig 14  you saw it here pointing to the tin flask crushing itself into a small bulk and causing the flask holding it to collapse so that if i were to send steam through that barrel it would be condensedsupposing the barrel were cold it is therefore heated to perform the experiment i am now about to shew you i am going to send the steam through the barrel in small quantities and you shall judge for yourselves when you see it issue from the other end whether it still remains steam steam is condensible into water and when you lower the temperature of steam you convert it back into fluid water but i have lowered the temperature of the gas which i have collected in this jar by passing it through water after it has traversed the iron barrel and still it does not change back into water i will take another test and apply to this gas i hold the jar in an inverted position or my substance would escape if i now apply a light to the mouth of the jar it ignites with a slight noise that tells you that it is not steam steam puts out a fireit does not burn but you saw that what i had in that jar burnt we may obtain this substance equally from water produced from the candleflame as from any other source when it is obtained by the action of the iron upon the aqueous vapour it leaves the iron in a state very similar to that in which these filings were after they were burnt it makes the iron heavier than it was before so long as the iron remains in the tube and is heated and is cooled again without the access of air or water it does not change in its weight but after having had this current of steam passed over it it then comes out heavier that it was before having taken something out of the steam and having allowed something else to pass forth which we see here and now as we have another jar full i will shew you something most interesting it is a combustible gas and i might at once take this jar and set fire to the contents and shew you that it is combustible but i intend to shew you more if i can it is also a very light substance steam will condense this body will rise in the air and not condense  illustration fig 15  suppose i take another glass jar empty of all but air if i examine it with a taper i shall find that it contains nothing but air i will now take this jar full of the gas that i am speaking of and deal with it as though it were a light body i will hold both upsidedown and turn the one up under the other and that which did contain the gas procured from the steam what does it contain now you will find it now only contains air but look here is the combustible substance taking the other jar which i have poured out of the one jar into the other it still preserves its quality and condition and independence and therefore is the more worthy of our consideration as belonging to the products of a candle  now this substance which we have just prepared by the action of iron on the steam or water we can also get by means of those other things which you have already seen act so well upon the water if i take a piece of potassium and make the necessary arrangements it will produce this gas and if instead a piece of zinc i find when i come to examine it very carefully that the main reason why this zinc cannot act upon the water continuously as the other metal does is because the result of the action of the water envelopes the zinc in a kind of protecting coat we have learned in consequence that if we put into our vessel only the zinc and water they by themselves do not give rise to much action and we get no result but suppose i proceed to dissolve off this varnishthis encumbering substancewhich i can do by a little acid the moment i do this i find the zinc acting upon the water exactly as the iron did but at the common temperature the acid in no way is altered except in its combination with the oxide of zinc which is produced i have now poured the acid into the glass and the effect is as though i were applying heat to cause this boiling up there is something coming off from the zinc very abundantly which is not steam there is a jar full of it and you will find that i have exactly the same combustible substance remaining in the vessel when i hold it upsidedown that i produced during the experiment with the iron barrel this is what we get from waterthe same substance which is contained in the candle  illustration fig 16  let us now trace distinctly the connection between these two points this is hydrogena body classed among those things which in chemistry we call elements because we can get nothing else out of them a candle is not an elementary body because we can get carbon out of it we can get this hydrogen out of it or at least out of the water which it supplies and this gas has been so named hydrogen because it is that element which in association with another generates water footnote greek hudos water and greek gennao i generate mr anderson having now been able to get two or three jars of gas we shall have a few experiments to make and i want to shew you the best way of making these experiments i am not afraid to shew you for i wish you to make experiments if you will only make them with care and attention and the assent of those around you as we advance in chemistry we are obliged to deal with substances which are rather injurious if in their wrong placesthe acids and heat and combustible things we use might do harm if carelessly employed if you want to make hydrogen you can make it easily from bits of zinc and sulphuric or muriatic acid here is what in former times was called the philosophers candle it is a little phial with a cork and a tube or pipe passing through it  illustration fig 17  and i am now putting a few little pieces of zinc into it this little instrument i am going to apply to a useful purpose in our demonstrationsfor i want to shew you that you can prepare hydrogen and make some experiments with it as you please at your own homes let me here tell you why i am so careful to fill this phial nearly and yet not quite full i do it because the evolved gas which as you have seen is very combustible is explosive to a considerable extent when mixed with air and might lead to harm if you were to apply a light to the end of that pipe before all the air had been swept out of the space above the water i am now about to pour in the sulphuric acid i have used very little zinc and more sulphuric acid and water because i want to keep it at work for some time i therefore take care in this way to modify the proportions of the ingredients so that i may have a regular supplynot too quick and not too slow supposing i now take a glass and put it upsidedown over the end of the tube because the hydrogen is light i expect that it will remain in that vessel a little while we will now test the contents of our glass to see if there be hydrogen in it i think i am safe in saying we have caught some applying a light there it is you see i will now apply a light to the top of the tube there is the hydrogen burning there is our philosophical candle it is a foolish feeble sort of a flame you may say but it is so hot that scarcely any common flame gives out so much heat it goes on burning regularly and i am now about to put that flame to burn under a certain arrangement in order that we may examine its results and make use of the information which we may thereby acquire inasmuch as the candle produces water and this gas comes out of the water let us see what this gives us by the same process of combustion that the candle went through when it burnt in the atmosphere and for that purpose i am going to put the lamp under this apparatus in order to condense whatever may arise from the combustion within it in the course of a short time you will see moisture appearing in the cylinder and you will get the water running down the side and the water from this hydrogen flame will have absolutely the same effect upon all our tests being obtained by the same general process as in the former case this hydrogen is a very beautiful substance it is so light that it carries things up it is far lighter than the atmosphere and i dare say i can shew you this by an experiment which if you are very clever some of you may even have skill enough to repeat here is our generator of hydrogen and here are some soapsuds i have an indiarubber tube connected with the hydrogen generator and at the end of the tube is a tobaccopipe  illustration fig 18  i can thus put the pipe into the suds and blow bubbles by means of the hydrogen you observe how the bubbles fall downwards when i blow them with my warm breath but notice the difference when i blow them with hydrogen the lecturer here blew bubbles with hydrogen which rose to the roof of the theatre it shews you how light this gas must be in order to carry with it not merely the ordinary soapbubble but the larger portion of a drop hanging to the bottom of it i can shew its lightness in a better way than this larger bubbles than these may be so lifted up indeed in former times balloons used to be filled with this gas mr anderson will fasten this tube on to our generator and we shall have a stream of hydrogen here with which we can charge this balloon made of collodion i need not even be very careful to get all the air out for i know the power of this gas to carry it up two collodion balloons were inflated and sent up one being held by a string here is another larger one made of thin membrane which we will fill and allow to ascend you will see they will all remain floating about until the gas escapes  what then are the comparative weights of these substances i have a table here which will shew you the proportion which their weights bear to each other i have taken a pint and a cubic foot as the measures and have placed opposite to them the respective figures a pint measure of this hydrogen weighs threequarters of our smallest weight a grain and a cubic foot weighs onetwelfth of an ounce whereas a pint of water weighs 8750 grains and a cubic foot of water weighs almost 1000 ounces you see therefore what a vast difference there is between the weight of a cubic foot of water and a cubic foot of hydrogen  hydrogen gives rise to no substance that can become solid either during combustion or afterwards as a product of its combustion but when it burns it produces water only and if we take a cold glass and put it over the flame it becomes damp and you have water produced immediately in appreciable quantity and nothing is produced by its combustion but the same water which you have seen the flame of the candle produce it is important to remember that this hydrogen is the only thing in nature which furnishes water as the sole product of combustion  and now we must endeavour to find some additional proof of the general character and composition of water and for this purpose i will keep you a little longer so that at our next meeting we may be better prepared for the subject we have the power of arranging the zinc which you have seen acting upon the water by the assistance of an acid in such a manner as to cause all the power to be evolved in the place where we require it i have behind me a voltaic pile and i am just about to shew you at the end of this lecture its character and power that you may see what we shall have to deal with when next we meet i hold here the extremities of the wires which transport the power from behind me and which i shall cause to act on the water  we have previously seen what a power of combustion is possessed by the potassium or the zinc or the ironfilings but none of them shew such energy as this the lecturer here made contact between the two terminal wires of the battery when a brilliant flash of light was produced this light is in fact produced by a fortyzinc power of burning it is a power that i can carry about in my hands through these wires at pleasurealthough if i applied it wrongly to myself it would destroy me in an instant for it is a most intense thing and the power you see here put forth while you count five bringing the poles in contact and exhibiting the electric light is equivalent to the power of several thunderstorms so great is its force14 and that you may see what intense energy it has i will take the ends of the wires which convey the power from the battery and with it i dare say i can burn this iron file now this is a chemical power and one which when we next meet i shall apply to water and shew you what results we are able to produce     lecture iv  hydrogen in the candleburns into waterthe other part of wateroxygen  i see you are not tired of the candle yet or i am sure you would not be interested in the subject in the way you are when our candle was burning we found it produced water exactly like the water we have around us and by further examination of this water we found in it that curious body hydrogenthat light substance of which there is some in this jar we afterwards saw the burning powers of that hydrogen and that it produced water and i think i introduced to your notice an apparatus which i very briefly said was an arrangement of chemical force or power or energy so adjusted as to convey its power to us in these wires and i said i should use that force to pull the water to pieces to see what else there was in the water besides hydrogen because you remember when we passed the water through the iron tube we by no means got the weight of water back which we put in in the form of steam though we had a very large quantity of gas evolved we have now to see what is the other substance present that you may understand the character and use of this instrument let us make an experiment or two let us put together first of all some substances knowing what they are and then see what that instrument does to them there is some copper observe the various changes which it can undergo and here is some nitric acid and you will find that this being a strong chemical agent will act very powerfully when i add it to the copper it is now sending forth a beautiful red vapour but as we do not want that vapour mr anderson will hold it near the chimney for a short time that we may have the use and beauty of the experiment without the annoyance the copper which i have put into the flask will dissolve it will change the acid and the water into a blue fluid containing copper and other things and i propose then shewing you how this voltaic battery deals with it and in the meantime we will arrange another kind of experiment for you to see what power it has this is a substance which is to us like waterthat is to say it contains bodies which we do not know of as yet as water contains a body which we do not know as yet now this solution of a salt15 i will put upon paper and spread about and apply the power of the battery to it and observe what will happen three or four important things will happen which we shall take advantage of i place this wetted paper upon a sheet of tinfoil which is convenient for keeping all clean and also for the advantageous application of the power and this solution you see is not at all affected by being put upon the paper or tinfoil nor by anything else i have brought in contact with it yet and which therefore is free to us to use as regards that instrument but first let us see that our instrument is in order here are our wires let us see whether it is in the state in which it was last time we can soon tell as yet when i bring them together we have no power because the conveyerswhat we call the electrodesthe passages or ways for the electricityare stopped but now mr anderson by that referring to a sudden flash at the ends of the wires has given me a telegram to say that it is ready before i begin our experiment i will get mr anderson to break contact again at the battery behind me and we will put a platinumwire across to connect the poles and then if i find i can ignite a pretty good length of this wire we shall be safe in our experiment now you will see the power the connection was established and the intermediate wire became redhot there is the power running beautifully through the wire which i have made thin on purpose to shew you that we have those powerful forces and now having that power we will proceed with it to the examination of water  i have here two pieces of platinum and if i lay them down upon this piece of paper the moistened paper on the tinfoil you will see no action and if i take them up there is no change that you can see but the arrangement remains just as it was before but now see what happens if i take these two poles and put either one or the other of them down separately on the platinumplates they do nothing for me both are perfectly without action but if i let them both be in contact at the same moment see what happens a brown spot appeared under each pole of the battery look here at the effect that takes place and see how i have pulled something apart from the whitesomething brown and i have no doubt if i were to arrange it thus and were to put one of the poles to the tinfoil on the other side of the paperwhy i get such a beautiful action upon the paper that i am going to see whether i cannot write with ita telegram if you please the lecturer here traced the word juvenile on the paper with one of the terminal wires see there how beautifully we can get our results  you see we have here drawn something which we have not known about before out of this solution let us now take that flask from mr andersens hands and see what we can draw out of that this you know is a liquid which we have just made up from copper and nitric acid whilst our other experiments were in hand and though i am making this experiment very hastily and may bungle a little yet i prefer to let you see what i do rather than prepare it beforehand  now see what happens these two platinumplates are the two ends or i will make them so immediately of this apparatus and i am about to put them in contact with that solution just as we did a moment ago on the paper it does not matter to us whether the solution be on the paper or whether it be in the jar so long as we bring the ends of the apparatus to it if i put the two platinums in by themselves they come out as clean and as white as they go in inserting them into the fluid without connecting them with the battery but when we take the power and lay that on the platinums were connected with the battery and again dipped into the solution this you see exhibiting one of the platinums is at once turned into copper as it were it has become like a plate of copper and that exhibiting the other piece of platinum has come out quite clean if i take this coppered piece and change sides the copper will leave the righthand side and come over to the left side what was before the coppered plate comes out clean and the plate which was clean comes out coated with copper and thus you see that the same copper we put into this solution we can also take out of it by means of this instrument  putting that solution aside let us now see what effect this instrument will have upon water here are two little platinumplates which i intend to make the ends of the battery and this c is a little vessel so shaped as to enable me to take it to pieces and shew you its construction in these two cups a and b i pour mercury which touches the ends of the wires connected with the platinumplates in the vessel c i pour some water containing a little acid but which is put only for the purpose of facilitating the action it undergoes no change in the process and connected with the top of the vessel is a bent glass tube d which may remind you of the pipe which was connected with the gun barrel in our furnace experiment and which now passes under the jar f  i have now adjusted this apparatus and we will proceed to affect the water in some way or other in the other case i sent the water through a tube which was made redhot i am now going to pass the electricity through the contents of this vessel  perhaps i may boil the water if i do boil the water i shall get steam and you know that steam condenses when it gets cold and you will therefore see by that whether i do boil the water or not perhaps however i shall not boil the water but produce some other effect  you shall have the experiment and see there is one wire which i will put to this side a and here is the other wire which i will put to the other side b and you will soon see whether any disturbance takes place here it is seeming to boil up famously but does it boil let us see whether that which goes out is steam or not i think you will soon see the jar f will be filled with vapour if that which rises from the water is steam but can it be steam why certainly not because there it remains you see unchanged  there it is standing over the water and it cannot therefore be steam but must be a permanent gas of some sort what is it is it hydrogen is it anything else well we will examine it if it is hydrogen it will burn the lecturer then ignited a portion of the gas collected which burnt with an explosion  illustration fig 19  it is certainly something combustible but not combustible in the way that hydrogen is hydrogen would not have given you that noise but the colour of that light when the thing did burn was like that of hydrogen it will however burn without contact with the air that is why i have chosen this other form of apparatus for the purpose of pointing out to you what are the particular circumstances of this experiment in place of an open vessel i have taken one that is closed our battery is so beautifully active that we are even boiling the mercury and getting all things rightnot wrong but vigorously right and i am going to shew you that that gas whatever it may be can burn without air and in that respect differs from a candle which cannot burn without the air and our manner of doing this is as followsi have here a glass vessel g which is fitted with two platinumwires ik through which i can apply electricity and we can put the vessel on the airpump and exhaust the air and when we have taken the air out we can bring it here and fasten it on to this jar f and let into the vessel that gas which was formed by the action of the voltaic battery upon the water and which we have produced by changing the water into itfor i may go as far as this and say we have really by that experiment changed the water into that gas we have not only altered its condition but we have changed it really and truly into that gaseous substance and all the water is there which was decomposed by the experiment as i screw this vessel gh on here h and make the tubes well connected and when i open the stopcocks hhh if you watch the level of the water in f you will see that the gas will rise i will now close the stopcocks as i have drawn up as much as the vessel can hold and being safely conveyed into that chamber i will pass into it an electric spark from this leyden jar l when the vessel which is now quite clear and bright will become dim there will be no sound for the vessel is strong enough to confine the explosion a spark was then passed through the jar when the explosive mixture was ignited did you see that brilliant light if i again screw the vessel on to the jar and open these stopcocks you will see that the gas will rise a second time the stopcocks were then opened those gases referring to the gases first collected in the jar and which had just been ignited by the electric spark have disappeared as you see their place is vacant and fresh gas has gone in water has been formed from them and if we repeat our operation repeating the last experiment i shall have another vacancy as you will see by the water rising i always have an empty vessel after the explosion because the vapour or gas into which that water has been resolved by the battery explodes under the influence of the spark and changes into water and byandby you will see in this upper vessel some drops of water trickling down the sides and collecting at the bottom  we are here dealing with water entirely without reference to the atmosphere the water of the candle had the atmosphere helping to produce it but in this way it can be produced independently of the air water therefore ought to contain that other substance which the candle takes from the air and which combining with the hydrogen produces water  just now you saw that one end of this battery took hold of the copper extracting it from the vessel which contained the blue solution it was effected by this wire and surely we may say if the battery has such power with a metallic solution which we made and unmade may we not find that it is possible to split asunder the component parts of the water and put them into this place and that place suppose i take the polesthe metallic ends of this batteryand see what will happen with the water in this apparatus fig 20 where we have separated the two ends far apart  illustration fig 20  i place one here at a and the other there at b and i have little shelves with holes which i can put upon each pole and so arrange them that whatever escapes from the two ends of the battery will appear as separate gases for you saw that the water did not become vaporous but gaseous the wires are now in perfect and proper connection with the vessel containing the water and you see the bubbles rising let us collect these bubbles and see what they are here is a glass cylinder o i fill it with water and put it over one end a of the pile and i will take another h and put it over the other end b of the pile and so now we have a double apparatus with both places delivering gas  both these jars will fill with gas there they go that to the right h filling very rapidly the one to the left o filling not so rapidly and though i have allowed some bubbles to escape yet still the action is going on pretty regularly and were it not that one is rather smaller than the other you would see that i should have twice as much in this h as i have in that o  both these gases are colourless they stand over the water without condensing they are alike in all thingsi mean in all apparent things and we have here an opportunity of examining these bodies and ascertaining what they are their bulk is large and we can easily apply experiments to them i will take this jar h first and will ask you to be prepared to recognise hydrogen  think of all its qualitiesthe light gas which stood well in inverted vessels burning with a pale flame at the mouth of the jarand see whether this gas does not satisfy all these conditions if it be hydrogen it will remain here while i hold this jar inverted  a light was then applied when the hydrogen burnt what is there now in the other jar  you know that the two together made an explosive mixture  but what can this be which we find as the other constituent in water and which must therefore be that substance which made the hydrogen burn we know that the water we put into the vessel consisted of the two things together we find one of these is hydrogen what must that other be which was in the water before the experiment and which we now have by itself  i am about to put this lighted splinter of wood into the gas  the gas itself will not burn but it will make the splinter of wood burn  the lecturer ignited the end of the wood and introduced it into the jar of gas  see how it invigorates the combustion of the wood and how it makes it burn far better than the air would make it burn and now you see by itself that every other substance which is contained in the water and which when the water was formed by the burning of the candle must have been taken from the atmosphere what shall we call it a b or c let us call it ocall it oxygen it is a very good distinctsounding name this then is the oxygen which was present in the water forming so large a part of it  we shall now begin to understand more clearly our experiments and researches because when we have examined these things once or twice we shall soon see why a candle burns in the air when we have in this way analysed the waterthat is to say separated or electrolysed its parts out of itwe get two volumes of hydrogen and one of the body that burns it and these two are represented to us on the following diagram with their weights also stated and we shall find that the oxygen is a very heavy body by comparison with the hydrogen it is the other element in water  i had better perhaps tell you now how we get this oxygen abundantly having shewn you how we can separate it from the water oxygen as you will immediately imagine exists in the atmosphere for how should the candle burn to produce water without it                              1         8                                      oxygen  oxygen      889                                  hydrogen     111  hydrogen                                            9      water     1000                                       such a thing would be absolutely impossible and chemically impossible without oxygen  illustration fig 21  can we get it from the air well there are some very complicated and difficult processes by which we can get it from the air but we have better processes there is a substance called the black oxide of manganese it is a very blacklooking mineral but very useful and when made redhot it gives out oxygen here is an iron bottle which has had some of this substance put into it and there is a tube fixed to it and a fire ready made and mr anderson will put that retort into the fire for it is made of iron and can stand the heat here is a salt called chlorate of potassa which is now made in large quantities for bleaching and chemical and medical uses and for pyrotechnic and other purposes i will take some and mix it with some of the oxide of manganese oxide of copper or oxide of iron would do as well and if i put these together in a retort far less than a red heat is sufficient to evolve this oxygen from the mixture i am not preparing to make much because we only want sufficient for our experiments only as you will see immediately if i use too small a charge the first portion of the gas will be mixed with the air already in the retort and i should be obliged to sacrifice the first portion of the gas because it would be so much diluted with air the first portion must therefore be thrown away you will find in this case that a common spiritlamp is quite sufficient for me to get the oxygen and so we shall have two processes going on for its preparation see how freely the gas is coming over from that small portion of the mixture we will examine it and see what are its properties now in this way we are producing as you will observe a gas just like the one we had in the experiment with the battery transparent undissolved by water and presenting the ordinary visible properties of the atmosphere as this first jar contains the air together with the first portions of the oxygen set free during the preparation we will carry it out of the way and be prepared to make our experiments in a regular dignified manner and inasmuch as that power of making wood wax or other things burn was so marked in the oxygen we obtained by means of the voltaic battery from water we may expect to find the same property here we will try it you see there is the combustion of a lighted taper in air and here is its combustion in this gas lowering the taper into the jar see how brightly and how beautifully it burns you can also see more than thisyou will perceive it is a heavy gas whilst the hydrogen would go up like a balloon or even faster than a balloon when not encumbered with the weight of the envelope  illustration fig 22  you may easily see that although we obtained from water twice as much in volume of the hydrogen as of oxygen it does not follow that we have twice as much in weightbecause one is heavy and the other a very light gas we have means of weighing gases or air but without stopping to explain that let me just tell you what their respective weights are the weight of a pint of hydrogen is threequarters of a grain the weight of the same quantity of oxygen is nearly twelve grains this is a very great difference the weight of a cubit foot of hydrogen is onetwelfth of an ounce and the weight of a cubit foot of oxygen is one ounce and a third and so on we might come to masses of matter which may be weighed in the balance and which we can take account of as to hundredweights and as to tons as you will see almost immediately  now as regards this very property of oxygen supporting combustion which we may compare to air i will take a piece of candle to shew it you in a rough way and the result will be rough there is our candle burning in the air how will it burn in oxygen i have here a jar of this gas and i am about to put it over the candle for you to compare the action of this gas with that of the air why look at it it looks something like the light you saw at the poles of the voltaic battery think how vigorous that action must be and yet during all that action nothing more is produced than what is produced by the burning of the candle in air we have the same production of water and the same phenomena exactly when we use this gas instead of air as we have when the candle is burnt in air  but now we have got a knowledge of this new substance we can look at it a little more distinctly in order to satisfy ourselves that we have got a good general understanding of this part of the product of a candle it is wonderful how great the supporting powers of this substance are as regards combustion for instance here is a lamp which simple though it be is the original i may say of a great variety of lamps which are constructed for divers purposesfor lighthouses microscopic illuminations and other uses and if it were proposed to make it burn very brightly you would say if a candle burnt better in oxygen will not a lamp do the same why it will do so mr anderson will give me a tube coming from our oxygen reservoir and i am about to apply it to this flame which i will previously make burn badly on purpose there comes the oxygen what a combustion that makes but if i shut it off what becomes of the lamp the flow of oxygen was stopped and the lamp relapsed to its former dimness it is wonderful how by means of oxygen we get combustion accelerated but it does not affect merely the combustion of hydrogen or carbon or the candle but it exalts all combustions of the common kind we will take one which relates to iron for instance as you have already seen iron burn a little in the atmosphere here is a jar of oxygen and this is a piece of iron wire but if it were a bar as thick as my wrist it would burn the same  illustration fig 23  i first attach a little piece of wood to the iron i then set the wood on fire and let them both down together into the jar the wood is now alight and there it burns as wood should burn in oxygen but it will soon communicate its combustion to the iron the iron is now burning brilliantly and will continue so for a long time as long as we supply oxygen so long can we carry on the combustion of the iron until the latter is consumed  we will now put that on one side and take some other substance but we must limit our experiments for we have not time to spare for all the illustrations you would have a right to if we had more time we will take a piece of sulphuryou know how sulphur burns in the airwell we put it into the oxygen and you will see that whatever can burn in air can burn with a far greater intensity in oxygen leading you to think that perhaps the atmosphere itself owes all its power of combustion to this gas the sulphur is now burning very quietly in the oxygen but you cannot for a moment mistake the very high and increased action which takes place when it is so burnt instead of being burnt merely in common air  illustration fig 24  i am now about to shew you the combustion of another substancephosphorus i can do it better for you here than you can do it at home this is a very combustible substance and if it be so combustible in air what might you expect it would be in oxygen i am about to shew it to you not in its fullest intensity for if i did so we should almost blow the apparatus upi may even now crack the jar though i do not want to break things carelessly you see how it burns in the air but what a glorious light it gives out when i introduce it into oxygen introducing the lighted phosphorus into the jar of oxygen there you see the solid particles going off which cause that combustion to be so brilliantly luminous  thus far we have tested this power of oxygen and the high combustion it produces by means of other substances we must now for a little while longer look at it as respects the hydrogen you know when we allowed the oxygen and the hydrogen derived from the water to mix and burn together we had a little explosion you remember also that when i burnt the oxygen and the hydrogen in a jet together we got very little light but great heat i am now about to set fire to oxygen and hydrogen mixed in the proportion in which they occur in water here is a vessel containing one volume of oxygen and two volumes of hydrogen this mixture is exactly of the same nature as the gas we just now obtained from the voltaic battery it would be far too much to burn at once i have therefore arranged to blow soapbubbles with it and burn those bubbles that we may see by a general experiment or two how this oxygen supports the combustion of the hydrogen first of all we will see whether we can blow a bubble well there goes the gas causing it to issue through a tobaccopipe into some soapsuds here i have a bubble i am receiving them on my hand and you will perhaps think i am acting oddly in this experiment but it is to shew you that we must not always trust to noise and sounds but rather to real facts exploding a bubble on the palm of his hand i am afraid to fire a bubble from the end of the pipe because the explosion would pass up into the jar and blow it to pieces this oxygen then will unite with the hydrogen as you see by the phenomena and hear by the sound with the utmost readiness of action and all its powers are then taken up in its neutralisation of the qualities of the hydrogen  so now i think you will perceive the whole history of water with reference to oxygen and the air from what we have before said why does a piece of potassium decompose water because it finds oxygen in the water what is set free when i put it in the water as i am about to do again it sets free hydrogen and the hydrogen burns but the potassium itself combines with oxygen and this piece of potassium in taking the water apartthe water you may say derived from the combustion of the candletakes away the oxygen which the candle took from the air and so sets the hydrogen free and even if i take a piece of ice and put a piece of potassium upon it the beautiful affinities by which the oxygen and the hydrogen are related are such that the ice will absolutely set fire to the potassium i shew this to you today in order to enlarge your ideas of these things and that you may see how greatly results are modified by circumstances there is the potassium on the ice producing a sort of volcanic action  it will be my place when next we meet having pointed out these anomalous actions to shew you that none of these extra and strange effects are met with by usthat none of these strange and injurious actions take place when we are burning not merely a candle but gas in our streets or fuel in our fireplaces so long as we confine ourselves within the laws that nature has made for our guidance     lecture v  oxygen present in the airnature of the atmosphereits propertiesother products from the candlecarbonic acidits properties   we have now seen that we can produce hydrogen and oxygen from the water that we obtained from the candle hydrogen you know comes from the candle and oxygen you believe comes from the air but then you have a right to ask me how is it that the air and the oxygen do not equally well burn the candle if you remember what happened when i put a jar of oxygen over a piece of candle you recollect there was a very different kind of combustion to that which took place in the air now why is this it is a very important question and one i shall endeavour to make you understand it relates most intimately to the nature of the atmosphere and is most important to us  we have several tests for oxygen besides the mere burning of bodies you have seen a candle burnt in oxygen or in the air you have seen phosphorus burnt in the air or in oxygen and you have seen ironfilings burnt in oxygen but we have other tests besides these and i am about to refer to one or two of them for the purpose of carrying your conviction and your experience further here we have a vessel of oxygen i will shew its presence to you if i take a little spark and put it into that oxygen you know by the experience you gained the last time we met what will happen if i put that spark into the jar it will tell you whether we have oxygen here or not yes we have proved it by combustion and now here is another test for oxygen which is a very curious and useful one i have here two jars full of gas with a plate between them to prevent their mixing i take the plate away and the gases are creeping one into the other what happens say you they together produce no such combustion as was seen in the case of the candle but see how the presence of oxygen is told by its association with this other substance14 what a beautifully coloured gas i have obtained in this way shewing me the presence of the oxygen in the same way we can try this experiment by mixing common air with this testgas here is a jar containing airsuch air as the candle would burn inand here is a jar or bottle containing the testgas i let them come together over water and you see the result the contents of the testbottle are flowing into the jar of air and you see i obtain exactly the same kind of action as before and that shews me that there is oxygen in the airthe very same substance that has been already obtained by us from the water produced by the candle but then beyond that how is it that the candle does not burn in air as well as in oxygen we will come to that point at once i have here two jars they are filled to the same height with gas and the appearance to the eye is alike in both and i really do not know at present which of these jars contains oxygen and which contains air although i know they have previously been filled with these gases but here is our testgas and i am going to work with the two jars in order to examine whether there is any difference between them in the quality of reddening this gas i am now going to turn this testgas into one of the jars and observe what happens there is reddening you see there is then oxygen present we will now test the other jar but you see this is not so distinctly red as the first and further this curious thing happensif i take these two gases and shake them well together with water we shall absorb the red gas and then if i put in more of this testgas and shake again we shall absorb more and i can go on as long as there be any oxygen present to produce that effect if i let in air it will not matter but the moment i introduce water the red gas disappears and i may go on in this way putting in more and more of the testgas until i come to something left behind which will not redden any longer by the use of that particular body that rendered the air and the oxygen red why is that you see in a moment it is because there is besides oxygen something else present which is left behind i will let a little more air into the jar and if it turns red you will know that some of that reddening gas is still present and that consequently it was not for the want of this producing body that that air was left behind  now you will begin to understand what i am about to say you saw that when i burnt phosphorus in a jar as the smoke produced by the phosphorus and the oxygen of the air condensed it left a good deal of gas unburnt just as this red gas left something untouchedthere was in fact this gas left behind which the phosphorus cannot touch which the reddening gas cannot touch and this something is not oxygen and yet is part of the atmosphere  so that is one way of opening out air into the two things of which it is composedoxygen which burns our candles our phosphorus or anything else and this other substancenitrogenwhich will not burn them this other part of the air is by far the larger proportion and it is a very curious body when we come to examine it it is remarkably curious and yet you say perhaps that it is very uninteresting it is uninteresting in some respects because of thisthat it shews no brilliant effects of combustion  if i test it with a taper as i do oxygen and hydrogen it does not burn like hydrogen nor does it make the taper burn like oxygen try it in any way i will it does neither the one thing nor the other it will not take fire it will not let the taper burn it puts out the combustion of everything there is nothing that will burn in it in common circumstances it has no smell it is not sour it does not dissolve in water it is neither an acid nor an alkali it is as indifferent to all our organs as it is possible for a thing to be and you might say it is nothing it is not worth chemical attention what does it do in the air ah then come our beautiful and fine results shewn us by an observant philosophy  suppose in place of having nitrogen or nitrogen and oxygen we had pure oxygen as our atmosphere what would become of us you know very well that a piece of iron lit in a jar of oxygen goes on burning to the end when you see a fire in an iron grate imagine where the grate would go to if the whole of the atmosphere were oxygen the grate would burn up more powerfully than the coalsfor the iron of the grate itself is even more combustible than the coals which we burn in it a fire put into the middle of a locomotive would be a fire in a magazine of fuel if the atmosphere were oxygen the nitrogen lowers it down and makes it moderate and useful for us and then with all that it takes away with it the fumes that you have seen produced from the candle disperses them throughout the whole of the atmosphere and carries them away to places where they are wanted to perform a great and glorious purpose of good to man for the sustenance of vegetation and thus does a most wonderful work although you say on examining it why it is a perfectly indifferent thing this nitrogen in its ordinary state is an inactive element no action short of the most intense electric force and then in the most infinitely small degree can cause the nitrogen to combine directly with the other element of the atmosphere or with other things round about it it is a perfectly indifferent and therefore to say a safe substance  but before i take you to that result i must tell you about the atmosphere itself i have written on this diagram the composition of one hundred parts of atmospheric air                    bulk  weight oxygen        20    223 nitrogen       80    777                                          l00   1000  it is a true analysis of the atmosphere so far as regards the quantity of oxygen and the quantity of nitrogen present by our analysis we find that 5 pints of the atmosphere contain only 1 pint of oxygen and 4 pints or 4 parts of nitrogen by bulk that is our analysis of the atmosphere it requires all that quantity of nitrogen to reduce the oxygen down so as to be able to supply the candle properly with fuel so as to supply us with an atmosphere which our lungs can healthily and safely breathe for it is just as important to make the oxygen right for us to breathe as it is to make the atmosphere right for the burning of the fire and the candle  but now for this atmosphere first of all let me tell you the weight of these gases a pint of nitrogen weighs 10410 grains or a cubic foot weighs 116 ounce that is the weight of the nitrogen the oxygen is heavier a pint of it weighs 11910 grains and a cubic foot weighs 134 ounce a pint of air weighs about 10710 grains and a cubic foot 115 ounce  illustration fig 25  you have asked me several times and i am very glad you have how do you weigh gases i will shew you it is very simple and easily done here is a balance and here a copper bottle made as light as we can consistent with due strength turned very nicely in the lathe and made perfectly airtight with a stopcock which we can open and shut which at present is open and therefore allows the bottle to be full of air i have here a nicelyadjusted balance in which i think the bottle in its present condition will be balanced by the weight on the other side and here is a pump by which we can force the air into this bottle and with it we will force in a certain number of volumes of air as measured by the pump twenty measures were pumped in we will shut that in and put it in the balance see how it sinks it is much heavier than it was by what  by the air that we have forced into it by the pump there is not a greater bulk of air but there is the same bulk of heavier air because we have forced in air upon it and that you may have a fair notion in your mind as to how much this air measures here is a jar full of water we will open that copper vessel into this jar and let the air return to its former state all i have to do now is to screw them tightly together and to turn the taps when there you see is the bulk of the twenty pumps of air which i forced into the bottle and to make sure that we have been quite correct in what we have been doing we will take the bottle again to the balance and if it is now counterpoised by the original weight we shall be quite sure we have made our experiment correctly  illustration fig 26  it is balanced so you see we can find out the weight of the extra volumes of air forced in in that way and by that means we are able to ascertain that a cubic foot of air weighs 115 ounce but that small experiment will by no means convey to your mind the whole literal truth of this matter it is wonderful how it accumulates when you come to larger volumes this bulk of air a cubic foot weighs 115 ounce what do you think of the contents of that box above there which i have had made for the purpose the air which is within that box weighs one pounda full pound and i have calculated the weight of the air in this roomyou would hardly imagine it but it is above a ton so rapidly do the weights rise up and so important is the presence of the atmosphere and of the oxygen and the nitrogen in it and the use it performs in conveying things to and fro from place to place and carrying bad vapours to places where they will do good instead of harm  having given you that little illustration with respect to the weight of the air let me shew you certain consequences of it you have a right to them because you would not understand so much without it do you remember this kind of experiment have you ever seen it suppose i take a pump somewhat similar to the one i had a little while ago to force air into the bottle and suppose i place it in such a manner that by certain arrangements i can apply my hand to it my hand moves about in the air so easily that it seems to feel nothing and i can hardly get velocity enough by any motion of my own in the atmosphere to make sure that there is much resistance to it  illustration fig 27  but when i put my hand here on the airpump receiver which was afterwards exhausted you see what happens why is my hand fastened to this place and why am i able to pull this pump about and see how is it that i can hardly get my hand away why is this it is the weight of the airthe weight of the air that is above i have another experiment here which i think will explain to you more about it when the air is pumped from underneath the bladder which is stretched over this glass you will see the effect in another shape the top is quite flat at present but i will make a very little motion with the pump and now look at itsee how it has gone down see how it is bent in you will see the bladder go in more and more until at last i expect it will be driven in and broken by the force of the atmosphere pressing upon it  illustration fig 28  the bladder at last broke with a loud report now that was done entirely by the weight of the air pressing on it and you can easily understand how that is the particles that are piled up in the atmosphere stand upon each other as these five cubes do you can easily conceive that four of these five cubes are resting upon the bottom one and if i take that away the others will all sink down so it is with the atmosphere the air that is above is sustained by the air that is beneath and when the air is pumped away from beneath them the change occurs which you saw when i placed my hand on the airpump and which you saw in the case of the bladder and which you shall see better here i have tied over this jar a piece of sheet indiarubber and i am now about to take away the air from the inside of the jar and if you will watch the indiarubberwhich acts as a partition between the air below and the air aboveyou will see when i pump how the pressure shews itself see where it is going toi can actually put my hand into the jar and yet this result is only caused by the great and powerful action of the air above how beautifully it shews this curious circumstance  here is something that you can have a pull at when i have finished today it is a little apparatus of two hollow brass hemispheres closely fitted together and having connected with it a pipe and a cock through which we can exhaust the air from the inside and although the two halves are so easily taken apart while the air is left within yet you will see when we exhaust it byandby no power of any two of you will be able to pull them apart every square inch of surface that is contained in the area of that vessel sustains fifteen pounds by weight or nearly so when the air is taken out and you may try your strength presently in seeing whether you can overcome that pressure of the atmosphere  here is another very pretty thingthe boys sucker only refined by the philosopher we young ones have a perfect right to take toys and make them into philosophy inasmuch as nowadays we are turning philosophy into toys here is a sucker only it is made of indiarubber if i clap it upon the table you see at once it holds why does it hold i can slip it about and yet if i try to pull it up it seems as if it would pull the table with it i can easily make it slip about from place to place but only when i bring it to the edge of the table can i get it off it is only kept down by the pressure of the atmosphere above we have a couple of them and if you take these two and press them together you will see how firmly they stick and indeed we may use them as they are proposed to be used to stick against windows or against walls where they will adhere for an evening and serve to hang anything on that you want i think however that you boys ought to be shewn experiments that you can make at home and so here is a very pretty experiment in illustration of the pressure of the atmosphere here is a tumbler of water suppose i were to ask you to turn that tumbler upsidedown so that the water should not fall out and yet not be kept in by your hand but merely by using the pressure of the atmosphere could you do that take a wineglass either quite full or halffull of water and put a flat card on the top turn it upsidedown and then see what becomes of the card and of the water the air cannot get in because the water by its capillary attraction round the edge keeps it out  i think this will give you a correct notion of what you may call the materiality of the air and when i tell you that the box holds a pound of it and this room more than a ton you will begin to think that air is something very serious i will make another experiment to convince you of this positive resistance there is that beautiful experiment of the popgun made so well and so easily you know out of a quill or a tube or anything of that kindwhere we take a slice of potato for instance or an apple and take the tube and cut out a pellet as i have now done and push it to one end i have made that end tight and now i take another piece and put it in it will confine the air that is within the tube perfectly and completely for our purpose and i shall now find it absolutely impossible by any force of mine to drive that little pellet close up to the other it cannot be done i may press the air to a certain extent but if i go on pressing long before it comes to the second the confined air will drive the front one out with a force something like that of gunpowder for gunpowder is in part dependent upon the same action that you see here exemplified  i saw the other day an experiment which pleased me much as i thought it would serve our purpose here i ought to have held my tongue for four or five minutes before beginning this experiment because it depends upon my lungs for success by the proper application of air i expect to be able to drive this egg out of one cup into the other by the force of my breath but if i fail it is in a good cause and i do not promise success because i have been talking more than i ought to do to make the experiment succeed  the lecturer here tried the experiment and succeeded in blowing the egg from one eggcup to the other  you see that the air which i blow goes downwards between the egg and the cup and makes a blast under the egg and is thus able to lift a heavy thingfor a full egg is a very heavy thing for air to lift if you want to make the experiment you had better boil the egg quite hard first and then you may very safely try to blow it from one cup to the other with a little care  i have now kept you long enough upon this property of the weight of the air but there is another thing i should like to mention you saw the way in which in this popgun i was able to drive the second piece of potato half or twothirds of an inch before the first piece started by virtue of the elasticity of the airjust as i pressed into the copper bottle the particles of air by means of the pump now this depends upon a wonderful property in the air namely its elasticity and i should like to give you a good illustration of this if i take anything that confines the air properly as this membrane which also is able to contract and expand so as to give us a measure of the elasticity of the air and confine in this bladder a certain portion of air and then if we take the atmosphere off from the outside of it just as in these cases we put the pressure onif we take the pressure off you will see how it will then go on expanding and expanding larger and larger until it will fill the whole of this belljar shewing you that wonderful property of the air its elasticity its compressibility and expansibility to an exceedingly large extent and which is very essential for the purposes and services it performs in the economy of creation  we will now turn to another very important part of our subject remembering that we have examined the candle in its burning and have found that it gives rise to various products we have the products you know of soot of water and of something else which you have not yet examined we have collected the water but have allowed the other things to go into the air let us now examine some of these other products  here is an experiment which i think will help you in part in this way we will put our candle there and place over it a chimney thus i think my candle will go on burning because the airpassage is open at the bottom and the top in the first place you see the moisture appearingthat you know about it is water produced from the candle by the action of the air upon its hydrogen but besides that something is going out at the top it is not moistureit is not waterit is not condensible and yet after all it has very singular properties you will find that the air coming out of the top of our chimney is nearly sufficient to blow the light out i am holding to it and if i put the light fairly opposed to the current it will blow it quite out you will say that is as it should be and i am supposing that you think it ought to do so because the nitrogen does not support combustion and ought to put the candle out since the candle will not burn in nitrogen  illustration fig 29  but is there nothing else there than nitrogen i must now anticipatethat is to say i must use my own knowledge to supply you with the means that we adopt for the purpose of ascertaining these things and examining such gases as these i will take an empty bottlehere is oneand if i hold it over this chimney i shall get the combustion of the candle below sending its results into the bottle above and we shall soon find that this bottle contains not merely an air that is bad as regards the combustion of a taper put into it but having other properties  let me take a little quicklime and pour some common water on to itthe commonest water will do i will stir it a moment then pour it upon a piece of filtering paper in a funnel and we shall very quickly have a clear water proceeding to the bottle below as i have here i have plenty of this water in another bottle but nevertheless i should like to use the limewater that was prepared before you so that you may see what its uses are if i take some of this beautiful clear limewater and pour it into this jar which has collected the air from the candle you will see a change coming about do you see that the water has become quite milky observe that will not happen with air merely here is a bottle filled with air and if i put a little limewater into it neither the oxygen nor the nitrogen nor anything else that is in that quantity of air will make any change in the limewater it remains perfectly clear and no shaking of that quantity of limewater with that quantity of air in its common state will cause any change but if i take this bottle with the limewater and hold it so as to get the general products of the candle in contact with it in a very short time we shall have it milky there is the chalk consisting of the lime which we used in making the limewater combined with something that came from the candlethat other product which we are in search of and which i want to tell you about today this is a substance made visible to us by its action which is not the action of the limewater either upon the oxygen or upon the nitrogen nor upon the water itself but it is something new to us from the candle and then we find this white powder produced by the limewater and the vapour from the candle appears to us very much like whitening or chalk and when examined it does prove to be exactly the same substance as whitening or chalk so we are led or have been led to observe upon the various circumstances of this experiment and to trace this production of chalk to its various causes to give us the true knowledge of the nature of this combustion of the candleto find that this substance issuing from the candle is exactly the same as that substance which would issue from a retort if i were to put some chalk into it with a little moisture and make it redhot you would then find that exactly the same substance would issue from it as from the candle  but we have a better means of getting this substance and in greater quantity so as to ascertain what its general characters are we find this substance in very great abundance in a multitude of cases where you would least expect it all limestones contain a great deal of this gas which issues from the candle and which we call carbonic acid all chalks all shells all corals contain a great quantity of this curious air we find it fixed in these stones for which reason dr black called it fixed airfinding it in these fixed things like marble and chalk he called it fixed air because it lost its quality of air and assumed the condition of a solid body we can easily get this air from marble  here is a jar containing a little muriatic acid and here is a taper which if i put it into that jar will shew only the presence of common air there is you see pure air down to the bottom the jar is full of it  here is a substancemarble17 a very beautiful and superior marbleand if i put these pieces of marble into the jar a great boiling apparently goes on that however is not steamit is a gas that is rising up and if i now search the jar by a candle i shall have exactly the same effect produced upon the taper as i had from the air which issued from the end of the chimney over the burning candle it is exactly the same action and caused by the very same substance that issued from the candle and in this way we can get carbonic acid in great abundancewe have already nearly filled the jar  we also find that this gas is not merely contained in marble here is a vessel in which i have put some common whiteningchalk which has been washed in water and deprived of its coarser particles and so supplied to the plasterer as whitening  here is a large jar containing this whitening and water and i have here some strong sulphuric acid which is the acid you might have to use if you were to make these experiments only in using this acid with limestone the body that is produced is an insoluble substance whereas the muriatic acid produces a soluble substance that does not so much thicken the water and you will seek out a reason why i take this kind of apparatus for the purpose of shewing this experiment i do it because you may repeat in a small way what i am about to do in a large one you will have here just the same kind of action and i am evolving in this large jar carbonic acid exactly the same in its nature and properties as the gas which we obtained from the combustion of the candle in the atmosphere and no matter how different the two methods by which we prepare this carbonic acid you will see when we get to the end of our subject that it is all exactly the same whether prepared in the one way or in the other  we will now proceed to the next experiment with regard to this gas what is its nature here is one of the vessels full and we will try it as we have done so many other gases by combustion you see it is not combustible nor does it support combustion neither as we know does it dissolve much in water because we collect it over water very easily then you know that it has an effect and becomes white in contact with limewater and when it does become white in that way it becomes one of the constituents to make carbonate of lime or limestone  the next thing i must shew you is that it really does dissolve a little in water and  therefore that it is unlike oxygen and hydrogen in that respect i have here an apparatus by which we can produce this solution in the lower part of this apparatus is marble and acid and in the upper part cold water the valves are so arranged that the gas can get from one to the other i will set it in action now and you can see the gas bubbling up through the water as it has been doing all night long and by this time we shall find that we have this substance dissolved in the water if i take a glass and draw off some of the water i find that it tastes a little acid to the mouth it is impregnated with carbonic acid and if i now apply a little limewater to it that will give us a test of its presence this water will make the limewater turbid and white which is proof of the presence of carbonic acid  then it is a very weighty gasit is heavier than the atmosphere i have put their respective weights at the lower part of this table along with for comparison the weights of the other gases we have been examining                         pint      cubic foot hydrogen         34 grains 112 ounce oxygen           11910    112   nitrogen         10110    114   air            10716    138   carbonic acid      1613     1910   a pint of it weighs 1613 grains and a cubic foot weighs 1910 ounce almost two ounces you can see by many experiments that this is a heavy gas suppose i take a glass containing nothing else but air and from this vessel containing the carbonic acid i attempt to pour a little of this gas into that glass i wonder whether any has gone in or not i cannot tell by the appearance but i can in this way introducing the taper yes there it is you see and if i were to examine it by limewater i should find it by that test also i will take this little bucket and put it down into the well of carbonic acidindeed we too often have real wells of carbonic acidand now if there is any carbonic acid i must have got to it by this time and it will be in this bucket which we will examine with a taper there it is you see it is full of carbonic acid  illustration fig 30  there is another experiment by which i will shew you its weight i have here a jar suspended at one end of a balanceit is now equipoised but when i pour this carbonic acid into the jar on the one side which now contains air you will see it sink down at once because of the carbonic acid that i pour into it and now if i examine this jar with the lighted taper i shall find that the carbonic acid has fallen into it and it no longer has any power of supporting the combustion if i blow a soapbubble which of course will be filled with air and let it fall into this jar of carbonic acid it will float  illustration fig 31  but i shall first of all take one of these little balloons filled with air  i am not quite sure where the carbonic acid is we will just try the depth and see whereabouts is its level there you see we have this bladder floating on the carbonic acid and if i evolve some more of the carbonic acid the bladder will be lifted up higher there it goesthe jar is nearly full and now i will see whether i can blow a soapbubble on that and float it in the same way the lecturer here blew a soapbubble and allowed it to fall into the jar of carbonic acid when it floated in it midway it is floating as the balloon floated by virtue of the greater weight of the carbonic acid than of the air and now having so far given you the history of the carbonic acidas to its sources in the candle as to its physical properties and weightwhen we next meet i shall shew you of what it is composed and where it gets its elements from     lecture vi  carbon or charcoalcoal gasrespiration and its analogy to the burning of a candleconclusion   a lady who honours me by her presence at these lectures has conferred a still further obligation by sending me these two candles which are from japan and i presume are made of that substance to which i referred in a former lecture you see that they are even far more highly ornamented than the french candles and i suppose are candles of luxury judging from their appearance they have a remarkable peculiarity about themnamely a hollow wickthat beautiful peculiarity which argand introduced into the lamp and made so valuable to those who receive such presents from the east i may just say that this and such like materials gradually undergo a change which gives them on the surface a dull and dead appearance but they may easily be restored to their original beauty if the surface be rubbed with a clean cloth or silk handkerchief so as to polish the little rugosity or roughness this will restore the beauty of the colours i have so rubbed one of these candles and you see the difference between it and the other which has not been polished but which may be restored by the same process observe also that these moulded candles from japan are made more conical than the moulded candles in this part of the world  i told you when we last met a good deal about carbonic acid we found by the limewater test that when the vapour from the top of the candle or lamp was received into bottles and tested by this solution of limewater the composition of which i explained to you and which you can make for yourselves we had that white opacity which was in fact calcareous matter like shells and corals and many of the rocks and minerals in the earth but i have not yet told you fully and clearly the chemical history of this substancecarbonic acidas we have it from the candle and i must now resume that subject we have seen the products and the nature of them as they issue from the candle  we have traced the water to its elements and now we have to see where are the elements of the carbonic acid supplied by the candle a few experiments will shew this you remember that when a candle burns badly it produces smoke but if it is burning well there is no smoke and you know that the brightness of the candle is due to this smoke which becomes ignited here is an experiment to prove this so long as the smoke remains in the flame of the candle and becomes ignited it gives a beautiful light and never appears to us in the form of black particles i will light some fuel which is extravagant in its burning this will serve our purposea little turpentine on a sponge you see the smoke rising from it and floating into the air in large quantities and remember now the carbonic acid that we have from the candle is from such smoke as that to make that evident to you i will introduce this turpentine burning on the sponge into a flask where i have plenty of oxygen the rich part of the atmosphere and you now see that the smoke is all consumed this is the first part of our experiment and now what follows the carbon which you saw flying off from the turpentine flame in the air is now entirely burned in this oxygen and we shall find that it will by this rough and temporary experiment give us exactly the same conclusion and result as we had from the combustion of the candle the reason why i make the experiment in this manner is solely that i may cause the steps of our demonstration to be so simple that you can never for a moment lose the train of reasoning if you only pay attention all the carbon which is burned in oxygen or air comes out as carbonic acid whilst those particles which are not so burned shew you the second substance in the carbonic acidnamely the carbonthat body which made the flame so bright whilst there was plenty of air but which was thrown off in excess when there was not oxygen enough to burn it  i have also to shew you a little more distinctly the history of carbon and oxygen in their union to make carbonic acid you are now better able to understand this than before and i have prepared three or four experiments by way of illustration this jar is filled with oxygen and here is some carbon which has been placed in a crucible for the purpose of being made redhot i keep my jar dry and venture to give you a result imperfect in some degree in order that i may make the experiment brighter i am about to put the oxygen and the carbon together  that this is carbon common charcoal pulverised you will see by the way in which it burns in the air letting some of the redhot charcoal fall out of the crucible i am now about to burn it in oxygen gas and look at the difference it may appear to you at a distance as if it were burning with a flame but it is not so every little piece of charcoal is burning as a spark and whilst it so burns it is producing carbonic acid i specially want these two or three experiments to point out what i shall dwell upon more distinctly byandbythat carbon burns in this way and not as a flame  instead of taking many particles of carbon to burn i will take a rather large piece which will enable you to see the form and size and to trace the effects very decidedly here is the jar of oxygen and here is the piece of charcoal to which i have fastened a little piece of wood which i can set fire to and so commence the combustion which i could not conveniently do without you now see the charcoal burning but not as a flame or if there be a flame it is the smallest possible one which i know the cause ofnamely the formation of a little carbonic oxide close upon the surface of the carbon it goes on burning you see slowly producing carbonic acid by the union of this carbon or charcoal they are equivalent terms with the oxygen i have here another piece of charcoal a piece of bark which has the quality of being blown to piecesexploding as it burns by the effect of the heat we shall reduce the lump of carbon into particles that will fly off still every particle equally with the whole mass burns in this peculiar way it burns as a coal and not like a flame you observe a multitude of little combustions going on but no flame i do not know a finer experiment than this to shew that carbon burns with a spark  here then is carbonic acid formed from its elements it is produced at once and if we examined it by limewater you will see that we have the same substance which i have previously described to you by putting together 6 parts of carbon by weight whether it comes from the flame of a candle or from powdered charcoal and 16 parts of oxygen by weight we have 22 parts of carbonic acid and as we saw last time the 22 parts of carbonic acid combined with 28 parts of lime produced common carbonate of lime  if you were to examine an oystershell and weigh the component parts you would find that every 50 parts would give 6 of carbon and 16 of oxygen combined with 28 of lime however i do not want to trouble you with these minuti¾it is only the general philosophy of the matter that we can now go into see how finely the carbon is dissolving away pointing to the lump of charcoal burning quietly in the jar of oxygen you may say that the charcoal is actually dissolving in the air round about and if that were perfectly pure charcoal which we can easily prepare there would be no residue whatever when we have a perfectly cleansed and purified piece of carbon there is no ash left the carbon burns as a solid dense body that heat alone cannot change as to its solidity and yet it passes away into vapour that never condenses into solid or liquid under ordinary circumstances and what is more curious still is the fact that the oxygen does not change in its bulk by the solution of the carbon in it just as the bulk is at first so it is at last only it has become carbonic acid  there is another experiment which i must give you before you are fully acquainted with the general nature of carbonic acid being a compound body consisting of carbon and oxygen carbonic acid is a body that we ought to be able to take asunder and so we can as we did with water so we can with carbonic acidtake the two parts asunder the simplest and quickest way is to act upon the carbonic acid by a substance that can attract the oxygen from it and leave the carbon behind you recollect that i took potassium and put it upon water or ice and you saw that it could take the oxygen from the hydrogen now suppose we do something of the same kind here with this carbonic acid you know carbonic acid to be a heavy gas i will not test it with limewater as that will interfere with our subsequent experiments but i think the heaviness of the gas and the power of extinguishing flame will be sufficient for our purpose i introduce a flame into the gas and you will see whether it will be put out you see the light is extinguished indeed the gas may perhaps put out phosphorus which you know has a pretty strong combustion here is a piece of phosphorus heated to a high degree i introduce it into gas and you observe the light is put out but it will take fire again in the air because there it reenters into combustion now let me take a piece of potassium a substance which even at common temperatures can act upon carbonic acid though not sufficiently for our present purpose because it soon gets covered with a protecting coat but if we warm it up to the burning point in air as we have a fair right to do and as we have done with phosphorus you will see that it can burn in carbonic acid and if it burns it will burn by taking oxygen so that you will see what is left behind i am going then to burn this potassium in the carbonic acid as a proof of the existence of oxygen in the carbonic acid in the preliminary process of heating the potassium exploded sometimes we get an awkward piece of potassium that explodes or something like it when it burns i will take another piece and now that it is heated i introduce it into the jar and you perceive that it burns in the carbonic acidnot so well as in the air because the carbonic acid contains the oxygen combined but it does burn and takes away the oxygen if i now put this potassium into water i find that besides the potash formed which you need not trouble about there is a quantity of carbon produced i have here made the experiment in a very rough way but i assure you that if i were to make it carefully devoting a day to it instead of five minutes we should get all the proper amount of charcoal left in the spoon or in the place where the potassium was burned so that there could be no doubt as to the result here then is the carbon obtained from the carbonic acid as a common black substance so that you have the entire proof of the nature of carbonic acid as consisting of carbon and oxygen and now i may tell you that whenever carbon burns under common circumstances it produces carbonic acid  suppose i take this piece of wood and put it into a bottle with limewater i might shake that limewater up with wood and the atmosphere as long as i pleased it would still remain clear as you see it but suppose i burn the piece of wood in the air of that bottle you of course know i get water do i get carbonic acid the experiment was performed there it is you seethat is to say the carbonate lime which results from carbonic acid and that carbonic acid must be formed from the carbon which comes from the wood from the candle or any other thing  indeed you have yourselves frequently tried a very pretty experiment by which you may see the carbon in wood if you take a piece of wood and partly burn it and then blow it out you have carbon left there are things that do not shew carbon in this way a candle does not shew it but it contains carbon here also is a jar of coalgas which produces carbonic acid abundantly you do not see the carbon but we can soon shew it to you i will light it and as long as there is any gas in this cylinder it will go on burning you see no carbon but you see a flame and because that is bright it will lead you to guess that there is carbon in the flame but i will shew it to you by another process i have some of the same gas in another vessel mixed with a body that will burn the hydrogen of the gas but will not burn the carbon i will light them with a burning taper and you perceive the hydrogen is consumed but not the carbon which is left behind as a dense black smoke i hope that by these three or four experiments you will learn to see when carbon is present and understand what are the products of combustion when gas or other bodies are thoroughly burned in the air  before we leave the subject of carbon let us make a few experiments and remarks upon its wonderful condition as respects ordinary combustion i have shewn you that the carbon in burning burns only as a solid body and yet you perceive that after it is burned it ceases to be a solid there are very few fuels that act like this it is in fact only that great source of fuel the carbonaceous series the coals charcoals and woods that can do it i do not know that there is any other elementary substance besides carbon that burns with these conditions and if it had not been so what would happen to us suppose all fuel had been like iron which when it burns burns into a solid substance we could not then have such a combustion as you have in this fireplace here also is another kind of fuel which burns very wellas well as if not better than carbonso well indeed as to take fire of itself when it is in the air as you see breaking a tube full of lead pyrophorus this substance is lead and you see how wonderfully combustible it is it is very much divided and is like a heap of coals in the fireplace the air can get to its surface and inside and so it burns but why does it not burn in that way now when it is lying in a mass emptying the contents of the tube in a heap on to a plate of iron simply because the air cannot get to it though it can produce a great heat the great heat which we want in our furnaces and under our boilers still that which is produced cannot get away from the portion which remains unburned underneath and that portion therefore is prevented from coming in contact with the atmosphere and cannot be consumed how different is that from carbon carbon burns just in the same way as this lead does and so gives an intense fire in the furnace or wherever you choose to burn it but then the body produced by its combustion passes away and the remaining carbon is left clear i shewed you how carbon went on dissolving in the oxygen leaving no ash whereas here pointing to the heap of pyrophorus we have actually more ash than fuel for it is heavier by the amount of the oxygen which has united with it thus you see the difference between carbon and lead or iron if we choose iron which gives so wonderful a result in our application of this fuel either as light or heat if when the carbon burnt the product went off as a solid body you would have had the room filled with an opaque substance as in the case of the phosphorus but when carbon burns everything passes up into the atmosphere it is in a fixed almost unchangeable condition before the combustion but afterwards it is in the form of gas which it is very difficult though we have succeeded to produce in a solid or a liquid state  now i must take you to a very interesting part of our subjectto the relation between the combustion of a candle and that living kind of combustion which goes on within us in every one of us there is a living process of combustion going on very similar to that of a candle and i must try to make that plain to you for it is not merely true in a poetical sensethe relation of the life of man to a taper and if you will follow i think i can make this clear in order to make the relation very plain i have devised a little apparatus which we can soon build up before you here is a board and a groove cut in it and i can close the groove at the top part by a little cover i can then continue the groove as a channel by a glass tube at each end there being a free passage through the whole suppose i take a taper or candle we can now be liberal in our use of the word candle since we understand what it means and place it in one of the tubes it will go on you see burning very well you observe that the air which feeds the flame passes down the tube at one end then goes along the horizontal tube and ascends the tube at the other end in which the taper is placed  illustration fig 32  if i stop the aperture through which the air enters i stop combustion as you perceive i stop the supply of air and consequently the candle goes out but now what will you think of this fact in a former experiment i shewed you the air going from one burning candle to a second candle if i took the air proceeding from another candle and sent it down by a complicated arrangement into this tube i should put this burning candle out but what will you say when i tell you that my breath will put out that candle i do not mean by blowing at all but simply that the nature of my breath is such that a candle cannot burn in it i will now hold my mouth over the aperture and without blowing the flame in any way let no air enter the tube but what comes from my mouth you see the result i did not blow the candle out i merely let the air which i expired pass into the aperture and the result was that the light went out for want of oxygen and for no other reason something or othernamely my lungshad taken away the oxygen from the air and there was no more to supply the combustion of the candle it is i think very pretty to see the time it takes before the bad air which i throw into this part of the apparatus has reached the candle the candle at first goes on burning but so soon as the air has had time to reach it it goes out and now i will shew you another experiment because this is an important part of our philosophy here is a jar which contains fresh air as you can see by the circumstance of a candle or gaslight burning it i make it close for a little time and by means of a pipe i get my mouth over it so that i can inhale the air by putting it over water in the way that you see i am able to draw up this air supposing the cork to be quite tight take it into my lungs and throw it back into the jar  illustration fig 33  we can then examine it and see the result you observe i first take up the air and then throw it back as is evident from the ascent and descent of the water and now by putting a taper into the air you will see the state in which it is by the light being extinguished even one inspiration you see has completely spoiled this air so that it is no use my trying to breathe it a second time now you understand the ground of the impropriety of many of the arrangements among the houses of the poorer classes by which the air is breathed over and over again for the want of a supply by means of proper ventilation sufficient to produce a good result you see how bad the air becomes by a single breathing so that you can easily understand how essential fresh air is to us  to pursue this a little further let us see what will happen with limewater here is a globe which contains a little limewater and it is so arranged as regards the pipes as to give access to the air within so that we can ascertain the effect of respired or unrespired air upon it of course i can either draw in air through a and so make the air that feeds my lungs go through the limewater or i can force the air out of my lungs through the tube b which goes to the bottom and so shew its effect upon the limewater  illustration fig 34  you will observe that however long i draw the external air into the limewater and then through it to my lungs i shall produce no effect upon the waterit will not make the limewater turbid but if i throw the air from my lungs through the limewater several times in succession you see how white and milky the water is getting shewing the effect which expired air has had upon it and now you begin to know that the atmosphere which we have spoiled by respiration is spoiled by carbonic acid for you see it here in contact with the limewater  i have here two bottles one containing limewater and the other common water and tubes which pass into the bottles and connect them the apparatus is very rough but it is useful notwithstanding  illustration fig 35  if i take these two bottles inhaling here and exhaling there the arrangement of the tubes will prevent the air going backwards the air coming in will go to my mouth and lungs and in going out will pass through the limewater so that i can go on breathing and making an experiment very refined in its nature and very good in its results you will observe that the good air has done nothing to the limewater in the other case nothing has come to the limewater but my respiration and you see the difference in the two cases  let us now go a little further what is all this process going on within us which we cannot do without either day or night which is so provided for by the author of all things that he has arranged that it shall be independent of all will if we restrain our respiration as we can to a certain extent we should destroy ourselves when we are asleep the organs of respiration and the parts that are associated with them still go on with their actionso necessary is this process of respiration to us this contact of the air with the lungs i must tell you in the briefest possible manner what this process is we consume food the food goes through that strange set of vessels and organs within us and is brought into various parts of the system into the digestive parts especially and alternately the portion which is so changed is carried through our lungs by one set of vessels while the air that we inhale and exhale is drawn into and thrown out of the lungs by another set of vessels so that the air and the food come close together separated only by an exceedingly thin surface the air can thus act upon the blood by this process producing precisely the same results in kind as we have seen in the case of the candle the candle combines with parts of the air forming carbonic acid and evolves heat so in the lungs there is this curious wonderful change taking place the air entering combines with the carbon not carbon in a free state but as in this case placed ready for action at the moment and makes carbonic acid and is so thrown out into the atmosphere and thus this singular result takes place we may thus look upon the food as fuel let me take that piece of sugar which will serve my purpose it is a compound of carbon hydrogen and oxygen similar to a candle as containing the same elements though not in the same proportionthe proportions being as shewn in this table  sugar  carbon     72                    hydrogen    11                      99 oxygen     88  this is indeed a very curious thing which you can well remember for the oxygen and hydrogen are in exactly the proportions which form water so that sugar may be said to be compounded of 72 parts of carbon and 99 parts of water and it is the carbon in the sugar that combines with the oxygen carried in by the air in the process of respirationso making us like candlesproducing these actions warmth and far more wonderful results besides for the sustenance of the system by a most beautiful and simple process to make this still more striking i will take a little sugar or to hasten the experiment i will use some syrup which contains about threefourths of sugar and a little water if i put a little oil of vitriol on it it takes away the water and leaves the carbon in a black mass the lecturer mixed the two together you see how the carbon is coming out and before long we shall have a solid mass of charcoal all of which has come out of sugar sugar as you know is food and here we have absolutely a solid lump of carbon where you would not have expected it and if i make arrangements so as to oxidize the carbon of sugar we shall have a much more striking result here is sugar and i have here an oxidizera quicker one than the atmosphere and so we shall oxidize this fuel by a process different from respiration in its form though not different in its kind it is the combustion of the carbon by the contact of oxygen which the body has supplied to it if i set this into action at once you will see combustion produced just what occurs in my lungstaking in oxygen from another source namely the atmospheretakes place here by a more rapid process  you will be astonished when i tell you what this curious play of carbon amounts to a candle will burn some four five six or seven hours what then must be the daily amount of carbon going up into the air in the way of carbonic acid what a quantity of carbon must go from each of us in respiration what a wonderful change of carbon must take place under these circumstances of combustion or respiration a man in twentyfour hours converts as much as seven ounces of carbon into carbonic acid a milch cow will convert seventy ounces and a horse seventynine ounces solely by the act of respiration that is the horse in twentyfour hours burns seventynine ounces of charcoal or carbon in his organs of respiration to supply his natural warmth in that time all the warmblooded animals get their warmth in this way by the conversion of carbon not in a free state but in a state of combination and what an extraordinary notion this gives us of the alterations going on in our atmosphere as much as 5000000 pounds or 548 tons of carbonic acid is formed by respiration in london alone in twentyfour hours and where does all this go up into the air if the carbon had been like the lead which i shewed you or the iron which in burning produces a solid substance what would happen combustion could not go on as charcoal burns it becomes a vapour and passes off into the atmosphere which is the great vehicle the great carrier for conveying it away to other places then what becomes of it wonderful is it to find that the change produced by respiration which seems so injurious to us for we cannot breathe air twice over is the very life and support of plants and vegetables that grow upon the surface of the earth it is the same also under the surface in the great bodies of water for fishes and other animals respire upon the same principle though not exactly by contact with the open air  such fish as i have here pointing to a globe of goldfish respire by the oxygen which is dissolved from the air by the water and form carbonic acid and they all move about to produce the one great work of making the animal and vegetable kingdoms subservient to each other and all the plants growing upon the surface of the earth like that which i have brought here to serve as an illustration absorb carbon these leaves are taking up their carbon from the atmosphere to which we have given it in the form of carbonic acid and they are growing and prospering give them a pure air like ours and they could not live in it give them carbon with other matters and they live and rejoice this piece of wood gets all its carbon as the trees and plants get theirs from the atmosphere which as we have seen carries away what is bad for us and at the same time good for themwhat is disease to the one being health to the other so are we made dependent not merely upon our fellowcreatures but upon our fellowexisters all nature being tied together by the laws that make one part conduce to the good of another  there is another little point which i must mention before we draw to a closea point which concerns the whole of these operations and most curious and beautiful it is to see it clustering upon and associated with the bodies that concern usoxygen hydrogen and carbon in different states of their existence i shewed you just now some powdered lead which i set burning18 and you saw that the moment the fuel was brought to the air it acted even before it got out of the bottlethe moment the air crept in it acted now there is a case of chemical affinity by which all our operations proceed when we breathe the same operation is going on within us when we burn a candle the attraction of the different parts one to the other is going on here it is going on in this case of the lead and it is a beautiful instance of chemical affinity if the products of combustion rose off from the surface the lead would take fire and go on burning to the end but you remember that we have this difference between charcoal and leadthat while the lead can start into action at once if there be access of air to it the carbon will remain days weeks months or years the manuscripts of herculaneum were written with carbonaceous ink and there they have been for 1800 years or more not having been at all changed by the atmosphere though coming in contact with it under various circumstances now what is the circumstance which makes the lead and carbon differ in this respect it is a striking thing to see that the matter which is appointed to serve the purpose of fuel waits in its action it does not start off burning like the lead and many other things that i could shew you but which i have not encumbered the table with but it waits for action this waiting is a curious and wonderful thing candlesthose japanese candles for instancedo not start into action at once like the lead or iron for iron finely divided does the same thing as lead but there they wait for years perhaps for ages without undergoing any alteration i have here a supply of coalgas the jet is giving forth the gas but you see it does not take fireit comes out into the air but it waits till it is hot enough before it burns if i make it hot enough it takes fire if i blow it out the gas that is issuing forth waits till the light is applied to it again it is curious to see how different substances waithow some will wait till the temperature is raised a little and others till it is raised a good deal i have here a little gunpowder and some guncotton even these things differ in the conditions under which they will burn the gunpowder is composed of carbon and other substances making it highly combustible and the guncotton is another combustible preparation they are both waiting but they will start into activity at different degrees of heat or under different conditions by applying a heated wire to them we shall see which will start first touching the guncotton with the hot iron you see the guncotton has gone off but not even the hottest part of the wire is now hot enough to fire the gunpowder how beautifully that shews you the difference in the degree in which bodies act in this way in the one case the substance will wait any time until the associated bodies are made active by heat but in the other as in the process of respiration it waits no time in the lungs as soon as the air enters it unites with the carbon even in the lowest temperature which the body can bear short of being frozen the action begins at once producing the carbonic acid of respiration and so all things go on fitly and properly thus you see the analogy between respiration and combustion is rendered still more beautiful and striking indeed all i can say to you at the end of these lectures for we must come to an end at one time or other is to express a wish that you may in your generation be fit to compare to a candle that you may like it shine as lights to those about you that in all your actions you may justify the beauty of the taper by making your deeds honourable and effectual in the discharge of your duty to your fellowmen     lecture on platinum  delivered before the royal institution on friday february 22 1861   whether i was to have the honour of appearing before you this evening or not seemed to be doubtful upon one or two points one of these i will mention immediately the other may or may not appear during the course of the hour that follows the first point is this when i was tempted to promise this subject for your attention this evening it was founded upon a promise and a full intent of performing that promise on the part of my friend deville of paris to come here to shew before you a phenomenon in metallurgic chemistry not common in that i have been disappointed his intention was to have fused here some thirty or forty pounds of platinum and so to have made manifest through my mouth and my statement the principles of a new process in metallurgy in relation to this beautiful magnificent and valuable metal but circumstances over which neither he nor i nor others concerned have sufficient control have prevented the fulfilment of that intention and the period at which i learned the fact was so recent that i could hardly leave my place here to be filled by another or permit you who in your kindness have come to hear what might be said to remain unreceived in the best manner possible to me under the circumstances i therefore propose to state as well as i can what the principles are on which m deville proceeds by means of drawings and some subordinate or inferior experiments the metal platinum of which you see some very fine specimens on the table has been known to us about a hundred years it has been wrought in a beautiful way in this country in france and elsewhere and supplied to the consumer in ingots of this kind or in plates such as we have here or in masses that by their very fall upon the table indicate the great weight of the substance which is indeed nearly at the head of all substances in that respect this substance has been given to us hitherto mainly through the philosophy of dr wollaston whom many of us know and it is obtained in great purity and beauty it is a very remarkable metal in many points besides its known special uses it usually comes to us in grains here is a very fine specimen of native platinum in grains here is also a nugget or ingot and here are some small pieces gathered out of certain alluvial soils in brazil mexico california and the uralian districts of russia  it is strange that this metal is almost always found associated with some four or five other metals most curious in their qualities and characteristics they are called platiniferous metals and they have not only the relation of being always found associated in this manner but they have other relations of a curious nature which i shall point out to you by a reference to one of the tables behind me this substance is always nativeit is always in the metallic state and the metals with which it is found connected and which are rarely found elsewhere are palladium rhodium iridium osmium and ruthenium we have the names in one of the tables arranged in two columns representing as you see two groupsplatinum iridium and osmium constituting one group and ruthenium rhodium and palladium the other three of these have the chemical equivalent of 9812 and the others a chemical equivalent of about half that number then the metals of one group have an extreme specific gravityplatinum being in fact the lightest of the three or as light as the lightest osmium has a specific gravity of 214 and is the heaviest body in nature platinum is 2115 and iridium the same the specific gravity of the other three being only about half that namely 113 121 and 118 then there is this curious relation that palladium and iridium are very much alike so that you would scarcely know one from the other though one has only half the weight of the other and only half the equivalent power so with iridium and rhodium and osmium and ruthenium which are so closely allied that they make pairs being separated each from its own group then these metals are the most infusible that we possess osmium is the most difficult to fuse indeed i believe it never has been fused while every other metal has ruthenium comes next iridium next rhodium next platinum next so that it ranks here as a pretty fusible metal and yet we have been long accustomed to speak of the infusibility of platinum and next comes palladium which is the most fusible metal of the whole it is a curious thing to see this fine association of physical properties coming out in metals which are grouped together somehow or other in nature but no doubt by causes which are related to analogous properties in their situation on the surface of the earth for it is in alluvial soils that these things are found  now with regard to this substance let me tell you briefly how we get it the process used to be this the ore which i shewed you just now was taken and digested in nitromuriatic acid of a certain strength and partly converted into a solution with the leaving behind of certain bodies that i have upon the table  the platinum being dissolved with care in acids to the solution the muriate of ammonia was added as i am about to add it here a yellow precipitate was then thrown down as you perceive is the case now and this carefully washed and cleansed gave us that body pointing to a specimen of the chloride of platinum and ammonium the other elements or nearly all being ejected  this substance being heated gave us what we call platinum sponge or platinum in the metallic state so finely divided as to form a kind of heavy mass or sponge which at the time that dr wollaston first sent it forth was not fusible for the market or in the manufacturers workshops inasmuch as the temperature required was so high and there were no furnaces that could bring the mass into a globule and cause the parts to adhere together most of our metals that we obtain from nature and work in our shops are brought at last into a mass by fusion  i am not aware that there is in the arts or sciences any other than iron which is not so  soft iron we do not bring together by fusion but by a process which is analogous to the one that was followed in the case of platinum namely welding for these divided grains of spongy platinum having been well washed and sunk in water for the purpose of excluding air and pressed together and heated and hammered and pressed again until they come into a pretty close dense compact mass did so cohere that when the mass was put into the furnace of charcoal and raised to a high temperature the particles at first infinitely dividedfor they were chemically dividedadhered the one to the other each to all the rest until they made that kind of substance which you see here which will bear rolling and expansion of every kind no other process than that has hitherto been adopted for the purpose of obtaining this substance from the particles by solution precipitation ignition and welding it certainly is a very fine thing to see that we may so fully depend upon the properties of the various substances we have to deal with that we can by carrying out our processes obtain a material like this allowing of division and extension under a rolling milla material of the finest possible kind the parts being held together not with interstices not with porosity but so continuous that no fluids can pass between them and as dr wollaston beautifully shewed a globule of platinum fused by the voltaic battery and the oxyhydrogen blowpipe when drawn into a wire was not sounder or stronger than this wire made by the curious coalescence of the particles by the sticking power that they had at high temperatures this is the process adopted by messrs johnson and matthey to whose great kindness i am indebted for these ingots and for the valuable assistance i have received in the illustrations  the treatment however that i have to bring before you is of another kind and it is in the hope that we shall be able before long to have such a thing as the manufacture of platinum of this kind that i am encouraged to come before you and tell you how far deville has gone in the matter and to give you illustrations of the principles on which he proceeds i think it is but fair that you should see an experiment shewing you the way in which we get the adhesion of platinum probably you all know of the welding of iron you go into the smiths shop and you see him put the handle of a poker on to the stem and by a little management and the application of heat he makes them one  you have no doubt seen him put the iron into the fire and sprinkle a little sand upon it  he does not know the philosophy he calls into play when he sprinkles a little sand over the oxide of iron but he has a fine philosophy there or practises it when he gets his welding i can shew you here this beautiful circumstance of the sticking together of the particles up to the fullest possible intensity of their combination if you were to go into the workshops of mr matthey and see them hammering and welding away you would see the value of the experiment i am about to shew you i have here some platinumwire  this is a metal which resists the action of acids resists oxidation by heat and change of any sort and which therefore i may heat in the atmosphere without any flux i bend the wire so as to make the ends cross these i make hot by means of the blowpipe and then by giving them a tap with a hammer i shall make them into one piece now that the pieces are united i shall have great difficulty in pulling them apart though they are joined only at the point where the two cylindrical surfaces came together and now i have succeeded in pulling the wire apart the division is not at the point of welding but where the force of the pincers has cut it so that the junction we have effected is a complete one this then is the principle of the manufacture and production of platinum in the old way  the treatment which deville proposes to carry out and which he has carried out to a rather large extent in reference to the russian supply of platinum is one altogether by heat having little or no reference to the use of acids that you may know what the problem is look at this table which gives you the composition of such a piece of platinum ore as i shewed you just now wherever it comes from the composition is as complicated though the proportions vary  platinum      764 iridium       43 rhodium       03 palladium      14 gold         04 copper        41 iron        117 osmide of iridium  05 sand         14                                        1005  this refers to the uralian ore in that state of combination as shewn in the table the iridium and osmium are found combined in crystals sometimes to the amount of 05 per cent and sometimes 3 or 4 per cent now this deville proposes to deal with in the dry way in the place of dealing with it by any acid  i have here another kind of platinum and i shew it to you for this reason the russian government having large stores of platinum in their dominions have obtained it in a metallic state and worked it into coin the coin i have in my hand is a twelve silver rouble piece the rouble is worth three shillings and this coin is therefore of the value of thirtysix shillings the smaller coin is worth half that sum and the other half of that the metal however is unfit for coinage when you have the two metals gold and silver used for coinage you have a little confusion in the value of the two in the market but when you have three precious metals for you may call platinum a precious metal worked into coin they will be sure to run counter to one another indeed the case did happen that the price of platinum coin fixed by the government was such that it was worth while to purchase platinum in other countries and make coin of it and then take it into that country and circulate it the result was that the russian government stopped the issue the composition of this coin isplatinum 970 iridium 12 rhodium 05 palladium 025 a little copper and a little iron it is in fact bad platinum it scales and it has an unfitness for commercial use and in the laboratory which the other wellpurified platinum has not it wants working over again  now devilles process depends upon three pointsupon intense heat blowpipe action and the volatility of certain metals we know that there are plenty of metals that are volatile but this i think is the first time that it has been proposed to use the volatility of certain metalssuch as gold and palladiumfor the purpose of driving them off and leaving something else behind he counts largely upon the volatility of metals which we have not been in the habit of considering volatile but which we have rather looked upon as fixed and i must endeavour to illustrate these three points by a few experiments perhaps i can best show you what is required in the process of heating platinum by using that source of heat which we have here and which seems to be almost illimitablenamely the voltaic battery for it is only in consequence of the heat that the voltaic battery affects the platinum by applying the two extremities of the battery to this piece of platinumwire you will see what result we shall obtain you perceive that we can take about this heating agent wherever we like and deal with it as we please limiting it in any way i am obliged to deal carefully with it but even that circumstance will have an interest for you in watching the experiment contact is now made the electric current when compressed into thin conductingwires offering resistance evolves heat to a large extent and this is the power by which we work you see the intense glow immediately imparted to the wire and if i applied the heat continuously the effect of the current would be to melt the wire as soon as the contact is broken the wire resumes its former appearance and now that we make contact again you perceive the glow as before the experiment was repeated several times in rapid succession you can see a line of light though you can scarcely perceive the wire and now that it has melted with the great heat if you examine it you will perceive that it is indeed a set of irregularities from end to enda set of little spheres which are strung upon an axis of platinum running through it it is that wire which mr grove described as being produced at the moment when fusion of the whole mass is commencing in the same manner if i take a tolerably thick piece of platinum and subject it to the heat that can be produced by this battery you will see the brilliancy of the effect produced i shall put on a pair of spectacles for the experiment as there is an injurious effect of the voltaic spark upon the eyes if the action is continued and it is neither policy nor bravery to subject any organ to unnecessary danger and i want at all events to keep the full use of my eyes to the end of the lecture  you now see the action of the heat upon the piece of platinumheat so great as to break in pieces the plate on which the drops of metal fall you perceive then that we have sufficiently powerful sources of heat in nature to deal with platinum i have here an apparatus by which the same thing can be shewn here is a piece of platinum which is put into a crucible of carbon made at the end of one pole of the battery and you will see the brilliant light that will be produced there is our furnace and the platinum is rapidly getting heated and now you perceive that it is melted and throwing off little particles what a magnificent philosophical instrument this is when you look at the result which is lying upon the charcoal you will see a beautifully fused piece of platinum it is now a fiery globule with a surface so bright and smooth and reflecting that i cannot tell whether it is transparent or opaque or what this then will give you an idea of what has to be done by any process that pretends to deal with thirty or forty or fifty pounds of platinum at once  let me now tell you briefly what deville proposes to do first of all he takes this ore with its impurities and mixes it as he finds it essential and best with its own weight of sulphuret of leadlead combined with sulphur both the lead and the sulphur are wanted for the iron that is there present as you see by the table is one of the most annoying substances in the treatment that you can imagine because it is not volatile and while the iron remains adhering to the platinum the platinum will not flow readily it cannot be sent away by a high temperaturesent into the atmosphere so as to leave the platinum behind well then a hundred parts of ore and a hundred parts of sulphuret of lead with about fifty parts of metallic lead being all mingled together in a crucible the sulphur of the sulphuret takes the iron the copper and some of the other metals and impurities and combines with them to form a slag and as it goes on boiling and oxidising it carries off the iron and so a great cleansing takes place  now you ought to know that these metals such as platinum iridium and palladium have a strong affinity for such metals as lead and tin and upon this a great deal depends very much depends upon the platinum throwing out its impurities of iron and so forth by being taken up with the lead present in it that you may have a notion of the great power that platinum has of combining with other metals i will refer you to a little of the chemists experiencehis bad experience he knows very well that if he takes a piece of platinumfoil and heats a piece of lead upon it or if he takes a piece of platinumfoil such as we have here and heats things upon it that have lead in them his platinum is destroyed i have here a piece of platinum and if i apply the heat of the spiritlamp to it in consequence of the presence of this little piece of lead which i will place on it i shall make a hole in the metal the heat of the lamp itself would do no harm to the platinum nor would other chemical means but because there is a little lead present and there is an affinity between the two substances the bodies fuse together at once you see the hole i have made it is large enough to put your finger in though the platinum itself was as you saw almost infusible except by the voltaic battery for the purpose of shewing this fact in a more striking manner i have taken pieces of platinumfoil tinfoil and leadfoil and rolled them together and if i apply the blowpipe to them you will have in fact a repetition on a larger scale of the experiment you saw just now when the lead and platinum came together and one spoiled the other when the metals are laid one upon the other and folded together and heat applied you will not only see that the platinum runs to waste but that at the time when the platinum and lead are combined there is ignition producedthere is a power of sustaining combustion i have taken a large piece that you may see the phenomenon on a large scale you saw the ignition and the explosion which followed of which we have here the resultsthe consequence of the chemical affinity between the platinum and the metals combined with it which is the thing upon which deville founds his first result  when he has melted these substances and stirred them well up and so obtained a complete mixture he throws in air upon the surface to burn off all the sulphur from the remaining sulphuret of lead and at last he gets an ingot of lead with platinummuch lead comparatively and little platinum he gets that in the crucible with a lot of scoriæ and other things which he treats afterwards it is that platiniferous lead which we have to deal with in our future process now let me tell you what he does with it his first object is to get rid of the lead he has thrown out all the iron and a number of other things and he has got this kind of compound indicated in the table he may get it as high as 78 per cent of platinum and 22 of lead or 5 or 10 or 15 of platinum and 95 or 90 or 85 of lead which he calls weak platinum and he then places it in the kind of vessel that you see before you suppose we had the mixture here we should have to make it hot and then throw in air upon the surface the combustible metalthat is the leadand the part that will oxidise are thoroughly oxidised the litharge would flow out in a fused state into a vessel placed to receive it and the platinum remains behind  illustration fig 36  here is the process which deville adopts for the purpose of casting off the lead after he has got out the platinum from the ore having made use of your friend you get rid of him as quickly as you can he gets his heat by applying the combination of oxygen and hydrogen or of carburetted fuel for the purpose of producing a fire i have here a source of coalgas there i have a source of hydrogen and here i have a source of oxygen i have here also one of the blowpipes used by deville in his process for working platinum in the way i have spoken of there are two pipes and one of them goes to the source of coalgas and the other to the supply of oxygen  illustration fig 37  by uniting these we obtain a flame of such a heat as to melt platinum you will perhaps hardly imagine what the heat is unless you have some proof of it but you will soon see that i have actually the power of melting platinum here is a piece of platinumfoil running like wax under the flame which i am bringing to bear against it the question however is whether we shall get heat enough to melt not this small quantity but large massesmany pounds of the metal having obtained heat like this the next consideration is what vessel is he to employ which could retain the platinum when so heated or bear the effects of the flame  such vessels are happily well supplied at paris and are formed of a substance which surrounds paris it is a kind of chalk called i believe by geologists calcaire grossière and it has the property of enduring an extreme degree of heat i am now going to get the highest heat that we can obtain first i shew you the combustion of hydrogen by itself i have not a large supply because the coalgas is sufficient for most of our purposes if i put a piece of lime obtained from this chalk into the gas you see we get a pretty hot flame which would burn ones fingers a good deal but now let me subject a piece of it to the joint action of oxygen and hydrogen i do this for the purpose of shewing you the value of lime as a material for the furnaces and chambers that are to contain the substances to be operated on and that are consequently to sustain the action of this extreme heat here we have the hydrogen and the oxygen which will give the most intense heat that can be obtained by chemical action and if i put a piece of lime into the flame we get what is called the limelight now with all the beauty and intensity of action which you perceive there is no sensible deterioration of the lime except by the mechanical force of the current of gases rushing from the jet against the lime sweeping away such particles as are not strongly aggregated vapour of lime some call it and it may be so but there is no other change of the lime than that under the action of heat of this highlyexalted chemical condition though almost any other substance would melt at once  then as to the way in which the heat is applied to the substance it is all very well for me to take a piece of antimony and fuse it in the flame of a blowpipe but if i tried this piece in the ordinary lamp flame i should do nothing if i tried a smaller piece i should do little or nothing and if i tried a still smaller piece i should do little or nothing yet i have a condition which will represent what deville carries to the highest possible extent and which we all carry to the highest extent in the use of the blowpipe suppose i take this piece of antimony i shall not be able to melt it in that flame of the candle by merely holding it there yet by taking pains we can even melt a piece of platinum there this is a preparation which i made for the purpose of proving the fusibility of platinum in a common candle there is a piece of wire drawn by that ingenious process of dr wollastons not more than the threethousandth part of an inch in diameter he put the wire into the middle of a cylinder of silver and drew both together until the whole compound was exceedingly thin and then he dissolved away the silver by nitric acid there was left in the centre a substance which i can scarcely see with an eyeglass but which i know is there and which i can make visible as you see by putting it into the candle where the heat makes it glow like a spark i have again and again tried this experiment upstairs in my own room and have easily fused this platinumwire by a common candle you see we have therefore heat enough in the candle as in the voltaic battery or in the highlyexalted combustion of the blowpipe but we do not supply a continuous source of heat in the very act of this becoming ignited the heat radiates so fast that you cannot accumulate enough to cause the fusion of the wire except under the most careful arrangement thus i cannot melt that piece of antimony by simply putting it into the candle but if i put it upon charcoal and drive the fiery current against it there will be heat enough to melt it the beauty of the blowpipe is that it sends hot air making hot air by the combustion of the flame against the thing to be heated i have only to hold the antimony in the course of that current and particle by particle of the current impinges upon the antimony and so we get it melted you now see it redhot and i have no doubt it will continue to burn if i withdraw it from the flame and continue to force the air on it now you see it burning without any heat but that of its own combustion which i am keeping up by sending the air against it it would go out in a moment if i took away the current of air from it but there it is burning and the more air i give it by this or any other action the better it is so then we have here not merely a mighty source of heat but a means of driving the heat forcibly against substances  let me shew you another experiment with a piece of iron it will serve two purposesshewing you what the blowpipe does as a source of heat and what it does by sending that heat where it is wanted i have taken iron in contrast with silver or other metals that you may see the difference of action and so be more interested in the experiment here is our fuel the coalgas and here our oxygen having thus my power of heat i apply it to the iron which as you see soon gets redhot it is now flowing about like a globule of melted mercury but observe i cannot raise any vapour it is now covered with a coat of melted oxide and unless i have a great power in my blowpipe it is hardly possible to break through it now then you see these beautiful sparks you have not only a beautiful kind of combustion but you see the iron is being driven off not producing smoke but burning in a fixed condition how different this is from the action of some other metalsthat piece of antimony for instance which we saw just now throwing off abundance of fumes we can of course burn away this iron by giving plenty of air to it but with the bodies which deville wants to expose to this intense heat he has not that means the gas itself must have power enough to drive off the slag which forms on the surface of the metal and power to impinge upon the platinum so as to get the full contact that he wants for the fusion to take place we see here then the means to which he resortsoxygen and either coalgas or watergas19 or pure hydrogen for producing heat and the blowpipe for the purpose of impelling the heated current upon the metals  i have two or three rough drawings here representing the kind of furnaces which he employs they are larger however than the actual furnaces he uses even the furnace in which he carries on that most serious operation of fusing fifty pounds of platinum at once is not much more than half the size of the drawing it is made of a piece of lime below and a piece of lime above you see how beautifully lime sustains heat without altering in shape and you may have thought how beautifully it prevents the dissipation of the heat by its very bad conducting powers  illustration fig 38  while the front part of the lime which you saw here was so highly ignited i could at any moment touch the back of it without feeling any annoyance from the heat so by having a chamber of lime of this sort he is able to get a vessel to contain these metals with scarcely any loss of heat he puts the blowpipes through these apertures and sends down these gases upon the metals which are gradually melted he then puts in more metal through a hole at the top the results of the combustion issue out of the aperture which you see represented if there be strips of platinum he pushes them through the mouth out of which the heated current is coming and there they get redhot and whitehot before they get into the bath of platinum so he is able to fuse a large body of platinum in this manner when the platinum is melted he takes off the top and pours out from the bottom piece like a crucible and makes his cast this is the furnace by which he fuses his forty pounds or fifty pounds of platinum at once the metal is raised to a heat that no eye can bear there is no light and shadow no chiarooscuro there all is the same intensity of glow you look in and you cannot see where the metal or the lime is it is all as one we have therefore a platform with a handle which turns upon an axis that coincides with the gutter that is formed for the pouring of the metal and when all is known to be ready by means of dark glasses the workmen take off the top piece and lift up the handle and the mould being then placed in a proper position he knows that the issue of the metal will be exactly in the line of the axis no injury has ever happened from the use of this plan you know with what care it is necessary to carry such a vessel of mercury as we have here for fear of turning it over on one side or the other but if it be a vessel of melted platinum the very greatest care must be used because the substance is twice as heavy yet no injury has been done to any of the workmen in this operation  i have said that deville depends upon intense heat for carrying off vapour and this brings me to the point of shewing how vapours are carried off here is a basin of mercury which boils easily as you know and gives us the opportunity of observing the facts and principles which are to guide us i have here two poles of the battery and if i bring them into contact with the mercury see what a development of vapour we have the mercury is flying off rapidly and i might if i pleased put all the company around me in a bath of mercury vapour and so if we take this piece of lead and treat it in the same way it will also give off vapour observe the fumes that rise from it and even if it was so far enclosed from the air that you could not form any litharge you would still have those abundant fumes flying off i may also take a piece of gold and shew you the same thing i have here a piece of gold which i put upon a clean surface of paris limestone applying the heat of the blowpipe to it you see how the heat drives off the vapour and if you notice at the end of the lecture you will observe on the stone a purple patch of condensed gold thus you see a proof of the volatilisation of gold it is the same with silver you will not be startled if i sometimes use one agent and sometimes another to illustrate a particular point the volatility of gold and silver is the same thing whether it be effected by the voltaic battery or by the blowpipe a lump of silver was placed in a charcoal crucible between the poles of a voltaic battery now look at the fumes of silver and observe the peculiar and beautiful green colour which they produce we shall now shew you this same process of boiling the silver cast on a screen from the electric lamp which you have before you and while dr tyndall is kindly getting the lamp ready for this purpose let me tell you that deville proposes to throw out in this way all these extraneous things that i have spoken of except twonamely iridium and rhodium it so happens as he says that iridium and rhodium do make the metal more capable of resisting the attacks of acids than platinum itself alloys are compounded up to 25 per cent of rhodium and iridium by which the chemical inaction of the platinum is increased and also its malleability and other physical properties the image of the voltaic discharge through vapour of silver was now thrown upon the screen what you have now on the screen is an inverted image of what you saw when we heated the silver before the fine stream that you see around the silver is the discharge of the electric force that takes place giving you that glorious green light which you see in the ray and if dr tyndall will open the top of the lamp you will see the quantity of fumes that will come out of the aperture shewing you at once the volatility of silver  i have now finished this imperfect account it is but an apology for not having brought the process itself before you i have done the best i could under the circumstances and i know your kindness well for if i were not aware that i might trust to it i would not appear here so often as i have done the gradual loss of memory and of my other faculties is making itself painfully evident to me and requires every time i appear before you the continued remembrance of your kindness to enable me to get through my task if i should happen to go on too long or should fail in doing what you might desire remember it is yourselves who are chargeable by wishing me to remain i have desired to retire as i think every man ought to do before his faculties become impaired but i must confess that the affection i have for this place and for those who frequent this place is such that i hardly know when the proper time has arrived
