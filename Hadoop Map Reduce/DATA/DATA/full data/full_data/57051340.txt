welcomes corrections and emendations the text has been transcribed as written except that because of the limitations of the gutenberg project format italicized words have been transcribed in full capitals  the lake gun is one of james fenimore coopers very few short stories and was written in the last year of his life it was commissioned by george e wood for publication in a volume of miscellaneous stories and poems called the parthenon new york george e wood 1850 and cooper received 100 for it the story was reprinted a few years later in a similar volume called specimens of american literature new york 1866 it was published in book form in 1932 in a slipcased edition limited to 450 copies new york william farquhar payson 1932 with an introduction by robert f spiller  introductory note the lake gun though based on folklore about seneca lake in central new york state the wandering jew and the lake gun and on a supposed seneca indian legend is in fact political satire commenting on american political demagogues in general and in particular on the then 1850 whig senator from new york state william henry seward 18011872 who had served as governor of new york 18381842 and would later become secretary of state 18611869 under presidents lincoln and johnson by 1850 cooper feared that unscrupulous political extremists mobilizing public opinion behind causes such as abolitionism were leading america towards a disastrous civil war cooper probably obtained his local lore about seneca lake while visiting his son paul who attended geneva college now hobart college on lake seneca from 18401844     the lake gun   by  james fenimore cooper     the seneca is remarkable for its wandering jew and the lake gun the first is a tree so balanced that when its roots are clear of the bottom it floats with its broken and pointed trunk a few feet above the surface of the water driving before the winds or following in the course of the currents at times the wandering jew is seen off jefferson near the head of this beautiful sheet and next it will appear anchored as it might be in the shallow water near the outlet  wandering jew  the medieval legend of ahasueras who mocked christ on his way to the cross and was condemned to live until judgment day is widespread throughout europe though he was only identified as a jew in the 17th centurystudents at geneva college now hobart college applied the name to a supposedly unsinkable floating log in lake seneca identified as the legendary chief agayentha jefferson  i am indebted to john gormley of burdett ny for the information that the village of jefferson which i had been unable to locate was renamed watkins in 1852 and then the current and wellknown watkins glen in 1926 august 2011   for more than half a century has this remnant of the forest floated about from point to point its bald head whitening with time until its features have become familiar to all the older inhabitants of that region of country the great depth of the seneca prevents it from freezing and summer and winter springtime and autumn is this wanderer to be observed occasionally battling with the ice that makes a short distance from the shore now pursuing its quiet way before a mild southern air in june or again anchored by its roots touching the bottom as it passes a point or comes in contact with the flats it has been known to remain a year or two at a time in view of the village of geneva until accustomed to its sight the people began to think that it was never to move from its berth any more but a fresh northerly breeze changes all this the jew swings to the gale and like a ship unmooring drags clear of the bottom and goes off to the southward with its head just high enough above water to be visible it would seem really that his wanderings are not to cease as long as wood will float  village of geneva  now the city of geneva at the northern end of lake seneca  no white man can give the history of this jew he was found laving his sides in the pure waters of the seneca by the earliest settlers and it may have been ages since his wanderings commenced when they are to cease is a secret in the womb of time  the lake gun is a mystery it is a sound resembling the explosion of a heavy piece of artillery that can be accounted for by none of the known laws of nature the report is deep hollow distant and imposing the lake seems to be speaking to the surrounding hills which send back the echoes of its voice in accurate reply no satisfactory theory has ever been broached to explain these noises conjectures have been hazarded about chasms and the escape of compressed air by the sudden admission of water but all this is talking at random and has probably no foundation in truth the most that can be said is that such sounds are heard though at long intervals and that no one as yet has succeeded in ascertaining their cause  the lake gun  the lake gun or lake drum is a mysterious booming sound occasionally heard on lake seneca and on neighboring lake cayuga which has been given a variety of scientific literary and legendary interpretations  it is not many lustrums since curiosity induced an idler a traveler and one possessed of much attainment derived from journeys in distant lands first to inquire closely into all the traditions connected with these two peculiarities of the seneca and having thus obtained all he could to lead him to make the tour of the entire lake in the hope of learning more by actual personal observation he went up and down in the steamboat was much gratified with his trip but could see or hear nothing to help him in his investigation the gun had not been heard in a long time and no one could tell him what had become of the wandering jew in vain did his eyes roam over the broad expanse of water they could discover nothing to reward their search there was an old man in the boat of the name of peter who had passed his life on the seneca and to him was our traveler referred as the person most likely to gratify his curiosity fuller for so we shall call the stranger for the sake of convenience was not slow to profit by this hint and was soon in amicable relations with the tough old freshwater mariner a halfeagle opportunely bestowed opened all the stores of peters lore and he professed himself ready to undertake a cruise even for the especial purpose of hunting up the jew  lustrum  a period of five years half eagle  a us gold coin worth 500  i havent seen that ere crittur nowpeter always spoke of the tree as if it had animal lifethese three years we think he doesnt like the steamboats the very last time i seed the old chap he was agoin up afore a smart norwester and we was acomin down with the wind in our teeth when i made out the jew about a mile or at most a mile and a half ahead of us and right in our track i remember that i said to myself says i old fellow well get a sight of your countenance this time i suppose you know sir that the jew has a face just like a human  i did not know that but what became of the tree  tree answered peter shaking his head why cant we cut a tree down in the woods saw it and carve it as we will and make it last a hundred years what become of the tree sirwhy as soon as the jew saw we was acomin so straight upon him what does the old chap do but shift his helm and make for the west shore you never seed a steamer leave sich a wake or make sich time if he went half a knot he went twenty  this little episode rather shook fullers faith in peters accuracy but it did not prevent his making an arrangement by which he and the old man were to take a cruise in quest of the tree after having fruitlessly endeavored to discover in what part of the lake it was just then to be seen  some folks pretend hes gone down said peter in continuation of a discourse on the subject as he flattened in the sheets of a very comfortable and rather spacious sailboat on quitting the wharf of geneva and will never come up agin but they may just as well tell me that the sky is coming down and that we may set about picking up the larks that jew will no more sink than a wellcorked bottle will sink  picking up the larks  when the sky falls we shall catch larks is an old proverb meaning that an idea or suggestion is ridiculous  this was the opinion of peter fuller cared but little for it though he still fancied he might make his companion useful in hunting up the object of his search these two strangelyassorted companions cruised up and down the seneca for a week vainly endeavoring to find the wandering jew various were the accounts they gleaned from the different boatmen one had heard he was to be met with off this point another in that bay all believed he might be found though no one had seen him latelysome said in many years  hell turn up said peter positively or the seneca would go down bows foremost we shall light on the old chap when we least expect it  it must be confessed that peter had many sufficient reasons for entertaining these encouraging hopes he was capitally fed had very little more to do than to ease off or flatten in a sheet the boat being too large to be rowed and cigars and liquors of various sorts were pretty much at his command for the obvious reason that they were under his care in delivering his sentiments however peter was reasonably honest for he had the most implicit faith not only in the existence of this jew but in the beneficent influence of his visits his presence was universally deemed a sign of good luck  fuller passed most of the nights in a comfortable bed leaving peter in the boat sometimes asking for lodgings in a farmhouse and at others obtaining them in an inn wherever he might be he inquired about the wandering jew and the lake gun bent on solving these two difficult problems if possible and always with the same success most persons had seen the former but not lately while about one in ten had heard the latter it occurred to our traveler that more of the last were to be found nearer to the northern than to the southern end of the lake  the cruise continued a fortnight in this desultory manner with the same want of success one morning as fuller was returning to the boat after passing the night in a farmhouse he was struck by the statuelike appearance of a figure which stood on the extreme point of a low rocky promontory that was considerably aside from any dwelling or building the place was just at the commencement of the hill country and where the shores of the seneca cease to offer those smiling pictures of successful husbandry that so much abound farther north a somber or it might be better to say a sober aspect gave dignity to the landscape which if not actually grand had at least most of the elements that characterize the noble in nature  but fuller at the moment was less struck with the scenery charming as that certainly was than with the statuelike and immovable form on the little promontory a single tree shaded the spot where the stranger stood but it cast its shadows toward the west at that early hour leaving the erect and chiseled form in clear sunlight stimulated by curiosity and hoping to learn something that might aid him in his search from one as curious as himself fuller turned aside and instead of descending to the spot where peter had the boat ready for his reception he crossed a pleasant meadow in the direction of the tree  several times did our traveler stop to gaze on that immovable form a feeling of superstition came over him when he saw that not the smallest motion nor relief of limb or attitude was made for the ten minutes that his eye had rested on the singular and strange object at he drew nearer however the outlines became more and more distinct and he fancied that the form was actually naked then the truth became apparent it was a native of the forest in his summer garb who had thrown aside his blanket and stood in his leggings naked phidias could not have cut in stone a more faultless form for active healthful youth had given to it the free and noble air of manly but modest independence  phidias  a very famous greek sculptor of the 5th century bc  sago said fuller drawing near to the young indian who did not betray surprise or emotion of any sort as the strangers footfall came unexpectedly on his ear using the salutation of convention as it is so generally practiced between the two races the indian threw forward an arm with dignity but maintained his erect and otherwise immovable attitude  sago  a term of greeting as cooper believed among american indians  oneida demanded fuller while he doubted if any young warrior of that halfsubdued tribe could retain so completely the air and mien of the great forests and distant prairies  seneca was the simple answer the word was uttered in a tone so low and melancholy that it sounded like saddened music nothing that fuller had ever before heard conveyed so much meaning so simply and in so few syllables it illuminated the long vista of the past and cast a gloomy shadow into that of the future alluding to a people driven from their haunts never to find another restingplace on earth that this young warrior so meant to express himselfnot in an abject attempt to extort sympathy but in the noble simplicity of a heart depressed by the fall of his racefuller could not doubt and every generous feeling of his soul was enlisted in behalf of this young indian  seneca he repeated slowly dropping his voice to something like the soft deep tones of the other then you are in your own country here  my country answered the red man coldly no my fathers country yes  his english was good denoting more than a common education though it had a slightly foreign or peculiar accent the intonations of his voice were decidedly those of the indian  you have come to visit the land of your fathers  a slight wave of the hand was the reply all this time the young seneca kept his eye fastened in one direction apparently regarding some object in the lake fuller could see nothing to attract this nearly riveted gaze though curiosity induced him to make the effort  you admire this sheet of water by the earnest manner in which you look upon it observed fuller  see exclaimed the indian motioning toward a point near a mile distant he moves may be he will come here  moves i see nothing but land water and sky what moves  the swimming seneca for a thousand winters he is to swim in the waters of this lake such is the tradition of my people five hundred winters are gone by since he was thrown into the lake five hundred more must come before he will sink the curse of the manitou is on him fire will not burn him water will not swallow him up the fish will not go near him even the accursed axe of the settler can not cut him into chips there he floats and must float until his time is finished  swimming seneca  though i have been unable to discover any genuine native american origin for this legend a detailed variation of it can be found in a poem outalissa by rev ralph hoyt published in sketches by rev hoyt vol viii new york c shepard nd ca 1848 the geneva college library copy of which is inscribed delancey and may have belonged to the family of coopers brotherinlaw episcopal bishop of western new york william heathcote de lancey 17971865 who lived in genevaa somewhat different version forms the geneva hobart college student legend of chief agayentha or the floating chief  you must mean the wandering jew  so the palefaces call him but he was never a jew tis a chief of the senecas thrown into the lake by the great spirit for his bad conduct whenever he tries to get upon the land the spirit speaks to him from the caves below and he obeys  that must mean the lake gun  so the palefaces call it it is not strange that the names of the red man and of the palefaces should differ  the races are not the same and each has its own traditions i wish to hear what the senecas say about this floating tree but first have the goodness to point it out to me  the young indian did as fuller requested aided by the keener vision of the red man our traveler at length got a glimpse of a distant speck on the water which his companion assured him was the object of their mutual search he himself had been looking for the jew a week but had asked no assistance from others relying on the keenness of his sight and the accuracy of his traditions that very morning he had first discovered the speck on the water which he now pointed out to his companion  you think then that yonder object is the wandering jew asked fuller  it is the swimming seneca five hundred winters has he been obliged to keep in the chilled waters of the lake in five hundred more the manitou will let him rest on its bottom  what was the offense that has drawn down upon this chief so severe a punishment  listen to our traditions and you shall know when the great spirit created man he gave him laws to obey and duties to perform  excuse me seneca but your language is so good that i hardly know what to make of you  an almost imperceptible smile played about the compressed lip of the young indian who at first seemed disposed to evade an explanation but on reflection he changed his purpose and communicated to fuller the outlines of a very simple and by no means unusual history he was a chief of the highest race in his tribe and had been selected to receive the education of a paleface at one of the colleges of that people he had received a degree and yielding to the irrepressible longings of what might almost be termed his nature he no sooner left the college in which he had been educated than he resumed the blanket and leggings under the influence of early recollections and a mistaken appreciation of the comparative advantages between the civilized condition and those of a life passed in the forest and on the prairies in this respect our young seneca resembles the white american who after a run of six months in europe returns home with the patriotic declaration in his mouth that his native land is preferable to all other lands fuller soon understood the case when both reverted to their common object in coming thither the young seneca thereupon resumed his explanation  the young indian  almost certainly based on abraham la fort or dehatkatons 17991848 an oneida indian who attended geneva college in the late 1820s but who later abandoned christianity and returned to his traditional way of life  these laws of the great spirit continued the seneca were not difficult to obey so long as the warrior was of a humble mind and believed himself inferior to the manitou who had fashioned him with his hands and placed him between the seneca and the cayuga to hunt the deer and trap the beaver but seewise was one of those who practiced arts that you palefaces condemn while you submit to them he was a demagogue among the red men and set up the tribe in opposition to the manitou  seewise  intended to represent william henry sewards surname  how exclaimed fuller did the dwellers in the forest suffer by such practices  men are every where the same let the color or the tribe or the country be what it may it was a law of our people one which tradition tells us came direct from the great spirit that the fish should be taken only in certain seasons and for so many moons some thought this law was for the health of the people others that it was to enable the fish to multiply for the future all believed it wise because it came from the manitou and had descended to the tribe through so many generations all but seewise he said that an indian ought to fish when and where he pleased that a warrior was not a woman that the spear and the hook had been given to him to be used like the bow and arrow and that none but cowardly indians would scruple to take the fish when they wished such opinions pleased the common indians who love to believe themselves greater than they are seewise grew bolder by success until he dared to say in council that the red men made the world themselves and for themselves and that they could do with it what they pleased he saw no use in any night it was inconvenient an indian could sleep in the light as well as in the darkness there was to be eternal day then the hunt could go on until the deer was killed or the bear treed the young indians liked such talk they loved to be told they were the equals of the great spirit they declared that seewise should be their principal chief seewise opened his ears wide to this talk and the young men listened to his words as they listened to the song of the mockingbird they liked each other because they praised each other it is sweet to be told that we are better and wiser than all around us it is sweet to the red man the palefaces may have more sober minds  the seneca paused an instant and fuller fancied that a smile of irony again struggled about his compressed lip as the traveler made no remark however the youthful warrior resumed his tale  i hear a great deal of what demagogues are doing among your people and of the evil they produce they begin by flattering and end by ruling he carries a strong hand who makes all near him help to uphold it in the crowd few perceive its weight until it crushes them  thus was it with seewise half the young men listened to him and followed in his trail the aged chiefs took counsel together they saw that all the ancient traditions were despised and that new conduct was likely to come in with new opinions they were too old to change what was done has never been said but seewise disappeared it was whispered that he had gone down among the fish he loved to take out of season there is one tradition that he speared an enormous salmon and the fish in its struggles drew him out of his canoe and that his hands could not let go of the handle of his spear let this be as it may no one ever saw seewise any more in the form in which he had been known to his people at length the trunk of a tree was seen floating about the seneca and one of the oldest of the chiefs pointing to it pronounced the name of seewise he would fish out of season and his spirit is condemned they say to float among the salmon and trout and eels for a thousand winters it was not long after this that the lake began to speak in a voice loud as the thunder from the clouds the seneca traditions say this is the manitou calling to seewise when he goes down after the fish out of season  and do you an educated man believe in this tale asked fuller  i can not say the things learned in childhood remain the longest on the memory they make the deepest marks i have seen the evil that a demagogue can do among the palefaces why should i not believe the same among my own people  this is well enough as respects the curse on the demagogue but lakes do not usually  fuller had got thus far when the seneca as if in mockery emitted the sound that has obtained the name of the lake gun among those who have lived on its banks in these later times perhaps it was in part the influence of the senecas legend united to the opinions and statements of the inhabitants of that region which conspired to make our traveler start in awe and surprise for certainly the deepmouthed cannon never gave forth a more impressive and sudden concussion on the ear  it does indeed sound very like a gun said fuller after a long pause had enabled him to speak  it is the voice of the great spirit forbidding seewise to fish answered the seneca for a time the demagogue has all the talking to himself but sooner or later the voice of truth is heard which is the voice of the manitou but i must go nearer to the treeha what has become of it  fuller looked and sure enough the speck on the water had vanished this might have been by an unobserved movement in a current or it might have been owing to a sudden variation in the light certain it was no tree could now be seen fuller then proposed to use his boat in endeavoring to get nearer to the jew the seneca gave a very cheerful assent and throwing his light summer blanket with an air of manly grace over a shoulder he followed to the waterside  most red men resumed the young warrior as he took his place in the boat would see something marvelous in this appearance and disappearance of the swimming seneca and would hesitate about going any nearer to him but this is not my feelingerror is strengthened by neglecting to look into truth i hope yet to go near seewise  fuller hardly knew what to think of his companions credulity at times he appeared to defer to the marvelous and the traditions of his tribe then again the lights of education would seem to gleam upon the darkness of his superstition and leave him a man of inductive reason as for himself he was probably not altogether as much of the last as his pride of race would have led him to hope  peter had seen nothing but he had heard the gun  t was a mere flash in the pan to what i have heard when the lake is in arnest said the old fellow with the love of exaggeration so common with the vulgar still it was a gun  a signal that the wandering jew is near by so haul aft the sheets and let us depart  in a quarter of an hour the boat was lying with her foresheet hauled over and her helm down within a hundred yards of the object of the long search of the whole party it was deep water and a slight ripple under what might be termed the cutwater of the tree indicated a movement perhaps a lower current forced forward the roots which in their turn urged the trunk ahead as often happens in such cases the accidental formation of the original fracture aided by the action of the weather had given to the end of the trunk a certain resemblance to a human countenance peter was the first to point out the peculiarity which he looked upon uneasily fuller soon observed it and said the aspect was in sooth that of a demagogue the forehead retreated the face was hatchetshaped while the entire expression was selfish yet undecided as for the seneca he gazed on these signs with wonder mingled with awe  hatchet shaped  william henry seward was famous for his angular hatchetshaped nose  we see here the wicked seewise the great spiritcall him manitou or call him goddoes not forget what is wrong or what is right the wicked may flourish for a while but there is a law that is certain to bring him within the power of punishment evil spirits go up and down among us but there is a limit they can not pass but indians like this swimming seneca do much harm they mislead the ignorant arouse evil passions and raise themselves into authority by their dupes the man who tells the people their faults is a truer friend than he who harps only on their good qualities be that only a tree or be it a man bound in this form for a thousand winters by the hand of the great spirit it tells the same story seewise did once live his career comes to us in traditions and we believe all that our fathers told us accursed be the man who deceives and who opens his mouth only to lie accursed too is the land that neglects the counsels of the fathers to follow those of the sons  there is a remarkable resemblance between this little incident in the history of the senecas and events that are passing among our palefaced race of the present age men who in their hearts really care no more for mankind than seewise cared for the fish lift their voices in shouts of a spurious humanity in order to raise themselves to power on the shoulders of an excited populace bloodshed domestic violence impracticable efforts to attain an impossible perfection and all the evils of a civil conflict are forgotten or blindly attempted in order to raise themselves in the arms of those they call the people  i know your present condition answered the young seneca openly smiling the manitou may have ordered it for your good trust to him there are days in which the sun is not seenwhen a lurid darkness brings a second night over the earth it matters not the great luminary is always there there may be clouds before his face but the winds will blow them away the man or the people that trust in god will find a lake for every seewise
