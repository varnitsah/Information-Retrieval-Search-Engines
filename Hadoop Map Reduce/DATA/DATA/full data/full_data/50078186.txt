50078186	the library     contents  prefatory note an apology for the bookhunter the library the books of the collector illustrated books    books books again and books once more these are our theme which some miscall mere madness setting little store by copies either short or tall but you o slaves of shelf and stall we rather write for you that hold patched folios dear and prize the small rare volume black with tarnished gold a d    prefatory note    the pages in this volume on illuminated and other mss with the exception of some anecdotes about bussy rabutin and julie de rambouillet have been contributed by the rev w j loftie who has also written on early printed books pp 9495  the pages on the biblioklept pp 4656 are reprinted with the editors kind permission from the saturday review and a few remarks on the moral lessons of bookstalls are taken from an essay in the same journal  mr ingram bywater fellow of exeter college and lately sub librarian of the bodleian has very kindly read through the proofs of chapters i ii and iii and suggested some alterations  thanks are also due to mr t r buchanan fellow of all souls college for two plates from his bookbindings in all souls library printed for private circulation which he has been good enough to lend me  the plates are beautifully drawn and coloured by dr j j wild  messrs george bell  sons messrs bradbury agnew  co and messrs chatto  windus must be thanked for the use of some of the woodcuts which illustrate the concluding chapter a l    an apology for the bookhunter    all men says dr dibdin like to be their own librarians  a writer on the library has no business to lay down the law as to the books that even the most inexperienced amateurs should try to collect  there are books which no lover of literature can afford to be without classics ancient and modern on which the world has pronounced its verdict  these works in whatever shape we may be able to possess them are the necessary foundations of even the smallest collections  homer dante and milton shakespeare and sophocles aristophanes and moliere thucydides tacitus and gibbon swift and scottthese every lover of letters will desire to possess in the original languages or in translations  the list of such classics is short indeed and when we go beyond it the tastes of men begin to differ very widely  an assortment of broadsheet ballads and scrapbooks bought in boyhood was the nucleus of scotts library rich in the works of poets and magicians of alchemists and anecdotists  a childish liking for coloured prints of stage characters may be the germ of a theatrical collection like those of douce and malone and cousin  people who are studying any past period of human history or any old phase or expression of human genius will eagerly collect little contemporary volumes which seem trash to other amateurs  for example to a student of moliere it is a happy chance to come across la carte du royaume des pretieusesthe map of the kingdom of the precieuseswritten the year before the comedian brought out his famous play les precieuses ridicules  this geographical tract appeared in the very recueil des pieces choisies whose authors magdelon in the play was expecting to entertain when mascarille made his appearance  there is a faculty which horace walpole named serendipitythe luck of falling on just the literary document which one wants at the moment  all collectors of out of the way books know the pleasure of the exercise of serendipity but they enjoy it in different ways  one man will go home hugging a volume of sermons another with a bulky collection of catalogues which would have distended the pockets even of the wide greatcoat made for the purpose that charles nodier used to wear when he went a bookhunting  others are captivated by black letter others by the plays of such obscurities as nabbes and glapthorne  but however various the tastes of collectors of books they are all agreed on one pointthe love of printed paper  even an elzevir man can sympathise with charles lambs attachment to that folio beaumont and fletcher which he dragged home late at night from barkers in covent garden  but it is another thing when lamb says i do not care for a first folio of shakespeare  a bibliophile who could say this could say anything  no there are in every period of taste books which apart from their literary value all collectors admit to possess if not for themselves then for others of the brotherhood a peculiar preciousness  these books are esteemed for curiosity for beauty of type paper binding and illustrations for some connection they may have with famous people of the past or for their rarity  it is about these books the method of preserving them their enemies the places in which to hunt for them that the following pages are to treat  it is a subject more closely connected with the taste for curiosities than with art strictly so called  we are to be occupied not so much with literature as with books not so much with criticism as with bibliography the quaint duenna of literature a study apparently dry but not without its humours and here an apology must be made for the frequent allusions and anecdotes derived from french writers  these are as unavoidable almost as the use of french terms of the sport in tennis and in fencing  in bibliography in the care for books as books the french are still the teachers of europe as they were in tennis and are in fencing  thus richard de bury chancellor of edward iii writes in his philobiblon oh god of gods in zion what a rushing river of joy gladdens my heart as often as i have a chance of going to paris  there the days seem always short there are the goodly collections on the delicate fragrant bookshelves  since dante wrote of    lonor di quell arte ch allumare e chiamata in parisi   the art that is called illuminating in paris and all the other arts of writing printing binding books have been most skilfully practised by france  she improved on the lessons given by germany and italy in these crafts  twenty books about books are written in paris for one that is published in england  in our country dibdin is out of date the second edition of his bibliomania was published in 1811 and mr hill burtons humorous bookhunter is out of print  meanwhile in france writers grave and gay from the gigantic industry of brunet to nodiers quaint fancy and janins wit and the always entertaining bibliophile jacob paul lacroix have written or are writing on books manuscripts engravings editions and bindings  in england therefore rare french books are eagerly sought and may be found in all the booksellers catalogues  on the continent there is no such care for our curious or beautiful editions old or new  here a hint may be given to the collector  if he picks up a rare french book at a low price he would act prudently in having it bound in france by a good craftsman  its value when the wicked day of destiny comes and the collection is broken up will thus be made secure  for the french do not suffer our english bindings gladly while we have no narrow prejudice against the works of lortic and cape but the reverse  for these reasons then and also because every writer is obliged to make the closest acquaintance with books in the direction where his own studies lie the writings of french authorities are frequently cited in the following pages  this apology must be followed by a brief defence of the taste and passion of bookcollecting and of the class of men known invidiously as bookworms and bookhunters  they and their simple pleasures are the butts of a cheap and shrewish set of critics who cannot endure in others a taste which is absent in themselves important new books have actually been condemned of late years because they were printed on good paper and a valuable historical treatise was attacked by reviewers quite angrily because its outward array was not mean and forbidding  of course critics who take this view of new books have no patience with persons who care for margins and condition and early copies of old books  we cannot hope to convert the adversary but it is not necessary to be disturbed by his clamour  people are happier for the possession of a taste as long as they possess it and it does not like the demons of scripture possess them  the wise collector gets instruction and pleasure from his pursuit and it may well be that in the long run he and his family do not lose money  the amusement may chance to prove a very fair investment  as to this question of making money by collecting mr hill burton speaks very distinctly in the bookhunter where money is the object let a man speculate or become a miser   let not the collector ever unless in some urgent and necessary circumstances part with any of his treasures  let him not even have recourse to that practice called barter which political philosophers tell us is the universal resource of mankind preparatory to the invention of money  let him confine all his transactions in the market to purchasing only  no good comes of gentlemenamateurs buying and selling  there is room for difference of opinion here but there seems to be most reason on the side of mr hill burton  it is one thing for the collector to be able to reflect that the money he expends on books is not lost and that his family may find themselves richer not poorer because he indulged his taste  it is quite another thing to buy books as a speculator buys shares meaning to sell again at a profit as soon as occasion offers  it is necessary also to warn the beginner against indulging extravagant hopes  he must buy experience with his books and many of his first purchases are likely to disappoint him  he will pay dearly for the wrong caesar of 1635 the one without errors in pagination and this is only a common example of the beginners blunders collecting is like other forms of sport the aim is not certain at first the amateur is nervous and as in angling is apt to strike a bargain too hurriedly  i often think that the pleasure of collecting is like that of sport people talk of bookhunting and the old latin motto says that one never wearies of the chase in this forest  but the analogy to angling seems even stronger  a collector walks in the london or paris streets as he does by tweed or spey  many a lordly mart of books he passes like mr quaritchs mr tooveys or m fontaines or the shining store of mm morgand et fatout in the passage des panoramas  here i always feel like brassicanus in the king of hungarys collection non in bibliotheca sed in gremio jovis not in a library but in paradise  it is not given to every one to cast angle in these preserves  they are kept for dukes and millionaires  surely the old duke of roxburghe was the happiest of mortals for to him both the chief bookshops and auction rooms and the famous salmon streams of floors were equally open and he revelled in the prime of bookcollecting and of angling  but there are little tributary streets with humbler stalls shy pools as it were where the humbler fisher of books may hope to raise an elzevir or an old french play a first edition of shelley or a restoration comedy  it is usually a case of hope unfulfilled but the merest nibble of a rare book say marstons poems in the original edition or beddoess loves arrow poisoned or bankess bay horse in a trance or the mel heliconicum of alexander ross or les oeuvres de clement marot de cahors vallet de chambre du roy a paris ches pierre gaultier 1551 even a chance at something of this sort will kindle the waning excitement and add a pleasure to a mans walk in muddy london  then suppose you purchase for a couple of shillings the histoire des amours de henry iv et autres pieces curieuses a leyde chez jean sambyx elzevir 1664 it is certainly not unpleasant on consulting m fontaines catalogue to find that he offers the same work at the ransom of 10 pounds  the beginner thinks himself in singular luck even though he has no idea of vending his collection and he never reflects that conditionspotless white leaves and broad margins make the market value of a book  setting aside such bare considerations of profit the sport given by bookstalls is full of variety and charm  in london it may be pursued in most of the cross streets that stretch a dirty net between the british museum and the strand  there are other more shy and less frequently poached resorts which the amateur may be allowed to find out for himself  in paris there is the long sweep of the quais where some eighty bouquinistes set their boxes on the walls of the embankment of the seine  there are few country towns so small but that books occasionally rare and valuable may be found lurking in secondhand furniture warehouses  this is one of the advantages of living in an old country  the colonies are not the home for a collector  i have seen an australian bibliophile enraptured by the rare chance of buying in melbourne an early work onthe history of port jackson  this seems but poor game  but in europe an amateur has always occupation for his odd moments in town and is for ever lured on by the radiant apparition of hope  all collectors tell their anecdotes of wonderful luck and magnificent discoveries  there is a volume voyages litteraires sur les quais de paris paris durand 1857 by m de fontaine de resbecq which might convert the dullest soul to bookhunting  m de resbecq and his friends had the most amazing good fortune  a m n found six original plays of moliere worth perhaps as many hundreds of pounds bound up with garths dispensary an english poem which has long lost its vogue  it is worth while indeed to examine all volumes marked miscellanea essays and the like and treasures may possibly lurk as snuffy davy knew within the battered sheepskin of school books  books lie in out of the way places poggio rescued quintilian from the counter of a wood merchant the best time for bookhunting in paris is the early morning  the take as anglers say is on from halfpast seven to halfpast nine am  at these hours the vendors exhibit their fresh wares and the agents of the more wealthy booksellers come and pick up everything worth having  these agents quite spoil the sport of the amateur  they keep a strict watch on every country dealers catalogue snap up all he has worth selling and sell it over again charging pounds in place of shillings  but m de resbecq vows that he once picked up a copy of the first edition of la rochefoucaulds maxims out of a box which two booksellers had just searched  the same collector got together very promptly all the original editions of la bruyere and he even found a copy of the elzevir pastissier francais at the humble price of six sous  now the  pastissier francais an illprinted little cookerybook of the elzevirs has lately fetched 600 pounds at a sale  the antiquarys story of snuffy davy and the game of chess is dwarfed by the luck of m de resbecq  not one amateur in a thousand can expect such good fortune  there is however a recent instance of a rugby boy who picked up on a stall a few fluttering leaves hanging together on a flimsy thread  the old woman who kept the stall could hardly be induced to accept the large sum of a shilling for an original quarto of shakespeares king john  these stories are told that none may despair  that none may be over confident an author may recount his own experience  the only odd trouvaille that ever fell to me was a clean copy of la journee chretienne with the name of leon gambetta 1844 on its catholic flyleaf  rare books grow rarer every day and often tis only hope that remains at the bottom of the fourpenny boxes  yet the paris bookhunters cleave to the game august is their favourite season for in august there is least competition  very few people are as a rule in paris and these are not tempted to loiter  the bookseller is drowsy and glad not to have the trouble of chaffering  the english go past and do not tarry beside a row of dusty boxes of books  the heat threatens the amateur with sunstroke  then says m octave uzanne in a prose ballade of bookhuntersthen calm glad heroic the bouquineurs prowl forth refreshed with hope  the brown old calfskin wrinkles in the sun the leaves crackle you could poach an egg on the cover of a quarto  the dome of the institute glitters the sickly trees seem to wither their leaves wax red and grey a faint warm wind is walking the streets  under his vast umbrella the bookhunter is secure and content he enjoys the pleasures of the sport unvexed by poachers and thinks less of the heat than does the deerstalker on the bare hillside  there is plenty of morality if there are few rare books in the stalls  the decay of affection the breaking of friendship the decline of ambition are all illustrated in these fourpenny collections  the presentation volumes are here which the author gave in the pride of his heart to the poet who was his master to the critic whom he feared to the friend with whom he was on terms of mutual admiration  the critic has not even cut the leaves the poet has brusquely torn three or four apart with his finger and thumb the friend has grown cold and has let the poems slip into some corner of his library whence they were removed on some day of doom and of general clearing out  the sale of the library of a late learned prelate who had boileaus hatred of a dull book was a scene to be avoided by his literary friends  the bishop always gave the works which were offered to him a fair chance  he read till he could read no longer cutting the pages as he went and thus his progress could be traced like that of a backwoodsman who blazes his way through a primeval forest  the paperknife generally ceased to do duty before the thirtieth page  the melancholy of the book hunter is aroused by two questions whence and whither  the bibliophile asks about his books the question which the metaphysician asks about his soul  whence came they  their value depends a good deal on the answer  if they are stamped with arms then there is a book armorial du bibliophile by m guigard which tells you who was their original owner  any one of twenty coatsofarms on the leather is worth a hundred times the value of the volume which it covers  if there is no such mark the fancy is left to devise a romance about the first owner and all the hands through which the book has passed  that vanini came from a jesuit college where it was kept under lock and key  that copy of agrippa de vanitate scientiarum is marked in a crabbed hand and in faded ink with cynical latin notes  what pessimist two hundred years ago made his grumbling so permanent  one can only guess but part of the imaginative joys of the bookhunter lies  in the fruitless conjecture  that other question whither is graver  whither are our treasures to be scattered  will they find kind masters or worst fate of books fall into the hands of women who will sell them to the trunkmaker  are the leaves to line a box or to curl a maidens locks  are the rarities to become more and more rare and at last fetch prodigious prices  some unlucky men are able partly to solve these problems in their own lifetime  they are constrained to sell their librariesan experience full of bitterness wrath and disappointment  selling books is nearly as bad as losing friends than which life has no worse sorrow  a book is a friend whose face is constantly changing  if you read it when you are recovering from an illness and return to it years after it is changed surely with the change in yourself  as a mans tastes and opinions are developed his books put on a different aspect  he hardly knows the poems and ballads he used to declaim and cannot recover the enigmatic charm of sordello  books change like friends like ourselves like everything but they are most piquant in the contrasts they provoke when the friend who gave them and wrote them is a success though we laughed at him a failure though we believed in him altered in any case and estranged from his old self and old days  the vanished past returns when we look at the pages  the vicissitudes of years are printed and packed in a thin octavo and the shivering ghosts of desire and hope return to their forbidden home in the heart and fancy  it is as well to have the power of recalling them always at hand and to be able to take a comprehensive glance at the emotions which were so powerful and full of life and now are more faded and of less account than the memory of the dreams of childhood  it is because our books are friends that do change and remind us of change that we should keep them with us even at a little inconvenience and not turn them adrift in the world to find a dusty asylum in cheap bookstalls  we are a part of all that we have read to parody the saying of mr tennysons ulysses and we owe some respect and houseroom at least to the early acquaintances who have begun to bore us and remind us of the vanity of ambition and the weakness of human purpose  old school and college books even have a reproachful and salutary power of whispering how much a man knew and at the cost of how much trouble that he has absolutely forgotten and is neither the better nor the worse for it  it will be the same in the case of the books he is eager about now though to be sure he will read with less care and forget with an ease and readiness only to be acquired by practice  but we were apologising for bookhunting not because it teaches moral lessons as dauncyng also does according to sir thomas elyot in the boke called the gouvernour but because it affords a kind of sportive excitement  bookstalls are not the only field of the chase  book catalogues which reach the collector through the post give him all the pleasures of the sport at home  he reads the booksellers catalogues eagerly he marks his chosen sport with pencil he writes by return of post or he telegraphs to the vendor unfortunately he almost always finds that he has been forestalled probably by some booksellers agent  when the catalogue is a french one it is obvious that parisians have the pick of the market before our slow letters reach m claudin or m labitte  still the catalogues themselves are a kind of lesson in bibliography  you see from them how prices are ruling and you can gloat in fancy over de luynes edition of moliere 1673 two volumes in red morocco double trautz bauzonnet or some other vanity hopelessly out of reach  in their catalogues mm morgand and fatout print a facsimile of the frontispiece of this very rare edition  the bust of moliere occupies the centre and portraits of the great actor as sganarelle and mascarille of the precieuses ridicules stand on either side  in the second volume are moliere and his wife armande crowned by the muse thalia  a catalogue which contains such exact reproductions of rare and authentic portraits is itself a work of art and serviceable to the student  when the shop of a bookseller with a promising catalogue which arrives over night is not too far distant bibliophiles have been known to rush to the spot in the grey morning before the doors open  there are amateurs however who prefer to stay comfortably at home and pity these poor fanatics shivering in the rain outside a door in oxford street or booksellers row  there is a length to which enthusiasm cannot go and many collectors draw the line at rising early in the morning  but when we think of the sport of bookhunting it is to sales in auctionrooms that the mind naturally turns  here the rival buyers feel the passion of emulation and it was in an auctionroom that guibert de pixerecourt being outbid said in tones of mortal hatred i will have the book when your collection is sold after your death  and he kept his word  the fever of gambling is not absent from the auctionroom and people bid jealous as they sometimes ride jealous in the huntingfield yet the neophyte if he strolls by chance into a saleroom will be surprised at the spectacle  the chamber has the look of a rather seedy hell  the crowd round the auctioneers box contains many persons so dingy and semitic that at monte carlo they would be refused admittance while in germany they would be persecuted by herr von treitschke with christian ardour  bidding is languid and valuable books are knocked down for trifling sums  let the neophyte try his luck however and prices will rise wonderfully  the fact is that the sale is a knock out  the bidders are professionals in a league to let the volumes go cheap and to distribute them afterwards among themselves  thus an amateur can have a good deal of sport by bidding for a book till it reaches its proper value and by then leaving in the lurch the professionals who combine to run him up  the amusement has its obvious perils but the presence of gentlemen in an auctionroom is a relief to the auctioneer and to the owner of the books  a bidder must be able to command his temper both that he may be able to keep his head cool when tempted to bid recklessly and that he may disregard the not very carefully concealed sneers of the professionals  in bookhunting the nature of the quarry varies with the taste of the collector  one man is for bibles another for ballads  some pursue plays others look for play bills  he was not says mr hill burton speaking of kirkpatrick sharpe he was not a black letter man or a tall copyist or an uncut man or a roughedge man or an earlyenglish dramatist or an elzevirian or a broadsider or a pasquinader or an old brown calf man or a grangerite 1 or a tawny moroccoite or a gilt topper or a marbled insider or an editio princeps man  these nicknames briefly dispose into categories a good many species of collectors  but there are plenty of others  you may be a historicalbindings man and hunt for books that were bound by the great artists of the past and belonged to illustrious collectors  or you may be a jametist and try to gather up the volumes on which jamet the friend of louis racine scribbled his cynical marginalia  or you may covet the earliest editions of modern poetsshelley keats or tennyson or even ebenezer jones or the object of your desires may be the books of the french romanticists who flourished so freely in 1830  or being a person of large fortune and landed estate you may collect country histories  again your heart may be set on the books illustrated by eisen cochin and gravelot or stothard and blake in the last century  or you may be so oldfashioned as to care for aldine classics and for the books of the giunta press  in fact as many as are the species of rare and beautiful books so many are the species of collectors  there is one sort of men modest but not unwise in their generations who buy up the pretty books published in very limited editions by french booksellers like mm lemerre and jouaust  already their reprints of rochefoucaulds first edition of beaumarchais of la fontaine of the lyrics attributed to moliere and other volumes are exhausted and fetch high prices in the market  by a singular caprice the little volumes of mr thackerays miscellaneous writings in yellow paper wrappers when they are first editions have become objects of desire and their old modest price is increased twenty fold  it is not always easy to account for these freaks of fashion but even in bookcollecting there are certain definite laws  why do you pay a large price for a dingy old book outsiders ask when a clean modern reprint can be procured for two or three shillings  to this question the collector has several replies which he at least finds satisfactory  in the first place early editions published during a great authors lifetime and under his supervision have authentic texts  the changes in them are the changes that prior or la bruyere themselves made and approved  you can study in these old editions the alterations in their taste the history of their minds  the case is the same even with contemporary authors  one likes to have mr tennysons poems chiefly lyrical london  effingham wilson royal exchange cornhill 1830  it is fifty years old this little book of one hundred and fiftyfour pages this first fruit of a stately tree  in half a century the poet has altered much and withdrawn much but already in 1830 he had found his distinctive note and his mariana is a masterpiece  mariana is in all the collections but pieces of which the execution is less certain must be sought only in the old volume of 1830  in the same way the strayed reveller and other poems by a  london  b fellowes ludgate street 1849 contains much that mr matthew arnold has altered and this volume like the suppressed empedocles on etna and other poems by a 1852 appeals more to the collector than do the new editions which all the world may possess  there are verses curious in their way in mr cloughs ambarvalia 1849 which you will not find in his posthumous edition but which repay perusal  these minutiae of literary history become infinitely more important in the early editions of the great classical writers and the bookcollector may regard his taste as a kind of handmaid of critical science  the preservation of rare books and the collection of materials for criticism are the useful functions then of bookcollecting  but it is not to be denied that the sentimental side of the pursuit gives it most of its charm  old books are often literary relics and as dear and sacred to the lover of literature as are relics of another sort to the religious devotee  the amateur likes to see the book in its form as the author knew it  he takes a pious pleasure in the first edition of les precieuses ridicules mdclx just as moliere saw it when he was fresh in the business of authorship and wrote mon dieu quun autheur est neuf la premiere fois quon limprime  all editions published during a great mans life have this attraction and seem to bring us closer to his spirit  other volumes are relics as we shall see later of some famed collector and there is a certain piety in the care we give to books once dear to longepierre or harley or dhoym or buckle to madame de maintenon or walpole to grolier or askew or de thou or heber such copies should be handed down from worthy owners to owners not unworthy such servants of literature should never have careless masters  a man may prefer to read for pleasure in a good clear reprint  m charpentiers montaigne serves the turn but it is natural to treasure more les essais de michel seigneur de montaigne that were printed by francoise le febre of lyon in 1595  it is not a beautiful book the type is small and rather blunt but william drummond of hawthornden has written on the title page his name and his device cipresso e palma  there are a dozen modern editions of moliere more easily read than the four little volumes of wetstein amsterdam 1698 but these contain reduced copies of the original illustrations and here you see arnolphe and agnes in their habits as they lived moliere and mdlle de brie as the public of paris beheld them more than two hundred years ago sucklings fragmenta aurea contain a good deal of dross and most of the gold has been gathered into miscellanies but the original edition of 1646 after his own copies with the portrait of the jolly cavalier who died aetatis suae 28 has its own allurement theocritus is more easily read perhaps in wordsworths edition or zieglers but that which zacharias calliergi printed in rome 1516 with an excommunication from leo x against infringement of copyright will always be a beautiful and desirable book especially when bound by derome  the gist of the pious prince contis strictures on the wickedness of comedy may be read in various literary histories but it is natural to like his traite de la comedie selon la tradition de leglise tiree des conciles et des saints peres published by lovys billaine in 1660 especially when the tract is a clean copy arrayed in a decorous black morocco  these are but a few common examples chosen from a meagre little library a twopenny treasurehouse but they illustrate on a minute scale the nature of the collectors passionthe character of his innocent pleasures  he occasionally lights on other literary relics of a more personal character than mere first editions  a lucky collector lately bought shelleys copy of ossian with the poets signature on the titlepage in booksellers row  another possesses a copy of foppenss rare edition of petrarchs le sage resolu contre lune et lautre fortune which once belonged to sir hudson lowe the gaoler of napoleon and may have fortified by its stoical maxims the soul of one who knew the extremes of either fortune the captive of st helena  but the best example of a book which is also a relic is the imitatio christi which belonged to j j rousseau  let m tenant de latour lately the happy owner of this possession tell his own story of his treasure  it was in 1827 that m de latour was walking on the quai of the louvre  among the volumes in a shop he noticed a shabby little copy of the imitatio christi  m de latour like other bibliophiles was not in the habit of examining stray copies of this work except when they were of the elzevir size for the elzevirs published a famous undated copy of the imitatio a book which brings considerable prices however by some lucky chance some socratic daemon whispering may be in his ear he picked up the little dingy volume of the last century  it was of a paris edition 1751 but what was the name on the flyleaf  m de latour read a j j rousseau  there was no mistake about it the good bibliophile knew rousseaus handwriting perfectly well to make still more sure he paid his seventyfive centimes for the book and walked across the pont des arts to his bookbinders where he had a copy of rousseaus works with a facsimile of his handwriting  as he walked m de latour read in his book and found notes of rousseaus on the margin  the facsimile proved that the inscription was genuine  the happy de latour now made for the public office in which he was a functionary and rushed into the bureau of his friend the marquis de v  the marquis a man of great strength of character recognised the signature of rousseau with but little display of emotion  m de latour now noticed some withered flowers among the sacred pages but it was reserved for a friend to discover in the faded petals rousseaus favourite flower the periwinkle  like a true frenchman like rousseau himself in his younger days m de latour had not recognised the periwinkle when he saw it  that night so excited was m de latour he never closed an eye  what puzzled him was that he could not remember in all rousseaus works a single allusion to the imitatio christi  time went on the old book was not rebound but kept piously in a case of russia leather  m de latour did not suppose that dans ce bas monde it fut permis aux joies du bibliophile daller encore plus loin  he imagined that the delights of the amateur could only go further in heaven  it chanced however one day that he was turning over the oeuvres inedites of rousseau when he found a letter in which jean jacques writing in 1763 asked motierstravers to send him the imitatio christi  now the date 1764 is memorable in rousseaus confessions for a burst of sentiment over a periwinkle the first he had noticed particularly since his residence at les charmettes where the flower had been remarked by madame de warens  thus m tenant de latour had recovered the very identical periwinkle which caused the tear of sensibility to moisten the fine eyes of jean jacques rousseau  we cannot all be adorers of rousseau  but m de latour was an enthusiast and this little anecdote of his explains the sentimental side of the bibliophiles pursuit  yes it is sentiment that makes us feel a lively affection for the books that seem to connect us with great poets and students long ago dead  their hands grasp ours across the ages  i never see the first edition of homer that monument of typography and of enthusiasm for letters printed at florence 1488 at the expense of young bernardo and nerio nerli and of their friend giovanni acciajuoli but i feel moved to cry with heyne salvete juvenes nobiles et generosi greek text  such is our apology for bookcollecting  but the best defence of the taste would be a list of the names of great collectors a vision of mighty bookhunters  let us say nothing of seth and noah for their reputation as amateurs is only based on the authority of the tract de bibliothecis antediluvianis  the library of assurbanipal i pass over for its volumes were made as pliny says of coctiles laterculi of baked tiles which have been deciphered by the late mr george smith  philosophers as well as immemorial kings pharaohs and ptolemys are on our side  it was objected to plato by persons answering to the cheap scribblers of today that he though a sage gave a hundred minae 360 pounds for three treatises of philolaus while aristotle paid nearly thrice the sum for a few books that had been in the library of speusippus did not a latin philosopher go great lengths in a laudable anxiety to purchase an odyssey as old as homer and what would not cicero that great collector have given for the ascraean editio princeps of hesiod scratched on mouldy old plates of lead  perhaps dr schliemann may find an original edition of the iliad at orchomenos but of all early copies none seems so attractive as that engraved on the leaden plates which pausanias saw at ascra  then in modern times what great allies has the collector what brethren in bookhunting  the names are like the catalogue with which villon fills his ballade des seigneurs du temps jadis  a collector was le preux charlemaigne and our english alfred  the kings of hungary as mathias corvinus the kings of france and their queens and their mistresses and their lords were all amateurs  so was our henry viii and james i who wished he could be chained to a shelf in the bodleian  the middle age gives us richard de bury among ecclesiastics and the renaissance boasts sir thomas more with that pretty fardle of books in the small type of aldus which he carried for a freight to the people of utopia  men of the world like bussy rabutin queens like our elizabeth popes like innocent x financiers like colbert who made the grand turk send him levant morocco for bindings men of letters like scott and southey janin and nodier and paul lacroix warriors like junot and prince eugene these are only leaders of companies in the great army of lovers of books in which it is honourable enough to be a private soldier    the library    the library which is to be spoken of in these pages is all unlike the halls which a spencer or a huth fills with treasure beyond price  the age of great libraries has gone by and where a collector of the old school survives he is usually a man of enormous wealth who might if he pleased be distinguished in parliament in society on the turf itself or in any of the pursuits where unlimited supplies of money are strictly necessary the old amateurs whom la bruyere was wont to sneer at were not satisfied unless they possessed many thousands of books  for a collector like cardinal mazarin naude bought up the whole stock of many a bookseller and left great towns as bare of printed paper as if a tornado had passed and blown the leaves away  in our modern times as the industrious bibliophile jacob says the fashion of bookcollecting has changed from the vast hall that it was the library of the amateur has shrunk to a closet to a mere bookcase nothing but a neat article of furniture is needed now where a great gallery or a long suite of rooms was once required  the book has become as it were a jewel and is kept in a kind of jewelcase it is not quantity of pages nor lofty piles of ordinary binding nor theological folios and classic quartos that the modern amateur desires  he is content with but a few books of distinction and elegance masterpieces of printing and binding or relics of famous old collectors of statesmen philosophers beautiful dead ladies or again he buys illustrated books or first editions of the modern classics  no one not the duc daumale or m james rothschild himself with his 100 books worth 40000 pounds can possess very many copies of books which are inevitably rare  thus the adviser who would offer suggestions to the amateur need scarcely write like naude and the old authorities about the size and due position of the library  he need hardly warn the builder to make the salle face the east because the eastern winds being warm and dry of their nature greatly temper the air fortify the senses make subtle the humours purify the spirits preserve a healthy disposition of the whole body and to say all in one word are most wholesome and salubrious  the east wind like the fashion of book collecting has altered in character a good deal since the days when naude was librarian to cardinal mazarin  one might as well repeat the learned isidorus his counsels about the panels of green marble that refreshes the eye and boethius his censures on library walls of ivory and glass as fall back on the ancient ideas of librarians dead and gone  the amateur then is the person we have in our eye and especially the bibliophile who has but lately been bitten with this pleasant mania of collecting  we would teach him how to arrange and keep his books orderly and in good case and would tell him what to buy and what to avoid  by the library we do not understand a study where no one goes and where the master of the house keeps his boots an assortment of walkingsticks the waverley novels pearson on the creed humes essays and a collection of sermons  in alas too many english homes the library is no more than this and each generation passes without adding a book except now and then a bradshaw or a railway novel to the collection on the shelves  the success perhaps of circulating libraries or it may be the aryan tendencies of our race which does not read and lives in the open air have made books the rarest of possessions in many houses there are relics of the age before circulating libraries there are fragments of the lettered store of some scholarly greatgrandfather and these with a few odd numbers of magazines a few primers and manuals some sermons and novels make up the ordinary library of an english household  but the amateur whom we have in our thoughts can never be satisfied with these commonplace supplies  he has a taste for books more or less rare and for books neatly bound in short for books in the fabrication of which art has not been absent  he loves to have his study like montaignes remote from the interruption of servants wife and children a kind of shrine where he may be at home with himself with the illustrious dead and with the genius of literature  the room may look east west or south provided that it be dry warm light and airy  among the many enemies of books the first great foe is damp and we must describe the necessary precautions to be taken against this peril we will suppose that the amateur keeps his ordinary working books modern tomes and all that serve him as literary tools on open shelves  these may reach the roof if he has books to fill them and it is only necessary to see that the back of the bookcases are slightly removed from contact with the walls  the more precious and beautifully bound treasures will naturally be stored in a case with closelyfitting glassdoors 2  the shelves should be lined with velvet or chamois leather that the delicate edges of the books may not suffer from contact with the wood  a leather lining fitted to the back of the case will also help to keep out humidity  most writers recommend that the bookcases should be made of wood close in the grain such as wellseasoned oak or for smaller tabernacles of literature of mahogany satinwood lined with cedar ebony and so forth  these closegrained woods are less easily penetrated by insects and it is fancied that bookworms dislike the aromatic scents of cedar sandal wood and russia leather  there was once a bibliophile who said that a man could only love one book at a time and the darling of the moment he used to carry about in a charming leather case  others men of few books preserve them in long boxes with glass fronts which may be removed from place to place as readily as the household gods of laban  but the amateur who not only worships but reads books needs larger receptacles and in the open oak cases for modern authors and for books with common modern papers and bindings in the closed armoire for books of rarity and price he will find we think the most useful mode of arranging his treasures  his shelves will decline in height from the lowest where huge folios stand at case to the top ranges while elzevirs repose on a level with the eye  it is well that each upper shelf should have a leather fringe to keep the dust away  as to the shape of the bookcases and the furniture and ornaments of the library every amateur will please himself  perhaps the satinwood or mahogany tabernacles of rare books are best made after the model of what furnituredealers indifferently call the queen anne or the chippendale style  there is a pleasant quaintness in the carved architectural ornaments of the top and the inlaid flowers of marquetry go well with the pretty florid editions of the last century the books that were illustrated by stothard and gravelot  ebony suits theological tomes very well especially when they are bound in white vellum  as to furniture people who can afford it will imitate the arrangements of lucullus in mr hill burtons charming volume the bookhunter blackwood edinburgh 1862everything is of perfect finishthe mahoganyrailed gallery the tiny ladders the broad winged lecterns with leathern cushions on the edges to keep the wood from grazing the rich bindings the books themselves each shelf uniform with its facings or rather backings like welldressed lines at a review  the late sir william stirlingmaxwell a famous bibliophile invented a very nice library chair  it is most comfortable to sit on and as the top of the back is broad and flat it can be used as a ladder of two high steps when one wants to reach a book on a lofty shelf  a kind of square revolving bookcase an american invention manufactured by messrs trubner is useful to the working man of letters  made in oak stained green it is not unsightly  as to ornaments every man to his taste  you may have a pallid bust of pallas above your classical collection or fill the niches in a shrine of old french light literature pastoral and comedy with delicate shepherdesses in chelsea china  on such matters a modest writer like mr jingle when mr pickwick ordered dinner will not presume to dictate  next to damp dust and dirt are the chief enemies of books  at short intervals books and shelves ought to be dusted by the amateur himself  even dr johnson who was careless of his person and of volumes lent to him was careful about the cleanliness of his own books  boswell found him one day with big gloves on his hands beating the dust out of his library as was his custom  there is nothing so hideous as a dirty thumbmark on a white page  these marks are commonly made not because the reader has unwashed hands but because the dust which settles on the top edge of books falls in and is smudged when they are opened  gilttop edges should be smoothed with a handkerchief and a small brush should be kept for brushing the tops of books with rough edges before they are opened but it were well that all books had the top edge gilt  there is no better preservative against dust  dust not only dirties books it seems to supply what mr spencer would call a fitting environment for bookworms  the works of bookworms speak for themselves and are manifest to all  how many a rare and valuable volume is spoiled by neat round holes drilled through cover and leaves  but as to the nature of your worm authorities differ greatly  the ancients knew this plague of which lucian speaks  mr blades mentions a white bookworm slain by the librarian of the bodleian  in byzantium the black sort prevailed  evenus the grammarian wrote an epigram against the black bookworm anthol  pal ix 251   pest of the muses devourer of pages in crannies that lurkest fruits of the muses to taint labour of learning to spoil wherefore oh blackfleshed worm wert thou born for the evil thou workest wherefore thine own foul form shapst thou with envious toil   the learned mentzelius says he hath heard the bookworm crow like a cock unto his mate and i knew not says he whether some local fowl was clamouring or whether there was but a beating in mine ears even at that moment all uncertain as i was i perceived in the paper whereon i was writing a little insect that ceased not to carol like very chanticleer until taking a magnifying glass i assiduously observed him  he is about the bigness of a mite and carries a grey crest and the head low bowed over the bosom as to his crowing noise it comes of his clashing his wings against each other with an incessant din  thus far mentzelius and more to the same purpose as may be read in the memoirs of famous foreign academies dijon 175559 13 vol in quarto  but in our times the learned mr blades having a desire to exhibit bookworms in the body to the caxtonians at the caxton celebration could find few men that had so much as seen a bookworm much less heard him utter his native woodnotes wild  yet in his enemies of books he describes some rare encounters with the worm  dirty books damp books dusty books and books that the owner never opens are most exposed to the enemy and the worm the proud worm is the conqueror still as a didactic poet sings in an ode on mans mortality  as we have quoted mentzelius it may not be amiss to give dalemberts theory of bookworms  i believe he says that a little beetle lays her eggs in books in august thence is hatched a mite like the cheesemite which devours books merely because it is compelled to gnaw its way out into the air  bookworms like the paste which binders employ but dalembert adds that they cannot endure absinthe  mr blades finds too that they disdain to devour our adulterate modern paper  say shall i sing of rats asked grainger when reading to johnson his epic the sugarcane  no said the doctor and though rats are the foe of the bibliophile at least as much as of the sugar planter we do not propose to sing of them  m fertiault has done so already in les sonnets dun bibliophile where the reader must be pleased with the beautiful etchings of rats devouring an illuminated ms and battening on morocco bindings stamped with the bees of de thou  it is unnecessary and it would be undignified to give hints on ratcatching but the amateur must not forget that these animals have a passion for bindings  the bookcollector must avoid gas which deposits a filthy coat of oil that catches dust  mr blades found that three jets of gas in a small room soon reduced the leather on his bookshelves to a powder of the consistency of snuff and made the backs of books come away in his hand  shaded lamps give the best and most suitable light for the library  as to the risks which books run at the hands of the owner himself we surely need not repeat the advice of richard de bury  living in an age when tubs if not unknown as m michelet declares were far from being common the old collector inveighed against the dirty hands of readers and against their habit of marking their place in a book with filthy straws or setting down a beer pot in the middle of the volume to keep the pages open  but the amateur however refined himself must beware of men who love not fly leaves neither regard margins but write notes over the latter and light their pipes with the former  after seeing the wreck of a book which these persons have been busy with one appreciates the fine greek hyperbole  the greeks did not speak of thumbing but of walking up and down on a volume greek text to such fellows it matters not that they make a book dirty and greasy cutting the pages with their fingers and holding the boards over the fire till they crack  all these slatternly practices though they destroy a book as surely as the flames of caesars soldiers at alexandria seem fine manly acts to the grobians who use them  what says jules janin who has written contre lindifference des philistins il faut a lhomme sage et studieux un tome honorable et digne de sa louange  the amateur and all decent men will beware of lending books to such rude workers and this consideration brings us to these great foes of books the borrowers and robbers  the lending of books and of other property has been defended by some great authorities thus panurge himself says it would prove much more easy in nature to have fish entertained in the air and bullocks fed in the bottom of the ocean than to support or tolerate a rascally rabble of people that will not lend pirckheimer too for whom albert durer designed a bookplate was a lender and took for his device sibi et amicis and jo grolierii et amicorum was the motto of the renowned grolier whom mistaken writers vainly but frequently report to have been a bookbinder  but as mr leicester warren says in his study of bookplates pearson 1880 christian charles de savigny leaves all the rest behind exclaiming non mihi sed aliis  but the majority of amateurs have chosen wiser though more churlish devices as the ungodly borroweth and payeth not again or go to them that sell and buy for yourselves  david garrick engraved on his bookplate beside a bust of shakspeare these words of menage la premiere chose quon doit faire quand on a emprunte un livre cest de le lire afin de pouvoir le rendre plutot  but the borrower is so minded that the last thing he thinks of is to read a borrowed book and the penultimate subject of his reflections is its restoration menage menagiana paris 1729 vol i p 265 mentions as if it were a notable misdeed this of angelo politians he borrowed a lucretius from pomponius laetus and kept it for four years four years in the sight of the borrower it is but a moment  menage reports that a friend kept his pausanias for three years whereas four months was long enough   at quarto saltem mense redire decet   there is no satisfaction in lending a book for it is rarely that borrowers while they deface your volumes gather honey for new stores as de quincey did and coleridge and even dr johnson who greased and dogseared such volumes as were confided to his tender mercies with the same indifference wherewith he singed his own wigs  but there is a race of mortals more annoying to a conscientious man than borrowers  these are the spontaneous lenders who insist that you shall borrow their tomes  for my own part when i am oppressed with the charity of such i lock their books up in a drawer and behold them not again till the day of their return  there is no security against borrowers unless a man like guibert de pixerecourt steadfastly refuses to lend  the device of pixerecourt was un livre est un ami qui ne change jamais  but he knew that our books change when they have been borrowed like our friends when they have been married when a lady borrows them as the fairy queen says in the ballad of tamlane   but had i kennd tamlane she says a lady wad borrowed thee i wad taen out thy twa gray een put in twa een o tree  had i but kennd tamlane she says before ye came frae hame i wad taen out your heart o flesh put in a heart o stane   above the lintel of his library door pixerecourt had this couplet carved    tel est le triste sort de tout livre prete souvent il est perdu toujours il est gate   m paul lacroix says he would not have lent a book to his own daughter  once lacroix asked for the loan of a work of little value  pixerecourt frowned and led his friend beneath the doorway pointing to the motto  yes said m lacroix but i thought that verse applied to every one but me  so pixerecourt made him a present of the volume  we cannot all imitate this immense but unamiable amateur therefore bibliophiles have consoled themselves with the inventions of bookplates quaint representations perhaps heraldic perhaps fanciful of their claims to the possession of their own dear volumes  mr leicester warren and m poulet malassis have written the history of these slender works of art and each bibliophile may have his own engraved and may formulate his own anathemas on people who borrow and restore not again  the process is futile but may comfort the heart like the curses against thieves which the greeks were wont to scratch on leaden tablets and deposit in the temple of demeter  each amateur can exercise his own taste in the design of a bookplate and for such as love and collect rare editions of homer i venture to suggest this motto which may move the heart of the borrower to send back an aldine copy of the epic    greek text 3   mr william blades in his pleasant volume the enemies of books trubner makes no account of the bookthief or biblioklept  if they injure the owners says mr blades with real tolerance they do no harm to the books themselves by merely transferring them from one set of bookshelves to another  this sentence has naturally caused us to reflect on the ethical character of the biblioklept he is not always a bad man  in old times when language had its delicacies and moralists were not devoid of sensibility the french did not say un voleur de livres but un chipeur de livres as the papers call lady shoplifters kleptomaniacs  there are distinctions  m jules janin mentions a great parisian bookseller who had an amiable weakness  he was a bibliokleptomaniac  his first motion when he saw a book within reach was to put it in his pocket  every one knew his habit and when a volume was lost at a sale the auctioneer duly announced it and knocked it down to the enthusiast who regularly paid the price  when he went to a private view of books about to be sold the officials at the door would ask him as he was going out if he did not happen to have an elzevir horace or an aldine ovid in his pocket  then he would search those receptacles and exclaim yes yes here it is so much obliged to you i am so absent  m janin mentions an english noble a sir fitzgerald who had the same tastes but who unluckily fell into the hands of the police  yet m janin has a tenderness for the bookstealer who after all is a lover of books  the moral position of the malefactor is so delicate and difficult that we shall attempt to treat of it in the severe though rococo manner of aristotles ethics  here follows an extract from the lost aristotelian treatise concerning books  among the contemplative virtues we reckon the love of books  now this virtue like courage or liberality has its mean its excess and its defect  the defect is indifference and the man who is defective as to the love of books has no name in common parlance therefore we may call him the robustious philistine  this man will cut the leaves of his own or his friends volumes with the butter knife at breakfast  also he is just the person wilfully to mistake the double sense of the term flyleaves and to stick the fly leaves of his volumes full of flyhooks  he also loves dogsears and marks his place with his pipe when he shuts a book in a hurry or he will set the leg of his chair on a page to keep it open  he praises those who tear off margins for pipelights and he makes cigarettes with the tissuepaper that covers engravings  when his books are bound he sees that the margin is cut to the quick  he tells you too that he buys books to read them but he does not say why he thinks it needful to spoil them  also he will drag off bindingsor should we perhaps call this crime greek text or brutality rather than mere vice for vice is essentially human but to tear off bindings is bestial  thus they still speak of a certain monster who lived during the french revolution and who having purchased volumes attired in morocco and stamped with the devices of the oligarchs would rip off the leather or vellum and throw them into the fire or out of the window saying that now he could read with unwashed hands at his ease  such a person then is the man indifferent to books and he sins by way of defect being deficient in the contemplative virtue of bookloving  as to the man who is exactly in the right mean we call him the booklover  his happiness consists not in reading which is an active virtue but in the contemplation of bindings and illustrations and titlepages thus his felicity partakes of the nature of the bliss we attribute to the gods for that also is contemplative and we call the book lover happy and even blessed but within the limits of mortal happiness  but just as in the matter of absence of fear there is a mean which we call courage and a defect which we call cowardice and an excess which is known as foolhardiness so it is in the case of the love of books  as to the mean we have seen that it is the virtue of the true booklover while the defect constitutes the sin of the robustious philistine  but the extreme is found in covetousness and the covetous man who is in the extreme state of bookloving is the biblioklept or bookstealer  now his vice shows itself not in contemplation for of contemplation there can be no excess but in action  for books are procured as we say by purchase or by barter and these are voluntary exchanges both the seller and the buyer being willing to deal  but books are again procured in another way by involuntary contractthat is when the owner of the book is unwilling to part with it but he whose own the book is not is determined to take it  the bookstealer is such a man as this and he possesses himself of books with which the owner does not intend to part by virtue of a series of involuntary contracts  again the question may be raised whether is the robustious philistine who despises books or the biblioklept who adores them out of measure and excessively the worse citizen  now if we are to look to the consequences of actions only as the followers of bentham advise clearly the robustious philistine is the worse citizen for he mangles and dirties and destroys books which it is the interest of the state to preserve  but the biblioklept treasures and adorns the books he has acquired and when he dies or goes to prison the state receives the benefit at his sale  thus libri who was the greatest of biblioklepts rescued many of the books he stole from dirt and misuse and had them bound royally in purple and gold  also it may be argued that books naturally belong to him who can appreciate them and if good books are in a dull or indifferent mans keeping this is the sort of slavery which we call unnatural in our politics and which is not to be endured  shall we say then that the robustious philistine is the worse citizen while the biblioklept is the worse man  but this is perhaps matter for a separate disquisition  this fragment of the lost aristotelian treatise concerning books shows what a difficulty the stagirite had in determining the precise nature of the moral offence of the biblioklept  indeed both as a collector and as an intuitive moralist aristotle must have found it rather difficult to condemn the bookthief  he doubtless went on to draw distinctions between the man who steals books to sell them again for mere pecuniary profit which he would call chrematistic or unnatural bookstealing and the man who steals them because he feels that he is their proper and natural possessor  the same distinction is taken by jules janin who was a more constant student of horace than of aristotle  in his imaginary dialogue of bibliophiles janin introduces a character who announces the death of m libri  the tolerant person who brings the sad news proposes to cast a few flowers on the melancholy tomb  he was a bibliophile after all  what do you say to it  many a good fellow has stolen books and died in grace at the last  yes replies the president of the club but the good fellows did not sell the books they stole    cest une grande honte une grande misere this libri was an inspectorgeneral of french libraries under louis philippe  when he was tried in 1848 it was calculated that the sum of his known thefts amounted to 20000 pounds  many of his robberies escaped notice at the time  it is not long since lord ashburnham according to a french journal le livre found in his collection some fragments of a pentateuch  these relics had been in the possession of the lyons library whence libri stole them in 1847  the late lord ashburnham bought them without the faintest idea of libris dishonesty and when after eleven years the present peer discovered the proper owners of his treasure he immediately restored the pentateuch to the lyons library  many eminent characters have been biblioklepts  when innocent x was still monsignor pamphilio he stole a bookso says tallemant des reauxfrom du monstier the painter  the amusing thing is that du monstier himself was a bookthief  he used to tell how he had lifted a book of which he had long been in search from a stall on the pontneuf but says tallemant whom janin does not seem to have consulted there are many people who dont think it thieving to steal a book unless you sell it afterwards  but du monstier took a less liberal view where his own books were concerned  the cardinal barberini came to paris as legate and brought in his suite monsignor pamphilio who afterwards became innocent x  the cardinal paid a visit to du monstier in his studio where monsignor pamphilio spied on a table lhistoire du concile de trentthe good edition the london one  what a pity thought the young ecclesiastic that such a man should be by some accident the possessor of so valuable a book  with these sentiments monsignor pamphilio slipped the work under his soutane  but little du monstier observed him and said furiously to the cardinal that a holy man should not bring thieves and robbers in his company  with these words and with others of a violent and libellous character he recovered the history of the council of trent and kicked out the future pope  amelot de la houssaie traces to this incident the hatred borne by innocent x to the crown and the people of france another pope while only a cardinal stole a book from menageso m janin reportsbut we have not been able to discover menages own account of the larceny  the anecdotist is not so truthful that cardinals need flush a deeper scarlet like the roses in bions lament for adonis on account of a scandal resting on the authority of menage  among royal persons catherine de medici according to brantome was a biblioklept  the marshal strozzi had a very fine library and after his death the queenmother seized it promising some day to pay the value to his son who never got a farthing of the money  the ptolemies too were thieves on a large scale  a department of the alexandrian library was called the books from the ships and was filled with rare volumes stolen from passengers in vessels that touched at the port  true the owners were given copies of their ancient mss but the exchange as aristotle says was an involuntary one and not distinct from robbery  the great pattern of biblioklepts a man who carried his passion to the most regrettable excesses was a spanish priest don vincente of the convent of pobla in aragon  when the spanish revolution despoiled the convent libraries don vincente established himself at barcelona under the pillars of los encantes where are the stalls of the merchants of bricabrac and the seats of them that sell books  in a gloomy den the don stored up treasures which he hated to sell  once he was present at an auction where he was outbid in the competition for a rare perhaps a unique volume  three nights after that the people of barcelona were awakened by cries of fire  the house and shop of the man who had bought ordinacions per los gloriosos reys de arago were blazing  when the fire was extinguished the body of the owner of the house was found with a pipe in his blackened hand and some money beside him  every one said he must have set the house on fire with a spark from his pipe  time went on and week by week the police found the bodies of slain men now in the street now in a ditch now in the river there were young men and old all had been harmless and inoffensive in their lives andall had been bibliophiles  a dagger in an invisible hand had reached their hearts but the assassin had spared their purses money and rings  an organised search was made in the city and the shop of don vincente was examined  there in a hidden recess the police discovered the copy of ordinacions per los gloriosis reys de arago which ought by rights to have been burned with the house of its purchaser  don vincente was asked how he got the book  he replied in a quiet voice demanded that his collection should be made over to the barcelona library and then confessed a long array of crimes  he had strangled his rival stolen the ordinacions and burned the house  the slain men were people who had bought from him books which he really could not bear to part with  at his trial his counsel tried to prove that his confession was false and that he might have got his books by honest means  it was objected that there was in the world only one book printed by lambert palmart in 1482 and that the prisoner must have stolen this the only copy from the library where it was treasured  the defendants counsel proved that there was another copy in the louvre that therefore there might be more and that the defendants might have been honestly procured  here don vincente previously callous uttered an hysterical cry  said the alcalde at last vincente you begin to understand the enormity of your offence  ah senor alcalde my error was clumsy indeed  if you only knew how miserable i am  if human justice prove inflexible there is another justice whose pity is inexhaustible  repentance is never too late  ah senor alcalde but my copy was not unique with the story of this impenitent thief we may close the roll of biblioklepts though dibdin pretends that garrick was of the company and stole alleynes books at dulwich  there is a thievish nature more hateful than even the biblioklept the bookghoul is he who combines the larceny of the biblioklept with the abominable wickedness of breaking up and mutilating the volumes from which he steals  he is a collector of titlepages frontispieces illustrations and bookplates  he prowls furtively among public and private libraries inserting wetted threads which slowly eat away the illustrations he covets and he broods like the obscene demon of arabian superstitions over the fragments of the mighty dead  his disgusting tastes vary  he prepares books for the american market  christmas books are sold in the states stuffed with pictures cut out of honest volumes  here is a quotation from an american paper  another style of christmas book which deserves to be mentioned though it is out of the reach of any but the very rich is the historical or literary work enriched with inserted plates  there has never to our knowledge been anything offered in america so supremely excellent as the 5000 book on washington we think exhibited by boston last year but not a few fine specimens of books of this class are at present offered to purchasers  scribner has a beautiful copy of forsters life of dickens enlarged from three volumes octavo to nine volumes quarto by taking to pieces remounting and inlaying  it contains some eight hundred engravings portraits views playbills titlepages catalogues proof illustrations from dickenss works a set of the onwhyn plates rare engravings by cruikshank and phiz and autograph letters  though this volume does not compare with harveys dickens offered for 1750 two years ago it is an excellent specimen of books of this sort and the veriest tyro in bibliographical affairs knows how scarce are becoming the early editions of dickenss works and the plates illustrating them 4  anything about dickens in the beginning of his career is a sound investment from a business point of view  another work of the same sort valued at 240 is lady trevelyans edition of macaulay illustrated with portraits many of them very rare  even cheaper all things considered is an extra illustrated copy of the histoire de la gravure which besides its seventythree reproductions of old engravings is enriched with two hundred fine specimens of the early engravers many of the impressions being in first and second states  at 155 such a book is really a bargain especially for any one who is forming a collection of engravings  another delightful work is the library edition of brays evelyn illustrated with some two hundred and fifty portraits and views and valued at 175 and still another is boydells milton with plates after westall and further illustrations in the shape of twentyeight portraits of the painter and one hundred and eightyone plates and many of them before letter  the price of this book is 325  but few bookghouls are worse than the moral ghoul  he defaces with a pen the passages in some precious volume which do not meet his idea of moral propriety  i have a pines horace with the engravings from gems which has fallen into the hands of a moral ghoul  not only has he obliterated the verses which hurt his delicate sense but he has actually scraped away portions of the classical figures and the breasts of the nymphs in the brake the soul of tartuffe had entered into the body of a sinner of the last century  the antiquarian ghoul steals titlepages and colophons  the aesthetic ghoul cuts illuminated initials out of manuscripts  the petty trivial and almost idiotic ghoul of our own days sponges the flyleaves and boards of books for the purpose of cribbing the bookplates  an old complaint of a bookplate in dread of the wet sponge of the enemy has been discovered by mr austin dobson 5   the bookplates petition by a gentleman

the pages as andre cheniers friend served his copy of malherbe  it is scarcely necessary to warn the amateur against the society of bookghouls who are generally snuffy and foul in appearance and by no means so insinuating as that fair ladyghoul amina of the arabian nights  another enemy of books must be mentioned with the delicacy that befits the topic  almost all women are the inveterate foes not of novels of course nor peerages and popular volumes of history but of books worthy of the name  it is true that isabelle deste and madame de pompadour and madame de maintenon were collectors and doubtless there are other brilliant exceptions to a general rule but broadly speaking women detest the books which the collector desires and admires  first they dont understand them second they are jealous of their mysterious charms third books cost money and it really is a hard thing for a lady to see money expended on what seems a dingy old binding or yellow paper scored with crabbed characters  thus ladies wage a skirmishing war against booksellers catalogues and history speaks of husbands who have had to practise the guile of smugglers when they conveyed a new purchase across their own frontier  thus many married men are reduced to collecting elzevirs which go readily into the pocket for you cannot smuggle a folio volume easily  this inveterate dislike of books often produces a very deplorable result when an old collector dies  his womankind as the antiquary called them sell all his treasures for the price of wastepaper to the nearest country bookseller  it is a melancholy duty which forces one to introduce such topics into a volume on art at home  but this little work will not have been written in vain if it persuades ladies who inherit books not to sell them hastily without taking good and disinterested opinion as to their value  they often dispose of treasures worth thousands for a ten pound note and take pride in the bargain  here let history mention with due honour the paragon of her sex and the pattern to all wives of bookcollecting men madame fertiault  it is thus that she addresses her lord in a charming triolet les amoureux du livre p xxxv   le livre a ton esprit    tant mieux moi jai ton coeur et sans partage puisje desirer davantage le livre a ton esprit    tant mieux heureuse de te voir joyeux je ten voudrais    tout un etage le livre a ton esprit    tant mieux moi jai ton coeur et sans partage   books rule thy mind so let it be thy heart is mine and mine alone what more can i require of thee books rule thy mind so let it be contented when thy bliss i see i wish a world of books thine own books rule thy mind so let it be thy heart is mine and mine alone   there is one method of preserving books which alas only tempts the borrower the stealer the rat and the bookworm but which is absolutely necessary as a defence against dust and neglect  this is binding  the bookbinders art too often destroys books when the artist is careless but it is the only mode of preventing our volumes from falling to pieces and from being some day disregarded as wastepaper  a wellbound book especially a book from a famous collection has its price even if its literary contents be of trifling value  a leather coat fashioned by derome or le gascon or duseuil will win respect and careful handling for one specimen of an edition whereof all the others have perished  nothing is so slatternly as the aspect of a book merely stitched in the french fashion when the threads begin to stretch and the paper covers to curl and be torn  worse consequences follow whole sheets are lost the volume becomes worthless and the owner must often be at the expense of purchasing another copy if he can for the edition may now be out of print  thus binding of some sort not only adds a grace to the library presenting to the eye the cheerful gilded rows of our volumes but is a positive economy  in the case of our clothcovered english works the need of binding is not so immediately obvious  but our publishers have a taste for clothing their editions in tender tones of colour stamped often with landscapes printed in gold in white or what not  covers like this may or may not please the eye while they are new and clean but they soon become dirty and hideous  when a book is covered in cloth of a good dark tint it may be allowed to remain unbound but the primrose and lilac hues soon call out for the aid of the binder  much has been written of late about bookbinding  in a later part of this manual we shall have something to say about historical examples of the art and the performances of the great masters  at present one must begin by giving the practical rule that a book should be bound in harmony with its character and its value  the bibliophile if he could give the rein to his passions would bind every book he cares to possess in a full coat of morocco or if it did not age so fast of russia leather  but to do this is beyond the power of most of us  only works of great rarity or value should be full bound in morocco  if we have the luck to light on a shakespeare quarto on some masterpiece of aldus manutius by all means let us entrust it to the most competent binder and instruct him to do justice to the volume  let old english books as mores utopia have a cover of stamped and blazoned calf  let the binder clothe an early rabelais or marot in the style favoured by grolier in leather tooled with geometrical patterns  let a moliere or corneille be bound in the graceful contemporary style of le gascon where the lacelike pattern of the gilding resembles the venetian pointlace for which la fontaine liked to ruin himself  let a binding a la fanfare in the style of thouvenin denote a novelist of the last century let panelled russia leather array a folio of shakespeare and let english works of a hundred years ago be clothed in the sturdy fashion of roger payne  again the bibliophile may prefer to have the leather stamped with his arms and crest like de thou henri iii dhoym madame du barry and most of the collectors of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries  yet there are books of great price which one would hesitate to bind in new covers  an aldine or an elzevir in its old vellum or paper wrapper with uncut leaves should be left just as it came from the presses of the great printers  in this condition it is a far more interesting relic  but a morocco case may be made for the book and lettered properly on the back so that the volume though really unbound may take its place with the bound books on the shelves  a copy of any of shelleys poems in the original wrappers should i venture to think be treated thus and so should the original editions of keatss and of mr tennysons works  a collector who is also an author will perhaps like to have copies of his own works in morocco for their coats will give them a chance of surviving the storms of time  but most other books not of the highest rarity and interest will be sufficiently clothed in halfbindings that is with leather backs and corners while the rest of the cover is of cloth or paper or whatever other substance seems most appropriate an oxford tutor used to give halfbinding as an example of what aristotle calls greek text or shabbiness and when we recommend such coverings for books it is as a counsel of expediency not of perfection  but we cannot all be millionaires and let it be remembered the really wise amateur will never be extravagant nor let his taste lead him into the ignoble melancholy of pecuniary embarrassment  let the example of charles nodier be our warning nay let us remember that while nodier could get out of debt by selling his collection ours will probably not fetch anything like what we gave for it  in halfbindings there is a good deal of room for the exercise of the collectors taste  m octave uzanne in a tract called les caprices dun bibliophile gives some hints on this topic which may be taken or let alone  m uzanne has noticed the monotony and the want of meaning and suggestion in ordinary halfbindings  the paper or cloth which covers the greater part of the surface of halfbound books is usually inartistic and even ugly he proposes to use old scraps of brocade embroidery venice velvet or what not and doubtless a covering made of some dead fair ladys train goes well with a romance by crebillon and engravings by marillier  voici un cartonnage pompadour de notre invention says m uzanne with pride but he observes that it needs a strong will to make a bookbinder execute such orders  for another class of books which our honest english shelves reject with disgust m uzanne proposes a binding of the skin of the boa constrictor undoubtedly appropriate and admonishing  the leathers of china and japan with their strange tints and gilded devices may be used for books of fantasy like gaspard de la nuit or the opium eater or poes poems or the verses of gerard de nerval  here in short is an almost unexplored field for the taste of the bibliophile who with some expenditure of time and not much of money may make halfbinding an art and give modern books a peculiar and appropriate raiment  m ambrose firmin didot has left some notes on a more serious topicthe colours to be chosen when books are fullbound in morocco  thus he would have the iliad clothed in red the odyssey in blue because the old greek rhapsodists wore a scarlet cloak when they recited the wrath of achilles a blue one when they chanted of the return of odysseus  the writings of the great dignitaries of the church m didot would array in violet scarlet goes well with the productions of cardinals philosophers have their sober suit of black morocco poets like panard may be dressed in rose colour  a collector of this sort would like were it possible to attire goldsmiths poems in a coat of tyrian bloom satin grain  as an antithesis to these extravagant fancies we may add that for ordinary books no binding is cheaper neater and more durable than a coat of buckram  the conditions of a well bound book may be tersely enumerated  the binding should unite solidity and elegance  the book should open easily and remain open at any page you please  it should never be necessary in reading to squeeze back the covers and no book however expensively bound has been properly treated if it does not open with ease  it is a mistake to send recently printed books to the binder especially books which contain engravings  the printing ink dries slowly and in the process called beating the text is often transferred to the opposite page  m rouveyre recommends that one or two years should pass before the binding of a newly printed book  the owner will of course implore the binder to spare the margins and almost equally of course the binder durus arator will cut them down with his abominable plough  one is almost tempted to say that margins should always be left untouched for if once the binder begins to clip he is unable to resist the seductive joy and cuts the paper to the quick even into the printed matter mr blades tells a very sad story of a nobleman who handed over some caxtons to a provincial binder and received them back minus 500 pounds worth of margin  margins make a book worth perhaps 400 pounds while their absence reduces the same volume to the box marked all these at fourpence  intonsis capillis with locks unshorn as motteley the old dealer used to say an elzevir in its paper wrapper may be worth more than the same tome in morocco stamped with longepierres fleece of gold  but these things are indifferent to bookbinders new and old  there lies on the table as i write les provinciales ou les lettres ecrites par louis de montalte a un provincial de ses amis  aux rr pp jesuites  a cologne ches pierre de la vallee mdclviii  it is the elzevir edition or what passes for such but the binder has cut down the margin so that the words les provinciales almost touch the top of the page  often the wretchhe lived judging by his style in deromes time before the revolutionhas sliced into the head titles of the pages  thus the book with its old red morocco cover and gilded flowers on the back is no proper companion for les pensees de m pascal wolfganck 1672 which some sober dutchman has left with a fair allowance of margin an inch taller in its vellum coat than its neighbour in morocco  here once more is les fascheux comedie de i b p moliere representee sur le theatre du palais royal  a paris chez gabriel quinet au palais dans la galerie des prisonniers a lange gabriel mdclxiii  avec privilege du roy  what a crowd of pleasant memories the bibliophile and he only finds in these dry words of the title quinet the bookseller lived au palais in that pretty old arcade where corneille cast the scene of his comedy la galerie du palais  in the geneva edition of corneille 1774 you can see gravelots engraving of the place it is a print full of exquisite charm engraved by le mure in 1762  here is the long arcade in shape exactly like the galleries of the bodleian library at oxford the booksellers booth is arched over and is open at front and side  dorimant and cleante are looking out one leans on the books on the windowsill the other lounges at the door and they watch the pretty hippolyte who is chaffering with the laceseller at the opposite shop  ce visage vaut mieux que toutes vos chansons says dorimant to the bookseller  so they loitered and bought books and flirted in their lace ruffles and ribbons and flowing locks and wide canons when moliere was young and when this little old book was new and lying on the shelves of honest quinet in the palace gallery  the very titlepage and pagination not of this second edition but of the first of les fascheux had their own fortunes for the dedication to fouquet was perforce withdrawn  that favourite entertained la valliere and the king with the comedy at his house of vaux and then instantly fell from power and favour and losing his place and his freedom naturally lost the flattery of a dedication  but retombons a nos coches as montaigne says this pleasant little copy of the play which is a kind of relic of moliere and his old world has been ruthlessly bound up with a treatise des pierres precieuses published by didot in 1776  now the play is naturally a larger book than the treatise on precious stones so the binder has cut down the margins to the size of those of the work on amethysts and rubies  as the italian tyrant chained the dead and the living together as procrustes maimed his victims on his cruel bed so a hardhearted french binder has tied up and mutilated and spoiled the old play which otherwise would have had considerable value as well as interest  we have tried to teach the beginner how to keep his books neat and clean what men and monsters he should avoid how he should guard himself against borrowers bookworms damp and dirt  but we are sometimes compelled to buy books already dirty and dingy foxed or spotted with red worn by greasy hands stained with ink spots or covered with ms notes  the art of man has found a remedy for these defects  i have never myself tried to wash a book and this care is best left to professional hands  but the french and english writers give various recipes for cleaning old books which the amateur may try on any old rubbish out of the fourpenny box of a bookstall till he finds that he can trust his own manipulations  there are fat stains on books as thumb marks traces of oil the midnight oil flakes of old pasty crust left in old shakespeares and candle drippings  there are thin stains as of mud scalingwax ink dust and damp  to clean a book you first carefully unbind it take off the old covers cut the old stitching and separate sheet from sheet  then take a page with fat stains of any kind of grease except fingermarks pass a hot flat iron over it and press on it a clean piece of blotting paper till the paper sucks up the grease then charge a camelhair brush with heated turpentine and pass it over the places that were stained  if the paper loses its colour press softly over it a delicate handkerchief soaked in heated spirits of wine  fingermarks you will cover with clean soap leave this on for some hours and then rub with a sponge filled with hot water  afterwards dip in weak acid and water and then soak the page in a bath of clean water  inkstained pages you will first dip in a strong solution of oxalic acid and then in hydrochloric acid mixed in six times its quantity of water  then bathe in clean water and allow to dry slowly  some english recipes may also be given  grease or wax spots says hannett in bibliopegia may be removed by washing the part with ether chloroform or benzine and placing it between pieces of white blotting paper then pass a hot iron over it  chlorine water says the same writer removes ink stains and bleaches the paper at the same time  of chloride of lime a piece the size of a nut a cocoa nut or a hazel nut in a pint of water may be applied with a camels hair pencil and plenty of patience  to polish old bindings take the yolk of an egg beat it up with a fork apply it with a sponge having first cleaned the leather with a dry flannel  the following says a writer in notes and queries with perfect truth is an easier if not a better method purchase some bookbinders varnish and use it as you did the rudimentary omelette of the former recipe  vellum covers may be cleaned with soap and water or in bad cases by a weak solution of salts of lemon  lastly the collector should acquire such books as lowndess bibliography brunets manuel and as many priced catalogues as he can secure  the catalogues of mr quaritch mr bohn m fontaine mm morgand et fatout are excellent guides to a knowledge of the market value of books  other special works as renouards for aldines willemss for elzevirs and cohens for french engravings will be mentioned in their proper place dibdins books are inaccurate and longwinded but may occasionally be dipped into with pleasure    the books of the collector    the easiest way to bring order into the chaos of desirable books is doubtless to begin historically with manuscripts  almost every age that has left any literary remains has bequeathed to us relics which are cherished by collectors  we may leave the clay books of the chaldeans out of the account  these tomes resemble nothing so much as sticks of chocolate and however useful they may be to the student the clay mss of assurbanipal are not coveted by the collector  he finds his earliest objects of desire in illuminated manuscripts  the art of decorating manuscripts is as old as egypt but we need not linger over the beautiful papyri which are silent books to all but a few egyptologists  greece out of all her tomes has left us but a few illwritten papyri  roman and early byzantine art are represented by a virgil and fragments of an iliad the drawings in the latter have been reproduced in a splendid volume milan 1819 and shew greek art passing into barbarism  the illumination of mss was a favourite art in the later empire and is said to have been practised by boethius  the iconoclasts of the eastern empire destroyed the books which contained representations of saints and of the persons of the trinity and the monk lazarus a famous artist was cruelly tortured for his skill in illuminating sacred works  the art was decaying in western europe when charlemagne sought for painters of mss in england and ireland where the monks in their monasteries had developed a style with original qualities  the library of corpus christi at cambridge contains some of the earliest and most beautiful of extant english mss  these parchments stained purple or violet and inscribed with characters of gold are too often beyond the reach of the amateur for whom we write  the mss which he can hope to acquire are neither very early nor very sumptuous and as a rule mss of secular books are apt to be out of his reach  yet a collection of mss has this great advantage over a collection of printed books that every item in it is absolutely unique no two mss being ever really the same  this circumstance alone would entitle a good collection of mss to very high consideration on the part of bookcollectors  but in addition to the great expense of such a collection there is another and even more serious drawback it is sometimes impossible and is often extremely difficult to tell whether a ms is perfect or not  this difficulty can only be got over by an amount of learning on the part of the collector to which unfortunately he is too often a stranger  on the other hand the advantages of collecting mss are sometimes very great  in addition to the pleasurea pleasure at once literary and artisticwhich the study of illuminated mss affords there is the certainty that as years go on the value of such a collection increases in a proportion altogether marvellous  i will take two examples to prove this point  some years ago an eminent collector gave the price of 30 pounds for a small french book of hours painted in grisaille  it was in a country town that he met with this treasure for a treasure he considered the book in spite of its being of the very latest school of illumination  when his collection was dispersed a few years ago this one book fetched 260 pounds  in the celebrated perkins sale in 1873 a magnificent early ms part of which was written in gold on a purple ground and which was dated in the catalogue ninth or tenth century but was in reality of the end of the tenth or beginning of the eleventh was sold for 565 pounds to a dealer  it found its way into mr bragges collection at what price i do not know and was resold three years later for 780 pounds  any person desirous of making a collection of illuminated mss should study seriously for some time at the british museum or some such place until he is thoroughly acquainted 1 with the styles of writing in use in the middle ages so that he can at a glance make a fairly accurate estimate of the age of the book submitted to him and 2 with the proper means of collating the several kinds of servicebooks which in nine cases out of ten were those chosen for illumination  a knowledge of the styles of writing can be acquired at second hand in a book lately published by mr charles trice martin fsa being a new edition of astles progress of writing  still better of course is the actual inspection and comparison of books to which a date can be with some degree of certainty assigned  it is very common for the age of a book to be misstated in the catalogues of sales for the simple reason that the older the writing the plainer in all probability it is  let the student compare writing of the twelfth century with that of the sixteenth and he will be able to judge at once of the truth of this assertion i had once the good fortune to pick up a small testament of the early part of the twelfth century if not older which was catalogued as belonging to the fifteenth a date which would have made it of very moderate value  with regard to the second point the collation of mss i fear there is no royal road to knowing whether a book is perfect or imperfect in some cases the catchwords remain at the foot of the pages  it is then of course easy to see if a page is lost but where no such clue is given the students only chance is to be fully acquainted with what a book ought to contain  he can only do this when he has a knowledge of the different kinds of servicebooks which were in use and of their most usual contents  i am indebted to a paper read by the late sir william tite at a meeting of the society of antiquaries for the collation of books of hours but there are many kinds of mss besides these and it is well to know something of them  the horae or books of hours were the latest development of the servicebooks used at an earlier period  they cannot in fact be strictly called servicebooks being intended only for private devotion  but in the thirteenth century and before it psalters were in use for this purpose and the collation of a psalter is in truth more important than that of a book of hours  it will be well for a student therefore to begin with psalters as he can then get up the hours in their elementary form  i subjoin a bibliographical account of both kinds of mss  in the famous exhibition at the burlington club in 1874 a number of volumes was arranged to show how persistent one type of the age could be  the form of the decorations and the arrangement of the figures in borders once invented was fixed for generations  in a psalter of the thirteenth century there was under the month of january in the calendar a picture of a grotesque little figure warming himself at a stove  the hearth below the chimneypot above on which a stork was feeding her brood with the intermediate chimney shaft used as a border looked like a scientific preparation from the interior anatomy of a house of the period  in one of the latest of the mss exhibited on that occasion was the selfsame design again  the little man was no longer a grotesque and the picture had all the high finish and completeness in drawing that we might expect in the workmanship of a contemporary of van eyck there was a full series of intermediate books showing the gradual growth of the picture  with regard to chronology it may be roughly asserted that the earliest books which occur are psalters of the thirteenth century next to them come bibles of which an enormous issue took place before the middle of the fourteenth century  these are followed by an endless series of books of hours which as the sixteenth century is reached appear in several vernacular languages  those in english being both very rare and of great importance in liturgical history are of a value altogether out of proportion to the beauty of their illuminations  side by side with this succession are the evangelistina which like the example mentioned above are of the highest merit beauty and value followed by sermons and homilies and the breviary which itself shows signs of growth as the years go on  the real missal with which all illuminated books used to be confounded is of rare occurrence but i have given a collation of it also  besides these devotional or religious books i must mention chronicles and romances and the semireligious and moral allegories such as the pelerinage de lame which is said to have given bunyan the machinery of the pilgrims progress  chaucers and gowers poetry exists in many mss as does the polychronicon of higden but as a rule the mediaeval chronicles are of single origin and were not copied  to collate mss of these kinds is quite impossible unless by carefully reading them and seeing that the pages run on without break  i should advise the young collector who wishes to make sure of success not to be too catholic in his tastes at first but to confine his attention to a single period and a single school  i should also advise him to make from time to time a careful catalogue of what he buys and to preserve it even after he has weeded out certain items  he will then be able to make a clear comparative estimate of the importance and value of his collection and by studying one species at a time to become thoroughly conversant with what it can teach him  when he has so to speak burnt his fingers once or twice he will find himself able to distinguish at sight what no amount of teaching by word of mouth or by writing could ever possibly impart to any advantage  one thing i should like if possible to impress very strongly upon the reader  that is the fact that a ms which is not absolutely perfect if it is in a genuine state is of much more value than one which has been made perfect by the skill of a modern restorer  the more skilful he is that is to say the better he can forge the style of the original the more worthless he renders the volume  printing seems to have superseded the art of the illuminator more promptly and completely in england than on the continent  the dames galantes of brantomes memoirs took pleasure in illuminated books of hours suited to the nature of their devotions  as late as the time of louis xiv bussy rabutin had a volume of the same kind illuminated with portraits of saints of his own canonisation the most famous of these modern examples of costly mss was la guirlande de julie a collection of madrigals by various courtly hands presented to the illustrious julie daughter of the marquise de rambouillet most distinguished of the precieuses and wife of the duc de montausier the supposed original of molieres alceste the ms was copied on vellum by nicholas jarry the great calligraph of his time  the flowers on the margin were painted by robert  not long ago a french amateur was so lucky as to discover the ms book of prayers of julies noble mother the marquise de rambouillet the marquise wrote these prayers for her own devotions and jarry the illuminator declared that he found them most edifying and delightful to study  the manuscript is written on vellum by the famous jarry contains a portrait of the fair julie herself and is bound in morocco by le gascon  the happy collector who possesses the volume now heard vaguely that a manuscript of some interest was being exposed for sale at a trifling price in the shop of a country bookseller  the description of the book casual as it was made mention of the monogram on the cover  this was enough for the amateur  he rushed to a railway station travelled some three hundred miles reached the country town hastened to the booksellers shop and found that the book had been withdrawn by its owner  happily the possessor unconscious of his bliss was at home  the amateur sought him out paid the small sum demanded and returned to paris in triumph  thus even in the region of manuscriptcollecting there are extraordinary prizes for the intelligent collector   to know if a manuscript is perfect   if the manuscript is of english or french writing of the twelfth thirteenth fourteenth or fifteenth centuries it is probably either1 a bible 2 a psalter 3 a book of hours or 4 but rarely a missal  it is not worth while to give the collation of a gradual or a hymnal or a processional or a breviary or any of the fifty different kinds of servicebooks which are occasionally met with but which are never twice the same  to collate one of them the reader must go carefully through the book seeing that the catchwords if there are any answer to the head lines and if there are signatures that is if the foot of the leaves of a sheet of parchment has any mark for enabling the binder to gather them correctly going through them and seeing that each signed leaf has its corresponding blank  1  to collate a bible it will be necessary first to go through the catchwords if any and signatures as above then to notice the contents  the first page should contain the epistle of st jerome to the reader  it will be observed that there is nothing of the nature of a titlepage but i have often seen titlepages supplied by some ignorant imitator in the last century with the idea that the book was imperfect without one  the books of the bible follow in orderbut the order not only differs from ours but differs in different copies  the apocryphal books are always included  the new testament usually follows on the old without any break and the book concludes with an index of the hebrew names and their signification in latin intended to help preachers to the figurative meaning of the biblical types and parables  the last line of the bible itself usually contains a colophon in which sometimes the name of the writer is given sometimes the length of time it has taken him to write and sometimes merely the explicit laus deo which has found its way into many modern books  this colophon which comes as a rule immediately before the index often contains curious notes hexameters giving the names of all the books biographical or local memoranda and should always be looked for by the collector  one such line occurs to me  it is in a bible written in italy in the thirteenth century    qui scripsit scribat  vergilius spe domini vivat   vergilius was no doubt in this case the scribe  the latin and the writing are often equally crabbed  in the bodleian there is a bible with this colophon    finito libro referemus gratias christo mcclxv indict viij ego lafracus de pacis de cmoa scriptor scripsi   this was also written in italy  english colophons are often very quaintqui scripsit hunc librum fiat collocatus in paradisum is an example  the following gives us the name of one master gerard who in the fourteenth century thus poetically described his ownership   si ge ponaturet rar simul associatur  et dus reddaturcui pertinet ita vocatur   in a bible written in england in the british museum there is a long colophon in which after the name of the writerhunc librum scripsit wills de halesthere is a prayer for ralph of nebham who had called hales to the writing of the book followed by a date fes fuit liber anno mcci quarto ab incarnatione domini  in this bible the books of the new testament were in the following order the evangelists the acts the epistles of s peter s james and s john the epistles of s paul and the apocalypse  in a bible at brussels i found the colophon after the index hic expliciunt interpretationes hebrayorum nominum do gris qui potens est p sup omia  some of these bibles are of marvellously small dimensions  the smallest i ever saw was at ghent but it was very imperfect  i have one in which there are thirteen lines of writing in an inch of the column  the order of the books of the new testament in bibles of the thirteenth century is usually according to one or other of the three following arrangements   1  the evangelists romans to hebrews acts epistles of s peter s james and s john apocalypse  2  the evangelists acts epistles of s peter s james and s john epistles of s paul apocalypse  this is the most common  3  the evangelists acts epistles of s peter s james and s john apocalypse and epistles of s paul  on the fly leaves of these old bibles there are often very curious inscriptions  in one i have this haec biblia emi haquinas prior monasterii hatharbiensis de dono domini regis norwegie  who was this king of norway who in 1310 gave the prior of hatherby money to buy a bible which was probably written at canterbury  and who was haquinas  his name has a norwegian sound and reminds us of st thomas of that surname  in another manuscript i have seen   articula fidei nascitur abluitur patitur descendit at ima surgit et ascendit veniens discernere cuncta   in another this   sacramenta ecclesiae abluo fumo cibo piget ordinat uxor et ungit   i will conclude these notes on ms bibles with the following colophon from a copy written in italy in the fifteenth century   finito libro vivamus semper in christo  si semper in christo carebimus ultimo leto explicit deo gratias amen  stephanus de tantaldis scripsit in pergamo   2  the psalter of the thirteenth century is usually to be considered a forerunner of the book of hours  it always contains and usually commences with a calendar in which are written against certain days the obits of benefactors and others so that a well filled psalter often becomes a historical document of high value and importance  the first page of the psalms is ornamented with a huge b which often fills the whole page and contains a representation of david and goliath ingeniously fitted to the shape of the letter at the end are usually to be found the hymns of the three children and others from the bible together with the te deum and sometimes in late examples a litany  in some psalters the calendar is at the end  these psalters and the bibles described above are very frequently of english work more frequently that is than the books of hours and missals  the study of the scriptures was evidently more popular in england than in the other countries of europe during the middle ages and the early success of the reformers here must in part no doubt be attributed to the wide circulation of the bible even before it had been translated from the latin  i need hardly perhaps observe that even fragments of a psalter a testament or a bible in english are so precious as to be practically invaluable  3  we are indebted to sir w tite for the following collation of a flemish book of hours   1  the calendar  2  gospels of the nativity and the resurrection  3  preliminary prayers inserted occasionally  4  horaenocturns and matins  5  lauds  6  prime  7  tierce  8  sexte  9  none  10  vespers  11  compline  12  the seven penitential psalms  13  the litany  14  hours of the cross  15  hours of the holy spirit  16  office of the dead  17  the fifteen joys of b v m  18  the seven requests to our lord  19  prayers and suffrages to various saints  20  several prayers petitions and devotions   this is an unusually full example but the calendar the hours the seven psalms and the litany are in almost all the mss  the buyer must look carefully to see that no miniatures have been cut out but it is only by counting the leaves in their gatherings that he can make sure  this is often impossible without breaking the binding  the most valuable horae are those written in england  some are of the english use sarum or york or whatever it may happen to be but were written abroad especially in normandy for the english market  these are also valuable even when imperfect  look for the page before the commencement of the hours no 4 in the list above and at the end will be found a line in redincipit horae secundum usum sarum or otherwise as the case may be  4  missals do not often occur and are not only very valuable but very difficult to collate unless furnished with catchwords or signatures  but no missal is complete without the canon of the mass usually in the middle of the book and if there are any illuminations throughout the volume there will be a full page crucifixion facing the canon  missals of large size and completeness contain1 a calendar 2 the proper of the season 3 the ordinary and canon of the mass 4 the communal of saints 5 the proper of saints and special occasions 6 the lessons epistles and gospels with 7 some hymns proses and canticles  this is sir w tites list but as he remarks ms missals seldom contain so much  the collector will look for the canon which is invariable  breviaries run to an immense length and are seldom illuminated  it would be impossible to give them any kind of collation and the same may be said of many other kinds of old servicebooks and of the chronicles poems romances and herbals in which mediaeval literature abounded and which the collector must judge as best he can  the name of missal is commonly and falsely given to all old servicebooks by the booksellers but the collector will easily distinguish one when he sees it from the notes i have given  in a sarum missal at alnwick there is a colophon quoted by my lamented friend dr rock in his textile fabrics  it is appropriate both to the labours of the old scribes and also to those of their modern readers   librum scribendojon whas monachus laborabat  et mane surgendomultum corpus macerabat   it is one of the charms of manuscripts that they illustrate in their minute way all the art and even the social condition of the period in which they were produced  apostles saints and prophets wear the contemporary costume and jonah when thrown to the hungry whale wears doublet and trunk hose  the ornaments illustrate the architectural taste of the day  the backgrounds change from diapered patterns to landscapes as the modern way of looking at nature penetrates the monasteries and reaches the scriptorium where the illuminator sits and refreshes his eyes with the sight of the slender trees and blue distant hills  printed books have not such resources  they can only show varieties of type quaint frontispieces printers devices and fleurons at the heads of chapters  these attractions and even the engravings of a later day seem meagre enough compared with the allurements of manuscripts  yet printed books must almost always make the greater part of a collection and it may be well to give some rules as to the features that distinguish the productions of the early press but no amount of rules is worth six months practical experience in bibliography  that experience the amateur if he is wise will obtain in a public library like the british museum or the bodleian nowhere else is he likely to see much of the earliest of printed books which very seldom come into the market  those of the first german press are so rare that practically they never reach the hands of the ordinary collector  among them are the famous psalters printed by fust and schoffer the earliest of which is dated 1457 and the bible known as the mazarine bible  two copies of this last were in the perkins sale  i well remember the excitement on that occasion  the first copy put up was the best being printed upon vellum  the bidding commenced at 1000 pounds and very speedily rose to 2200 pounds at which point there was a long pause it then rose in hundreds with very little delay to 3400 pounds at which it was knocked down to a bookseller  the second copy was on paper and there were those present who said it was better than the other which had a suspicion attaching to it of having been restored with a facsimile leaf  the first bid was again 1000 pounds which the buyer of the previous copy made guineas and the bidding speedily went up to 2660 pounds at which price the first bidder paused  a third bidder had stepped in at 1960 pounds and now amid breathless excitement bid 10 pounds more  this he had to do twice before the book was knocked down to him at 2690 pounds  a scene like this has really very little to do with bookcollecting the beginner must labour hard to distinguish different kinds of printing he must be able to recognise at a glance even fragments from the press of caxton  his eye must be accustomed to all the tricks of the trade and others so that he may tell a facsimile in a moment or detect a forgery  but now let us return to the distinctive marks of early printed books  the first is says m rouveyre   1  the absence of a separate titlepage  it was not till 14761480 that the titles of books were printed on separate pages  the next mark is    2  the absence of capital letters at the beginnings of divisions for example in an aldine iliad the fifth book begins thus    greek text   it was intended that the open space occupied by the small epsilon epsilon symbol should be filled up with a coloured and gilded initial letter by the illuminator  copies thus decorated are not very common but the aldine homer of francis i rescued by m didot from a rubbish heap in an english cellar had its due illuminations  in the earliest books the guide to the illuminator the small printed letter does not appear and he often puts in the wrong initial  3  irregularity and rudeness of type is a note of the primitive printing press which very early disappeared  nothing in the history of printing is so remarkable as the beauty of almost its first efforts  other notes are   4  the absence of figures at the top of the pages and of signatures at the foot  the thickness and solidity of the paper the absence of the printers name of the date and of the name of the town where the press stood and the abundance of crabbed abbreviations are all marks more or less trustworthy of the antiquity of books  it must not be supposed that all books published let us say before 1500 are rare or deserve the notice of the collector  more than 18000 works it has been calculated left the press before the end of the fifteenth century  all of these cannot possibly be of interest and many of them that are rare are rare precisely because they are uninteresting  they have not been preserved because they were thought not worth preserving  this is a great cause of rarity but we must not hastily conclude that because a book found no favour in its own age therefore it has no claim on our attention  a london bookseller tells me that he bought the remainder of keatss endymion for fourpence a copy  the first edition of endymion is now rare and valued  in trying to mend the binding of an old odyssey lately i extracted from the vellum covers parts of two copies of a very scarce and curious french dictionary of slang le jargon ou langage de largot reforme  this treatise may have been valueless almost when it appeared but now it is serviceable to the philologist and to all who care to try to interpret the slang ballades of the poet villon  an old pamphlet an old satire may hold the key to some historical problem or throw light on the past of manners and customs  still of the earliest printed books collectors prefer such rare and beautiful ones as the oldest printed bibles  german englishas taverners and the bishopsor hebrew and greek or the first editions of the ancient classics which may contain the readings of mss now lost or destroyed talking of early bibles let us admire the luck and prudence of a certain mr sandford  he always longed for the first hebrew bible but would offer no fancy price being convinced that the book would one day fall in his way  his foreboding was fulfilled and he picked up his treasure for ten shillings in a shop in the strand the taste for incunabula or very early printed books slumbered in the latter half of the sixteenth and all the seventeenth century it revived with the third jubilee of printing in 1740 and since then has refined itself and only craves books very early very important or works from the press of caxton the st albans schoolmaster or other famous old artists  enough has been said to show the beginner always enthusiastic that all old books are not precious  for further information the biography and typography of william caxton by mr blades trubner london 1877 may be consulted with profit  following the categories into which m brunet classifies desirable books in his invaluable manual we now come to books printed on vellum and on peculiar papers  at the origin of printing examples of many books probably presentation copies were printed on vellum there is a vellum copy of the celebrated florentine first edition of homer but it is truly sad to think that the twin volumes iliad and odyssey have been separated and pine in distant libraries  early printed books on vellum often have beautifully illuminated capitals dibdin mentions in bibliomania london 1811 p 90 that a m van praet was compiling a catalogue of works printed on vellum and had collected more than 2000 articles  when hard things are said about henry viii let us remember that this monarch had a few copies of his book against luther printed on vellum  the duke of marlboroughs library possessed twentyfive books on vellum all printed before 1496  the chapterhouse at padua has a catullus of 1472 on vellum let mr robinson ellis think wistfully of that treasure  the notable count mcarthy of toulouse had a wonderful library of books in membranis including a book much coveted for its rarity oddity and the beauty of its illustrations the hypnerotomachia of poliphilus venice 1499  vellum was the favourite vanity of junot napoleons general  for reasons connected with its manufacture and best not inquired into the italian vellum enjoyed the greatest reputation for smooth and silky whiteness  dibdin calls our modern books on vellum little short of downright wretched  but the editor of this series could i think show examples that would have made dibdin change his opinion  many comparatively expensive papers large in format are used in choice editions of books  whatman papers dutch papers chinese papers and even papier verge have all their admirers  the amateur will soon learn to distinguish these materials  as to books printed on coloured papergreen blue yellow rhubarbcoloured and the like they are an offence to the eyes and to the taste  yet even these have their admirers and collectors and the great aldus himself occasionally used azure paper  under the head of large paper perhaps uncut copies should be mentioned  most owners of books have had the edges of the volumes gilded or marbled by the binders  thus part of the margin is lost an offence to the eye of the bibliomaniac while copies untouched by the binders shears are rare and therefore prized  the inconvenience of uncut copies is that one cannot easily turn over the leaves  but in the present state of the fashion a really rare uncut elzevir may be worth hundreds of pounds while a cropped example scarcely fetches as many shillings  a set of shakespeares quartoes uncut would be worth more than a respectable landed estate in connemara  for these reasons the amateur will do well to have new books of price bound uncut  it is always easy to have the leaves pared away but not even the fabled fountain at argos in which hera yearly renewed her maidenhood could restore margins once clipped away  so much for books which are chiefly precious for the quantity and quality of the material on which they are printed  even this rather foolish weakness of the amateur would not be useless if it made our publishers more careful to employ a sound clean handmade paper instead of drugged trash for their more valuable new productions indeed a taste for handmade paper is coming in and is part of the revolt against the passion for everything machinemade which ruined art and handiwork in the years between 1840 and 1870  the third of m brunets categories of books of prose includes livres de luxe and illustrated literature  every christmas brings us livres de luxe in plenty books which are no books but have gilt and magenta covers and great staring illustrations  these are regarded as drawingroom ornaments by people who never read  it is scarcely necessary to warn the collector against these gaudy baits of unregulated christmas generosity  all ages have not produced quite such garish livres de luxe as ours  but on the whole a book brought out merely for the sake of display is generally a book ill got up and not worth reading  moreover it is generally a folio or quarto so large that he who tries to read it must support it on a kind of scaffolding  in the class of illustrated books two sorts are at present most in demand  the ancient woodcuts and engravings often the work of artists like holbein and durer can never lose their interest  among old illustrated books the most famous and one of the rarest is the hypnerotomachia poliphili wherein all human matters are proved to be no more than a dream  this is an allegorical romance published in 1499 for francesco colonna by aldus manucius  poliam frater franciscus columna peramavit brother francesco colonna dearly loved polia is the inscription and device of this romance  poor francesco of the order of preachers disguised in this strange work his passion for a lady of uncertain name  here is a translation of the passage in which the lady describes the beginning of his affection  i was standing as is the manner of women young and fair at the window or rather on the balcony of my palace  my yellow hair the charm of maidens was floating round my shining shoulders  my locks were steeped in unguents that made them glitter like threads of gold and they were slowly drying in the rays of the burning sun  a handmaid happy in her task was drawing a comb through my tresses and surely these of andromeda seemed not more lovely to perseus nor to lucius the locks of photis 6  on a sudden poliphilus beheld me and could not withdraw from me his glances of fire and even in that moment a ray of the sun of love was kindled in his heart  the fragment is itself a picture from the world of the renaissance we watch the blonde learned lady dreaming of perseus and lucius greek lovers of old time while the sun gilds her yellow hair and the young monk passing below sees and loves and falls into the deep waters of desire  the lover is no less learned than the lady and there is a great deal of amorous archaeology in his account of his voyage to cythera  as to the designs in wood quaint in their vigorous effort to be classical they have been attributed to mantegna to bellini and other artists  jean cousin is said to have executed the imitations in the paris editions of 1546 1556 and 1561  the hypnerotomachia seems to deserve notice because it is the very type of the books that are dear to collectors as distinct from the books that in any shape are for ever valuable to the world  a cheap tauchnitz copy of the iliad and odyssey or a globe shakespeare are from the point of view of literature worth a wilderness of hypnerotomachiae  but a clean copy of the hypnerotomachia especially on vellum is one of the jewels of bibliography  it has all the right qualities it is very rare it is very beautiful as a work of art it is curious and even bizarre it is the record of a strange time and a strange passion it is a relic lastly of its printer the great and good aldus manutius  next to the old woodcuts and engravings executed in times when artists were versatile and did not disdain even to draw a bookplate as durer did for pirckheimer the designs of the french little masters are at present in most demand  the book illustrations of the seventeenth century are curious enough and invaluable as authorities on manners and costume  but the attitudes of the figures are too often stiff and ungainly while the composition is frequently left to chance  england could show nothing much better than ogilbys translations of homer illustrated with big florid engravings in sham antique style  the years between 1730 and 1820 saw the french little masters in their perfection  the dress of the middle of the eighteenth century of the age of watteau was precisely suited to the gay and graceful pencils of gravelot moreau eisen boucher cochin marillier and choffard  to understand their merits and the limits of their art it is enough to glance through a series of the designs for voltaire corneille or moliere  the drawings of society are almost invariably dainty and pleasing the serious scenes of tragedy leave the spectator quite unmoved  thus it is but natural that these artists should have shone most in the illustration of airy trifles like dorats baisers or tales like manon lescaut or in designing tailpieces for translations of the greek idyllic poets such as moschus and bion  in some of his illustrations of books especially perhaps in the designs for la physiologie de gout jouaust paris 1879 m lalauze has shown himself the worthy rival of eisen and cochin perhaps it is unnecessary to add that the beauty and value of all such engravings depends almost entirely on their state  the earlier proofs are much more brilliant than those drawn later and etchings on fine papers are justly preferred  for example m lalauzes engravings on whatman paper have a beauty which could scarcely be guessed by people who have only seen specimens on papier verge  every collector of the old french vignettes should possess himself of the guide de lamateur by m henry cohen rouquette paris 1880  among english illustrated books various tastes prefer the imaginative works of william blake the etchings of cruikshank and the woodcuts of bewick  the whole of the last chapter of this sketch is devoted by mr austin dobson to the topic of english illustrated books  here it may be said in passing that an early copy of william blakes songs of innocence written illustrated printed coloured and boarded by the authors own hand is one of the most charming objects that a bibliophile can hope to possess  the verses of blake in a framework of birds and flowers and plumes all softly and magically tinted seem like some book out of king oberons library in fairyland rather than the productions of a mortal press  the pictures in blakes prophetic books and even his illustrations to job show an imagination more heavily weighted by the technical difficulties of drawing  the next class of rare books is composed of works from the famous presses of the aldi and the elzevirs  other presses have perhaps done work as good but estienne the giunta and plantin are comparatively neglected while the taste for the performances of baskerville and foulis is not very eager  a safe judgment about aldines and elzevirs is the gift of years and of long experience in this place it is only possible to say a few words on a wide subject  the founder of the aldine press aldus pius manutius was born about 1450 and died at venice in 1514  he was a man of careful and profound learning and was deeply interested in greek studies then encouraged by the arrival in italy of many educated greeks and cretans  only four greek authors had as yet been printed in italy when 1495 aldus established his press at venice theocritus homer aesop and isocrates probably in very limited editions were in the hands of students  the purpose of aldus was to put greek and latin works beautifully printed in a convenient shape within the reach of all the world  his reform was the introduction of books at once cheap studiously correct and convenient in actual use  it was in 1498 that he first adopted the small octavo size and in his virgil of 1501 he introduced the type called aldine or italic  the letters were united as in writing and the type is said to have been cut by francesco da bologna better known as francia in imitation of the hand of petrarch  for full information about aldus and his descendants and successors the work of m firmin didot alde manuce et lhellenisme a venise  paris 1875 and the aldine annals of renouard must be consulted  these two works are necessary to the collector who will otherwise be deceived by the misleading assertions of the booksellers  as a rule the volumes published in the lifetime of aldus manutius are the most esteemed and of these the aristotle the first homer the virgil and the ovid are perhaps most in demand  the earlier aldines are consulted almost as studiously as mss by modern editors of the classics  just as the house of aldus waned and expired that of the great dutch printers the elzevirs began obscurely enough at leyden in 1583  the elzevirs were not like aldus ripe scholars and men of devotion to learning  aldus laboured for the love of noble studies the elzevirs were acute and too often smart men of business  the founder of the family was louis born at louvain 1540 died 1617 but it was in the second and third generations that bonaventura and abraham elzevir began to publish at leyden their editions in small duodecimo  like aldus these elzevirs aimed at producing books at once handy cheap correct and beautiful in execution  their adventure was a complete success  the elzevirs did not like aldus surround themselves with the most learned scholars of their time their famous literary adviser heinsius was full of literary jealousies and kept students of his own calibre at a distance  the classical editions of the elzevirs beautiful but too small in type for modern eyes are anything but exquisitely correct  their editions of the contemporary  french authors now classics themselves are lovely examples of skill in practical enterprise the elzevirs treated the french authors much as american publishers treat englishmen  they stole right and left but no one complained much in these times of slack copyright and at all events the piratic larcenous publications of the dutch printers were pretty and so far satisfactory  they themselves in turn were the victims of fraudulent and untradesmanlike imitations  it is for this among other reasons that the collector of elzevirs must make m willemss book les elzevier brussels and paris 1880 his constant study differences so minute that they escape the unpractised eye denote editions of most various value  in elzevirs a lines breadth of margin is often worth a hundred pounds and a misprint is quoted at no less a sum  the fantastic caprice of bibliophiles has revelled in the bibliography of these dutch editions  they are at present very scarce in england where a change in fashion some years ago had made them common enough  no elzevir is valuable unless it be clean and large in the margins  when these conditions are satisfied the question of rarity comes in and remy belleaus macaronic poem or le pastissier francais may rise to the price of four or five hundred pounds  a rabelais moliere or corneille of a good edition is now more in request than the once adored imitatio christi dateless or the virgil of 1646 which is full of gross errors of the press but is esteemed for red characters in the letter to augustus and another passage at page 92  the ordinary marks of the elzevirs were the sphere the old hermit the athena the eagle and the burning faggot  but all little old books marked with spheres are not elzevirs as many booksellers suppose  other printers also stole the designs for the tops of chapters the aegipan the siren the head of medusa the crossed sceptres and the rest  in some cases the elzevirs published their books especially when they were piracies anonymously  when they published for the jansenists they allowed their clients to put fantastic pseudonyms on the title pages  but except in four cases they had only two pseudonyms used on the titles of books published by and for themselves  these disguises are jean sambix for jean and daniel elzevir at leyden and for the elzevirs of amsterdam jacques le jeune  the last of the great representatives of the house daniel died at amsterdam 1680  abraham an unworthy scion struggled on at leyden till 1712  the family still prospers but no longer prints in holland  it is common to add duodecimos of foppens wolfgang and other printers to the collections of the elzevirs  the books of wolfgang have the sign of the fox robbing a wild bees nest with the motto quaerendo  curious and singular books are the next in our classification  the category is too large  the books that be curious not in the booksellers sense of prurient and disgusting are innumerable all suppressed and condemned books from les fleurs du mal to vaninis amphitheatrum or the english translation of brunos spaccia della bestia trionfante are more or less rare and more or less curious  wild books like william postels three marvellous triumphs of women are curious  freakish books like macaronic poetry written in a medley of languages are curious books from private presses are singular  the old english poets and satirists turned out many a book curious to the last degree and priced at a fantastic value  such are jordans jewels of ingenuity microcynicon six snarling satyres 1599 and the treatize made of a galaunt printed by wynkyn de worde and found pasted into the flyleaf on the oakboard binding of an imperfect volume of pynsons statutes  all our early english poems and miscellanies are curious and as relics of delightful singers are most charming possessions  such are the songes and sonnettes of surrey 1557 the paradyce of daynty deuices 1576 the small handful of fragrant flowers and the handful of dainty delights gathered out of the lovely garden of sacred scripture fit for any worshipful gentlewoman to smell unto 1584  the teares of ireland 1642 are said though one would not expect it to be extremely rare and therefore precious  but there is no end to the list of such desirable rarities  if we add to them all books coveted as early editions and therefore as relics of great writers bunyan shakespeare milton sterne walton and the rest we might easily fill a book with remarks on this topic alone  the collection of such editions is the most respectable the most useful and alas the most expensive of the amateurs pursuits  it is curious enough that the early editions of swift scott and byron are little sought for if not wholly neglected while early copies of shelley tennyson and keats have a great price set on their heads  the quartoes of shakespeare like first editions of racine are out of the reach of any but very opulent purchasers or unusually lucky fortunate bookhunters  before leaving the topic of books which derive their value from the taste and fantasy of collectors it must be remarked that in this matter the fashion of the world changes  dr dibdin lamented seventy years ago the waning respect paid to certain editions of the classics  he would find that things have become worse now and modern german editions on execrable paper have supplanted his old favourites  fifty years ago m brunet expressed his contempt for the designs of boucher now they are at the top of the fashion  the study of old booksellers catalogues is full of instruction as to the changes of caprice  the collection of dr rawlinson was sold in 1756  the vision of pierce plowman 1561 and the creede of pierce plowman 1553 brought between them no more than three shillings and sixpence  eleven shillings were paid for the boke of chivalrie by caxton  the boke of st albans by wynkyn de worde cost 1 pounds  1s and this was the highest sum paid for any one of two hundred rare pieces of early english literature  in 1764 a copy of the hypnerotomachia was sold for two shillings a pettie pallace of pettie his pleasures ah what a thought for the amateur went for three shillings while palmerin of england 1602 attained no more than the paltry sum of fourteen shillings  when osborne sold the harley collection the scarcest old english books fetched but three or four shillings  if the wandering jew had been a collector in the last century he might have turned a pretty profit by selling his old english books in this age of ours  in old french too ahasuerus would have done a good stroke of business for the prices brought by old villons romances of the rose les marguerites de marguerite and so forth at the mcarthy sale were truly pitiable  a hundred years hence the original editions of thackeray or of miss greenaways christmas books or modern painters may be the ruling passion and aldines and elzevirs black letter and french vignettes may all be despised  a book which is commonplace in our century is curious in the next and disregarded in that which follows  old books of a heretical character were treasures once rare unholy possessions  now we have seen so many heretics that the world is indifferent to the audacities of bruno and the veiled impieties of vanini  the last of our categories of books much sought by the collector includes all volumes valued for their ancient bindings for the mark and stamp of famous amateurs  the french who have supplied the world with so many eminent bindersas eve padeloup duseuil le gascon derome simier bozerian thouvenin trautzbauzonnet and lorticare the chief patrons of books in historical bindings  in england an historical binding a book of lauds or jamess or garricks or even of queen elizabeths does not seem to derive much added charm from its associations  but in france peculiar bindings are now the objects most in demand among collectors  the series of books thus rendered precious begins with those of

with fleursdelys  the books of the later collectorslongepierre the translator of bion and moschus dhoym the diplomatist mccarthy and la valliere are all valued at a rate which seems fair game for satire  among the most interesting bibliophiles of the eighteenth century is madame du barry  in 1771 this notorious beauty could scarcely read or write  she had rooms however in the chateau de versailles thanks to the kindness of a monarch who admired those native qualities which education may polish but which it can never confer at versailles madame du barry heard of the literary genius of madame de pompadour  the pompadour was a person of taste  her large library of some four thousand works of the lightest sort of light literature was bound by biziaux  mr toovey possesses the brantome of this dame galante  madame herself had published etchings by her own fair hands and to hear of these things excited the emulation of madame du barry  she might not be clever but she could have a library like another if libraries were in fashion one day madame du barry astonished the court by announcing that her collection of books would presently arrive at versailles  meantime she took counsel with a bookseller who bought up examples of all the cheap remainders as they are called in the trade that he could lay his hands upon  the whole assortment about one thousand volumes in all was hastily bound in rose morocco elegantly gilt and stamped with the arms of the noble house of du barry  the bill which madame du barry owed her enterprising agent is still in existence  the thousand volumes cost about three francs each the binding extremely cheap came to nearly as much  the amusing thing is that the bookseller in the catalogue which he sent with the improvised library marked the books which madame du barry possessed before her large order was so punctually executed  there were two memoires de du barry an old newspaper two or three plays and lhistorie amoureuse de pierre le long  louis xv observed with pride that though madame pompadour had possessed a larger library that of madame du barry was the better selected  thanks to her new collection the lady learned to read with fluency but she never overcame the difficulties of spelling  a lady collector who loved books not very well perhaps but certainly not wisely was the unhappy marie antoinette  the controversy in france about the private character of the queen has been as acrimonious as the scotch discussion about mary stuart evidence good and bad letters as apocryphal as the letters of the famous casket have been produced on both sides  a few years ago under the empire m louis lacour found a manuscript catalogue of the books in the queens boudoir  they were all novels of the flimsiest sortlamitie dangereuse les suites dun moment derreur and even the stories of louvet and of retif de la bretonne  these volumes all bore the letters c t chateau de trianon and during the revolution they were scattered among the various public libraries of paris  the queens more important library was at the tuileries but at versailles she had only three books as the commissioners of the convention found when they made an inventory of the property of la femme capet  among the three was the gerusalemme liberata printed with eighty exquisite designs by cochin at the expense of monsieur afterwards louis xviii books with the arms of marie antoinette are very rare in private collections in sales they are as much sought after as those of madame du barry  with these illustrations of the kind of interest that belongs to books of old collectors we may close this chapter  the reader has before him a list with examples of the kinds of books at present most in vogue among amateurs  he must judge for himself whether he will follow the fashion by aid either of a long purse or of patient research or whether he will find out new paths for himself  a scholar is rarely a rich man  he cannot compete with plutocrats who buy by deputy  but if he pursues the works he really needs he may make a valuable collection  he cannot go far wrong while he brings together the books that he finds most congenial to his own taste and most useful to his own studies  here then in the words of the old sentiment i bid him farewell and wish success to his inclinations provided they are virtuous  there is a set of collectors alas whose inclinations are not virtuous  the most famous of them a frenchman observed that his own collection of bad books was unique  that of an english rival he

has no long or doubtful history since to find its first beginnings it is needless to go farther back than the last quarter of the eighteenth century  not that illustrated books of a certain class were by any means unknown before that period  on the contrary for many years previously literature had boasted its sculptures of bewigged and belaurelled worthies its prospects and landskips its phenomenal monsters and its curious antiques  but despite the couplet in the dunciad respecting books where        the pictures for the page atone and quarles is saved by beauties not his own    illustrations in which the designer attempted the actual delineation of scenes or occurrences in the text were certainly not common when pope wrote nor were they for some time afterwards either very numerous or very noteworthy  there are hogarths engravings to hudibras and don quixote there are the designs of his crony frank hayman to theobalds shakespeare to milton to pope to cervantes there are pines horace and sturts prayer book in both of which text and ornament were alike engraved there are the historical and topographical drawings of sandby wale and others and yetnotwithstanding all theseit is with bewicks cuts to gays fables in 1779 and stothards plates to harrisons novelists magazine in 1780 that bookillustration by imaginative compositions really begins to flourish in england  those little masterpieces of the newcastle artist brought about a revival of woodengraving which continues to this day but engraving upon metal as a means of decorating books practically came to an end with the annuals of thirty years ago  it will therefore be well to speak first of illustrations upon copper and steel   stothard blake and flaxman are the names that come freshest to memory in this connection  for a period of fifty years stothard stands preeminent in illustrated literature  measuring time by poets he may be said to have lent something of his fancy and amenity to most of the writers from cowper to rogers  as a draughtsman he is undoubtedly weak  his figures are often limp and invertebrate and his type of beauty insipid  still regarded as groups the majority of his designs are exquisite and he possessed one allpervading and unenglish qualitythe quality of grace this is his dominant note  nothing can be more seductive than the suave flow of his line his feeling for costume his gentle and chastened humour  many of his women and children are models of purity and innocence  but he works at ease only within the limits of his special powers he is happier in the pastoral and domestic than the heroic and supernatural and his style is better fitted to the formal salutations of clarissa and sir charles grandison than the rough horseplay of peregrine pickle  where rowlandson would have revelled stothard would be awkward and constrained where blake would give us a new sensation stothard would be poor and mechanical  nevertheless the gifts he possessed were thoroughly recognised in his own day and brought him if not riches at least competence and honour  it is said that more than three thousand of his drawings have been engraved and they are scattered through a hundred publications  those to the pilgrims progress and the poems of rogers are commonly spoken of as his best though he never excelled some of the oldfashioned plates with their pretty borders in the style of gravelot and the frenchmen to richardsons novels and such forgotten classics as joe thompson jessamy betsy thoughtless and one or two others in harrisons very miscellaneous collection  stothard was fortunate in his engravers  besides james heath his best interpreter schiavonetti sharp finden the cookes bartolozzi most of the fashionable translators into copper were busily employed upon his inventions  among the rest was an artist of powers far greater than his own although scarcely so happy in turning them to profitable account  the genius of william blake was not a marketable commodity in the same way as stothards talent the one caught the trick of the time with his facile elegance the other scorned to make any concessions either in conception or execution to the mere popularity of prettiness   give pensions to the learned pig or the hare playing on a tabor anglus can never see perfection but in the journeymans labour    he wrote in one of those roughhewn and bitter epigrams of his  yet the work that was then so lukewarmly receivedif indeed it can be said to have been received at allis at present far more sought after than stothards and the prices now given for the songs of innocence and experience the inventions to the book of job and even the grave would have brought affluence to the struggling artist who as cromek taunted him was frequently reduced so low as to be obliged to live on half a guinea a week  not that this was entirely the fault of his contemporaries  blake was a visionary and an untuneable man and like others who work for the select public of all ages he could not always escape the consequence that the select public of his own however willing were scarcely numerous enough to support him  his most individual works are the songs of innocence 1789 and the songs of experience 1794  these afterwards united in one volume were unique in their method of production indeed they do not perhaps strictly come within the category of what is generally understood to be copperplate engraving  the drawings were outlined and the songs written upon the metal with some liquid that resisted the action of acid and the remainder of the surface of the plate was eaten away with aquafortis leaving the design in bold relief like a rude stereotype  this was then printed off in the predominant tone blue brown or yellow as the case might beand delicately tinted by the artist in a prismatic and ethereal fashion peculiarly his own  stitched and bound in boards by mrs blake a certain number of these leafletstwentyseven in the case of the first issuemade up a tiny octavo of a wholly exceptional kind  words indeed fail to exactly describe the flowerlike beautythe fascination of these fairy missals in which it has been finely said the thrilling music of the verse and the gentle bedazzlement of the lines and colours so intermingle that the mind hangs in a pleasant uncertainty as to whether it is a picture that is singing or a song which has newly budded and blossomed into colour and form  the accompanying woodcut after one of the illustrations to the songs of innocence gives some indication of the general composition but it can convey no hint of the gorgeous purple and crimson and orange of the original  of the illustrations to the book of job 1826 there are excellent reduced facsimiles by the recentlydiscovered photointaglio process in the new edition of gilchrists life  the originals were engraved by blake himself in his strong decisive fashion and they are his best work  a kind of deisidaimoniaa sacred awe falls upon one in turning over these wonderful productions of the artists declining years and failing hand   leaving the old both worlds at once they view that stand upon the threshold of the new   sings waller and it is almost possible to believe for a moment that their creator was as he said under the direction of messengers from heaven  but his designs for blairs grave 1808 popularised by the burin of schiavonetti attracted greater attention at the time of publication and being less rare they are even now perhaps better known than the others  the facsimile here given is from the latter book  the worn old man the trustful woman and the guileless child are sleeping peacefully but the king with his sceptre and the warrior with his hand on his swordhilt lie openeyed waiting the summons of the trumpet  one cannot help fancying that the artists long vigils among the abbey tombs during his apprenticeship to james basire must have been present to his mind when he selected this impressive monumental subject  to one of blakes few friendsto the dear sculptor of eternity as he wrote to flaxman from felphamthe world is indebted for some notable book illustrations  whether the greatest writersthe homers the shakespeares the dantescan ever be illustrated without loss may fairly be questioned  at all events the showy dexterities of the dores and gilberts prove nothing to the contrary but now and then there comes to the graphic interpretation of a great author an artist either so reverential or so strongly sympathetic at some given point that in default of any relation more narrowly intimate we at once accept his conceptions as the best attainable  in this class are flaxmans outlines to homer and aeschylus  flaxman was not a hellenist as men are hellenists to day  nevertheless his roman studies had saturated him with the spirit of antique beauty and by his grand knowledge of the nude his calm his restraint he is such an illustrator of homer as is not likely to arise again  for whowith all our added knowledge of classical antiquitywho of our modern artists could hope to rival such thoroughly greek compositions as the ballplay of nausicaa in the odyssey or that lovely group from aeschylus of the tender hearted womanly oceanides cowering like flowers beaten by the storm under the terrible anger of zeus  in our day flaxmans drawings would have been reproduced by some of the modern facsimile processes and the gain would have been great  as it is something is lost by their transference to copper even though the translators be piroli and blake  blake in fact did more than he is usually credited with for beside the acknowledged and later hesiod 1817 he really engraved the whole of the odyssey pirolis plates having been lost on the voyage to england  the name of the roman artist nevertheless appears on the titlepage 1793  but blake was too original to be a successful copyist of other mens work and to appreciate the full value of flaxmans drawings they should be studied in the collections at university college the royal academy and elsewhere 9  flaxman and blake had few imitators  but a host of clever designers such as cipriani angelica kauffmann westall uwins smirke burney corbould dodd and others vied with the popular stothard in embellishing the endless poets novelists and essayists of our forefathers  some of these and most of the recognised artists of the period lent their aid to that boldly planned but unhappilyexecuted shakespeare of boydellblack and ghastly gallery of murky opies glum northcotes straddling fuselis as thackeray calls it  they are certainly not enlivening those cumbrous atlas folios of 18035 and they helped to ruin the worthy alderman  even courtly sir joshua is clearly ill at ease among the pushing hamiltons and mortimers and were it not for the whimsical discovery that westalls ghost of caesar strangely resembles mr gladstone there would be no restingplace for the modern student of these dismal masterpieces  the truth is reynolds excepted there were no contemporary painters strong enough for the task and the honours of the enterprise belong almost exclusively to smirkes seven ages and one or two plates from the lighter comedies  the great bible of macklin a rival and even more incongruous publication upon which some of the same designers were employed has fallen into completer oblivion  a rather better fate attended another book of this class which although belonging to a later period may be briefly referred to here  the milton of john martin has distinct individuality and some of the needful qualities of imagination  nevertheless posterity has practically decided that scenic grandeur and sombre effects alone are not a sufficient pictorial equipment for the varied story of paradise lost  it is to boydell of the shakespeare gallery that we owe the liber veritatis of claude engraved by richard earlom and indirectly since rivalry of claude prompted the attempt the famous liber studiorum of turner  neither of these howeverwhich like the rivers of france and the picturesque views in england and wales of the latter artist are collections of engravings rather than illustrated booksbelongs to the present purpose  but turners name may fitly serve to introduce those once familiar annuals and keepsakes that beginning in 1823 with ackermanns forgetme not enjoyed a popularity of more than thirty years  their general characteristics have been pleasantly satirised in thackerays account of the elegant miscellany of bacon the publisher to which mr arthur pendennis contributed his pretty poem of the church porch  his editress it will be remembered was the lady violet lebas and his colleagues the honourable percy popjoy lord dodo and the gifted bedwin sands whose eastern ghazuls lent so special a distinction to the volume in wateredsilk binding  the talented authors it is true were in most cases under the disadvantage of having to write to the plates of the talented artists a practice which even now is not extinct though it is scarcely considered favourable to literary merit  and the real annuals were no exception to the rule  as a matter of fact their general literary merit was not obtrusive although of course they sometimes contained work which afterwards became famous  they are now so completely forgotten and out of date that one scarcely expects to find that wordsworth coleridge macaulay and southey were among the occasional contributors  lambs beautiful album verses appeared in the bijou scotts bonnie dundee in the christmas box and tennysons st agnes eve in the keepsake  but the plates were after all the leading attraction  these prepared for the most part under the superintendence of the younger heath and executed on the steel which by this time had supplanted the old coppers were supplied by or were after almost every contemporary artist of note  stothard now growing old and past his prime turner etty stanfield leslie roberts danby maclise lawrence cattermole and numbers of others found profitable labour in this fashionable field until 1856 when the last of the annuals disappeared driven from the market by the rapid development of wood engraving  about a million it is roughly estimated was squandered in producing them  in connection with the annuals must be mentioned two illustrated books which were in all probability suggested by themthe poems and italy of rogers  the designs to these are chiefly by turner and stothard although there are a few by prout and others stothards have been already referred to turners are almost universally held to be the most successful of his many vignettes it has been truly saidin a recent excellent life of this artist 10that it would be difficult to find in the whole of his works two really greater than the alps at daybreak and the datur hora quieti in the former of these volumes  almost equally beautiful are the valombre falls and tornaros misty brow  of the italy set mr ruskin writes they are entirely exquisite poetical in the highest and purest sense exemplary and delightful beyond all praise  to such words it is not possible to add much  but it is pretty clear that the poetical vitality of rogers was secured by these welltimed illustrations over which he is admitted by his nephew mr sharpe to have spent about 7000 pounds and far larger sums have been named by good authorities  the artist received from fifteen to twenty guineas for each of the drawings the engravers goodall miller wallis smith and others sixty guineas a plate the poems and the italy in the original issues of 1830 and 1834 are still precious to collectors and are likely to remain so turner also illustrated scott milton campbell and byron but this series of designs has not received equal commendation from his greatest eulogist who declares them to be much more laboured and more or less artificial and unequal  among the numerous imitations directly induced by the rogers books was the lyrics of the heart by alaric attila watts a forgotten versifier and sometime editor of annuals but it did not meet with similar success  many illustrated works originating in the perfection and opportunities of engraving on metal are necessarily unnoticed in this rapid summary  as far however as bookillustration is concerned copper and steel plate engraving may be held to have gone out of fashion with the annuals  it is still indeed to be found lingering in that mine of modern artbooksthe art journal and not so very long ago it made a sumptuous and fugitive reappearance in dores idylls of the king birket fosters hood and one or two other imposing volumes  but it was badly injured by modern woodengraving it has since been crippled for life by photography and it is more than probable that the present rapid rise of modern etching will give it the coup de grace 11  by the end of the seventeenth century the art of engraving on wood had fallen into disuse  writing circa 1770 horace walpole goes so far as to say that it never was executed in any perfection in england and speaking afterwards of papillons traite de la gravure 1766 he takes occasion to doubt if that author would ever persuade the world to return to wooden cuts  nevertheless with bewick a few years later woodengraving took a fresh departure so conspicuous that it amounts to a revival  in what this consisted it is clearly impossible to show here with any sufficiency of detail but between the method of the old woodcutters who reproduced the drawings of durer and the method of the newcastle artist there are two marked and welldefined differences  one of these is a difference in the preparation of the wood and the tool employed the old woodcutters carved their designs with knives and chisels on strips of wood sawn lengthwisethat is to say upon the plank bewick used a graver and worked upon slices of box or pear cut across the grainthat is to say upon the end of the wood  the other difference of which bewick is said to have been the inventor is less easy to describe  it consisted in the employment of what is technically known as white line  in all antecedent woodcutting the cutter had simply cleared away those portions of the block left bare by the design so that the design remained in relief to be printed from like type  using the smooth box block as a uniform surface from which if covered with printing ink a uniformly black impression might be obtained bewick by cutting white lines across it at greater or lesser intervals produced gradations of shade from the absolute black of the block to the lightest tints  the general result of this method was to give a greater depth of colouring and variety to the engraving but its advantages may perhaps be best understood by a glance at the background of the woodcock on the following page  bewicks first work of any importance was the gays fables of 1779  in 1784 he did another series of select fables  neither of these books however can be compared with the general history of quadrupeds 1790 and the british land and water birds 1797 and 1804  the illustrations to the quadrupeds are in many instances excellent and large additions were made to them in subsequent issues  but in this collection bewick laboured to a great extent under the disadvantage of representing animals with which he was familiar only through the medium of stuffed specimens or incorrect drawings  in the british birds on the contrary his facilities for study from the life were greater and his success was consequently more complete  indeed it may be safely affirmed that of all the engravers of the present century none have excelled bewick for beauty of black and white for skilful rendering of plumage and foliage and for fidelity of detail and accessory  the woodcock here given the partridge the owl the yellow hammer the yellowbunting the willowwren are popular examples of these qualities  but there are a hundred others nearly as good  among sundry conventional decorations after the old german fashion in the first edition of the quadrupeds there are a fair number of those famous tailpieces which to a good many people constitute bewicks chief claim to immortality  that it is not easy to imitate them is plain from the failure of branstons attempts and from the inferior character of those by john thompson in yarrells fishes the genius of bewick was in fact entirely individual and particular  he had the humour of a hogarth in little as well as some of his special characteristicsnotably his faculty of telling a story by suggestive detail  an instance may be taken at random from vol i of the birds  a man whose wig and hat have fallen off lies asleep with open mouth under some bushes  he is manifestly drunk and the date 4 june on a neighbouring stone gives us the reason and occasion of his catastrophe  he has been too loyally celebrating the birthday of his majesty king george iii another of bewicks gifts is his wonderful skill in foreshadowing a tragedy  take as an example this truly appalling incident from the quadrupeds  the tottering child whose nurse is seen in the background has strayed into the meadow and is pulling at the tail of a viciouslooking colt with backturned eye and lifted heel down the gardensteps the mother hurries headlong but she can hardly be in time  and of all thissufficient one would say for a fairlysized canvasthe artist has managed to give a vivid impression in a block of three inches by two  then again like hogarth once more he rejoices in multiplications of dilemma  what for instance can be more comically pathetic than the headpiece to the contents in vol i of the birds  the old horse has been seized with an invincible fit of stubbornness  the day is both windy and rainy  the rider has broken his stick and lost his hat but he is too much encumbered with his cackling and excited stock to dare to dismount  nothing can help him but a deus ex machinaof whom there is no sign  besides his humour bewick has a delightfully rustic side of which hogarth gives but little indication  from the starved ewe in the snow nibbling forlornly at a wornout broom to the cow which has broken through the rail to reach the running water there are numberless designs which reveal that faithful lover of the field and hillside who as he said would rather be herding sheep on mickle bank top than remain in london to be made premier of england  he loved the country and the countrylife and he drew them as one who loved them  it is this rural quality which helps to give such a lasting freshness to his quaint and picturesque fancies and it is this which will continue to preserve their popularity even if they should cease to be valued for their wealth of whimsical invention  in referring to these masterpieces of bewicks it must not be forgotten that he had the aid of some clever assistants  his younger brother john was not without talent as is clear from his work for somerviles chace 1796 and that highly edifying book the blossoms of morality  many of the tailpieces to the water birds were designed by robert johnson who also did most of the illustrations to bewicks fables of 1818 which were engraved by temple and harvey two other pupils  another pupil was charlton nesbit an excellent engraver who was employed upon the birds and did good work in ackermanns religious emblems of 1808 and the second series of northcotes fables  but by far the largest portion of the tailpieces in the second volume of the birds was engraved by luke clennell a very skilful but unfortunate artist who ultimately became insane  to him we owe the woodcuts after stothards charming sketches to the rogers volume of 1810 an edition preceding those already mentioned as illustrated with steel plates and containing some of the artists happiest pictures of children and amorini  many of these little groups would make admirable designs for gems if indeed they are not already derived from them since one at least is an obvious copy of a wellknown sardonyxthe marriage of cupid and psyche  this volume generally known by the name of the firebrand edition is highly prized by collectors and as intelligent renderings of pen and ink there is little better than these engravings of clennells 12 finally among others of bewicks pupils must be mentioned william harvey who survived to 1866  it has been already stated that he engraved part of the illustrations to bewicks fables but his best known block is the large one of haydons death of dentatus soon after this he relinquished woodengraving in favour of design and for a long period was one of the most fertile and popular of bookillustrators  his style however is unpleasantly mannered and it is sufficient to make mention of his masterpiece the arabian nights of lane the illustrations to which produced under the supervision of the translator are said to be so accurate as to give the appropriate turbans for every hour of the day  they show considerable freedom of invention and a large fund of orientalism  harvey came to london in 1817 clennell had preceded him by some years and nesbit lived there for a considerable time  what distinguishes these pupils of bewick especially is that they were artists as well as engravers capable of producing the designs they engraved  the london school of engravers on the contrary were mostly engravers who depended upon others for their designs  the foremost of these was robert branston a skilful renderer of human figures and indoor scenes  he worked in rivalry with bewick and nesbit but he excelled neither while he fell far behind the former  john thompson one of the very best of modern english engravers on wood was branstons pupil  his range was of the widest and he succeeded as well in engraving fishes and birds for yarrell and waltons angler as in illustrations to moliere and hudibras  he was besides a clever draughtsman though he worked chiefly from the designs of thurston and others  one of the most successful of his illustrated books is the vicar of wakefield after mulready whose simplicity and homely feeling were well suited to goldsmiths style  another excellent engraver of this date is samuel williams  there is an edition of thomsons seasons with cuts both drawn and engraved by him which is well worthy of attention and like thompson and branston he was very skilful in reproducing the designs of cruikshank  some of his best work in this way is to be found in clarkes three courses and a dessert published by vizetelly in 1830  from this time forth however one hears less of the engraver and more of the artist  the establishment of the penny magazine in 1832 and the multifarious publications of charles knight gave an extraordinary impetus to woodengraving  ten years later came punch and the illustrated london news which further increased its popularity  artists of eminence began to draw on or for the block as they had drawn and were still drawing for the annuals in 18426 was issued the great abbotsford edition of the waverley novels which besides 120 plates contained nearly 2000 wood engravings and with the book of british ballads 1843 edited by mr s c hall arose that long series of illustrated christmas books which gradually supplanted the annuals and made familiar the names of gilbert birket foster harrison weir john absolon and a crowd of others  the poems of longfellow montgomery burns barry cornwall poe miss ingelow were all successively illustrated  besides these there were numerous selections such as willmotts poets of the nineteenth century willss poets wit and humour and so forth  but the field here grows too wide to be dealt with in detail and it is impossible to do more than mention a few of the books most prominent for merit or originality  amongst these there is the shakespeare of sir john gilbert  regarded as an interpretative edition of the great dramatist this is little more than a brilliant tour de force but it is nevertheless infinitely superior to the earlier efforts of kenny meadows in 1843 and also to the fancy designs of harvey in knights pictorial shakespeare  the illustrated tennyson of 1858 is also a remarkable production  the laureate almost more than any other requires a variety of illustrators and here for his idylls he had mulready and millais and for his romances rossetti and holman hunt his princess was afterwards illustrated by maclise and his enoch arden by arthur hughes but neither of these can be said to be wholly adequate  the lalla rookh of john tenniel 1860 albeit somewhat stiff and cold after this artists fashion is a superb collection of carefully studied oriental designs  with these may be classed the illustrations to aytouns lays of the scottish cavaliers by sir noel paton which have the same finished qualities of composition and the same academic hardness  several good editions of the pilgrims progress have appearednotably those of c h bennett j d watson and g h thomas  other books are millaiss parables of our lord leightons romola walkers philip and denis duval the don quixote dante la fontaine and other works of dore dalziels arabian nights leightons lyra germanica and moral emblems and the spiritual conceits of w harry rogers  these are some only of the number which does not include books like mrs hugh blackburns british birds wolfs wild animals wises new forest lintons lake country woods natural history and many more  nor does it take in the various illustrated periodicals which have multiplied so freely since in 1859 once a week first began to attract and train such younger draughtsmen as sandys lawless pinwell houghton morten and paul grey some of whose best work in this way has been revived in the edition of thornburys ballads and songs recently published by chatto and windus  ten years later came the graphic offering still wider opportunities to woodcut art and bringing with it a fresh school of artists  herkomer fildes small green barnard barnes crane caldecott hopkins and othersquos nunc perscribere longum esthave contributed good work to this popular rival of the older but still vigorous illustrated  and now again another promising serial the magazine of art affords a supplementary field to modern refinements and younger energies  not a few of the artists named in the preceding paragraph have also earned distinction in separate branches of the pictorial art and specially in that of humorous designa department which has always been so richly recruited in this country that it deserves more than a passing mention  from the days of hogarth onwards there has been an almost unbroken series of humorous draughtsmen who both on wood and metal play a distinguished part in our illustrated literature rowlandson one of the earliest was a caricaturist of inexhaustible facility and an artist who scarcely did justice to his own powers he illustrated several books but he is chiefly remembered in this way by his plates to combes three tours of dr syntax  gillray his contemporary whose bias was political rather than social is said to have illustrated the deserted village in his youth but he is not famous as a bookillustrator  another of the early men was bunbury whom qualityloving mr walpole calls the second hogarth and first imitator who ever fully equalled his original  but whose prints to tristram shandy are nevertheless completely forgotten while if he be remembered at all it is by the plate of the long minuet and the vulgar directions to bad horsemen  with the first years of the century however appears the great master of modern humorists whose long life ended only a few years since the veteran george cruikshankas his admirers were wont to style him  he indeed may justly be compared to hogarth since in tragic power and intensity he occasionally comes nearer to him than any artist of our time  it is manifestly impossible to mention here all the more important efforts of this indefatigable worker from those faraway days when he caricatured boney and championed queen caroline to that final frontispiece for the rose and the lilydesigned and etched according to the inscription by george cruikshank age 83 but the plates to the points of humour to grimms goblins to oliver twist jack sheppard maxwells irish rebellion and the table book are sufficiently favourable and varied specimens of his skill with the needle while the woodcuts to three courses and a dessert one of which is here given are equally good examples of his work on the block  the triumph of cupid which begins the table book is an excellent instance of his lavish wealth of fancy and it contains beside onenay more than oneof the many portraits of the artist he is shown en robe de chambre smoking this was before his regenerate days in front of a blazing fire with a pet spaniel on his knee  in the cloud which curls from his lips is a motley procession of sailors sweeps jockeys greenwich pensioners jew clothesmen flunkies and others more illustrious chained to the chariot wheels of cupid who preceded by cherubic acolytes and bannerbearers winds round the top of the picture towards an altar of hymen on the table  when by the aid of a pocketglass one has mastered these swarming figures as well as those in the foreground it gradually dawns upon one that all the furniture is strangely vitalised  masks laugh round the border of the tablecloth the markings of the mantelpiece resolve themselves into rows of madly racing figures the tongs leers in a degage and cavalier way at the artist the shovel and poker grin in sympathy there are faces in the smoke in the fire in the fireplacethe very fender itself is a ring of fantastic creatures who jubilantly hem in the ashes  and it is not only in the grotesque and fanciful that cruikshank excels he is master of the strange the supernatural and the terrible  in range of character the comparison is probably a hackneyed one both by his gifts and his limitations he resembles dickens and had he illustrated more of that writers works the resemblance would probably have been more evident  in oliver twist for example where dickens is strong cruikshank is strong where dickens is weak he is weak too  his fagin his bill sikes his bumble and their following are on a level with dickenss conceptions his monk and rose maylie are as poor as the originals  but as the defects of dickens are overbalanced by his merits so cruikshanks strength is far in excess of his weakness  it is not to his melodramatic heroes or waspwaisted heroines that we must look for his triumphs it is to his delineations from the moralists point of view of vulgarity and viceof the rank life of towns with all its squalid tragedy and comedy  here he finds his strongest ground and possibly notwithstanding his powers as a comic artist and caricaturist his loftiest claim to recollection  cruikshank was employed on two only of dickenss booksoliver twist and the sketches by boz 13  the great majority of them were illustrated by hablot k browne an artist who followed the illfated seymour on the pickwick papers  to phiz as he is popularly called we are indebted for our pictorial ideas of sam weller mrs gamp captain cuttle and most of the authors characters down to the tale of two cities  phiz also illustrated a great many of levers novels for which his skill in hunting and other leverlike scenes especially qualified him  with the name of richard doyle we come to the first of a group of artists whose main work was or is still done for the timehonoured miscellany of mr punch  so familiar an object is punch upon our tables that one is sometimes apt to forget how unfailing and how good on the whole is the work we take so complacently as a matter of course  and of this good work in the earlier days a large proportion was done by mr doyle  he is still living although he has long ceased to gladden those sprightly pages  but it was to punch that he contributed his masterpiece the manners and customs of ye englyshe a series of outlines illustrating social life in 1849 and cleverly commented by a shadowy mr pips a sort of fetch or double of the bustling and garrulous old caroline diarist  in these captivating pictures the life of thirty years ago is indeed as the titlepage has it drawn from ye quick  we see the molesworths and cantilupes of the day parading the park we watch brougham fretting at a hearing in the lords or peel holding forth to the commons where the irish members are already obstructive we squeeze in at the haymarket to listen to jenny lind or we run down the river to greenwich fair and visit mr richardson his show  many years after in the birds eye views of society which appeared in the early numbers of the cornhill magazine mr doyle returned to this attractive theme  but the later designs were more elaborate and not equally fortunate  they bear the same relationship to mr pipss pictorial chronicle as the laboured temperance fairy tales of cruikshanks old age bear to the littleworked grimms goblins of his youth  so hazardous is the attempt to repeat an old success  nevertheless many of the initial letters to the birds eye views are in the artists best and most frolicsome manner  the foreign tour of brown jones and robinson is another of his happy thoughts for punch and some of his most popular designs are to be found in thackerays newcomes where his satire and fancy seem thoroughly suited to his text  he has also illustrated lockers wellknown london lyrics ruskins king of the golden river and hughess scouring of the white horse from which last the initial at the beginning of this chapter has been borrowed  his latest important effort was the series of drawings called in fairy land to which mr william allingham contributed the verses  in speaking of the newcomes one is reminded that its illustrious author was himself a punch artist and would probably have been a designer alone had it not been decreed that he should paint in colours which will never crack and never need restoration everyone knows the story of the rejected illustrator of pickwick whom that and other rebuffs drove permanently to letters  to his death however he clung fondly to his pencil  in technique he never attained to certainty or strength and his genius was too quick and creativeperhaps also too desultoryfor finished work while he was always indifferent to costume and accessory  but many of his sketches for vanity fair for pendennis for the virginians for the rose and the ring the christmas books and the posthumously published orphan of pimlico have a vigour of impromptu and a happy suggestiveness which is better than correct drawing  often the realisation is almost photographic  look for example at the portrait in pendennis of the dilapidated major as he crawls downstairs in the dawn after the ball at gaunt house and then listen to the inimitable context  that admirable and devoted major above allwho had been for hours by lady claverings side ministering to her and feeding her body with everything that was nice and her ear with everything that was sweet and flatteringoh what an object he was  the rings round his eyes were of the colour of bistre those orbs themselves were like the plovers eggs whereof lady clavering and blanche had each tasted the wrinkles in his old face were furrowed in deep gashes and a silver stubble like an elderly morning dew was glittering on his chin and alongside the dyed whiskers now limp and out of curl  a good deal of thisthat fine touch in italics especiallycould not possibly be rendered in black and white and yet how much is indicated and how thoroughly the whole is felt  one turns to the woodcut from the words and back again to the words from the woodcut with everincreasing gratification  then again thackerays little initial letters are charmingly arch and playful  they seem to throw a shy sidelight upon the text giving as it were an additional and confidential hint of the working of the authors mind  to those who with the present writer love every tiny scratch and quirk and flourish of the masters hand these small but priceless memorials are far beyond the frigid appraising of academics and schools of art  after doyle and thackeray come a couple of wellknown artistsjohn leech and john tenniel  the latter still lives may he long live to delight and instruct us  of the former whose genial and manly pictures of life and character are in every home where good humoured raillery is prized and appreciated it is scarcely necessary to speak  who does not remember the splendid languid swells the brighteyed rosy girls with no nonsense about them in pork pie hats and crinolines the superlative jeamess the hairy mossoos the musicgrinding italian desperadoes whom their kind creator hated so  and then the intrepidity of mr briggs the roman rule of paterfamilias the vagaries of the rising generation  there are things in this gallery over which the severest misanthrope must chucklethey are simply irresistible let any one take say that smallest sketch of the hapless mortal who has turned on the hot water in the bath and cannot turn it off again and see if he is able to restrain his laughter  in this one gift of producing instant mirth leech is almost alone  it would be easy to assail his manner and his skill but for sheer fun for the invention of downright humorous situation he is unapproached except by cruikshank  he did a few illustrations to dickenss christmas books but his bestknown bookillustrations properly so called are to uncle toms cabin the comic histories of abeckett the little tour in ireland and certain sporting novels by the late mr surtees  tenniel now confines himself almost exclusively to the weekly cartoons with which his name is popularly associated  but years ago he used to invent the most daintily fanciful initial letters and many of his admirers prefer the serio grotesque designs of punchs pocketbook alice in wonderland and through the lookingglass to the always correctlydrawn but sometimes stifflyconceived cartoons  what for example could be more delightful than the picture in alice in wonderland of the mad tea party  observe the hopelessly distraught expression of the march hare and the eager incoherence of the hatter  a little further on the pair are trying to squeeze the dormouse into the teapot and a few pages back the blue caterpillar is discovered smoking his hookah on the top of a mushroom  he was exactly three inches long says the veracious chronicle but what a dignitywhat an oriental flexibility of gesture  speaking of animals it must not be forgotten that tenniel is a master in this line  his british lion in particular is a most imposing quadruped and so often in request that it is not necessary to go back to the famous cartoons on the indian mutiny to seek for examples of that magnificent presence  as a specimen of the artists treatment of the lesser felidae the readers attention is invited to this charming little kitten from through the lookingglass  mr tenniel is a link between leech and the younger school of punch artists of whom mr george du maurier mr linley sambourne and mr charles keene are the most illustrious  the first is nearly as popular as leech and is certainly a greater favourite with cultivated audiences  he is not so much a humorist as a satirist of the thackeray typeunsparing in his denunciation of shams affectations and flimsy pretences of all kinds  a master of composition and accomplished draughtsman he excels in the delineation of societyits bishops its professional beauties and aesthetes its nouveaux riches its distinguished foreigners while now and then but not too often he lets us know that if he chose he could be equally happy in depicting the lowest classes there was a barroom scene not long ago in punch which gave the clearest evidence of this  some of those for whom no good thing is good enough complain it is said that he lacks varietythat he is too constant to one type of feminine beauty  but any one who will be at the pains to study a group of conventional society faces from any of his at homes or musical parties will speedily discover that they are really very subtly diversified and contrasted  for a case in point take the decorously sympathetic group round the sensitive german musician who is veeping over one of his own compositions  or follow the titter running round that amused assembly to whom the tenor warbler is singing meeeet me once again with such passionate emphasis that the domestic cat mistakes it for a wellknown area cry  as for his ladies it may perhaps be conceded that his type is a little persistent  still it is a type so refined so graceful so attractive altogether that in the jarring of less wellfavoured realities it is an advantage to have it always before our eyes as a standard to which we can appeal mr du maurier is a fertile bookillustrator whose hand is frequently seen in the cornhill and elsewhere  some of his best work of this kind is in douglas jerrolds story of a feather in thackerays ballads and the large edition of the ingoldsby legends to which leech tenniel and cruikshank also contributed one of his prettiest compositions is the group here reproduced from punchs almanack for 1877  the talent of his colleague mr linley sambourne may fairly be styled unique  it is difficult to compare it with anything in its way except some of the happier efforts of the late mr charles bennett to which nevertheless it is greatly superior in execution  to this clever artists invention everything seems to present itself with a train of fantastic accessory so whimsically inexhaustible that it almost overpowers one with its prodigality  each fresh examination of his designs discloses something overlooked or unexpected  let the reader study for a moment the famous birds of a feather of 1875 or that ingenious skit of 1877 upon the rival grosvenor gallery and academy in which the late president of the latter is shown as the proudest of peacocks the eyes of whose tail are portraits of royal academicians and whose bodyfeathers are paint brushes and shillings of admission  mr sambourne is excellent too at adaptations of popular pictureswitness the more than happy parodies of herrmans a bout darguments and une bonne histoire  his bookillustrations have been comparatively few those to burnands laughable burlesque of sandford and merton being among the best  rumour asserts that he is at present engaged upon kingsleys water babies a subject which might almost be supposed to have been created for his pencil  there are indications it may be added that mr sambournes talents are by no means limited to the domain in which for the present he chooses to exercise them and it is not impossible that he may hereafter take high rank as a cartoonist  mr charles keene a selection from whose sketches has recently been issued under the title of our people is unrivalled in certain bourgeois military and provincial types  no one can draw a volunteer a monthly nurse a scotchman an ancient mariner of the wateringplace species with such absolutely humorous verisimilitude  personages too in whose eyesto use mr swivellers euphemismthe sun has shone too strongly find in mr keene a merciless satirist of their pleasant vices  like leech he has also a remarkable power of indicating a landscape background with the fewest possible touches  his book illustrations have been mainly confined to magazines and novels those in once a week to a good fight the tale subsequently elaborated by charles reade into the cloister and the hearth present some good specimens of his earlier work  one of these in which the dwarf of the story is seen climbing up a wall with a lantern at his back will probably be remembered by many  after the punch school there are other lesser luminaries  mr w s gilberts drawings to his own inimitable bab ballads have a perverse drollery which is quite in keeping with that erratic text mr f barnard whose exceptional talents have not been sufficiently recognised is a master of certain phases of strongly marked character and like mr charles green has contributed some excellent sketches to the household edition of dickens  mr sullivan of fun whose grotesque studies of the british tradesman and workman have recently been republished has abounding vis comica but he has hitherto done little in the way of illustrating books  for minute pictorial stocktaking and photographic retention of detail mr sullivans artistic memory may almost be compared to the wonderful literary memory of mr sala mr john proctor who some years ago in will o the wisp seemed likely to rival tenniel as a cartoonist has not been very active in this way while mr matthew morgan the clever artist of the tomahawk has transferred his services to the united states  of mr bowcher of judy and various other professedly humorous designers space permits no further mention   there remains however one popular branch of bookillustration which has attracted the talents of some of the most skilful and original of modern draughtsmen ie the embellishment of childrens books  from the days when mulready drew the old butterflys ball and peacock at home of our youth to those of the delightfully blakelike fancies of e v b whose childs play has recently been republished for the delectation of a new generation of admirers this has always been a popular and profitable employment but of late years it has been raised to the level of a fine art mr h s marks mr j d watson mr walter crane have produced specimens of nursery literature which for refinement of colouring and beauty of ornament cannot easily be surpassed  the equipments of the last named especially are of a very high order  he began as a landscapist on wood he now chiefly devotes himself to the figure and he seems to have the decorative art at his fingers ends as a natural gift  such work as king luckieboys party was a revelation in the way of toy books while the babys opera and babys bouquet are petits chefs doeuvre of which the sagacious collector will do well to secure copies not for his nursery but his library  nor can his mrs mundi at home be neglected by the curious in quaint and graceful invention 14  another bookthe under the window of miss kate greenawaycomes within the same category  since stothard no one has given us such a cleareyed softfaced happyhearted childhood or so poetically apprehended the coy reticences the simplicities and the small solemnities of little people  added to this the oldworld costume in which she usually elects to clothe her characters lends an arch piquancy of contrast to their innocent rites and ceremonies  her taste in tinting too is very sweet and springlike and there is a fresh pure fragrance about all her pictures as of newgathered nosegays or perhaps looking to the fashions that she favours it would be better to say bowpots  but the latest good genius of this branch of bookillustrating is mr randolph caldecott a designer assuredly of the very first order  there is a spontaneity of fun an unforced invention about everything he does that is infinitely entertaining  other artists draw to amuse us mr caldecott seems to draw to amuse himselfand this is his charm  one feels that he must have chuckled inwardly as he puffed the cheeks of his jovial huntsmen or sketched that inimitably complacent dog in the house that jack built or exhibited the exploits of the immortal train band captain of famous london town  this last is his masterpiece  cowper himself must have rejoiced at itand lady austen  there are two sketches in this bookthey occupy the concluding pageswhich are especially fascinating  on one john gilpin in a forlorn and flaccid condition is helped into the house by the sympathising and very attractive betty on the other he has donned his slippers refreshed his inner man with a cordial and over the heaving shoulder of his spouse who lies dissolved upon his martial bosom he is taking the spectators into his confidence with a wink worthy of the late mr buckstone  nothing more genuine more heartily laughable than this set of designs has appeared in our day  and mr caldecott has few limitations  not only does he draw human nature admirably but he draws animals and landscapes equally well so one may praise him without reserve  though not childrens books mention should here be made of his bracebridge hall and old christmas the illustrations to which are the nearest approach to that beauideal perfect sympathy between the artist and the author with which the writer is acquainted  the cut on page 173 is from the former of these works   many of the books above mentioned are printed in colours by various processes and they are not always engraved on wood  butto close the account of modern woodengravingsome brief reference must be made to what is styled the new american school as exhibited for the most part in scribners and other transatlantic magazines authorities it is reported shake their heads over these performances cest magnifique mais ce nest pas la gravure they whisper  into the matter in dispute it is perhaps presumptuous for an atechnic to adventure himself  but to the outsider it would certainly seem as if the chief ground of complaint is that the new comers do not play the game according to the old rules and that this alleged irregular mode of procedure tends to lessen the status of the engraver as an artist  false or true this it may fairly be advanced has nothing whatever to do with the matter as far at least as the public are concerned  for them the question is simply and solelywhat is the result obtained  the new school availing themselves largely of the assistance of photography are able to dispense in a great measure with the old tedious method of drawing on the block and to leave the artist to choose what medium he prefers for his designbe it oil watercolour or black and whiteconcerning themselves only to reproduce its characteristics on the wood  this is of course a deviation from the method of bewick  but would bewick have adhered to his method in these days even in his last hours he was seeking for new processes  what we want is to get nearest to the artist himself with the least amount of interpretation or intermediation on the part of the engraver  is engraving on copper to be reproduced we want a facsimile if possible and not a rendering into something which is supposed to be the orthodox utterance of woodengraving  take for example the copy of schiavonettis engraving of blakes deaths door in scribners magazine for june 1880 or the cut from the same source at page 131 of this book  these are faithful line for line transcriptions as far as wood can give them of the original copperplates and this being the case it is not to be wondered at that the public who for a few pence can have practical facsimiles of blake of cruikshank or of whistler are loud in their appreciation of the new american school  nor are its successes confined to reproduction in facsimile  those who look at the exquisite illustrations in the same periodical to the tile club at play to roes success with small fruits and harriss insects injurious to vegetationto say nothing of the selected specimens in the recently issued portfolioswill see that the latest comers can hold their own on all fields with any school that has gone before 15  besides copperplate and wood there are many processes which have been and are still employed for bookillustrations although the brief limits of this chapter make any account of them impossible lithography was at one time very popular and in books like robertss holy land exceedingly effective  the etching club issued a number of books circa 184152 and most of the work of phiz and cruikshank was done with the needle  it is probable that as we have already seen the impetus given to modern etching by messrs hamerton seymour haden and whistler will lead to a specific revival of etching as a means of bookillustration already beautiful etchings have for some time appeared in lart the portfolio and the etcher and at least one book of poems has been entirely illustrated in this waythe poems of mr w bell scott  for reproducing old engravings maps drawings and the like it is not too much to say that we shall never get anything much closer than the facsimiles of m amanddurand and the typographic etching and autotype companies  but further improvements will probably have to be made before these can compete commercially with woodengraving as practised by the new american school   of making many books twais said there is no end and who thereon the everrunning ink doth shed but probes the words of solomon wherefore we now for colophon from londons city drear and dark in the year eighteen eightone reprint them at the press of clark  a d    footnotes  1  this is the technical name for people who illustrate books with engravings from other works  the practice became popular when granger published his biographical history of england  2  mr william blades in his enemies of books trubner 1880 decries glassdoors the absence of ventilation will assist the formation of mould  but m rouveyre bids us open the doors on sunny days that the air may be renewed and close them in the evening hours lest moths should enter and lay their eggs among the treasures  and with all deference to mr blades glassdoors do seem to be useful in excluding dust  3  send him back carefully for you can if you like that all unharmed he may return to his own place  4  no wonder the books are scarce if they are being hacked to pieces by grangerites  5  these lines appeared in notes and queries jan 8 1881  6  in the golden ass of apuleius which polia should not have read  7  m arsene houssaye seems to think he has found them marked on the flyleaves with an impression in wax of a seal engraved with the head of epicurus  8  this chapter was written by austin dobsondp  9  the recent winter exhibition of the old masters 1881 contained a fine display of flaxmans drawings a large number of which belonged to mr f t palgrave  10  by mr cosmo monkhouse  11  these words were written before the art journal had published its programme for 1881  from this it appears that the present editor fully recognises the necessity for calling in the assistance of the needle  12  the example here copied on the wood by m lacour is a very successful reproduction of clennells style  13  he also illustrated the memoirs of joseph grimaldi  but this was simply edited by boz  14  the reader will observe that this volume is indebted to mr crane for its beautiful frontispiece  15  since this paragraph was first written an interesting paper on the illustrations in scribner from the pen of mr j comyns carr has appeared in lart
