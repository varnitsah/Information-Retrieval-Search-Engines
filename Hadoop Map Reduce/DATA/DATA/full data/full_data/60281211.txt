60281211	falk  a reminiscence   by joseph conrad    several of us all more or less connected with the sea were dining in a small riverhostelry not more than thirty miles from london and less than twenty from that shallow and dangerous puddle to which our coasting men give the grandiose name of german ocean and through the wide windows we had a view of the thames an enfilading view down the lower hope reach but the dinner was execrable and all the feast was for the eyes  that flavour of saltwater which for so many of us had been the very water of life permeated our talk he who hath known the bitterness of the ocean shall have its taste forever in his mouth but one or two of us pampered by the life of the land complained of hunger it was impossible to swallow any of that stuff and indeed there was a strange mustiness in everything the wooden diningroom stuck out over the mud of the shore like a lacustrine dwelling the planks of the floor seemed rotten a decrepit old waiter tottered pathetically to and fro before an antediluvian and wormeaten sideboard the chipped plates might have been disinterred from some kitchen midden near an inhabited lake and the chops recalled times more ancient still they brought forcibly to ones mind the night of ages when the primeval man evolving the first rudiments of cookery from his dim consciousness scorched lumps of flesh at a fire of sticks in the company of other good fellows then gorged and happy sat him back among the gnawed bones to tell his artless tales of experiencethe tales of hunger and huntand of women perhaps  but luckily the wine happened to be as old as the waiter so comparatively empty but upon the whole fairly happy we sat back and told our artless tales we talked of the sea and all its works the sea never changes and its works for all the talk of men are wrapped in mystery but we agreed that the times were changed and we talked of old ships of seaaccidents of breakdowns dismastings and of a man who brought his ship safe to liverpool all the way from the river platte under a jury rudder we talked of wrecks of short rations and of heroismor at least of what the newspapers would have called heroism at seaa manifestation of virtues quite different from the heroism of primitive times and now and then falling silent all together we gazed at the sights of the river  a p  o boat passed bound down one gets jolly good dinners on board these ships remarked one of our band a man with sharp eyes read out the name on her bows arcadia what a beautiful model of a ship murmured some of us she was followed by a small cargo steamer and the flag they hauled down aboard while we were looking showed her to be a norwegian she made an awful lot of smoke and before it had quite blown away a highsided short wooden barque in ballast and towed by a paddletug appeared in front of the windows all her hands were forward busy setting up the headgear and aft a woman in a red hood quite alone with the man at the wheel paced the length of the poop back and forth with the grey wool of some knitting work in her hands  german i should think muttered one the skipper has his wife on board remarked another and the light of the crimson sunset all ablaze behind the london smoke throwing a glow of bengal light upon the barques spars faded away from the hope reach  then one of us who had not spoken before a man of over fifty that had commanded ships for a quarter of a century looking after the barque now gliding far away all black on the lustre of the river said  this reminds me of an absurd episode in my life now many years ago when i got first the command of an iron barque loading then in a certain eastern seaport it was also the capital of an eastern kingdom lying up a river as might be london lies up this old thames of ours no more need be said of the place for this sort of thing might have happened anywhere where there are ships skippers tugboats and orphan nieces of indescribable splendour and the absurdity of the episode concerns only me my enemy falk and my friend hermann  there seemed to be something like peculiar emphasis on the words my friend hermann which caused one of us for we had just been speaking of heroism at sea to say idly and nonchalantly  and was this hermann a hero  not at all said our grizzled friend no hero at all he was a schifffuhrer shipconductor thats how they call a master mariner in germany i prefer our way the alliteration is good and there is something in the nomenclature that gives to us as a body the sense of corporate existence apprentice mate master in the ancient and honourable craft of the sea as to my friend hermann he might have been a consummate master of the honourable craft but he was called officially schifffuhrer and had the simple heavy appearance of a welltodo farmer combined with the goodnatured shrewdness of a small shopkeeper with his shaven chin round limbs and heavy eyelids he did not look like a toiler and even less like an adventurer of the sea still he toiled upon the seas in his own way much as a shopkeeper works behind his counter and his ship was the means by which he maintained his growing family  she was a heavy strong bluntbowed affair awakening the ideas of primitive solidity like the wooden plough of our forefathers and there were about her other suggestions of a rustic and homely nature the extraordinary timber projections which i have seen in no other vessel made her square stern resemble the tail end of a millers waggon but the four stern ports of her cabin glazed with six little greenish panes each and framed in wooden sashes painted brown might have been the windows of a cottage in the country the tiny white curtains and the greenery of flower pots behind the glass completed the resemblance on one or two occasions when passing under stern i had detected from my boat a round arm in the act of tilting a watering pot and the bowed sleek head of a maiden whom i shall always call hermanns niece because as a matter of fact ive never heard her name for all my intimacy with the family  this however sprang up later on meantime in common with the rest of the shipping in that eastern port i was left in no doubt as to hermanns notions of hygienic clothing evidently he believed in wearing good stout flannel next his skin on most days little frocks and pinafores could be seen drying in the mizzen rigging of his ship or a tiny row of socks fluttering on the signal halyards but once a fortnight the family washing was exhibited in force it covered the poop entirely the afternoon breeze would incite to a weird and flabby activity all that crowded mass of clothing with its vague suggestions of drowned mutilated and flattened humanity trunks without heads waved at you arms without hands legs without feet kicked fantastically with collapsible flourishes and there were long white garments that taking the wind fairly through their neck openings edged with lace became for a moment violently distended as by the passage of obese and invisible bodies on these days you could make out that ship at a great distance by the multicoloured grotesque riot going on abaft her mizzen mast  she had her berth just ahead of me and her name was dianadiana not of ephesus but of bremen this was proclaimed in white letters a foot long spaced widely across the stern somewhat like the lettering of a shopsign under the cottage windows this ridiculously unsuitable name struck one as an impertinence towards the memory of the most charming of goddesses for apart from the fact that the old craft was physically incapable of engaging in any sort of chase there was a gang of four children belonging to her they peeped over the rail at passing boats and occasionally dropped various objects into them thus sometime before i knew hermann to speak to i received on my hat a horrid ragdoll belonging to hermanns eldest daughter however these youngsters were upon the whole well behaved they had fair heads round eyes round little knobby noses and they resembled their father a good deal  this diana of bremen was a most innocent old ship and seemed to know nothing of the wicked sea as there are on shore households that know nothing of the corrupt world and the sentiments she suggested were unexceptionable and mainly of a domestic order she was a home all these dear children had learned to walk on her roomy quarterdeck in such thoughts there is something pretty even touching their teeth i should judge they had cut on the ends of her running gear i have many times observed the baby hermann nicholas engaged in gnawing the whipping of the foreroyal brace nicholas favourite place of residence was under the main fiferail directly he was let loose he would crawl off there and the first seaman who came along would bring him carefully held aloft in tarry hands back to the cabin door i fancy there must have been a standing order to that effect in the course of these transportations the baby who was the only peppery person in the ship tried to smite these stalwart young german sailors on the face  mrs hermann an engaging stout housewife wore on board baggy blue dresses with white dots when as happened once or twice i caught her at an elegant little washtub rubbing hard on white collars babys socks and hermanns summer neckties she would blush in girlish confusion and raising her wet hands greet me from afar with many friendly nods her sleeves would be rolled up to the elbows and the gold hoop of her wedding ring glittered among the soapsuds her voice was pleasant she had a serene brow smooth bands of very fair hair and a goodhumoured expression of the eyes she was motherly and moderately talkative when this simple matron smiled youthful dimples broke out on her fresh broad cheeks hermanns niece on the other hand an orphan and very silent i never saw attempt a smile this however was not gloom on her part but the restraint of youthful gravity  they had carried her about with them for the last three years to help with the children and be company for mrs hermann as hermann mentioned once to me it had been very necessary while they were all little he had added in a vexed manner it was her arm and her sleek head that i had glimpsed one morning through the sternwindows of the cabin hovering over the pots of fuchsias and mignonette but the first time i beheld her full length i surrendered to her proportions they fix her in my mind as great beauty great intelligence quickness of wit or kindness of heart might have made some her other woman equally memorable  with her it was form and size it was her physical personality that had this imposing charm she might have been witty intelligent and kind to an exceptional degree i dont know and this is not to the point all i know is that she was built on a magnificent scale built is the only word she was constructed she was erected as it were with a regal lavishness it staggered you to see this reckless expenditure of material upon a chit of a girl she was youthful and also perfectly mature as though she had been some fortunate immortal she was heavy too perhaps but thats nothing it only added to that notion of permanence she was barely nineteen but such shoulders such round arms such a shadowing forth of mighty limbs when with three long strides she pounced across the deck upon the overturned nicholasits perfectly indescribable she seemed a good quiet girl vigilant as to lenas needs gustavs tumbles the state of carls dear little noseconscientious hardworking and all that but what magnificent hair she had abundant long thick of a tawny colour it had the sheen of precious metals she wore it plaited tightly into one single tress hanging girlishly down her back and its end reached down to her waist the massiveness of it surprised you on my word it reminded one of a club her face was big comely of an unruffled expression she had a good complexion and her blue eyes were so pale that she appeared to look at the world with the empty white candour of a statue you could not call her goodlooking it was something much more impressive the simplicity of her apparel the opulence of her form her imposing stature and the extraordinary sense of vigorous life that seemed to emanate from her like a perfume exhaled by a flower made her beautiful with a beauty of a rustic and olympian order to watch her reaching up to the clothesline with both arms raised high above her head caused you to fall a musing in a strain of pagan piety excellent mrs hermanns baggy cotton gowns had some sort of rudimentary frills at neck and bottom but this girls print frocks hadnt even a wrinkle nothing but a few straight folds in the skirt falling to her feet and these when she stood still had a severe and statuesque quality she was inclined naturally to be still whether sitting or standing however i dont mean to say she was statuesque she was too generously alive but she could have stood for an allegoric statue of the earth i dont mean the wornout earth of our possession but a young earth a virginal planet undisturbed by the vision of a future teeming with the monstrous forms of life and death clamorous with the cruel battles of hunger and thought  the worthy hermann himself was not very entertaining though his english was fairly comprehensible mrs hermann who always let off one speech at least at me in an hospitable cordial tone and in plattdeutsch i suppose i could not understand as to their niece however satisfactory to look upon and she inspired you somehow with a hopeful view as to the prospects of mankind she was a modest and silent presence mostly engaged in sewing only now and then as i observed falling over that work into a state of maidenly meditation her aunt sat opposite her sewing also with her feet propped on a wooden footstool on the other side of the deck hermann and i would get a couple of chairs out of the cabin and settle down to a smoking match accompanied at long intervals by the pacific exchange of a few words i came nearly every evening hermann i would find in his shirt sleeves as soon as he returned from the shore on board his ship he commenced operations by taking off his coat then he put on his head an embroidered round cap with a tassel and changed his boots for a pair of cloth slippers afterwards he smoked at the cabindoor looking at his children with an air of civic virtue till they got caught one after another and put to bed in various staterooms lastly we would drink some beer in the cabin which was furnished with a wooden table on cross legs and with black straightbacked chairsmore like a farm kitchen than a ships cuddy the sea and all nautical affairs seemed very far removed from the hospitality of this exemplary family  and i liked this because i had a rather worrying time on board my own ship i had been appointed exofficio by the british consul to take charge of her after a man who had died suddenly leaving for the guidance of his successor some suspiciously unreceipted bills a few drydock estimates hinting at bribery and a quantity of vouchers for three years extravagant expenditure all these mixed up together in a dusty old violincase lined with ruby velvet i found besides a large accountbook which when opened hopefully turned out to my infinite consternation to be filled with versespage after page of rhymed doggerel of a jovial and improper character written in the neatest minute hand i ever did see in the same fiddlecase a photograph of my predecessor taken lately in saigon represented in front of a garden view and in company of a female in strange draperies an elderly squat rugged man of stern aspect in a clumsy suit of black broadcloth and with the hair brushed forward above the temples in a manner reminding one of a boars tusks of a fiddle however the only trace on board was the case its empty husk as it were but of the two last freights the ship had indubitably earned of late there were not even the husks left it was impossible to say where all that money had gone to it wasnt on board it had not been remitted home for a letter from the owners preserved in a desk evidently by the merest accident complained mildly enough that they had not been favoured by a scratch of the pen for the last eighteen months there were next to no stores on board not an inch of spare rope or a yard of canvas the ship had been run bare and i foresaw no end of difficulties before i could get her ready for sea  as i was young thennot thirty yeti took myself and my troubles very seriously the old mate who had acted as chief mourner at the captains funeral was not particularly pleased at my coming but the fact is the fellow was not legally qualified for command and the consul was bound if at all possible to put a properly certificated man on board as to the second mate all i can say his name was tottersen or something like that his practice was to wear on his head in that tropical climate a mangy fur cap he was without exception the stupidest man i had ever seen on board ship and he looked it too he looked so confoundedly stupid that it was a matter of surprise for me when he answered to his name  i drew no great comfort from their company to say the least of it while the prospect of making a long sea passage with those two fellows was depressing and my other thoughts in solitude could not be of a gay complexion the crew was sickly the cargo was coming very slow i foresaw i would have lots of trouble with the charterers and doubted whether they would advance me enough money for the ships expenses their attitude towards me was unfriendly altogether i was not getting on i would discover at odd times generally about midnight that i was totally inexperienced greatly ignorant of business and hopelessly unfit for any sort of command and when the steward had to be taken to the hospital ill with choleraic symptoms i felt bereaved of the only decent person at the after end of the ship he was fully expected to recover but in the meantime had to be replaced by some sort of servant and on the recommendation of a certain schomberg the proprietor of the smaller of the two hotels in the place i engaged a chinaman schomberg a brawny hairy alsatian and an awful gossip assured me that it was all right firstclass boy that came in the suite of his excellency tseng the commissioneryou know his excellency tseng lodged with me here for three weeks  he mouthed the chinese excellency at me with great unction though the specimen of the suite did not seem very promising at the time however i did not know what an untrustworthy humbug schomberg was the boy might have been forty or a hundred and forty for all you could tellone of those chinamen of the deathshead type of face and completely inscrutable before the end of the third day he had revealed himself as a confirmed opiumsmoker a gambler a most audacious thief and a firstclass sprinter when he departed at the top of his speed with thirtytwo golden sovereigns of my own hardearned savings it was the last straw i had reserved that money in case my difficulties came to the worst now it was gone i felt as poor and naked as a fakir i clung to my ship for all the bother she caused me but what i could not bear were the long lonely evenings in her cuddy where the atmosphere made smelly by a leaky lamp was agitated by the snoring of the mate that fellow shut himself up in his stuffy cabin punctually at eight and made gross and revolting noises like a waterlogged trump it was odious not to be able to worry oneself in comfort on board ones own ship everything in this world i reflected even the command of a nice little barque may be made a delusion and a snare for the unwary spirit of pride in man  from such reflections i was glad to make any escape on board that bremen diana there apparently no whisper of the worlds iniquities had ever penetrated and yet she lived upon the wide sea and the sea tragic and comic the sea with its horrors and its peculiar scandals the sea peopled by men and ruled by iron necessity is indubitably a part of the world but that patriarchal old tub like some saintly retreat echoed nothing of it she was world proof her venerable innocence apparently had put a restraint on the roaring lusts of the sea and yet i have known the sea too long to believe in its respect for decency an elemental force is ruthlessly frank it may of course have been hermanns skilful seamanship but to me it looked as if the allied oceans had refrained from smashing these high bulwarks unshipping the lumpy rudder frightening the children and generally opening this familys eyes out of sheer reticence it looked like reticence the ruthless disclosure was in the end left for a man to make a man strong and elemental enough and driven to unveil some secrets of the sea by the power of a simple and elemental desire  this however occurred much later and meantime i took sanctuary in that serene old ship early every evening the only person on board that seemed to be in trouble was little lena and in due course i perceived that the health of the ragdoll was more than delicate this object led a sort of in extremis existence in a wooden box placed against the starboard mooringbitts tended and nursed with the greatest sympathy and care by all the children who greatly enjoyed pulling long faces and moving with hushed footsteps only the babynicholaslooked on with a cold ruffianly leer as if he had belonged to another tribe altogether lena perpetually sorrowed over the box and all of them were in deadly earnest it was wonderful the way these children would work up their compassion for that bedraggled thing i wouldnt have touched with a pair of tongs i suppose they were exercising and developing their racial sentimentalism by the means of that dummy i was only surprised that mrs hermann let lena cherish and hug that bundle of rags to that extent it was so disreputably and completely unclean but mrs hermann would raise her fine womanly eyes from her needlework to look on with amused sympathy and did not seen to see it somehow that this object of affection was a disgrace to the ships purity purity not cleanliness is the word it was pushed so far that i seemed to detect in this too a sentimental excess as if dirt had been removed in very love it is impossible to give you an idea of such a meticulous neatness it was as if every morning that ship had been arduously explored withwith toothbrushes her very bowsprit three times a week had its toilette made with a cake of soap and a piece of soft flannel arrayedi must say arrayedarrayed artlessly in dazzling white paint as to wood and dark green as to ironwork the simpleminded distribution of these colours evoked the images of simpleminded peace of arcadian felicity and the childish comedy of disease and sorrow struck me sometimes as an abominably real blot upon that ideal state  i enjoyed it greatly and on my part i brought a little mild excitement into it our intimacy arose from the pursuit of that thief it was in the evening and hermann who contrary to his habits had stayed on shore late that day was extricating himself backwards out of a little gharry on the river bank opposite his ship when the hunt passed realising the situation as though he had eyes in his shoulderblades he joined us with a leap and took the lead the chinaman fled silent like a rapid shadow on the dust of an extremely oriental road i followed a long way in the rear my mate whooped like a savage a young moon threw a bashful light on a plain like a monstrous waste ground the architectural mass of a buddhist temple far away projected itself in dead black on the sky we lost the thief of course but in my disappointment i had to admire hermanns presence of mind the velocity that stodgy man developed in the interests of a complete stranger earned my warm gratitudethere was something truly cordial in his exertions  he seemed as vexed as myself at our failure and would hardly listen to my thanks he said it was nothings and invited me on the spot to come on board his ship and drink a glass of beer with him we poked sceptically for a while amongst the bushes peered without conviction into a ditch or two there was not a sound patches of slime glimmered feebly amongst the reeds slowly we trudged back drooping under the thin sickle of the moon and i heard him mutter to himself himmel zwei und dreissig pfund he was impressed by the figure of my loss for a long time we had ceased to hear the mates whoops and yells  then he said to me everybody has his troubles and as we went on remarked that he would never have known anything of mine hadnt he by an extraordinary chance been detained on shore by captain falk he didnt like to stay late ashorehe added with a sigh the something doleful in his tone i put to his sympathy with my misfortune of course  on board the diana mrs hermanns fine eyes expressed much interest and commiseration we had found the two women sewing face to face under the open skylight in the strong glare of the lamp hermann walked in first starting in the very doorway to pull off his coat and encouraging me with loud hospitable ejaculations come in this way come in captain at once coat in hand he began to tell his wife all about it mrs hermann put the palms of her plump hands together i smiled and bowed with a heavy heart the niece got up from her sewing to bring hermanns slippers and his embroidered calotte which he assumed pontifically talking about me all the time billows of white stuff lay between the chairs on the cabin floor i caught the words zwei und dreissig pfund repeated several times and presently came the beer which seemed delicious to my throat parched with running and the emotions of the chase  i didnt get away till well past midnight long after the women had retired hermann had been trading in the east for three years or more carrying freights of rice and timber mostly his ship was well known in all the ports from vladivostok to singapore she was his own property the profits had been moderate but the trade answered well enough while the children were small yet in another year or so he hoped he would be able to sell the old diana to a firm in japan for a fair price he intended to return home to bremen by mail boat second class with mrs hermann and the children he told me all this stolidly with slow puffs at his pipe i was sorry when knocking the ashes out he began to rub his eyes i would have sat with him till morning what had i to hurry on board my own ship for to face the broken rifled drawer in my stateroom ugh the very thought made me feel unwell  i became their daily guest as you know i think that mrs hermann from the first looked upon me as a romantic person i did not of course tear my hair coram populo over my loss and she took it for lordly indifference afterwards i daresay i did tell them some of my adventuressuch as they wereand they marvelled greatly at the extent of my experience hermann would translate what he thought the most striking passages getting up on his legs and as if delivering a lecture on a phenomenon he addressed himself with gestures to the two women who would let their sewing sink slowly on their laps meantime i sat before a glass of hermanns beer trying to look modest mrs hermann would glance at me quickly emit slight achs the girl never made a sound never but she too would sometimes raise her pale eyes to look at me in her unseeing gentle way her glance was by no means stupid it beamed out soft and diffuse as the moon beams upon a landscapequite differently from the scrutinising inspection of the stars you were drowned in it and imagined yourself to appear blurred and yet this same glance when turned upon christian falk must have been as efficient as the searchlight of a battleship  falk was the other assiduous visitor on board but from his behaviour he might have been coming to see the quarterdeck capstan he certainly used to stare at it a good deal when keeping us company outside the cabin door with one muscular arm thrown over the back of the chair and his big shapely legs in very tight white trousers extended far out and ending in a pair of black shoes as roomy as punts on arrival he would shake hermanns hand with a mutter bow to the women and take up his careless and misanthropic attitude by our side he departed abruptly with a jump going through the performance of grunts handshakes bow as if in a panic sometimes with a sort of discreet and convulsive effort he approached the women and exchanged a few low words with them half a dozen at most on these occasions hermanns usual stare became positively glassy and mrs hermanns kind countenance would colour up the girl herself never turned a hair  falk was a dane or perhaps a norwegian i cant tell now at all events he was a scandinavian of some sort and a bloated monopolist to boot it is possible he was unacquainted with the word but he had a clear perception of the thing itself his tariff of charges for towing ships in and out was the most brutally inconsiderate document of the sort i had ever seen he was the commander and owner of the only tugboat on the river a very trim white craft of 150 tons or more as elegantly neat as a yacht with a round wheelhouse rising like a glazed turret high above her sharp bows and with one slender varnished pole mast forward i daresay there are yet a few shipmasters afloat who remember falk and his tug very well he extracted his pound and a half of flesh from each of us merchantskippers with an inflexible sort of indifference which made him detested and even feared schomberg used to remark i wont talk about the fellow i dont think he has six drinks from years end to years end in my place but my advice is gentlemen dont you have anything to do with him if you can help it  this advice apart from unavoidable business relations was easy to follow because falk intruded upon no one it seems absurd to compare a tugboat skipper to a centaur but he reminded me somehow of an engraving in a little book i had as a boy which represented centaurs at a stream and there was one especially in the foreground prancing bow and arrows in hand with regular severe features and an immense curled wavy beard flowing down his breast falks face reminded me of that centaur besides he was a composite creature not a manhorse it is true but a manboat he lived on board his tug which was always dashing up and down the river from early morn till dewy eve  in the last rays of the setting sun you could pick out far away down the reach his beard borne high up on the white structure foaming up stream to anchor for the night there was the whiteclad mans body and the rich brown patch of the hair and nothing below the waist but the thwartship white lines of the bridgescreens that lead the eye to the sharp white lines of the bows cleaving the muddy water of the river  separated from his boat to me at least he seemed incomplete the tug herself without his head and torso on the bridge looked mutilated as it were but he left her very seldom all the time i remained in harbour i saw him only twice on shore on the first occasion it was at my charterers where he came in misanthropically to get paid for towing out a french barque the day before the second time i could hardly believe my eyes for i beheld him reclining under his beard in a canebottomed chair in the billiardroom of schombergs hotel  it was very funny to see schomberg ignoring him pointedly the artificiality of it contrasted strongly with falks natural unconcern the big alsatian talked loudly with his other customers going from one little table to the other and passing falks place of repose with his eyes fixed straight ahead falk sat there with an untouched glass at his elbow he must have known by sight and name every white man in the room but he never addressed a word to anybody he acknowledged my presence by a drop of his eyelids and that was all sprawling there in the chair he would now and again draw the palms of both his hands down his face giving at the same time a slight almost imperceptible shudder  it was a habit he had and of course i was perfectly familiar with it since you could not remain an hour in his company without being made to wonder at such a movement breaking some long period of stillness it was a passionate and inexplicable gesture he used to make it at all sorts of times as likely as not after he had been listening to little lenas chatter about the suffering doll for instance the hermann children always besieged him about his legs closely though in a gentle way he shrank from them a little he seemed however to feel a great affection for the whole family for hermann himself especially he sought his company in this case for instance he must have been waiting for him because as soon as he appeared falk rose hastily and they went out together then schomberg expounded in my hearing to three or four people his theory that falk was after captain hermanns niece and asserted confidently that nothing would come of it it was the same last year when captain hermann was loading here he said  naturally i did not believe schomberg but i own that for a time i observed closely what went on all i discovered was some impatience on hermanns part at the sight of falk stepping over the gangway the excellent man would begin to mumble and chew between his teeth something that sounded like german swearwords however as ive said im not familiar with the language and hermanns soft roundeyed countenance remained unchanged staring stolidly ahead he greeted him with wie gehts or in english how are you with a throaty enunciation the girl would look up for an instant and move her lips slightly mrs hermann let her hands rest on her lap to talk volubly to him for a minute or so in her pleasant voice before she went on with her sewing again falk would throw himself into a chair stretch his big legs as like as not draw his hands down his face passionately as to myself he was not pointedly impertinent it was rather as though he could not be bothered with such trifles as my existence and the truth is that being a monopolist he was under no necessity to be amiable he was sure to get his own extortionate terms out of me for towage whether he frowned or smiled as a matter of fact he did neither but before many days elapsed he managed to astonish me not a little and to set schombergs tongue clacking more than ever  it came about in this way there was a shallow bar at the mouth of the river which ought to have been kept down but the authorities of the state were piously busy gilding afresh the great buddhist pagoda just then and i suppose had no money to spare for dredging operations i dont know how it may be now but at the time i speak of that sandbank was a great nuisance to the shipping one of its consequences was that vessels of a certain draught of water like hermanns or mine could not complete their loading in the river after taking in as much as possible of their cargo they had to go outside to fill up the whole procedure was an unmitigated bore when you thought you had as much on board as your ship could carry safely over the bar you went and gave notice to your agents they in their turn notified falk that soandso was ready to go out then falk ostensibly when it fitted in with his other work but if the truth were known simply when his arbitrary spirit moved him after ascertaining carefully in the office that there was enough money to meet his bill would come along unsympathetically glaring at you with his yellow eyes from the bridge and would drag you out dishevelled as to rigging lumbered as to the decks with unfeeling haste as if to execution and he would force you too to take the end of his own wire hawser for the use of which there was of course an extra charge to your shouted remonstrances against that extortion this towering trunk with one hand on the engineroom telegraph only shook its bearded head above the splash the racket and the clouds of smoke in which the tug backing and filling in the smother of churning paddlewheels behaved like a ferocious and impatient creature he had her manned by the cheekiest gang of lascars i ever did see whom he allowed to bawl at you insolently and once fast he plucked you out of your berth as if he did not care what he smashed eighteen miles down the river you had to go behind him and then three more along the coast to where a group of uninhabited rocky islets enclosed a sheltered anchorage there you would have to lie at single anchor with your naked spars showing to seaward over these barren fragments of land scattered upon a very intensely blue sea there was nothing to look at besides but a bare coast the muddy edge of the brown plain with the sinuosities of the river you had left traced in dull green and the great pagoda uprising lonely and massive with shining curves and pinnacles like the gorgeous and stony efflorescence of tropical rocks you had nothing to do but to wait fretfully for the balance of your cargo which was sent out of the river with the greatest irregularity and it was open to you to console yourself with the thought that after all this stage of bother meant that your departure from these shores was indeed approaching at last  we both had to go through that stage hermann and i and there was a sort of tacit emulation between the ships as to which should be ready first we kept on neck and neck almost to the finish when i won the race by going personally to give notice in the forenoon whereas hermann who was very slow in making up his mind to go ashore did not get to the agents office till late in the day they told him there that my ship was first on turn for next morning and i believe he told them he was in no hurry it suited him better to go the day after  that evening on board the diana he sat with his plump knees well apart staring and puffing at the curved mouthpiece of his pipe presently he spoke with some impatience to his niece about putting the children to bed mrs hermann who was talking to falk stopped short and looked at her husband uneasily but the girl got up at once and drove the children before her into the cabin in a little while mrs hermann had to leave us to quell what from the sounds inside must have been a dangerous mutiny at this hermann grumbled to himself for half an hour longer falk left alone with us fidgeted on his chair sighed lightly then at last after drawing his hands down his face got up and as if renouncing the hope of making himself understood he hadnt opened his mouth once he said in english well good night captain hermann he stopped for a moment before my chair and looked down fixedly i may even say he glared and he went so far as to make a deep noise in his throat there was in all this something so marked that for the first time in our limited intercourse of nods and grunts he excited in me something like interest but next moment he disappointed mefor he strode away hastily without a nod even  his manner was usually odd it is true and i certainly did not pay much attention to it but that sort of obscure intention which seemed to lurk in his nonchalance like a wary old carp in a pond had never before come so near the surface he had distinctly aroused my expectations i would have been unable to say what it was i expected but at all events i did not expect the absurd developments he sprung upon me no later than the break of the very next day  i remember only that there was on that evening enough point in his behaviour to make me after he had fled wonder audibly what he might mean to this hermann crossing his legs with a swing and settling himself viciously away from me in his chair said that fellow dont know himself what he means  there might have been some insight in such a remark i said nothing and still averted he added when i was here last year he was just the same an eruption of tobacco smoke enveloped his head as if his temper had exploded like gunpowder  i had half a mind to ask him point blank whether he at least didnt know why falk a notoriously unsociable man had taken to visiting his ship with such assiduity after all i reflected suddenly it was a most remarkable thing i wonder now what hermann would have said as it turned out he didnt let me ask forgetting all about falk apparently he started a monologue on his plans for the future the selling of the ship the going home and falling into a reflective and calculating mood he mumbled between regular jets of smoke about the expense the necessity of disbursing passage money for all his tribe seemed to disturb him in a manner that was the more striking because otherwise he gave no signs of a miserly disposition and yet he fussed over the prospect of that voyage home in a mail boat like a sedentary grocer who has made up his mind to see the world he was racially thrifty i suppose and for him there must have been a great novelty in finding himself obliged to pay for travellingfor sea travelling which was the normal state of life for the familyfrom the very cradle for most of them i could see he grudged prospectively every single shilling which must be spent so absurdly it was rather funny he would become doleful over it and then again with a fretful sigh he would suppose there was nothing for it now but to take three secondclass ticketsand there were the four children to pay for besides a lot of money that to spend at once a big lot of money  i sat with him listening not for the first time to these heartsearchings till i grew thoroughly sleepy and then i left him and turned in on board my ship at daylight i was awakened by a yelping of shrill voices accompanied by a great commotion in the water and the short bullying blasts of a steamwhistle falk with his tug had come for me  i began to dress it was remarkable that the answering noise on board my ship together with the patter of feet above my head ceased suddenly but i heard more remote guttural cries which seemed to express surprise and annoyance then the voice of my mate reached me howling expostulations to somebody at a distance other voices joined apparently indignant a chorus of something that sounded like abuse replied now and then the steamwhistle screeched  altogether that unnecessary uproar was distracting but down there in my cabin i took it calmly in another moment i thought i should be going down that wretched river and in another week at the most i should be totally quit of the odious place and all the odious people in it  greatly cheered by the idea i seized the hairbrushes and looking at myself in the glass began to use them suddenly a hush fell upon the noise outside and i heard the ports of my cabin were thrown openi heard a deep calm voice not on board my ship however hailing resolutely in english but with a strong foreign twang go ahead  there may be tides in the affairs of men which taken at the flood and so on personally i am still on the look out for that important turn i am however afraid that most of us are fated to flounder for ever in the dead water of a pool whose shores are arid indeed but i know that there are often in mens affairs unexpectedlyeven irrationallyilluminating moments when an otherwise insignificant sound perhaps only some perfectly commonplace gesture suffices to reveal to us all the unreason all the fatuous unreason of our complacency go ahead are not particularly striking words even when pronounced with a foreign accent yet they petrified me in the very act of smiling at myself in the glass and then refusing to believe my ears but already boiling with indignation i ran out of the cabin and up on deck  it was incredibly true it was perfectly true i had no eyes for anything but the diana it was she then was being taken away she was already out of her berth and shooting athwart the river the way this loonatic plucked that ship out is a caution said the awed voice of my mate close to my ear hey hallo falk hermann whats this infernal trick i yelled in a fury  nobody heard me falk certainly could not hear me his tug was turning at full speed away under the other bank the wire hawser between her and the diana stretched as taut as a harpstring vibrated alarmingly  the high black craft careened over to the awful strain a loud crack came out of her followed by the tearing and splintering of wood there said the awed voice in my ear hes carried away their towing chock and then with enthusiasm oh look look sir look at them dutchmen skipping out of the way on the forecastle i hope to goodness hell break a few of their shins before hes done with em  i yelled my vain protests the rays of the rising sun coursing level along the plain warmed my back but i was hot enough with rage i could not have believed that a simple towing operation could suggest so plainly the idea of abduction of rape falk was simply running off with the diana  the white tug careered out into the middle of the river the red floats of her paddlewheels revolving with mad rapidity tore up the whole reach into foam the diana in midstream waltzed round with as much grace as an old barn and flew after her ravisher through the ragged fog of smoke driving headlong upon the water i had a glimpse of falks square motionless shoulders under a white hat as big as a cartwheel of his red face his yellow staring eyes his great beard instead of keeping a lookout ahead he was deliberately turning his back on the river to glare at his tow the tall heavy craft never so used before in her life seemed to have lost her senses she took a wild sheer against her helm and for a moment came straight at us menacing and clumsy like a runaway mountain she piled up a streaming hissing boiling wave halfway up her blunt stem my crew let out one great howland then we held our breaths it was a near thing but falk had her he had her in his clutch i fancied i could hear the steel hawser ping as it surged across the dianas forecastle with the hands on board of her bolting away from it in all directions it was a near thing hermann with his hair rumpled in a snuffy flannel shirt and a pair of mustardcoloured trousers had rushed to help with the wheel i saw his terrified round face i saw his very teeth uncovered by a sort of ghastly fixed grin and in a great leaping tumult of water between the two ships the diana whisked past so close that i could have flung a hairbrush at his head for it seems i had kept them in my hands all the time meanwhile mrs hermann sat placidly on the skylight with a woollen shawl on her shoulders the excellent woman in response to my indignant gesticulations fluttered a handkerchief nodding and smiling in the kindest way imaginable the boys only halfdressed were jumping about the poop in great glee displaying their gaudy braces and lena in a short scarlet petticoat with peaked elbows and thin bare arms nursed the ragdoll with devotion the whole family passed before my sight as if dragged across a scene of unparalleled violence the last i saw was hermanns niece with the baby hermann in her arms standing apart from the others magnificent in her closefitting print frock she displayed something so commanding in the manifest perfection of her figure that the sun seemed to be rising for her alone the flood of light brought out the opulence of her form and the vigour of her youth in a glorifying way she went by perfectly motionless and as if lost in meditation only the hem of her skirt stirred in the draught the sun rays broke on her sleek tawny hair that baldheaded ruffian nicholas was whacking her on the shoulder i saw his tiny fat arm rise and fall in a workmanlike manner and then the four cottage windows of the diana came into view retreating swiftly down the river the sashes were up and one of the white calico curtains was fluttered straight out like a streamer above the agitated water of the wake  to be thus tricked out of ones turn was an unheard of occurrence in my agents office where i went to complain at once they protested with apologies they couldnt understand how the mistake arose but schomberg when i dropped in later to get some tiffin though surprised to see me was perfectly ready with an explanation i found him seated at the end of a long narrow table facing his wifea scraggy little woman with long ringlets and a blue tooth who smiled abroad stupidly and looked frightened when you spoke to her between them a waggling punkah fanned twenty canebottomed chairs and two rows of shiny plates three chinamen in white jackets loafed with napkins in their hands around that desolation schombergs pet table dhote was not much of a success that day he was feeding himself ferociously and seemed to overflow with bitterness  he began by ordering in a brutal voice the chops to be brought back for me and turning in his chair mistake they told you not a bit of it dont you believe it for a moment captain falk isnt a man to make mistakes unless on purpose his firm conviction was that falk had been trying all along to curry favour on the cheap with hermann on the cheapmind you it doesnt cost him a cent to put that insult upon you and captain hermann gets in a day ahead of your ship times money eh you are very friendly with captain hermann i believe but a man is bound to be pleased at any little advantage he may get captain hermann is a good business man and theres no such thing as a friend in business is there he leaned forward and began to cast stealthy glances as usual but falk is and always was a miserable fellow i would despise him  i muttered grumpily that i had no particular respect for falk  i would despise him he insisted with an appearance of anxiety which would have amused me if i had not been fathoms deep in discontent to a young man fairly conscientious and as wellmeaning as only the young man can be the current illusage of life comes with a peculiar cruelty youth that is fresh enough to believe in guilt in innocence and in itself will always doubt whether it have not perchance deserved its fate sombre of mind and without appetite i struggled with the chop while mrs schomberg sat with her everlasting stupid grin and schombergs talk gathered way like a slide of rubbish  let me tell you its all about that girl i dont know what captain hermann expects but if he asked me i could tell him something about falk hes a miserable fellow that man is a perfect slave thats what i call him a slave last year i started this table dhote and sent cards outyou know you think he had one meal in the house give the thing a trial not once he has got hold now of a madras cooka blamed fraud that i hunted out of my cookhouse with a rattan he was not fit to cook for white men no not for the white mens dogs either but see any damned native that can boil a pot of rice is good enough for mr falk rice and a little fish he buys for a few cents from the fishing boats outside is what he lives on you would hardly credit iteh a white man too  he wiped his lips using the napkin with indignation and looking at me it flashed through my mind in the midst of my depression that if all the meat in the town was like these table dhote chops falk wasnt so far wrong i was on the point of saying this but schombergs stare was intimidating hes a vegetarian perhaps i murmured instead  hes a miser a miserable miser affirmed the hotelkeeper with great force the meat here is not so good as at homeof course and dear too but look at me i only charge a dollar for the tiffin and one dollar and fifty cents for the dinner show me anything cheaper why am i doing it theres little profit in this game falk wouldnt look at it i do it for the sake of a lot of young white fellows here that hadnt a place where they could get a decent meal and eat it decently in good company theres firstrate company always at my table  the convinced way he surveyed the empty chairs made me feel as if i had intruded upon a tiffin of ghostly presences  a white man should eat like a white man dash it all he burst out impetuously ought to eat meat must eat meat i manage to get meat for my patrons all the year round dont i i am not catering for a dam lot of coolies have another chop captain no you boytake away  he threw himself back and waited grimly for the curry the halfclosed jalousies darkened the room pervaded by the smell of fresh whitewash a swarm of flies buzzed and settled in turns and poor mrs schombergs smile seemed to express the quintessence of all the imbecility that had ever spoken had ever breathed had ever been fed on infamous buffalo meat within these bare walls schomberg did not open his lips till he was ready to thrust therein a spoonful of greasy rice he rolled his eyes ridiculously before he swallowed the hot stuff and only then broke out afresh  it is the most degrading thing they take the dish up to the wheelhouse for him with a cover on it and he shuts both the doors before he begins to eat fact must be ashamed of himself ask the engineer he cant do without an engineerdont you seeand as no respectable man can be expected to put up with such a table he allows them fifteen dollars a month extra mess money i assure you it is so you just ask mr ferdinand da costa thats the engineer he has now you may have seen him about my place a delicate dark young man with very fine eyes and a little moustache he arrived here a year ago from calcutta between you and me i guess the moneylenders there must have been after him he rushes here for a meal every chance he can get for just please tell me what satisfaction is that for a welleducated young fellow to feed all alone in his cabinlike a wild beast thats what falk expects his engineers to put up with for fifteen dollars extra and the rows on board every time a little smell of cooking gets about the deck you wouldnt believe the other day da costa got the cook to fry a steak for hima turtle steak it was too not beef at alland the fat caught or something young da costa himself was telling me of it here in this room mr schombergsays heif i had let a cylinder cover blow off through the skylight by my negligence captain falk couldnt have been more savage he frightened the cook so that he wont put anything on the fire for me now poor da costa had tears in his eyes only try to put yourself in his place captain a sensitive gentlemanly young fellow is he expected to eat his food raw but thats your falk all over ask any one you like i suppose the fifteen dollars extra he has to give keep on ranklingin there  and schomberg tapped his manly breast i sat half stunned by his irrelevant babble suddenly he gripped my forearm in an impressive and cautious manner as if to lead me into a very cavern of confidence  its nothing but enviousness he said in a lowered tone which had a stimulating effect upon my wearied hearing i dont suppose there is one person in this town that he isnt envious of i tell you hes dangerous even i myself am not safe from him i know for certain he tried to poison  oh come now i cried revolted  but i know for certain the people themselves came and told me of it he went about saying everywhere i was a worse pest to this town than the cholera he had been talking against me ever since i opened this hotel and he poisoned captain hermanns mind too last time the diana was loading here captain hermann used to come in every day for a drink or a cigar this time he hasnt been here twice in a week how do you account for that  he squeezed my arm till he extorted from me some sort of mumble  he makes ten times the money i do ive another hotel to fight against and there is no other tug on the river i am not in his way am i he wouldnt be fit to run an hotel if he tried but thats just his nature he cant bear to think i am making a living i only hope it makes him properly wretched hes like that in everything he would like to keep a decent table well enough but nofor the sake of a few cents cant do it its too much for him thats what i call being a slave to it but hes mean enough to kick up a row when his nose gets tickled a bit see that that just paints him miserly and envious you cant account for it any other way can you i have been studying him these three years  he was anxious i should assent to his theory and indeed on thinking it over it would have been plausible enough if there hadnt been always the essential falseness of irresponsibility in schombergs chatter however i was not disposed to investigate the psychology of falk i was engaged just then in eating despondently a piece of stale dutch cheese being too much crushed to care what i swallowed myself let along bothering my head about falks ideas of gastronomy i could expect from their study no clue to his conduct in matters of business which seemed to me totally unrestrained by morality or even by the commonest sort of decency how insignificant and contemptible i must appear for the fellow to dare treat me like thisi reflected suddenly writhing in silent agony and i consigned falk and all his peculiarities to the devil with so much mental fervour as to forget schombergs existence till he grabbed my arm urgently well you may think and think till every hair of your head falls off captain but you cant explain it in any other way  for the sake of peace and quietness i admitted hurriedly that i couldnt persuaded that now he would leave off but the only result was to make his moist face shine with the pride of cunning he removed his hand for a moment to scare a black mass of flies off the sugarbasin and caught hold of my arm again  to be sure and in the same way everybody is aware he would like to get married only he cant let me quote you an instance well two years ago a miss vanlo a very ladylike girl came from home to keep house for her brother fred who had an engineering shop for small repairs by the water side suddenly falk takes to going up to their bungalow after dinner and sitting for hours in the verandah saying nothing the poor girl couldnt tell for the life of her what to do with such a man so she would keep on playing the piano and singing to him evening after evening till she was ready to drop and it wasnt as if she had been a strong young woman either she was thirty and the climate had been playing the deuce with her thendont you knowfred had to sit up with them for propriety and during whole weeks on end never got a single chance to get to bed before midnight that was not pleasant for a tired manwas it and besides fred had worries then because his shop didnt pay and he was dropping money fast he just longed to get away from here and try his luck somewhere else but for the sake of his sister he hung on and on till he ran himself into debt over his earsi can tell you i myself could show a handful of his chits for meals and drinks in my drawer i could never find out tho where he found all the money at last cant be but he must have got something out of that brother of his a coal merchant in port said anyhow he paid everybody before he left but the girl nearly broke her heart disappointment of course and at her age dont you know mrs schomberg here was very friendly with her and she could tell you awful despair fainting fits it was a scandal a notorious scandal to that extent that old mr siegersnot your present charterer but mr siegers the father the old gentleman who retired from business on a fortune and got buried at sea going home he had to interview falk in his private office he was a man who could speak like a dutch uncle and besides messrs siegers had been helping falk with a good bit of money from the start in fact you may say they made him as far as that goes it so happened that just at the time he turned up here their firm was chartering a lot of sailing ships every year and it suited their business that there should be good towing facilities on the river see welltheres always an ear at the keyholeisnt there in fact he lowered his tone confidentially in this case a good friend of mine a man you can see here any evening only they conversed rather low anyhow my friends certain that falk was trying to make all sorts of excuses and old mr siegers was coughing a lot and yet falk wanted all the time to be married too why its notorious the man has been longing for years to make a home for himself only he cant face the expense when it comes to putting his hand in his pocketit chokes him off thats the truth and no other ive always said so and everybody agrees with me by this time what do you think of thateh  he appealed confidently to my indignation but having a mind to annoy him i remarked that it seemed to me very pitifulif true  he bounced in his chair as if i had run a pin into him i dont know what he might have said only at that moment we heard through the half open door of the billiardroom the footsteps of two men entering from the verandah a murmur of two voices at the sharp tapping of a coin on a table mrs schomberg half rose irresolutely sit still he hissed at her and then in an hospitable jovial tone contrasting amazingly with the angry glance that had made his wife sink in her chair he cried very loud tiffin still going on in here gentlemen  there was no answer but the voices dropped suddenly the head chinaman went out we heard the clink of ice in the glasses pouring sounds the shuffling of feet the scraping of chairs schomberg after wondering in a low mutter who the devil could be there at this time of the day got up napkin in hand to peep through the doorway cautiously he retreated rapidly on tiptoe and whispering behind his hand informed me that it was falk falk himself who was in there and whats more he had captain hermann with him  the return of the tug from the outer roads was unexpected but possible for falk had taken away the diana at halfpast five and it was now two oclock schomberg wished me to observe that neither of these men would spend a dollar on a tiffin which they must have wanted but by the time i was ready to leave the diningroom falk had gone i heard the last of his big boots on the planks of the verandah hermann was sitting quite alone in the large wooden room with the two lifeless billiard tables shrouded in striped covers mopping his face diligently he wore his best goashore clothes a stiff collar black coat large white waistcoat grey trousers a white cotton sunshade with a cane handle reposed between his legs his side whiskers were neatly brushed his chin had been freshly shaved and he only distantly resembled the dishevelled and terrified man in a snuffy night shirt and ignoble old trousers i had seen in the morning hanging on to the wheel of the diana  he gave a start at my entrance and addressed me at once in some confusion but with genuine eagerness he was anxious to make it clear he had nothing to do with what he called the tam pizness of the morning it was most inconvenient he had reckoned upon another day up in town to settle his bills and sign certain papers there were also some few stores to come and sundry pieces of my ironwork as he called it quaintly landed for repairs had been left behind now he would have to hire a native boat to take all this out to the ship it would cost five or six dollars perhaps he had had no warning from falk nothing he hit the table with his dumpy fist der verfluchte kerl came in the morning like a tam ropper making a great noise and took him away his mate was not prepared his ship was moored fasthe protested it was shameful to come upon a man in that way shameful yet such was the power falk had on the river that when i suggested in a chilling tone that he might have simply refused to have his ship moved hermann was quite startled at the idea i never realised so well before that this is an age of steam the exclusive possession of a marine boiler had given falk the whiphand of us all hermann recovering put it to me appealingly that i knew very well how unsafe it was to contradict that fellow at this i only smiled distantly  der kerl he cried he was sorry he had not refused he was indeed the damage the damage what for all that damage there was no occasion for damage did i know how much damage he had done it gave me a certain satisfaction to tell him that i had heard his old waggon of a ship crack fore and aft as she went by you passed close enough to me i added significantly  he threw both his hands up to heaven at the recollection one of them grasped by the middle the white parasol and he resembled curiously a caricature of a shopkeeping citizen in one of his own german comic papers ach that was dangerous he cried i was amused but directly he added with an appearance of simplicity the side of your iron ship would have been crushed in likelike this matchbox  would it i growled much less amused now but by the time i had decided that this remark was not meant for a dig at me he had worked himself into a high state of resentfulness against falk the inconvenience the damage the expense gottferdam devil take the fellow behind the bar schomberg with a cigar in his teeth pretended to be writing with a pencil on a large sheet of paper and as hermanns excitement increased it made me comfortingly aware of my own calmness and superiority but it occurred to me while i listened to his revilings that after all the good man had come up in the tug there perhapssince he must come to townhe had no option but evidently he had had a drink with falk either accepted or offered how was that so i checked him by saying loftily that i hoped he would make falk pay for every penny of the damage  thats it thats it go for him called out schomberg from the bar flinging his pencil down and rubbing his hands  we ignored his noise but hermanns excitement suddenly went off the boil as when you remove a saucepan from the fire i urged on his consideration that he had done now with falk and falks confounded tug he hermann would not perhaps turn up again in this part of the world for years to come since he was going to sell the diana at the end of this very trip go home passenger in a mail boat he murmured mechanically he was therefore safe from falks malice all he had to do was to race off to his consignees and stop payment of the towage bill before falk had the time to get in and lift the money  nothing could have been less in the spirit of my advice than the thoughtful way in which he set about to make his parasol stay propped against the edge of the table  while i watched his concentrated efforts with astonishment he threw at me one or two perplexed halfshy glances then he sat down thats all very well he said reflectively  it cannot be doubted that the man had been thrown off his balance by being hauled out of the harbour against his wish his stolidity had been profoundly stirred else he would never have made up his mind to ask me unexpectedly whether i had not remarked that falk had been casting eyes upon his niece no more than myself i answered with literal truth the girl was of the sort one necessarily casts eyes at in a sense she made no noise but she filled most satisfactorily a good bit of space  but you captain are not the same kind of man observed hermann  i was not i am happy to say in a position to deny this what about the lady i could not help asking at this he gazed for a time into my face earnestly and made as if to change the subject i heard him beginning to mutter something unexpected about his children growing old enough to require schooling he would have to leave them ashore with their grandmother when he took up that new command he expected to get in germany  this constant harping on his domestic arrangements was funny i suppose it must have been like the prospect of a complete alteration in his life an epoch he was going too to part with the diana he had served in her for years he had inherited her from an uncle if i remember rightly and the future loomed big before him occupying his thought exclusively with all its aspects as on the eve of a venturesome enterprise he sat there frowning and biting his lip and suddenly he began to fume and fret  i discovered to my momentary amusement that he seemed to imagine i could should or ought have caused falk in some way to pronounce himself such a hope was incomprehensible but funny then the contact with all this foolishness irritated me i said crossly that i had seen no symptoms but if there were anysince he hermann was so surethen it was still worse what pleasure falk found in humbugging people in just that way i couldnt say it was however my solemn duty to warn him it had lately i said come to my knowledge that there was a man not a very long time ago either who had been taken in just like this  all this passed in undertones and at this point schomberg exasperated at our secrecy went out of the room slamming the door with a crash that positively lifted us in our chairs this or else what i had said huffed my hermann he supposed with a contemptuous toss of his head towards the door which trembled yet that i had got hold of some of that mans silly tales it looked indeed as though his mind had been thoroughly poisoned against schomberg his tales werethey were he repeated seeking for the wordtrash they were trash he reiterated and moreover i was young yet  this horrid aspersion i regret i am no longer exposed to that sort of insult made me huffy too i felt ready in my own mind to back up every assertion of schombergs and on any subject in a moment devil only knows why hermann and i were looking at each other most inimically he caught up his hat without more ado and i gave myself the pleasure of calling after him  take my advice and make falk pay for breaking up your ship you arent likely to get anything else out of him  when i got on board my ship later on the old mate who was very full of the events of the morning remarked  i saw the tug coming back from the outer roads just before two pm he never by any chance used the words morning or afternoon always pm or am logbook style smart work that mans always in a state of hurry hes a regular chuckerout aint he sir theres a few pubs i know of in the eastend of london that would be all the better for one of his sort around the bar he chuckled at his joke a regular chuckerout now he has fired out that dutchman head over heels i suppose our turns coming tomorrow morning  we were all on deck at break of day even the sickpoor devilshad crawled out ready to cast off in the twinkling of an eye nothing came falk did not come at last when i began to think that probably something had gone wrong in his engineroom we perceived the tug going by full pelt down the river as if we hadnt existed for a moment i entertained the wild notion that he was going to turn round in the next reach afterwards i watched his smoke appear above the plain now here now there according to the windings of the river it disappeared then without a word i went down to breakfast i just simply went down to breakfast  not one of us uttered a sound till the mate after imbibingby means of suction out of a saucerhis second cup of tea exclaimed where the devil is the man gone to  courting i shouted with such a fiendish laugh that the old chap didnt venture to open his lips any more  i started to the office perfectly calm calm with excessive rage evidently they knew all about it already and they treated me to a show of consternation the manager a softfooted immensely obese man breathing short got up to meet me while all round the room the young clerks bending over the papers on their desks cast upward glances in my direction the fat man without waiting for my complaint wheezing heavily and in a tone as if he himself were incredulous conveyed to me the news that falkcaptain falkhad declinedhad absolutely declinedto tow my shipto have anything to do with my shipthis day or any other day never  i did my best to preserve a cool appearance but all the same i must have shown how much taken aback i was we were talking in the middle of the room suddenly behind my back some ass blew his nose with great force and at the same time another quilldriver jumped up and went out on the landing hastily it occurred to me i was cutting a foolish figure there i demanded angrily to see the principal in his private room  the skin of mr siegers head showed dead white between the iron grey streaks of hair lying plastered crosswise from ear to ear over the top of his skull in the manner of a bandage his narrow sunken face was of an uniform and permanent terracotta colour like a piece of pottery he was sickly thin and short with wrists like a boy of ten but from that debile body there issued a bullying voice tremendously loud harsh and resonant as if produced by some powerful mechanical contrivance in the nature of a foghorn i do not know what he did with it in the private life of his home but in the larger sphere of business it presented the advantage of overcoming arguments without the slightest mental effort by the mere volume of sound we had had several passages of arms it took me all i knew to guard the interests of my ownerswhom nota bene i had never seenwhile siegers who had made their acquaintance some years before during a business tour in australia pretended to the knowledge of their innermost minds and in the character of our very good friends threw them perpetually at my head  he looked at me with a jaundiced eye there was no love lost between us and declared at once that it was strange very strange his pronunciation of english was so extravagant that i cant even attempt to reproduce it for instance he said fferie strantch combined with the bellowing intonation it made the language of ones childhood sound weirdly startling and even if considered purely as a kind of unmeaning noise it filled you with astonishment at first they had he continued been acquainted with captain falk for very many years and never had any reason  thats why i come to you of course i interrupted ive the right to know the meaning of this infernal nonsense in the half light of the room which was greenish because of the treetops screening the window i saw him writhe his meagre shoulders it came into my head as disconnected ideas will come at all sorts of times into ones head that this most likely was the very room where if the tale were true falk had been lectured by mr siegers the father mr siegers the sons overwhelming voice in brassy blasts as though he had been trying to articulate his words through a trombone was expressing his great regret at a conduct characterised by a very marked want of discretion as i lived i was being lectured too his deafening gibberish was difficult to follow but it was my conductminethat damn i wasnt going to stand this  what on earth are you driving at i asked in a passion i put my hat on my head he never offered a seat to anybody and as he seemed for the moment struck dumb by my irreverence i turned my back on him and marched out his vocal arrangements blared after me a few threats of coming down on the ship for the demurrage of the lighters and all the other expenses consequent upon the delays arising from my frivolity  once outside in the sunshine my head swam it was no longer a question of mere delay i perceived myself involved in hopeless and humiliating absurdities that were leading me to something very like a disaster let us be calm i muttered to myself and ran into the shade of a leprous wall from that short sidestreet i could see the broad main thoroughfare ruinous and gay running away away between stretches of decaying masonry bamboo fences ranges of arcades of brick and plaster hovels of lath and mud lofty temple gates of carved timber huts of rotten matsan immensely wide thoroughfare loosely packed as far as the eye could reach with a barefooted and brown multitude paddling ankle deep in the dust for a moment i felt myself about to go out of my mind with worry and desperation  some allowance must be made for the feelings of a young man new to responsibility i thought of my crew half of them were ill and i really began to think that some of them would end by dying on board if i couldnt get them out to sea soon obviously i should have to take my ship down the river either working under canvas or dredging with the anchor down operations which in common with many modern sailors i only knew theoretically and i almost shrank from undertaking them shorthanded and without local knowledge of the river bed which is so necessary for the confident handling of the ship there were no pilots no beacons no buoys of any sort but there was a very devil of a current for anybody to see no end of shoal places and at least two obviously awkward turns of the channel between me and the sea but how dangerous these turns were i would not tell i didnt even know what my ship was capable of i had never handled her in my life a misunderstanding between a man and his ship in a difficult river with no room to make it up is bound to end in trouble for the man on the other hand it must be owned i had not much reason to count upon a general run of good luck and suppose i had the misfortune to pile her up high and dry on some beastly shoal that would have been the final undoing of that voyage it was plain that if falk refused to tow me out he would also refuse to pull me off this meantwhat a day lost at the very best but more likely a whole fortnight of frizzling on some pestilential mudflat of desperate work of discharging cargo more than likely it meant borrowing money at an exorbitant rate of interestfrom the siegers gang too at that they were a power in the port and that elderly seaman of mine gambril had looked pretty ghastly when i went forward to dose him with quinine that morning he would certainly dienot to speak of two or three others that seemed nearly as bad and of the rest of them just ready to catch any tropical disease going horror ruin and everlasting remorse and no help none i had fallen amongst a lot of unfriendly lunatics  at any rate if i must take my ship down myself it was my duty to procure if possible some local knowledge but that was not easy the only person i could think of for that service was a certain johnson formerly captain of a country ship but now spliced to a country wife and gone utterly to the bad i had only heard of him in the vaguest way as living concealed in the thick of two hundred thousand natives and only emerging into the light of day for the purpose of hunting up some brandy i had a notion that if i could lay my hands on him i would sober him on board my ship and use him for a pilot better than nothing once a sailor always a sailorand he had known the river for years but in our consulate where i arrived dripping after a sharp walk they could tell me nothing the excellent young men on the staff though willing to help me belonged to a sphere of the white colony for which that sort of johnson does not exist their suggestion was that i should hunt the man up myself with the help of the consulates constablean exsergeantmajor of a regiment of hussars  this man whose usual duty apparently consisted in sitting behind a little table in an outer room of consular offices when ordered to assist me in my search for johnson displayed lots of energy and a marvellous amount of local knowledge of a sort but he did not conceal an immense and sceptical contempt for the whole business we explored together on that afternoon an infinity of infamous grog shops gambling dens opium dens we walked up narrow lanes where our gharrya tiny box of a thing on wheels attached to a jibbing burmah ponycould by no means have passed the constable seemed to be on terms of scornful intimacy with maltese with eurasians with chinamen with klings and with the sweepers attached to a temple with whom he talked at the gate we interviewed also through a grating in a mud wall closing a blind alley an immensely corpulent italian who the exsergeantmajor remarked to me perfunctorily had killed another man last year thereupon he addressed him as antonio and old buck though that bloated carcase apparently more than half filling the sort of cell wherein it sat recalled rather a fat pig in a stye familiar and never unbending the sergeant chuckedabsolutely chuckedunder the chin a horribly wrinkled and shrivelled old hag propped on a stick who had volunteered some sort of information and with the same stolid face he kept up an animated conversation with the groups of swathed brown women who sat smoking cheroots on the doorsteps of a long range of clay hovels we got out of the gharry and clambered into dwellings airy like packing crates or descended into places sinister like cellars we got in we drove on we got out again for the sole purpose as it seemed of looking behind a heap of rubble the sun declined my companion was curt and sardonic in his answers but it appears we were just missing johnson all along at last our conveyance stopped once more with a jerk and the driver jumping down opened the door  a black mudhole blocked the lane a mound of garbage crowned with the dead body of a dog arrested us not an empty australian beef tin bounded cheerily before the toe of my boot suddenly we clambered through a gap in a prickly fence  it was a very clean native compound and the big native woman with bare brown legs as thick as bedposts pursuing on all fours a silver dollar that came rolling out from somewhere was mrs johnson herself your mans at home said the exsergeant and stepped aside in complete and marked indifference to anything that might follow johnsonat homestood with his back to a native house built on posts and with its walls made of mats in his left hand he held a banana out of the right he dealt another dollar into space the woman captured this one on the wing and there and then plumped down on the ground to look at us with greater comfort  my man was sallow of face grizzled unshaven muddy on elbows and back where the seams of his serge coat yawned you could see his white nakedness the vestiges of a paper collar encircled his neck he looked at us with a grave swaying surprise where do you come from he asked my heart sank how could i have been stupid enough to waste energy and time for this  but having already gone so far i approached a little nearer and declared the purpose of my visit he would have to come at once with me sleep on board my ship and tomorrow with the first of the ebb he would give me his assistance in getting my ship down to the sea without steam a sixhundredton barque drawing nine feet aft i proposed to give him eighteen dollars for his local knowledge and all the time i was speaking he kept on considering attentively the various aspects of the banana holding first one side up to his eye then the other  youve forgotten to apologise he said at last with extreme precision not being a gentleman yourself you dont know apparently when you intrude upon a gentleman i am one i wish you to understand that when i am in funds i dont work and now  i would have pronounced him perfectly sober hadnt he paused in great concern to try and brush a hole off the knee of his trousers  i have moneyand friends every gentleman has perhaps you would like to know my friend his name is falk you could borrow some money try to remember falk falk abruptly his tone changed a noble heart he said muzzily  has falk been giving you some money i asked appalled by the detailed finish of the dark plot  lent me my good man not given me lent he corrected suavely met me taking the air last evening and being as usual anxious to obligehadnt you better go to the devil out of my compound  and upon this without other warning he let fly with the banana which missed my head and took the constable just under the left eye he rushed at the miserable johnson stammering with fury they fell but why dwell on the wretchedness the breathlessness the degradation the senselessness the weariness the ridicule and humiliation andandthe perspiration of these moments i dragged the exhussar off he was like a wild beast it seems he had been greatly annoyed at losing his free afternoon on my account the garden of his bungalow required his personal attention and at the slight blow of the banana the brute in him had broken loose we left johnson on his back still black in the face but beginning to kick feebly meantime the big woman had remained sitting on the ground apparently paralysed with extreme terror  for half an hour we jolted inside our rolling box side by side in profound silence the exsergeant was busy staunching the blood of a long scratch on his cheek i hope youre satisfied he said suddenly thats what comes of all that tomfool business if you hadnt quarrelled with that tugboat skipper over some girl or other all this wouldnt have happened  you heard that story i said  of course i heard and i shouldnt wonder if the consulgeneral himself doesnt come to hear of it how am i to go before him tomorrow with that thing on my cheeki want to know its you who ought to have got this  after that till the gharry stopped and he jumped out without leavetaking he swore to himself steadily horribly muttering great purposeful trooper oaths to which the worst a sailor can do is like the prattle of a child for my part i had just the strength to crawl into schombergs coffeeroom where i wrote at a little table a note to the mate instructing him to get everything ready for dropping down the river next day i couldnt face my ship well she had a clever sort of skipper and no mistakepoor thing what a horrid mess i took my head between my hands at times the obviousness of my innocence would reduce me to despair what had i done if i had done something to bring about the situation i should at least have learned not to do it again but i felt guiltless to the point of imbecility the room was empty yet only schomberg prowled round me goggleeyed and with a sort of awed respectful curiosity no doubt he had set the story going himself but he was a goodhearted chap and i am really persuaded he participated in all my troubles he did what he could for me he ranged aside the heavy matchstand set a chair straight pushed a spittoon slightly with his footas you show small attentions to a friend under a great sorrowsighed and at last unable to hold his tongue  well i warned you captain thats what comes of running your head against mr falk manll stick at nothing  i sat without stirring and after surveying me with a sort of commiseration in his eyes he burst out in a hoarse whisper but for a fine lump of a girl shes a fine lump of a girl he made a loud smacking noise with his thick lips the finest lump of a girl that i ever he was going on with great unction but for some reason or other broke off i fancied myself throwing something at his head i dont blame you captain hang me if i do he said with a patronising air  thank you i said resignedly it was no use fighting against this false fate i dont know even if i was sure myself where the truth of the matter began the conviction that it would end disastrously had been driven into me by all the successive shocks my sense of security had received i began to ascribe an extraordinary potency to agents in themselves powerless it was as if schombergs baseless gossip had the power to bring about the thing itself or the abstract enmity of falk could put my ship ashore  i have already explained how fatal this last would have been for my further action my youth my inexperience my very real concern for the health of my crew must be my excuse the action itself when it came was purely impulsive it was set in movement quite undiplomatically and simply by falks appearance in the doorway  the room was full by then and buzzing with voices i had been looked at with curiosity by every one but how am i to describe the sensation produced by the appearance of falk himself blocking the doorway the tension of expectation could be measured by the profundity of the silence that fell upon the very click of the billiard balls as to schomberg he looked extremely frightened he hated mortally any sort of row fracas he called it in his establishment fracas was bad for business he affirmed but in truth this specimen of portly middleaged manhood was of a timid disposition i dont know what considering my presence in the place they all hoped would come of it a sort of stag fight perhaps or they may have supposed falk had come in only to annihilate me completely as a matter of fact falk had come in because hermann had asked him to inquire after the precious white cotton parasol which in the worry and excitement of the previous day he had forgotten at the table where we had held our little discussion  it was this that gave me my opportunity i dont think i would have gone to seek falk out no i dont think so there are limits but there was an opportunity and i seized iti have already tried to explain why now i will merely state that in my opinion to get his sickly crew into the sea air and secure a quick despatch for his ship a skipper would be justified in going to any length short of absolute crime he should put his pride in his pocket he may accept confidences explain his innocence as if it were a sin he may take advantage of misconceptions of desires and of weaknesses he ought to conceal his horror and other emotions and if the fate of a human being and that human being a magnificent young girl is strangely involvedwhy he should contemplate that fate whatever it might seem to be without turning a hair and all these things i have done the explaining the listening the pretendingeven to the discretionand nobody not even hermanns niece i believe need throw stones at me now schomberg at all events neednt since from first to last i am happy to say there was not the slightest fracas  overcoming a nervous contraction of the windpipe i had managed to exclaim captain falk his start of surprise was perfectly genuine but afterwards he neither smiled nor scowled he simply waited then when i had said i must have a talk with you and had pointed to a chair at my table he moved up to me though he didnt sit down schomberg however with a long tumbler in his hand was making towards us prudently and i discovered then the only sign of weakness in falk he had for schomberg a repulsion resembling that sort of physical fear some people experience at the sight of a toad perhaps to a man so essentially and silently concentrated upon himself though he could talk well enough as i was to find out presently the others irrepressible loquacity embracing every human being within range of the tongue might have appeared unnatural disgusting and monstrous he suddenly gave signs of restivenesspositively like a horse about to rear and muttering hurriedly as if in great pain no i cant stand that fellow seemed ready to bolt this weakness of his gave me the advantage at the very start verandah i suggested as if rendering him a service and walked him out by the arm we stumbled over a few chairs we had the feeling of open space before us and felt the fresh breath of the riverfresh but tainted the chinese theatres across the water made in the sparsely twinkling masses of gloom an eastern town presents at night blazing centres of light and of a distant and howling uproar i felt him become suddenly tractable again like an animal like a goodtempered horse when the object that scares him is removed yes i felt in the darkness there how tractable he was without my conviction of his inflexibilitytenacity rather perhapsbeing in the least weakened his very arm abandoning itself to my grasp was as hard as marblelike a limb of iron but i heard a tumultuous scuffling of bootsoles within the unspeakable idiots inside were crowding to the windows climbing over each others backs behind the blinds billiard cues and all somebody broke a window pane and with the sound of falling glass so suggestive of riot and devastation schomberg reeled out after us in a state of funk which had prevented his parting with his brandy and soda he must have trembled like an aspen leaf the piece of ice in the long tumbler he held in his hand tinkled with an effect of chattering teeth i beg you gentlemen he expostulated thickly come really now i must insist  how proud i am of my presence of mind hallo i said instantly in a loud and naive tone somebodys breaking your windows schomberg would you please tell one of your boys to bring out here a pack of cards and a couple of lights and two long drinks will you  to receive an order soothed him at once it was business certainly he said in an immensely relieved tone the night was rainy with wandering gusts of wind and while we waited for the candles falk said as if to justify his panic i dont interfere in anybodys business i dont give any occasion for talk i am a respectable man but this fellow is always making out something wrong and can never rest till he gets somebody to believe him  this was the first of my knowledge of falk this desire of respectability of being like everybody else was the only recognition he vouchsafed to the organisation of mankind for the rest he might have been the member of a herd not of a society selfpreservation was his only concern not selfishness but mere selfpreservation selfishness presupposes consciousness choice the presence of other men but his instinct acted as though he were the last of mankind nursing that law like the only spark of a sacred fire i dont mean to say that living naked in a cavern would have satisfied him obviously he was the creature of the conditions to which he was born no doubt selfpreservation meant also the preservation of these conditions but essentially it meant something much more simple natural and powerful how shall i express it it meant the preservation of the five senses of his bodylet us saytaking it in its narrowest as well as in its widest meaning i think you will admit before long the justice of this judgment however as we stood there together in the dark verandah i had judged nothing as yetand i had no desire to judgewhich is an idle practice anyhow the light was long in coming  of course i said in a tone of mutual understanding it isnt exactly a game of cards i want with you  i saw him draw his hands down his facethe vague stir of the passionate and meaningless gesture but he waited in silent patience it was only when the lights had been brought out that he opened his lips i understood his mumble to mean that he didnt know any game  like this schomberg and all the other fools will have to keep off i said tearing open the pack have you heard that we are universally supposed to be quarrelling about a girl you know whoof course i am really ashamed to ask but is it possible that you do me the honour to think me dangerous  as i said these words i felt how absurd it was and also i felt flatteredfor really what else could it be his answer spoken in his usual dispassionate undertone made it clear that it was so but not precisely as flattering as i supposed he thought me dangerous with hermann more than with the girl herself but as to quarrelling i saw at once how inappropriate the word was we had no quarrel natural forces are not quarrelsome you cant quarrel with the wind that inconveniences and humiliates you by blowing off your hat in a street full of people he had no quarrel with me neither would a boulder falling on my head have had he fell upon me in accordance with the law by which he was movednot of gravitation like a detached stone but of selfpreservation of course this is giving it a rather wide interpretation strictly speaking he had existed and could have existed without being married yet he told me that he had found it more and more difficult to live alone yes he told me this in his low careless voice to such a pitch of confidence had we arrived at the end of half an hour  it took me just about that time to convince him that i had never dreamed of marrying hermanns niece could any necessity have been more extravagant and the difficulty was the greater because he was so hard hit that he couldnt imagine anybody being able to remain in a state of indifference any man with eyes in his head he seemed to think could not help coveting so much bodily magnificence this profound belief was conveyed by the manner he listened sitting sideways to the table and playing absently with a few cards i had dealt to him at random and the more i saw into him the more i saw of him the wind swayed the lights so that his sunburnt face whiskered to the eyes seemed to successively flicker crimson at me and to go out i saw the extraordinary breadth of the high cheekbones the perpendicular style of the features the massive forehead steep like a cliff denuded at the top largely uncovered at the temples the fact is i had never before seen him without his hat but now as if my fervour had made him hot he had taken it off and laid it gently on the floor something peculiar in the shape and setting of his yellow eyes gave them the provoking silent intensity which characterised his glance but the face was thin furrowed worn i discovered that through the bush of his hair as you may detect the gnarled shape of a tree trunk lost in a dense undergrowth these overgrown cheeks were sunken it was an anchorites bony head fitted with a capuchins beard and adjusted to a herculean body i dont mean athletic hercules i take it was not an athlete he was a strong man susceptible to female charms and not afraid of dirt and thus with falk who was a strong man he was extremely strong just as the girl since i must think of them together was magnificently attractive by the masterful power of flesh and blood expressed in shape in size in attitudethat is by a straight appeal to the senses his mind meantime preoccupied with respectability quailed before schombergs tongue and seemed absolutely impervious to my protestations and i went so far as to protest that i would just as soon think of marrying my mothers dear old lady faithful female cook as hermanns niece sooner i protested in my desperation much sooner but it did not appear that he saw anything outrageous in the proposition and in his sceptical immobility he seemed to nurse the argument that at all events the cook was very very far away it must be said that just before i had gone wrong by appealing to the evidence of my manner whenever i called on board the diana i had never attempted to approach the girl or to speak to her or even to look at her in any marked way nothing could be clearer but as his own idea oflet us saycourting seemed to consist precisely in sitting silently for hours in the vicinity of the beloved object that line of argument inspired him with distrust staring down his extended legs he let out a gruntas much as to say thats all very fine but you cant throw dust in my eyes  at last i was exasperated into saying why dont you put the matter at rest by talking to hermann and i added sneeringly you dont expect me perhaps to speak for you  to this he said very loud for him would you  and for the first time he lifted his head to look at me with wonder and incredulity he lifted his head so sharply that there could be no mistake i had touched a spring i saw the whole extent of my opportunity and could hardly believe in it  why speak to well of course i proceeded very slowly watching him with great attention for on my word i feared a joke not perhaps to the young lady herself i cant speak german you know but  he interrupted me with the earnest assurance that hermann had the highest opinion of me and at once i felt the need for the greatest possible diplomacy at this juncture so i demurred just enough to draw him on falk sat up but except for a very noticeable enlargement of the pupils till the irises of his eyes were reduced to two narrow yellow rings his face i should judge was incapable of expressing excitement oh yes hermann did have the greatest  take up your cards heres schomberg peeping at us through the blind i said  we went through the motions of what might have been a game of ecarte presently the intolerable scandalmonger withdrew probably to inform the people in the billiardroom that we two were gambling on the verandah like mad  we were not gambling but it was a game a game in which i felt i held the winning cards the stake roughly speaking was the success of the voyagefor me and he i apprehended had nothing to lose our intimacy matured rapidly and before many words had been exchanged i perceived that the excellent hermann had been making use of me that simple and astute teuton had been it seems holding me up to falk in the light of a rival i was young enough to be shocked at so much duplicity did he tell you that in so many words i asked with indignation  hermann had not he had given hints only and of course it had not taken very much to alarm falk but instead of declaring himself he had taken steps to remove the family from under my influence he was perfectly straightforward about itas straightforward as a tile falling on your head there was no duplicity in that man and when i congratulated him on the perfection of his arrangementseven to the bribing of the wretched johnson against mehe had a genuine movement of protest never bribed he knew the man wouldnt work as long as he had a few cents in his pocket to get drunk on and naturally he saidnaturally he let him have a dollar or two he was himself a sailor he said and anticipated the view another sailor like myself was bound to take on the other hand he was sure that i should have to come to grief he hadnt been knocking about for the last seven years up and down that river for nothing it would have been no disgrace to mebut he asserted confidently i would have had my ship very awkwardly ashore at a spot two miles below the great pagoda  and with all that he had no illwill that was evident this was a crisis in which his only object had been to gain timei fancy and presently he mentioned that he had written for some jewellery real good jewelleryhad written to hongkong for it it would arrive in a day or two  well then i said cheerily everything is all right all youve got to do is to present it to the lady together with your heart and live happy ever after  upon the whole he seemed to accept that view as far as the girl was concerned but his eyelids drooped there was still something in the way for one thing hermann disliked him so much as to me on the contrary it seemed as though he could not praise me enough mrs hermann too he didnt know why they disliked him so it made everything most difficult  i listened impassive feeling more and more diplomatic his speech was not transparently clear he was one of those men who seem to live feel suffer in a sort of mental twilight but as to being fascinated by the girl and possessed by the desire of home life with herit was as clear as daylight so much being at stake he was afraid of putting it to the hazard of declaration besides there was something else and with hermann being so set against him  i see i said thoughtfully while my heart beat fast with the excitement of my diplomacy i dont mind sounding hermann in fact to show you how mistaken you were i am ready to do all i can for you in that way  a light sigh escaped him he drew his hands down his face and it emerged bony unchanged of expression as if all the tissues had been ossified all the passion was in those big brown hands he was satisfied then there was that other matter if there were anybody on earth it was i who could persuade hermann to take a reasonable view i had a knowledge of the world and lots of experience hermann admitted this himself and then i was a sailor too falk thought that a sailor would be able to understand certain things best  he talked as if the hermanns had been living all their life in a rural hamlet and i alone had been capable with my practice in life of a large and indulgent view of certain occurrences that was what my diplomacy was leading me to i began suddenly to dislike it  i say falk i asked quite brusquely you havent already a wife put away somewhere  the pain and disgust of his denial were very striking couldnt i understand that he was as respectable as any white man hereabouts earning his living honestly he was suffering from my suspicion and the low undertone of his voice made his protestations sound very pathetic for a moment he shamed me but my diplomacy notwithstanding i seemed to develop a conscience as if in very truth it were in my power to decide the success of this matrimonial enterprise by pretending hard enough we come to believe anythinganything to our advantage and i had been pretending very hard because i meant yet to be towed safely down the river but through conscience or stupidity i couldnt help alluding to the vanlo affair you acted rather badly there didnt you was what i ventured actually to sayfor the logic of our conduct is always at the mercy of obscure and unforeseen impulses  his dilated pupils swerved from my face glancing at the window with a sort of scared fury we heard behind the blinds the continuous and sudden clicking of ivory a jovial murmur of many voices and schombergs deep manly laugh  that confounded old woman of a hotelkeeper then would never never let it rest falk exclaimed well yes it had happened two years ago when it came to the point he owned he couldnt make up his mind to trust fred vanlono sailor a bit of a fool too he could not trust him but to stop his row he had lent him enough money to pay all his debts before he left i was greatly surprised to hear this then falk could not be such a miser after all so much the better for the girl for a time he sat silent then he picked up a card and while looking at it he said  you need not think of anything bad it was an accident ive been unfortunate once  then in heavens name say nothing about it  as soon as these words were out of my mouth i fancied i had said something immoral he shook his head negatively it had to be told he considered it proper that the relations of the lady should know no doubti thought to myselfhad miss vanlo not been thirty and damaged by the climate he would have found it possible to entrust fred vanlo with this confidence and then the figure of hermanns niece appeared before my minds eye with the wealth of her opulent form her rich youth her lavish strength with that powerful and immaculate vitality her girlish form must have shouted aloud of life to that man whereas poor miss vanlo could only sing sentimental songs to the strumming of a piano  and that hermann hates me i know it he cried in his undertone with a sudden recrudescence of anxiety i must tell them it is proper that they should know you would say so yourself  he then murmured an utterly mysterious allusion to the necessity for peculiar domestic arrangements though my curiosity was excited i did not want to hear any of his confidences i feared he might give me a piece of information that would make my assumed role of matchmaker odioushowever unreal it was i was aware that he could have the girl for the asking and keeping down a desire to laugh in his face i expressed a confident belief in my ability to argue away hermanns dislike for him i am sure i can make it all right i said he looked very pleased  and when we rose not a word had been said about towage not a word the game was won and the honour was safe oh blessed white cotton umbrella we shook hands and i was holding myself with difficulty from breaking into a step dance of joy when he came back striding all the length of the verandah and said doubtfully  i say captain i have your word youyouwont turn round  heavens the fright he gave me behind his tone of doubt there was something desperate and menacing the infatuated ass but i was equal to the situation  my dear falk i said beginning to lie with a glibness and effrontery that amazed me even at the timeconfidence for confidence he had made no confidences i will tell you that i am already engaged to an extremely charming girl at home and so you understand  he caught my hand and wrung it in a crushing grip  pardon me i feel it every day more difficult to live alone  on rice and fish i interrupted smartly giggling with the sheer nervousness of a danger escaped  he dropped my hand as if it had become suddenly red hot a moment of profound silence ensued as though something extraordinary had happened  i promise you to obtain hermanns consent i faltered out at last and it seemed to me that he could not help seeing through that humbugging promise if theres anything else to get over i shall endeavour to stand by you i conceded further feeling somehow defeated and overborne but you must do your best yourself  i have been unfortunate once he muttered unemotionally and turning his back on me he went away thumping slowly the plank floor as if his feet had been shod with iron  next morning however he was lively enough as manboat a combination of splashing and shouting of the insolent commotion below with the steady overbearing glare of the silent headpiece above he turned us out most unnecessarily at an ungodly hour but it was nearly eleven in the morning before he brought me up a cables length from hermanns ship and he did it very badly too in a hurry and nearly contriving to miss altogether the patch of good holding ground because forsooth he had caught sight of hermanns niece on the poop and so did i and probably as soon as he had seen her himself i saw the modest sleek glory of the tawny head and the full grey shape of the girlish print frock she filled so perfectly so satisfactorily with the seduction of unfaltering curvesa very nymph of diana the huntress and diana the ship sat highwalled and as solid as an institution on the smooth level of the water the most uninspiring and respectable craft upon the seas useful and ugly devoted to the support of domestic virtues like any grocers shop on shore at once falk steamed away for there was some work for him to do he would return in the evening  he ranged close by us passing out dead slow without a hail the beat of the paddlewheels reverberating amongst the stony islets as if from the ruined walls of a vast arena filled the anchorage confusedly with the clapping sounds of a mighty and leisurely applause abreast of hermanns ship he stopped the engines and a profound silence reigned over the rocks the shore and the sea for the time it took him to raise his hat aloft before the nymph of the grey print frock i had snatched up my binoculars and i can answer for it she didnt stir a limb standing by the rail shapely and erect with one of her hands grasping a rope at the height of her head while the way of the tug carried slowly past her the lingering and profound homage of the man there was for me an enormous significance in the scene the sense of having witnessed a solemn declaration the die was cast after such a manifestation he couldnt back out and i reflected that it was nothing whatever to me now with a rush of black smoke belching suddenly out of the funnel and a mad swirl of paddlewheels provoking a burst of weird and precipitated clapping the tug shot out of the desolate arena the rocky islets lay on the sea like the heaps of a cyclopean ruin on a plain the centipedes and scorpions lurked under the stones there was not a single blade of grass in sight anywhere not a single lizard sunning himself on a boulder by the shore when i looked again at hermanns ship the girl had disappeared i could not detect the smallest dot of a bird on the immense sky and the flatness of the land continued the flatness of the sea to the naked line of the horizon  this is the setting now inseparably connected with my knowledge of falks misfortune my diplomacy had brought me there and now i had only to wait the time for taking up the role of an ambassador my diplomacy was a success my ship was safe old gambril would probably live a feeble sound of a tapping hammer came intermittently from the diana during the afternoon i looked at times at the old homely ship the faithful nurse of hermanns progeny or yawned towards the distant temple of buddha like a lonely hillock on the plain where shaven priests cherish the thoughts of that annihilation which is the worthy reward of us all unfortunate he had been unfortunate once well that was not so bad as life goes and what the devil could be the nature of that misfortune i remembered that i had known a man before who had declared himself to have fallen years ago a victim to misfortune but this misfortune whose effects appeared permanent he looked desperately hard up when considered dispassionately seemed indistinguishable from a breach of trust could it be something of that nature apart however from the utter improbability that he would offer to talk of it even to his future uncleinlaw i had a strange feeling that falks physique unfitted him for that sort of delinquency as the person of hermanns niece exhaled the profound physical charm of feminine form so her adorers big frame embodied to my senses the hard straight masculinity that would conceivably kill but would not condescend to cheat the thing was obvious i might just as well have suspected the girl of a curvature of the spine and i perceived that the sun was about to set  the smoke of falks tug hove in sight far away at the mouth of the river it was time for me to assume the character of an ambassador and the negotiation would not be difficult except in the matter of keeping my countenance it was all too extravagantly nonsensical and i conceived that it would be best to compose for myself a grave demeanour i practised this in my boat as i went along but the bashfulness that came secretly upon me the moment i stepped on the deck of the diana is inexplicable as soon as we had exchanged greetings hermann asked me eagerly if i knew whether falk had found his white parasol  hes going to bring it to you himself directly i said with great solemnity meantime i am charged with an important message for which he begs your favourable consideration he is in love with your niece  ach so he hissed with an animosity that made my assumed gravity change into the most genuine concern what meant this tone and i hurried on  he wishes with your consent of course to ask her to marry him at oncebefore you leave here that is he would speak to the consul  hermann sat down and smoked violently five minutes passed in that furious meditation and then taking the long pipe out of his mouth he burst into a hot diatribe against falkagainst his cupidity his stupidity a fellow that can hardly be got to say yes or no to the simplest questionagainst his outrageous treatment of the shipping in port because he saw they were at his mercyand against his manner of walking which to his hermanns mind showed a conceit positively unbearable the damage to the old diana was not forgotten of course and there was nothing of any nature said or done by falk even to the last offer of refreshment in the hotel that did not seem to have been a cause of offence had the cheek to drag him hermann into that coffeeroom as though a drink from him could make up for fortyseven dollars and fifty cents of damage in the cost of wood alonenot counting two days work for the carpenter of course he would not stand in the girls way he was going home to germany there were plenty of poor girls walking about in germany  hes very much in love was all i found to say  yes he cried and it is time too after making himself and me talked about ashore the last voyage i was here and then now again coming on board every evening unsettling the girls mind and saying nothing what sort of conduct is that  the seven thousand dollars the fellow was always talking about did not in his opinion justify such behaviour moreover nobody had seen them he hermann seriously doubted if there were seven thousand cents and the tug no doubt was mortgaged up to the top of the funnel to the firm of siegers but let that pass he wouldnt stand in the girls way her head was so turned that she had become no good to them of late quite unable even to put the children to bed without her aunt it was bad for the children they got unruly and yesterday he actually had to give gustav a thrashing  for that too falk was made responsible apparently and looking at my hermanns heavy puffy goodnatured face i knew he would not exert himself till greatly exasperated and therefore would thrash very hard and being fat would resent the necessity how falk had managed to turn the girls head was more difficult to understand i supposed hermann would know and then hadnt there been miss vanlo it could not be his silvery tongue or the subtle seduction of his manner he had no more of what is called manner than an animalwhich however on the other hand is never and can never be called vulgar therefore it must have been his bodily appearance exhibiting a virility of nature as exaggerated as his beard and resembling a sort of constant ruthlessness it was seen in the very manner he lolled in the chair he meant no offence but his intercourse was characterised by that sort of frank disregard of susceptibilities a man of seven foot six living in a world of dwarfs would naturally assume without in the least wishing to be unkind but amongst men of his own stature or nearly this frank use of his advantages in such matters as the awful towage bills for instance caused much impotent gnashing of teeth when attentively considered it seemed appalling at times he was a strange beast but maybe women liked it seen in that light he was well worth taming and i suppose every woman at the bottom of her heart considers herself as a tamer of strange beasts but hermann arose with precipitation to carry the news to his wife i had barely the time as he made for the cabin door to grab him by the seat of his inexpressibles i begged him to wait till falk in person had spoken with him there remained some small matter to talk over as i understood  he sat down again at once full of suspicion  what matter he said surlily i have had enough of his nonsense theres no matter at all as he knows very well the girl has nothing in the world she came to us in one thin dress when my brother died and i have a growing family  it cant be anything of that kind i opined hes desperately enamoured of your niece i dont know why he did not say so before upon my word i believe it is because he was afraid to lose perhaps the felicity of sitting near her on your quarter deck  i intimated my conviction that his love was so great as to be in a sense cowardly the effects of a great passion are unaccountable it has been known to make a man timid but hermann looked at me as if i had foolishly raved and the twilight was dying out rapidly  you dont believe in passion do you hermann i said cheerily the passion of fear will make a cornered rat courageous falks in a corner he will take her off your hands in one thin frock just as she came to you and after ten years service it isnt a bad bargain i added  far from taking offence he resumed his air of civic virtue the sudden night came upon him while he stared placidly along the deck bringing in contact with his thick lips and taking away again after a jet of smoke the curved mouthpiece fitted to the stem of his pipe the night came upon him and buried in haste his whiskers his globular eyes his puffy pale face his fat knees and the vast flat slippers on his fatherly feet only his short arms in respectable white shirtsleeves remained very visible propped up like the flippers of a seal reposing on the strand  falk wouldnt settle anything about repairs told me to find out first how much wood i should require and he would see he remarked and after he had spat peacefully in the dusk we heard over the water the beat of the tugs floats there is on a calm night nothing more suggestive of fierce and headlong haste than the rapid sound made by the paddlewheels of a boat threshing her way through a quiet sea and the approach of falk towards his fate seemed to be urged by an impatient and passionate desire the engines must have been driven to the very utmost of their revolutions we heard them slow down at last and vaguely the white hull of the tug appeared moving against the black islets whilst a slow and rhythmical clapping as of thousands of hands rose on all sides it ceased all at once just before falk brought her up a single brusque splash was followed by the long drawn rumbling of iron links running through the hawse pipe then a solemn silence fell upon the roadstead  he will soon be here i murmured and after that we waited for him without a word meantime raising my eyes i beheld the glitter of a lofty sky above the dianas mastheads the multitude of stars gathered into clusters in rows in lines in masses in groups shone all together unanimouslyand the few isolated ones blazing by themselves in the midst of dark patches seemed to be of a superior kind and of an inextinguishable nature but long striding footsteps were heard hastening along the deck the high bulwarks of the diana made a deeper darkness we rose from our chairs quickly and falk appearing before us all in white stood still  nobody spoke at first as though we had been covered with confusion his arrival was fiery but his white bulk of indefinite shape and without features made him loom up like a man of snow  the captain here has been telling me hermann began in a homely and amicable voice and falk had a low nervous laugh his cool negligent undertone had no inflexions but the strength of a powerful emotion made him ramble in his speech he had always desired a home it was difficult to live alone though he was not answerable he was domestic there had been difficulties but since he had seen hermanns niece he found that it had become at last impossible to live by himself i meanimpossible he repeated with no sort of emphasis and only with the slightest of pauses but the word fell into my mind with the force of a new idea  i have not said anything to her yet hermann observed quietly and falk dismissed this by a thats all right certainly very proper there was a necessity for perfect franknessin marrying especially hermann seemed attentive but he seized the first opportunity to ask us into the cabin and bytheby falk he said innocently as we passed in the timber came to no less than fortyseven dollars and fifty cents  falk uncovering his head lingered in the passage some other time he said and hermann nudged me angrilyi dont know why the girl alone in the cabin sat sewing at some distance from the table falk stopped short in the doorway without a word without a sign without the slightest inclination of his bony head by the silent intensity of his look alone he seemed to lay his herculean frame at her feet her hands sank slowly on her lap and raising her clear eyes she let her soft beaming glance enfold him from head to foot like a slow and pale caress he was very hot when he sat down she with bowed head went on with her sewing her neck was very white under the light of the lamp but falk hiding his face in the palms of his hands shuddered faintly he drew them down even to his beard and his uncovered eyes astonished me by their tense and irrational expressionas though he had just swallowed a heavy gulp of alcohol it passed away while he was binding us to secrecy not that he cared but he did not like to be spoken about and i looked at the girls marvellous at her wonderful at her regal hair plaited tight into that one astonishing and maidenly tress whenever she moved her wellshaped head it would stir stiffly to and fro on her back the thin cotton sleeve fitted the irreproachable roundness of her arm like a skin and her very dress stretched on her bust seemed to palpitate like a living tissue with the strength of vitality animating her body how good her complexion was the outline of her soft cheek and the small convoluted conch of her rosy ear to pull her needle she kept the little finger apart from the others it seemed a waste of power to see her sewingeternally sewingwith that industrious and precise movement of her arm going on eternally upon all the oceans under all the skies in innumerable harbours and suddenly i heard falks voice declare that he could not marry a woman unless she knew of something in his life that had happened ten years ago it was an accident an unfortunate accident it would affect the domestic arrangements of their home but once told it need not be alluded to again for the rest of their lives i should want my wife to feel for me he said it has made me unhappy and how could he keep the knowledge of it to himselfhe asked usperhaps through years and years of companionship what sort of companionship would that be he had thought it over a wife must know then why not at once he counted on hermanns kindness for presenting the affair in the best possible light and hermanns countenance mystified before became very sour he stole an inquisitive glance at me i shook my head blankly some people thought falk went on that such an experience changed a man for the rest of his life he couldnt say it was hard awful and not to be forgotten but he did not think himself a worse man than before only he talked in his sleep now he believed at last i began to think he had accidentally killed some one perhaps a friendhis own father maybe when he went on to say that probably we were aware he never touched meat throughout he spoke english of course of my account  he swayed forward heavily  the girl with her hands raised before her pale eyes was threading her needle he glanced at her and his mighty trunk overshadowed the table bringing nearer to us the breadth of his shoulders the thickness of his neck and that incongruous anchorite head burnt in the desert hollowed and lean as if by excesses of vigils and fasting his beard flowed imposingly downwards out of sight between the two brown hands gripping the edge of the table and his persistent glance made sombre by the wide dilations of the pupils fascinated  imagine to yourselves he said in his ordinary voice that i have eaten man  i could only ejaculate a faint ah of complete enlightenment but hermann dazed by the excessive shock actually murmured himmel what for  it was my terrible misfortune to do so said falk in a measured undertone the girl unconscious sewed on mrs hermann was absent in one of the staterooms sitting up with lena who was feverish but hermann suddenly put both his hands up with a jerk the embroidered calotte fell and in the twinkling of an eye he had rumpled his hair all ends up in a most extravagant manner in this state he strove to speak with every effort his eyes seemed to start further out of their sockets his head looked like a mop he choked gasped swallowed and managed to shriek out the one word beast  from that moment till falk went out of the cabin the girl with her hands folded on the work lying in her lap never took her eyes off him his own in the blindness of his heart darted all over the cabin only seeking to avoid the sight of hermanns raving it was ridiculous and was made almost terrible by the stillness of every other person present it was contemptible and was made appalling by the mans overmastering horror of this awful sincerity coming to him suddenly with the confession of such a fact he walked with great strides he gasped he wanted to know from falk how dared he to come and tell him this did he think himself a proper person to be sitting in this cabin where his wife and children lived tell his niece expected him to tell his niece his own brothers daughter shameless did i ever hear tell of such impudencehe appealed to me this man here ought to have gone and hidden himself out of sight instead of  but its a great misfortune for me but its a great misfortune for me falk would ejaculate from time to time  however hermann kept on running frequently against the corners of the table at last he lost a slipper and crossing his arms on his breast walked up with one stocking foot very close to falk in order to ask him whether he did think there was anywhere on earth a woman abandoned enough to mate with such a monster did he did he did he i tried to restrain him he tore himself out of my hands he found his slipper and endeavouring to put it on stormed standing on one legand falk with a face unmoved and averted eyes grasped all his mighty beard in one vast palm  was it right then for me to die myself he asked thoughtfully i laid my hand on his shoulder  go away i whispered imperiously without any clear reason for this advice except that i wished to put an end to hermanns odious noise go away  he looked searchingly for a moment at hermann before he made a move i left the cabin too to see him out of the ship but he hung about the quarterdeck  it is my misfortune he said in a steady voice  you were stupid to blurt it out in such a manner after all we dont hear such confidences every day  what does the man mean he mused in deep undertones somebody had to diebut why me  he remained still for a time in the darksilent almost invisible all at once he pinned my elbows to my sides i felt utterly powerless in his grip and his voice whispering in my ear vibrated  its worse than hunger captain do you know what that means and i could kill thenor be killed i wish the crowbar had smashed my skull ten years ago and ive got to live now without her do you understand perhaps many years but how what can be done if i had allowed myself to look at her once i would have carried her off before that man in my handslike this  i felt myself snatched off the deck then suddenly droppedand i staggered backwards feeling bewildered and bruised what a man all was still he was gone i heard hermanns voice declaiming in the cabin and i went in  i could not at first make out a single word but mrs hermann who attracted by the noise had come in some time before with an expression of surprise and mild disapproval depicted broadly on her face was giving now all the signs of profound helpless agitation her husband shot a string of guttural words at her and instantly putting out one hand to the bulkhead as if to save herself from falling she clutched the loose bosom of her dress with the other he harangued the two women extraordinarily with much of his shirt hanging out of his waistbelt stamping his foot turning from one to the other sometimes throwing both his arms together straight up above his rumpled hair and keeping them in that position while he uttered a passage of loud denunciation at others folding them tight across his breastand then he hissed with indignation elevating his shoulders and protruding his head the girl was crying  she had not changed her attitude from her steady eyes that following falk in his retreat had remained fixed wistfully on the cabin door the tears fell rapid thick on her hands on the work in her lap warm and gentle like a shower in spring she wept without grimacing without noisevery touching very quiet with something more of pity than of pain in her face as one weeps in compassion rather than in griefand hermann before her declaimed i caught several times the word mensch man and also fressen which last i looked up afterwards in my dictionary it means devour hermann seemed to be requesting an answer of some sort from her his whole body swayed she remained mute and perfectly still at last his agitation gained her she put the palms of her hands together her full lips parted no sound came his voice scolded shrilly his arms went like a windmillsuddenly he shook a thick fist at her she burst out into loud sobs he seemed stupefied  mrs hermann rushed forward babbling rapidly the two women fell on each others necks and with an arm round her nieces waist she led her away her own eyes were simply streaming her face was flooded she shook her head back at me negatively i wonder why to this day the girls head dropped heavily on her shoulder they disappeared  then hermann sat down and stared at the cabin floor  we dont know all the circumstances i ventured to break the silence he retorted tartly that he didnt want to know of any according to his ideas no circumstances could excuse a crimeand certainly not such a crime this was the opinion generally received the duty of a human being was to starve falk therefore was a beast an animal base low vile despicable shameless and deceitful he had been deceiving him since last year he was however inclined to think that falk must have gone mad quite recently for no sane person without necessity uselessly for no earthly reason and regardless of anothers selfrespect and peace of mind would own to having devoured human flesh why tell he cried who was asking him it showed falks brutality because after all he had selfishly caused him hermann much pain he would have preferred not to know that such an unclean creature had been in the habit of caressing his children he hoped i would say nothing of all this ashore though he wouldnt like it to get about that he had been intimate with an eater of mena common cannibal as to the scene he had made which i judged quite unnecessary he was not going to inconvenience and restrain himself for a fellow that went about courting and upsetting girls heads while he knew all the time that no decent housewifely girl could think of marrying him at least he hermann could not conceive how any girl could fancy lena no it was impossible the thoughts that would come into their heads every time they sat down to a meal horrible horrible  you are too squeamish hermann i said  he seemed to think it was eminently proper to be squeamish if the word meant disgust at falks conduct and turning up his eyes sentimentally he drew my attention to the horrible fate of the victimsthe victims of that falk i said that i knew nothing about them he seemed surprised could not anybody imagine without knowing hefor instancefelt he would like to avenge them but what ifsaid ithere had not been any they might have died as it were naturallyof starvation he shuddered but to be eatenafter death to be devoured he gave another deep shudder and asked suddenly do you think it is true  his indignation and his personality together would have been enough to spoil the reality of the most authentic thing when i looked at him i doubted the storybut the remembrance of falks words looks gestures invested it not only with an air of reality but with the absolute truth of primitive passion  it is true just as much as you are able to make it and exactly in the way you like to make it for my part when i hear you clamouring about it i dont believe it is true at all  and i left him pondering the men in my boat lying at the foot of dianas side ladder told me that the captain of the tug had gone away in his gig some time ago  i let my fellows pull an easy stroke because of the heavy dew the clear sparkle of the stars seemed to fall on me cold and wetting there was a sense of lurking gruesome horror somewhere in my mind and it was mingled with clear and grotesque images schombergs gastronomic tittletattle was responsible for these and i half hoped i should never see falk again but the first thing my anchorwatchman told me was that the captain of the tug was on board he had sent his boat away and was now waiting for me in the cuddy  he was lying full length on the stern settee his face buried in the cushions i had expected to see it discomposed contorted despairing it was nothing of the kind it was just as i had seen it twenty times steady and glaring from the bridge of the tug it was immovably set and hungry dominated like the whole man by the singleness of one instinct  he wanted to live he had always wanted to live so we all dobut in us the instinct serves a complex conception and in him this instinct existed alone there is in such simple development a gigantic force and like the pathos of a childs naive and uncontrolled desire he wanted that girl and the utmost that can be said for him was that he wanted that particular girl alone i think i saw then the obscure beginning the seed germinating in the soil of an unconscious need the first shoot of that tree bearing now for a mature mankind the flower and the fruit the infinite gradation in shades and in flavour of our discriminating love he was a child he was as frank as a child too he was hungry for the girl terribly hungry as he had been terribly hungry for food  dont be shocked if i declare that in my belief it was the same need the same pain the same torture we are in his case allowed to contemplate the foundation of all the emotionsthat one joy which is to live and the one sadness at the root of the innumerable torments it was made plain by the way he talked he had never suffered so it was gnawing it was fire it was there like this and after pointing below his breastbone he made a hard wringing motion with his hands and i assure you that seen as i saw it with my bodily eyes it was anything but laughable and again as he was presently to tell me alluding to an early incident of the disastrous voyage when some damaged meat had been flung overboard he said that a time soon came when his heart ached that was the expression he used and he was ready to tear his hair out at the thought of all that rotten beef thrown away  i had heard all this i witnessed his physical struggles seeing the working of the rack and hearing the true voice of pain i witnessed it all patiently because the moment i came into the cuddy he had called upon me to stand by himand this it seems i had diplomatically promised  his agitation was impressive and alarming in the little cabin like the floundering of a great whale driven into a shallow cove in a coast he stood up he flung himself down headlong he tried to tear the cushion with his teeth and again hugging it fiercely to his face he let himself fall on the couch the whole ship seemed to feel the shock of his despair and i contemplated with wonder the lofty forehead the noble touch of time on the uncovered temples the unchanged hungry character of the faceso strangely ascetic and so incapable of portraying emotion  what should he do he had lived by being near her he had satin the eveningi knewall his life she sewed her head was bentso her headlike thisand her arms ah had i seen like this  he dropped on a stool bowed his powerful neck whose nape was red and with his hands stitched the air ludicrous sublimely imbecile and comprehensible  and now he couldnt have her no that was too much after thinking too that what had he done what was my advice take her by force no mustnt he who was there then to kill him for the first time i saw one of his features move a fighting teethbaring curl of the lip not hermann perhaps he lost himself in thought as though he had fallen out of the world  i may note that the idea of suicide apparently did not enter his head for a single moment it occurred to me to ask  where was it that this shipwreck of yours took place  down south he said vaguely with a start  you are not down south now i said violence wont do they would take her away from you in no time and what was the name of the ship  borgmester dahl he said it was no shipwreck  he seemed to be waking up by degrees from that trance and waking up calmed  not a shipwreck what was it  break down he answered looking more like himself every moment by this only i learned that it was a steamer i had till then supposed they had been starving in boats or on a raftor perhaps on a barren rock  she did not sink then i asked in surprise he nodded we sighted the southern ice he pronounced dreamily  and you alone survived  he sat down yes it was a terrible misfortune for me everything went wrong all the men went wrong i survived  remembering the things one reads of it was difficult to realise the true meaning of his answers i ought to have seen at oncebut i did not so difficult is it for our minds remembering so much instructed so much informed of so much to get in touch with the real actuality at our elbow and with my head full of preconceived notions as to how a case of cannibalism and suffering at sea should be managed i saidyou were then so lucky in the drawing of lots  drawing of lots he said what lots do you think i would have allowed my life to go for the drawing of lots  not if he could help if i perceived no matter what other life went  it was a great misfortune terrible awful he said many heads went wrong but the best men would live  the toughest you mean i said he considered the word perhaps it was strange to him though his english was so good  yes he asserted at last the best it was everybody for himself at last and the ship open to all  thus from question to question i got the whole story i fancy it was the only way i could that night have stood by him outwardly at least he was himself again the first sign of it was the return of that incongruous trick he had of drawing both his hands down his faceand it had its meaning now with that slight shudder of the frame and the passionate anguish of these hands uncovering a hungry immovable face the wide pupils of the intent silent fascinating eyes  it was an iron steamer of a most respectable origin the burgomaster of falks native town had built her she was the first steamer ever launched there the burgomasters daughter had christened her country people drove in carts from miles around to see her he told me all this he got the berth as what we should call a chief mate he seemed to think it had been a feather in his cap and in his own corner of the world this lover of life was of good parentage  the burgomaster had advanced ideas in the shipowning line at that time not every one would have known enough to think of despatching a cargo steamer to the pacific but he loaded her with pitchpine deals and sent her off to hunt for her luck wellington was to be the first port i fancy it doesnt matter because in latitude 44 d south and somewhere halfway between good hope and new zealand the tail shaft broke and the propeller dropped off  they were steaming then with a fresh gale on the quarter and all their canvas set to help the engines but by itself the sail power was not enough to keep way on her when the propeller went the ship broachedto at once and the masts got whipped overboard  the disadvantage of being dismasted consisted in this that they had nothing to hoist flags on to make themselves visible at a distance in the course of the first few days several ships failed to sight them and the gale was drifting them out of the usual track the voyage had been from the first neither very successful nor very harmonious there had been quarrels on board the captain was a clever melancholic man who had no unusual grip on his crew the ship had been amply provisioned for the passage but somehow or other several barrels of meat were found spoiled on opening and had been thrown overboard soon after leaving home as a sanitary measure afterwards the crew of the borgmester dahl thought of that rotten carrion with tears of regret covetousness and despair  she drove south to begin with there had been an appearance of organisation but soon the bonds of discipline became relaxed a sombre idleness succeeded they looked with sullen eyes at the horizon the gales increased she lay in the trough the seas made a clean breach over her on one frightful night when they expected their hulk to turn over with them every moment a heavy sea broke on board deluged the storerooms and spoiled the best part of the remaining provisions it seems the hatch had not been properly secured this instance of neglect is characteristic of utter discouragement falk tried to inspire some energy into his captain but failed from that time he retired more into himself always trying to do his utmost in the situation it grew worse gale succeeded gale with black mountains of water hurling themselves on the borgmester dahl some of the men never left their bunks many became quarrelsome the chief engineer an old man refused to speak at all to anybody others shut themselves up in their berths to cry on calm days the inert steamer rolled on a leaden sea under a murky sky or showed in sunshine the squalor of sea waifs the dried white salt the rust the jagged broken places then the gales came again they kept body and soul together on short rations once an english ship scudding in a storm tried to stand by them heavingto pluckily under their lee the seas swept her decks the men in oilskins clinging to her rigging looked at them and they made desperate signs over their shattered bulwarks suddenly her maintopsail went yard and all in a terrific squall she had to bear up under bare poles and disappeared  other ships had spoken them before but at first they had refused to be taken off expecting the assistance of some steamer there were very few steamers in those latitudes then and when they desired to leave this dead and drifting carcase no ship came in sight they had drifted south out of mens knowledge they failed to attract the attention of a lonely whaler and very soon the edge of the polar icecap rose from the sea and closed the southern horizon like a wall one morning they were alarmed by finding themselves floating amongst detached pieces of ice but the fear of sinking passed away like their vigour like their hopes the shocks of the floes knocking against the ships side could not rouse them from their apathy and the borgmester dahl drifted out again unharmed into open water they hardly noticed the change  the funnel had gone overboard in one of the heavy rolls two of their three boats had disappeared washed away in bad weather and the davits swung to and fro unsecured with chafed ropes ends waggling to the roll nothing was done on board and falk told me how he had often listened to the water washing about the dark engineroom where the engines stilled for ever were decaying slowly into a mass of rust as the stilled heart decays within the lifeless body at first after the loss of the motive power the tiller had been thoroughly secured by lashings but in course of time these had rotted chafed rusted parting one by one and the rudder freed banged heavily to and fro night and day sending dull shocks through the whole frame of the vessel this was dangerous nobody cared enough to lift a little finger he told me that even now sometimes waking up at night he fancied he could hear the dull vibrating thuds the pintles carried away and it dropped off at last  the final catastrophe came with the sending off of their one remaining boat it was falk who had managed to preserve her intact and now it was agreed that some of the hands should sail away into the track of the shipping to procure assistance she was provisioned with all the food they could spare for the six who were to go they waited for a fine day it was long in coming at last one morning they lowered her into the water  directly in that demoralised crowd trouble broke out two men who had no business there had jumped into the boat under the pretence of unhooking the tackles while some sort of squabble arose on the deck amongst these weak tottering spectres of a ships company the captain who had been for days living secluded and unapproachable in the chartroom came to the rail he ordered the two men to come up on board and menaced them with his revolver they pretended to obey but suddenly cutting the boats painter gave a shove against the ships side and made ready to hoist the sail  shoot sir shoot them down cried falkand i will jump overboard to regain the boat but the captain after taking aim with an irresolute arm turned suddenly away  a howl of rage arose falk dashed into his cabin for his own pistol when he returned it was too late two more men had leaped into the water but the fellows in the boat beat them off with the oars hoisted the boats lug and sailed away they were never heard of again  consternation and despair possessed the remaining ships company till the apathy of utter hopelessness reasserted its sway that day a fireman committed suicide running up on deck with his throat cut from ear to ear to the horror of all hands he was thrown overboard the captain had locked himself in the chartroom and falk knocking vainly for admittance heard him reciting over and over again the names of his wife and children not as if calling upon them or commending them to god but in a mechanical voice like an exercise of memory next day the doors of the chartroom were swinging open to the roll of the ship and the captain had disappeared he must during the night have jumped into the sea falk locked both the doors and kept the keys  the organised life of the ship had come to an end the solidarity of the men had gone they became indifferent to each other it was falk who took in hand the distribution of such food as remained they boiled their boots for soup to eke out the rations which only made their hunger more intolerable sometimes whispers of hate were heard passing between the languid skeletons that drifted endlessly to and fro north and south east and west upon that carcase of a ship  and in this lies the grotesque horror of this sombre story the last extremity of sailors overtaking a small boat or a frail craft seems easier to bear because of the direct danger of the seas the confined space the close contact the imminent menace of the waves seem to draw men together in spite of madness suffering and despair but there was a shipsafe convenient roomy a ship with beds bedding knives forks comfortable cabins glass and china and a complete cooks galley pervaded ruled and possessed by the pitiless spectre of starvation the lamp oil had been drunk the wicks cut up for food the candles eaten at night she floated dark in all her recesses and full of fears one day falk came upon a man gnawing a splinter of pine wood suddenly he threw the piece of wood away tottered to the rail and fell over falk too late to prevent the act saw him claw the ships side desperately before he went down next day another man did the same thing after uttering horrible imprecations but this one somehow managed to get hold of the broken rudder chains and hung on there silently falk set about trying to save him and all the time the man holding with both hands looked at him anxiously with his sunken eyes then just as falk was ready to put his hand on him the man let go his hold and sank like a stone falk reflected on these sights his heart revolted against the horror of death and he said to himself that he would struggle for every precious minute of his life  one afternoonas the survivors lay about on the after deckthe carpenter a tall man with a black beard spoke of the last sacrifice there was nothing eatable left on board nobody said a word to this but that company separated quickly these listless feeble spectres slunk off one by one to hide in fear of each other falk and the carpenter remained on deck together falk liked the big carpenter he had been the best man of the lot helpful and ready as long as there was anything to do the longest hopeful and had preserved to the last some vigour and decision of mind  they did not speak to each other henceforth no voices were to be heard conversing sadly on board that ship after a time the carpenter tottered away forward but later on falk going to drink at the freshwater pump had the inspiration to turn his head the carpenter had stolen upon him from behind and summoning all his strength was aiming with a crowbar a blow at the back of his skull  dodging just in time falk made his escape and ran into his cabin while he was loading his revolver there he heard the sound of heavy blows struck upon the bridge the locks of the chartroom doors were slight they flew open and the carpenter possessing himself of the captains revolver fired a shot of defiance  falk was about to go on deck and have it out at once when he remarked that one of the ports of his cabin commanded the approaches to the freshwater pump instead of going out he remained in and secured the door the best man shall survive he said to himselfand the other he reasoned must at some time or other come there to drink these starving men would drink often to cheat the pangs of their hunger but the carpenter too must have noticed the position of the port they were the two best men in the ship and the game was with them all the rest of the day falk saw no one and heard no sound at night he strained his eyes it was darkhe heard a rustling noise once but he was certain that no one could have come near the pump it was to the left of his deck port and he could not have failed to see a man for the night was clear and starry he saw nothing towards morning another faint noise made him suspicious deliberately and quietly he unlocked his door he had not slept and had not given way to the horror of the situation he wanted to live  but during the night the carpenter without at all trying to approach the pump had managed to creep quietly along the starboard bulwark and unseen had crouched down right under falks deck port when daylight came he rose up suddenly looked in and putting his arm through the round brass framed opening fired at falk within a foot he missedand falk instead of attempting to seize the arm holding the weapon opened his door unexpectedly and with the muzzle of his long revolver nearly touching the others side shot him dead  the best man had survived both of them had at the beginning just strength enough to stand on their feet and both had displayed pitiless resolution endurance cunning and courageall the qualities of classic heroism at once falk threw overboard the captains revolver he was a born monopolist then after the report of the two shots followed by a profound silence there crept out into the cold cruel dawn of antarctic regions from various hidingplaces over the deck of that dismantled corpse of a ship floating on a grey sea ruled by iron necessity and with a heart of icethere crept into view one by one cautious slow eager glaring and unclean a band of hungry and livid skeletons falk faced them the possessor of the only firearm on board and the second best manthe carpenterwas lying dead between him and them  he was eaten of course i said  he bent his head slowly shuddered a little drawing his hands over his face and said i had never any quarrel with that man but there were our lives between him and me  why continue the story of that ship that story before which with its freshwater pump like a spring of death its man with the weapon the sea ruled by iron necessity its spectral band swayed by terror and hope its mute and unhearing heaventhe fable of the flying dutchman with its convention of crime and its sentimental retribution fades like a graceful wreath like a wisp of white mist what is there to say that every one of us cannot guess for himself i believe falk began by going through the ship revolver in hand to annex all the matches those starving wretches had plenty of matches he had no mind to have the ship set on fire under his feet either from hate or from despair he lived in the open camping on the bridge commanding all the after deck and the only approach to the pump he lived some of the others lived tooconcealed anxious coming out one by one from their hidingplaces at the seductive sound of a shot and he was not selfish they shared but only three of them all were alive when a whaler returning from her cruising ground nearly ran over the waterlogged hull of the borgmester dahl which it seems in the end had in some way sprung a leak in both her holds but being loaded with deals could not sink  they all died falk said these three too afterwards but i would not die all died all under this terrible misfortune but was i too to throw away my life could i tell me captain i was alone there quite alone just like the others each man was alone was i to give up my revolver who to or was i to throw it into the sea what would have been the good only the best man would survive it was a great terrible and cruel misfortune  he had survived i saw him before me as though preserved for a witness to the mighty truth of an unerring and eternal principle great beads of perspiration stood on his forehead and suddenly it struck the table with a heavy blow as he fell forward throwing his hands out  and this is worse he cried this is a worse pain this is more terrible  he made my heart thump with the profound conviction of his cries and after he had left me alone i called up before my mental eye the image of the girl weeping silently abundantly patiently and as if irresistibly i thought of her tawny hair i thought how if unplaited it would have covered her all round as low as the hips like the hair of a siren and she had bewitched him fancy a man who would guard his own life with the inflexibility of a pitiless and immovable fate being brought to lament that once a crowbar had missed his skull the sirens sing and lure to death but this one had been weeping silently as if for the pity of his life she was the tender and voiceless siren of this appalling navigator he evidently wanted to live his whole conception of life nothing else would do and she too was a servant of that life that in the midst of death cries aloud to our senses she was eminently fitted to interpret for him its feminine side and in her own way and with her own profusion of sensuous charms she also seemed to illustrate the eternal truth of an unerring principle i dont know though what sort of principle hermann illustrated when he turned up early on board my ship with a most perplexed air it struck me however that he too would do his best to survive he seemed greatly calmed on the subject of falk but still very full of it  what is it you said i was last night you know he asked after some preliminary talk tootooi dont know a very funny word  squeamish i suggested  yes what does it mean  that you exaggerate thingsto yourself without inquiry and so on  he seemed to turn it over in his mind we went on talking this falk was the plague of his life upsetting everybody like this mrs hermann was unwell rather this morning his niece was crying still there was nobody to look after the children he struck his umbrella on the deck she would be like that for months fancy carrying all the way home second class a perfectly useless girl who is crying all the time it was bad for lena too he observed but on what grounds i could not guess perhaps of the bad example that child was already sorrowing and crying enough over the rag doll nicholas was really the least sentimental person of the family  why does she weep i asked  from pity cried hermann  it was impossible to make out women mrs hermann was the only one he pretended to understand she was very very upset and doubtful  doubtful about what i asked  he averted his eyes and did not answer this it was impossible to make them out for instance his niece was weeping for falk now he hermann would like to wring his neckbut then he supposed he had too tender a heart frankly he asked at last what do you think of what we heard last night captain  in all these tales i observed there is always a good deal of exaggeration  and not letting him recover from his surprise i assured him that i knew all the details he begged me not to repeat them his heart was too tender they made him feel unwell then looking at his feet and speaking very slowly he supposed that he need not see much of them after they were married for indeed he could not bear the sight of falk on the other hand it was ridiculous to take home a girl with her head turned a girl that weeps all the time and is of no help to her aunt  now you will be able to do with one cabin only on your passage home i said  yes i had thought of that he said brightly almost yes himself his wife four childrenone cabin might do whereas if his niece went  and what does mrs hermann say to it i inquired  mrs hermann did not know whether a man of that sort could make a girl happyshe had been greatly deceived in captain falk she had been very upset last night  those good people did not seem to be able to retain an impression for a whole twelve hours i assured him on my own personal knowledge that falk possessed in himself all the qualities to make his nieces future prosperous he said he was glad to hear this and that he would tell his wife then the object of the visit came out he wished me to help him to resume relations with falk his niece he said had expressed the hope i would do so in my kindness he was evidently anxious that i should for though he seemed to have forgotten ninetenths of his last nights opinions and the whole of his indignation yet he evidently feared to be sent to the rightabout you told me he was very much in love he concluded slyly and leered in a sort of bucolic way  as soon as he had left my ship i called falk on board by signalthe tug still lying at the anchorage he took the news with calm gravity as though he had all along expected the stars to fight for him in their courses  i saw them once more together and only onceon the quarterdeck of the diana hermann sat smoking with a shirtsleeved elbow hooked over the back of his chair mrs hermann was sewing alone as falk stepped over the gangway hermanns niece with a slight swish of the skirt and a swift friendly nod to me glided past my chair  they met in sunshine abreast of the mainmast he held her hands and looked down at them and she looked up at him with her candid and unseeing glance it seemed to me they had come together as if attracted drawn and guided to each other by a mysterious influence they were a complete couple in her grey frock palpitating with life generous of form olympian and simple she was indeed the siren to fascinate that dark navigator this ruthless lover of the five senses from afar i seemed to feel the masculine strength with which he grasped those hands she had extended to him with a womanly swiftness lena a little pale nursing her beloved lump of dirty rags ran towards her big friend and then in the drowsy silence of the good old ship mrs hermanns voice rang out so changed that it made me spin round in my chair to see what was the matter  lena come here she screamed and this goodnatured matron gave me a wavering glance dark and full of fearsome distrust the child ran back surprised to her knee but the two standing before each other in sunlight with clasped hands had heard nothing had seen nothing and no one three feet away from them in the shade a seaman sat on a spar very busy splicing a strop and dipping his fingers into a tarpot as if utterly unaware of their existence  when i returned in command of another ship some five years afterwards mr and mrs falk had left the place i should not wonder if schombergs tongue had succeeded at last in scaring falk away for good and indubitably there was a tale still going about the town of a certain falk owner of a tug who had won his wife at cards from the captain of an english ship   the end
