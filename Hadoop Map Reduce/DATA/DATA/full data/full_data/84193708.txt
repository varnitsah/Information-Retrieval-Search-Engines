 preface to the revised edition   the last cruise of the spitfire is the opening volume of the ship and shore series and tells of the things which happened to a boy who ran away from his guardians home because he could no longer stand the cruel treatment received  in this tale in order to get close to the heart of the boy the author has allowed luke foster to tell his own story in his own way luke has never before been to sea and when he is carried off on the spitfire his real experiences on the briny ocean set up in juxtaposition to what he had imagined a life on the rolling deep to be make reading which i trust every lad who has a hankering after a sailors life may digest with profit luke concludes that a life on land is good enough for him and i feel certain that a majority of our readers will agree with him  of lukes overbearing cousin and his dishonest uncle much might be said which luke leaves untold the boy does this probably out of his natural goodheartedness yet the lives of the pair and especially that of the father well illustrate the old saying that sooner or later every wrongdoer is bound to overreach himself and fall into the hands of justice  upon first appearing in print the last cruise of the spitfire was as well received as the stories in the bound to succeed series which had preceded it and once again the author begs to thank readers and critics for their

splash into the water  down in the hold  on the raft     the last cruise of the spitfire  or luke fosters strange voyage     chapter i  myself and my uncle   luke  yes mr stillwell  why didnt you sweep and dust the office this morning  i did sir  you did  yes sir  you did repeated the gentleman who i may as well state was my esteemed uncle i must say young man that lately you have falsified to an astonishing degree  excuse me but i have not falsifiednot to my knowledge sir  stop dont contradict me  i am telling the truth sir  stop i tell you i will not have it look here and then dare to tell me that this office has seen the touch of a broom or duster this day  and my uncle felix motioned me majestically into his office with one hand while with the other he pointed in bitter scorn at the floor  mr felix stillwell was in a bad humor his sarcastic tones told this quite as well as the sour look upon his face evidently some business matters had gone wrong and he intended to vent the spleen raised thereby upon me he was a highstrung man at the best and when anything went wrong the first person in his way was sure to catch the full benefit of his ire  i was an orphan and had lived with my uncle felix three years previous to that time i was a scholar at the hargrove military and commercial academy a first class trainingschool for boys situated upon the palisades overlooking the hudson river  my father was a retired lawyer who being in ill health went with my mother on a two years trip to europe they journeyed from place to place for sixteen months and then lost their lives in a terrible railway accident in england the death of both my parents at once was a fearful blow to me and for a long while i could not think and was utterly unable to judge what was taking place around me at the end of three months i was informed that mr stillwell had been appointed my guardian and then i was taken from school and placed in his office in new york city  my duties at the office of stillwell grinder  co were varied in the morning i was expected to clean everything as bright as a pin then i went to the postoffice and on a dozen other errands after which i did such writing as was placed in my hands  for this work i was allowed my board clothing and fifty cents a week spending moneynot a large sum but one with which i would have been content had other things been equal  but they were far from being so i lived with my uncle but i was not treated as one of the family his wifei do not care to call her my auntwas a very proud woman who had come from a blueblooded boston family and she hardly deigned to notice me when she did it was in a patronizing manner as if i was a menial far beneath her  my two cousins lillian and augustus were even less civil lillian who was a fashionable miss of seventeen never spoke to me excepting when she wanted something done and gus as every one called him thought it his right to order me around as if i was his valet  in the matter of food and clothing i was scarcely considered any of guss castoff suits were thought good enough for the office and my sunday suit was two years old i had my breakfast with the servants before the others were up took my noon lunch with me and dinner when i returned from the office which was generally two hours after mr stillwell when everything was cold  looking back at those times i often wonder how it was i stood the treatment as long as i did during my parents lives i had had nearly everything that my heart wished and to be thus cut short not only in my bodily wants but also in consideration and affection was hard indeed  to my mind there was no reason why i should be treated as one so far beneath the family my mother had been a gentlewoman and my father a gentleman and i was conceited enough to think that by both breeding and education i was fully the equal of my cousins besides my father had been welltodo and had no doubt left me a fair inheritance  had i had less to do i would have been lonely in a city where i hardly knew a soul but my work kept me so busy i had no time to think of myself and perhaps this is one reason why i did not rebel before i did  in the whole of the metropolis there was but one person whom i considered a friend that was mr ira mason who had his law offices in the same building with stillwell grinder  co i had done a number of errands for this gentleman and in return he had become interested in me  to mr mason i confided my story in all its details and when i had finished he told me that if matters did not mend or got worse to let him know and he would see what could be done for me  my uncle did not like mr mason who on several occasions had had clients who wished to obtain patents and whom he had taken elsewhere the reason given being that stillwell grinder  cos rates were too high though their peculiar methods of getting patents had much to do with it  it was the morning of my seventeenth birthday i had requested my uncle several days previous to give me a holiday which i intended to spend with an old school chum of mine harry banker at his home in locustville a pretty village fifty miles northwest of the city  the banker family and mine had been well acquainted and i had received numerous invitations from them to spend some time at their home a large farm but was each time forced to decline  when i had requested my uncle to let me go for just one day i had thought it would be impossible for him to refuse as it was the middle of july and business was dull i had saved my money for some time determined to be prepared to pay my own way if he should not give me the price of a ticket  my request for a day off was met with a sharp refusal it wasnt necessary there was work to do and besides gus was going to take the day to go to coney island and i must attend to his desk during his absence  i was taken back by the curt negative that i received and was inclined to air my mind i had had no holiday for two years and was clearly entitled to one gus had had a week at christmas and half a dozen days since it was not treating me fairly to pile up the work upon me and give me no breathing spells  what made me feel worse was the fact that i had written to harry telling him of my expectations so that i might find him home and we could have a good time he would surely expect me and it was doubtful if i could get him word in time telling him i could not come  on the evening before i had written him a letter and posted it gus had seen me do so and had made a mean remark concerning the fact that i was to stay at home while he was to have a good time  the remark was entirely uncalled for and it made me angry hot words passed and he was on the point of hitting me when my uncle came in and stopped the row but my cousin was fearfully angry still and vowed to get even with me and i knew he would try his best to do so  on arriving at the offices that morning i was in no bright humor but i knew sulking would accomplish nothing and so set to with a will to clean up as usual this job took fully half an hour and when it was done i crossed over to mr masons office to return a book he had loaned me and also to obtain another from his large library  while in the office i heard footsteps in the hall and looking through the partly closed door had seen gus enter his fathers private office closing the door after him i was on the point of following when i remembered what had passed between us and so waited until some member of the firm might appear  fully five minutes elapsed and then my cousin came out closing the door softly behind him he paused for a moment in the hallway and seeing no one hurried down the stairs and out of the building  i thought nothing more of his movements but continued to look over the books mr mason meanwhile being busy at his desk in a smaller office beyond presently i heard my uncles wellknown step and hurried out meeting him just after he had been in his private office which was behind all the others  dont think that because it is your birthday you can neglect your work he went on in a rising voice this office is to be cleaned thoroughly every morning  i cleaned it thoroughly not half an hour ago i replied stoutly  do you mean to contradict me he cried  im telling the truth was all i could say  does that look like it  the floor certainly did not look like it bits of paper were strewn in all directions and the bottle of ink on the desk had been upset creating a small blueblack river running diagonally over the oilcloth towards the safe that stood beside the window  of course i knew at once who had done all this gus had vowed to get square with me and this was his method of doing so yet i could not help but wonder what the outcome would be  i say does that floor look like it repeated mr stillwell in gathering wrath  i didnt do this uncle felix  you didnt he sneered well who did then we havent any cat to do it  i was on the point of saying it was a twolegged cat but thinking he would not relish the joke replied  i dont know gus was here  my son impossible i left him at home half an hour ago  he was here not ten minutes since i said  i dont believe it besides why should he make a pigpen of the office answer me that stormed uncle felix  because he knew i had just cleaned it up and he wanted to get even with me for that row we had yesterday  a likely story i must say as if augustus wasnt beyond such childishness you did this yourself i want you to clean it up at once  i didnt do i began  not another word clean it up i say  my uncle was in such a savage humor i knew it would be useless for me to attempt to reason with him so getting a sponge and some water i began to clean up the muss on the desk i had hardly cleaned the writingpad when my uncle stopped me  if you are going to take all day do the job when you come back from the postoffice i want some letters to go in the nine oclock mail here they are  he shoved the letters into my hand  now dont get them all dirty he cried or ill crack you over the head be off with you  in a moment i was on my way to the postoffice three blocks distant     chapter ii  an unexpected letter   as i walked along the street i could not help but ponder over the way i had been treated my uncles manner towards me was getting harsher every day if it kept up in this fashion soon the time would come when human nature could stand it no longer  and what was i to do then several times i had asked myself that question without being able to come to a satisfactory answer it was easy enough to think of running away and so forth but this was just the thing i did not wish to do my uncle was my guardian and he was bound to support me to be sure the support he gave me was merely a nominal one but i was not versed in law and was afraid if i went off he might keep my inheritance from me i did not know how much money my father had left but what there was i wanted to come to me  guss actions puzzled me if he was bound for a day to coney island what had brought him to the office at such an early hour of the morning i knew that he disliked early rising and was pretty well satisfied that even the delight of paying me off would not have induced him to leave his soft bed  arriving at the postoffice i posted mr stillwells letters and then opened the box containing the letters for the firm there were quite a handful and i looked at the addresses to see that no mistakes had been made  in an instant one of them attracted my attention  it was directed as follows      mr luke foster      care of stillwell grinder  co      patent agents      new york city   the letter was addressed to me and as it was the first foreign epistle i had received since my parents death i looked at it with considerable curiosity it was postmarked london and the handwriting was cramped and heavy  tearing the letter open i was still more astonished to read the following lines       mr luke foster       dear sir       of course you will be astonished to receive this i being a      stranger to you but just before his death i became well      acquainted with your father he spending with your mother six      weeks at my country residence in northampton we met six years      ago in new york and traveled from that city to chicago and      from there to st louis so you will see that we became quite      intimate       while stopping at my house your father expressed the fear that      should he die suddenly while on his travels and his wife also      odd indeed when such proved to be the case your future      might be an uncertain one he said he had made a will      appointing his friend john w banker of locustville new york      state to be your guardian but was afraid you might not like      the choice or that this man might not treat you well       never expecting that your fathers end was near i laughingly      replied that i was sure he had done for the best but he shook      his head in doubt and said men were strange and often acted      in a way least expected which is certainly true so i agreed      should anything happen to him to keep an eye on you i have      not done so for the following reason       following close upon your parents death came the demise of my      mother in paris and a week later the failure of a banking      house in south america with which i was closely connected      after the funeral of my mother i took passage for rio de      janeiro and it was about two weeks ago that i set foot in      england since then i have been exceedingly busy straightening      out my affairs and this is the first chance i have had of      addressing you       i trust your fathers choice of a guardian has been a happy      one and that you are doing well if not write me immediately      and i will see what can be done i send this letter in care of      your uncle because i have not had your address i know that he      and your father were not on good terms but i trust you no      longer carry on that quarrel       very truly       your friend       harvey nottington       43 old fellows road  standing by one of the deep windows of the postoffice i read the letter through twice it will be needless for me to state that it impressed me strangely  the most important statement made by the writer was that my father had never intended my uncle to be my guardian i knew of the family quarrel but mr stillwell when he had taken me from the academy had assured me that that was all past and gone and i had been delighted to have it so for it had always pained me to see my mother not on speaking terms with my aunt but apparently my uncle had not told the truth and for reasons of his own  how was it that mr stillwell had been appointed my guardian when my father wished mr banker to act in that capacity this was a question that worried me not a little i liked harrys father very much and was sure he would have treated me with far more consideration than i was now receiving  the perusal of the letter drove all thoughts of the unpleasant scene i had left behind from my mind and i was on the point of going directly to my uncle for an explanation of the case but then came the recollection of mr stillwells manner towards me and i shoved the letter into my pocket resolved to say nothing until i had thought the matter over  i walked back to the office slowly for i was in deep thought for two years my uncle had been my guardian and during that time my life had been little better than a continual hardship the letter brought up the memory of the past and i realized now more than ever how happy the days gone by had been what had brought about the change  clearly the way i was being treated mr stillwell cared nothing for me body or soul indeed at that moment i was inclined to think that he would be as well satisfied to see me dead as alive perhaps if i were dead he would inherit the money left me by my father  this thought had never occurred to me before and i gave it considerable attention when i came to review the whole matter i discovered that in reality i knew very little of my own affairs i had taken many things for granted and my uncles word on all occasions whether this was for the best was still to be seen  i was glad i had not gone on a visit that day had i done so mr stillwell would have received my letter and i do not doubt but that he would have opened it as it was he knew nothing of the communication and i did not intend that he should until i was ready to disclose it to him  by the stamp upon the letter sheet i saw that mr nottington was a solicitor and this made my mind revert to mr ira mason as i have said the lawyer had taken an interest in me and i was sure he would now give me the best advice in his power  i was sorry i could not go to the gentleman at once the letter had fired my curiosity and i wanted to get at the bottom of the affair  but i had already lost time to lose more would raise a storm of anger against me i determined to wait until the noon hour or after my uncle had gone home  the firm of patent lawyers of which my uncle was senior partner was composed of himself mr grinder a short stumpy busybody now away to washington on business and mr canning a young man who had been but recently taken in not so much because he was needed i fancied as because he brought with him plenty of money and a good business connection  mr canning did not come to business until very late as he lived twentyfive miles out of the city in new jersey there were no clerks but gus and myself so when i arrived at the office i found mr stillwell still alone  my uncles face was as dark as a thundercloud when i handed him the letters i made up my mind he was about to lecture me for having taken my time and i braced up to withstand the shower of strong language he would be sure to heap upon me  so young man youve got back at last he exclaimed  yes sir  been rather a long while  to this i made no reply what was there to say  its a wonder you came back at all he went on to be honest i never expected to see you again  im sorry i cant please you uncle felix  dont uncle felix me he cried savagely after your dirty work today i dont want to be any relation to you  this was certainly putting it rather strongly  whether you believe it or not i didnt muss up the office i said firmly gus did that  i left gus at home he cried even more emphatically than before and i could see that he was really angry because of my having dragged his sons name into the dispute  gus was here and left just before you came  i dont believe it  all the same it is true  its only a story to pass your crimes off on my son but it wont wash luke it wont wash  i made no further reply seeing it was useless to try to reason with him but hung up my hat and turned my attention to cleaning up the floor     chapter iii  somebodys crime   while engaged in tidying up the office i noticed for the first time that the door of the safe stood open this was a most unusual thing and i wondered if my uncle had taken something out and forgotten to close it he was a very careful man and if he had it was the first time i had known him to do such a thing  the safe door is open i said mildly as he moved as if to leave the office  have you just found that out he sneered and then i saw that he had gone over to the door of the office only to close it  was it open before i asked in some alarm  he looked at me for a moment in silence the cloud upon his brow deepening  luke you are a mighty cool one for a boy but ive got you fast so you might as well give in he said finally come now i want no nonsense  this unexpected speech only bewildered me  i dont understand you uncle felix  how many times must i tell you that i am no longer your uncle he stormed from this time i am done with you  what have i done  what have you done what havent you done ruined your good name forever  i didnt muss up  oh pshaw give the floor and the office a rest i want you to own up without further words  by this time i was more bewildered than ever what in the world was my uncle driving at  what do you want me to own up to i asked  you know well enough  no i dont  yes you do  i dont  ill give you five minutes to make a full confession he cried in a perfect rage at the end of that time if you are still obdurate i will hand you over to the police  this was certainly alarming news surely something serious had happened  if you will tell me what the trouble is ill try to answer your question was all i could find to say  again he looked at me in that hard cold manner  i want you to tell me he said with great deliberation i want you to tell me instantly what you have done with the six thousand dollars and the papers that were in the safe  i stood amazed for a moment i hardly realized the meaning of the words that had been spoken  the six thousand dollars that were in the safe i gasped  exactly  i dont know anything about the money i didnt know you had six thousand in the place  yes you did you saw me place it in the safe yesterday afternoon  no sir i did not  you did and you took it out either last night or this morning come tell me what you have done with it or as sure my name is felix stillwell you shall pass the remainder of this day in prison luke i am not to be trifled with  my uncle was fearfully in earnest and his thin hands trembled with excitement when he spoke in spite of the fact that i was a pretty stout young fellow i was glad that though he had closed the door leading to the outer office he had been unable to lock it it might come so far that i would be glad enough to escape from his presence  did you hear me he demanded seeing that i made no immediate reply  i was busy thinking over the strange news he had announced six thousand dollars and some papers missing from the safe whoever had taken them had made a big haul  i could not help but think of gus he was the only one who had been in the office besides myself was it possible the young man had robbed his own father  i was loath to believe that such was the case my cousin a thief it could not be possible and yet if he had not taken the money who had  do you hear me demanded mr stillwell again  i hear you i replied as calmly as i could though i was nearly as excited as he was  what did you do with the money  i dont know anything about the money  my uncle made a threatening gesture  its the truth whether you believe it or not i went on i did not know you had the money and i havent been near the safe  luke foster do you realize that you are staring the state prison in the face  i cant help that i know nothing of your money and thats all there is to it  when did you open the office this morning  quarter to seven  did you clean up at once  yes sir  when you cleaned up was the safe door open  no sir it might have been unlocked but it wasnt open  how long did it take you to clean up  about half an hour  what did you do then  i went to mr masons office to return a book he had loaned me  and then  when i came back i met you i replied promptly  and you mean to say the safe was robbed in the meantime luke you cannot make me believe that  i dont know when the safe was robbed i told you what i did that was all  i dont believe a word of your story you have robbed the safe and you have the money  if you think so you can search me i replied promptly  but even as i spoke i thought of the strange letter i had received what would my uncle say if he saw it it seemed to me i was getting into hot water in more ways than one  i shall search you never fear said mr stillwell but you had better confess it may go easier with you if you do  i cant confess to something im not guilty of i returned and then as i thought of how i had been treated i cried out  you had better look nearer home for the guilty party uncle felix  my reply seemed to anger him beyond all endurance  dont you dare to insinuate my son is a thief he cried you lowbred upstart i have half a mind to hand you over to the police at once  and with his face full of passion uncle felix bore down upon me as if ready to crush me beneath the iron heel of his wrath once and forever     chapter iv  an unexpected arrival   mr stillwells anger had reached a white heat and as he strode towards me i was half inclined to think he intended to take my very life he was naturally a passionate man and the insinuation i had made concerning his son maddened him beyond all endurance  i could readily understand why this was so my uncle felix almost worshiped his son and to have any one insinuate that that son was a thief cut him to the heart i believe he would rather have lost the six thousand dollars greatly as he might have felt the loss than to have imagined that gus was the guilty party  my son a thief he repeated hotly how dare you  gus was the only one in the office besides myself i replied  and that is the reason you lay the crime at his door i dont believe a word you say  i did not expect that he would gus was a favored son while i was but an orphan with no one to stand up for me  are you going to tell me what you have done with the money and the papers he demanded  how can i when i dont know anything of them  you do know  i dont  i hardly had the words out when my uncle grasped me roughly by the coat collar  ill teach you a lesson you young rascal  let go of me uncle felix i cried let go or illill  what will you do he sneered  never mind only you may be sorry if you dont  his only reply was to tighten his hand upon my collar in such a way that i was in immediate danger of being strangled  ill choke you to death if you dont tell he cried speak up instantly  i dont know  his hand tightened  will you tell  i did not reply i saw that he meant what he said and i was busy trying to think how to defend myself  when mr stillwell had caught me i had backed up against the desk near me lay a heavy ruler used by mr grinder in preparing designs for patents i picked up the ruler and before my assailant was aware struck him a violent blow upon the wrist  the brass edge of the weapon i had used made a slight cut upon my uncles arm and with a cry more of alarm than pain he dropped his hold of me and turned his attention to the injury  seeing this i quickly placed a large office chair near the door and got behind it in such a manner that i could escape at an instants warning  you young villain do you mean to add murder to your other crimes he howled as he proceeded to bind his handkerchief around his wrist  i mean to fight my own battles i replied i wont let you or any other man choke me to death  you shall suffer for all you have done  im willing to take the consequences i replied as coolly as i could  he continued to glare at me but for a moment made no movement probably because he knew not what to do next i watched him very much as a mouse may watch a cat  come luke you cant keep this up any longer hand over that money and the papers  let me tell you for the last time mr stillwell that i know nothing of either said i if any one has them that person is your son  dont tell me such a yarn  i believe its the truth if not why did gus steal into the office and out again in such a hurry this morning  i dont believe he was here i left him in his room at home  are you sure he was in his room  yes for i called him and he answered back  nevertheless he was here and maybe i can prove it  my uncle bit his lip he did not relish my last remark  and even if he was here he did not know the combination of the safe  neither did i  but you could have found it out you had plenty of chances  no more chances than gus had  pooh dont tell me that  its the truth  my son is not on a level with you  i always considered myself as good as he is i returned warmly  my son is not a thief  neither am i uncle felix and what is more i wont let you or any other man say so i declared  what are you going to do about it he asked curiously  i wont stand it thats all  do you know that i intend to have you arrested if you dont return what you have stolen  if you have me arrested i will do all i can to defend myself was my answer if i am brought before the judge perhaps i will have one or two things to say that you will not relish  what do you mean  there will be time enough to speak when i am brought into court  you think you are smart luke but you are nothing but a fool what can you say against me  a good many things that you dont dream of you are not treating me rightly and you know it you dont give me decent clothing to wear and i have to work harder than any one in the office i am sure my father never intended such a future for his son  i dont care what you father intended he snarled  but i do and what is more i intend sooner or later to try to have matters mended my father always told me he wished me to keep on going to school and then to enter princeton  never mind i am your guardian now and i know what is best for you  how much money did my father leave me i asked with considerable curiosity  none of your business  oh but it is my business  it is not your business and i want you to shut up he cried in a rage he left little enough  little enough i cried my father was rich  he was at one time but he lost the most of his fortune in stocks just before he died you have hardly enough to keep you until you are twentyone  i must confess that my uncles remarks were quite a shock to me i had always supposed that i would some day be wealthy i gave the matter a moments thought and then came to the conclusion that mr stillwell was not telling the truth  how much money did my father leave i repeated i am entitled to know  you will know when i get ready to tell you not before  perhaps you are mistaken said i and another thing uncle felix how is it that you were appointed my guardian  at these words i fancied my uncle turned pale he sprang towards me then stopped short  what do you mean by that question he demanded  i mean why were you made my guardian when my father and you were not on good terms  pooh that quarrel was of no consequence was the lofty reply your father could not find a better person in which to trust his sons care  i had my own opinion on that point but did not find it fit to say so then i put in what i thought was a master stroke  i thought mr banker was to be my guardian  at these words mr stillwell turned even paler than before and his hand trembled as he pointed his long finger at me in a threatening manner  you think too much he growled  are you going to answer that question  what put it into your head  never mind  has john banker been writing to you about it  in spite of his effort to ask the question unconcernedly i could see that my uncle was tremendously interested like a flash it came over me that perhaps this was one of the reasons he did not wish me to spend any time at harry bankers home mr banker might take it into his head to ask me how i was being treated and that might lead to trouble  never mind but im going to find out before long  and you are going to prison before long unless you hand over what you took from the safe  i am not afraid of you mr stillwell i have always done right but im going to know something about myself and soon i have a letter in my pocket that tells me that mr banker was to be my guardian and im going to know why he is not  mr stillwell glared at me if he could have eaten me up i believe he would have done so  you have a letter he cried hoarsely who from  that is my business  and ill make it mine hand it over this instant  not much  i say you will  and i say no  i was sorry i had spoken of the letter i could readily see that it had worked mr stillwell up to a fever heat  give me that letter luke ill stand no more fooling  once more my uncle bore down upon me but i saw him coming and shoved the chair in his way  i still held the ruler in my hand and now brandished it over my head  dont come any closer i cried if you do ill crack you on the head  my uncle was too enraged to pay attention to my words he hurled the chair aside and sprang upon me as a wild beast springs upon its prey  well see who is master he panted  in another instant he had me by the throat his grasp was that of a band of steel and i thought for a surety my last hour had come  letlet go i gasped  will you give me the letter  my only reply was to struggle with all my strength in a moment we were both on the floor  help help i cried  shut up he exclaimed and tried to close my mouth with his hand  i wont shut up let me up help  but now my voice was fainter it was all i could do to get my breath the room swam round and round before my eyes  give up that letter and the money and papers you took  help help  i could cry no longer my senses were fast leaving me would no one come to my assistance  well see who is master if you dont give  my uncle did not finish his speech for at that instant the door was flung open and a tall powerful man stood in the doorway  here let up there he commanded what are you doing stillwell whos that on the floor great buckwheat if it aint luke foster  i listened in amazement as well as delight the newcomer was mr john banker     chapter v  an appalling prospect   never was an arrival more opportune than when mr john banker stepped into the private office i fully believe had he come a moment later he would have found me insensible as it was it took me several seconds to recover my breath  john banker ejaculated my uncle and every line of his features told of his discomfiture  what are you doing with luke went on harrys father let him up  none of your business growled my uncle  i think it is luke get up  by this time i had somewhat recovered and i was not slow to obey the command i arose to my feet and took my place beside my newlyarrived friend  whats it all about went on mr banker turning to me  he says i robbed the safe of six thousand dollars i replied  and so he did put in my uncle glad to be able to speak a word for himself  six thousand dollars ejaculated mr banker phew but thats a large sum  i know nothing of the money i went on but i think his son took it and i just told him so and that made him mad  my son is no thief stormed mr stillwell  and neither is robert fosters son i reckon returned my friend ive knowed luke all my life and hes as straightforward a lad as one wants to meet theres some mistake mr stillwell  no mistake at all and unless the boy gives up what he took he shall go to prison  no no dont be too harsh cried mr banker remember he is your nephew  he is no longer any relation of mine ive cast him off  you have have you asked my friend curiously  yes i have  maybe you havent any right to do it went on mr banker youve got his money in trust  precious little of it  yes i reckon robert foster left quite a pile  no such thing  he was worth fifty or sixty thousand dollars  fifty or sixty thousand dollars howled mr stillwell it isnt quarter of that sum he left five thousand dollars and thats all  nonsense stillwell he left more  who knows best you or i  never mind you cant make me believe lukes father wasnt better off than that  my uncle pursed up his lips  but that isnt here nor there he said luke has taken the money and hes got to go to prison  a look of pain crossed mr bankers face he and my father had been warm friends and i well knew that he would do all in his power for me  he wont go to prison if i can help it he said luke tell me the whole story  despite the numerous interruptions from my uncle i related the particulars of the case mr banker listened with close attention  that sounds like a straight story he said when i had concluded i cant see but what your son is just as much under suspicion as luke stillwell  you dont know anything about it banker and the less you have to do with the matter the better off you will be  im going to see luke through  what brought you here  i came to take him along with me if he hadnt gone yet harry said he expected him up to spend the day or maybe a week and i happened to be in the city since yesterday  he wouldnt leave me off i put in he hasnt let me have a holiday since ive been here  humph seems to me youre rather hard on the lad stillwell in more ways than one  its none of your business you had better leave us alone  as ive said before i intend to see luke through dont be alarmed my lad if youve done right all will go well with you  thank you mr banker i need a friend mr stillwell doesnt give me half a show  you shall have all the show you need after this luke  my uncle was in a rage but he did not know what to do now that i had some one to stand by me i no longer felt the alarm i had when alone  for the last time are you going to give up the money asked mr stillwell  ive already answered that question was my reply  then you shall go to prison come along with me  he made a movement as if to take me by the arm but mr banker stopped him  not so fast stillwell where do you intend to take him  to the station house where he belongs  this alarmed me  can he do it i asked i didnt take the money  mr bankers face clouded  i am afraid he can but dont be alarmed i will stand by you  but the prospect before me of spending even a short while in one of the city station houses previous to an examination was not a pleasant one i had known one young clerk who had done so and was ever afterwards spoken of as having been to prison under suspicion  i wont go to prison i cried he has no right to send me why doesnt he send gus too  you come along said my uncle sternly didnt i tell you we would find out who was master  he took hold of my arm as he did so mr canning came bustling in  hello whats up he exclaimed  my uncle told his story the new partner listened incredulously  i can hardly believe it possible he exclaimed yet many things are queer here he added with a peculiar look that made my uncle wince  and im going to make an example of him went on my uncle take charge of the office while i take the young rascal down to the police station  i will take charge of the office but dont act hastily replied mr canning  now come along went on mr stillwell to me and beware how you conduct yourself  i shall go along said mr banker  taking me by the arm my uncle led the way down the stairs mr banker was close at my side     chapter vi  a turn of fortune   it was now almost nine oclock and nassau street where the patent offices of stillwell grinder  co were situated was crowded with people my uncle made such a show of what he was doing that it was not long before quite a crowd was following us all anxious to know what had happened  there is no use of your making such a show of the poor boy said mr banker you act as if he had murdered some one  mind your own business snarled mr stillwell  mr banker was an upright farmer and there was little of natural meekness in his nature he resented my uncles speech and quite an altercation took place  while the two were talking i was doing some hard thinking the idea of going to prison became every moment more odious to me i could fancy myself in a dark damp cell surrounded by criminals of every degree awaiting a hearing what would my friends think and if the affair once got into the newspapers my good name would be gone forever  the more i thought of the matter the more determined i became that i would not go to prison suppose i ran away  no sooner had this foolish thought entered my mind than i prepared to act upon it we were now on the corner of fulton street and to cross here was all but impossible my uncle and mr banker were still in hot dispute and for an instant neither of them noticed me  goodbye mr banker im off i cried out suddenly  and the next moment i had torn myself loose from my uncles grasp and was dashing down fulton street at the top of my speed  hi come back called out mr banker after me but i paid no heed  stop him stop him yelled my uncle stop the thief  his last words set the street in commotion the cry of stop the thief resounded on all sides and soon it seemed to me that i was being followed by at least half a hundred men and boys all eager to stop me in hopes of a possible reward  but now that i had once started i made up my mind not to be captured i was a good block ahead and by skillful turning i gradually managed to increase the distance  i was headed for the east river and it was not long before i came in sight of the docks and the ferry slips at one of the slips stood a ferryboat just preparing to leave for brooklyn  the sight of the boat gave me a sudden thought i dashed into the ferryhouse paid the ferry fare and in a moment was on board just as the boat left the slip  it had been a long and hard run but at last i was safe from being followed once in brooklyn there would be a hundred places for me to go in case of necessity  wiping the perspiration from my face i made my way to the forward deck but few people were on board and quite undisturbed i leaned against the railing to review the situation  what should i do next was the question that arose to my mind and i found no little difficulty in answering it i was half inclined to think that i had acted very foolishly in running away now every one would surely believe me guilty and if i was caught it would go hard indeed with me  had i better go back for one brief instant i thought such a course would be best then came the vision of the cell and i shuddered and resolved now i had undertaken to escape to continue as i had begun whether i was wise or not i will leave my readers to determine after my story is concluded  it was not long before the boat bumped into the slip on the opposite shore the shock brought me to a recollection of the present and in company with the other passengers i went ashore i had something of a notion that a policeman would be in waiting for me but none appeared and i passed out to the street unaccosted  i had been to brooklyn several times on errands for the firm so i knew the streets quite well but fearful of being seen i passed close to the wharves and finally came to a lumber yard and here i sat down  it was a hot day and it was not long before i was forced to seek the shade close at hand was a shed and this i took the liberty of entering  it was a rough place used for the seasoning of the better class of wood i found a seat on some ends of planking in a cool corner quite out of the line of observation of those who were passing  here i sat for full an hour nothing seemed to be going on in the lumber yard and no one came to disturb me  but at last came voices and then two rough looking men approached i was about to make my presence known but their appearance was such that i remained silent and they took seats close to the spot where i was  and the captain is sure that she is fully insured asked the taller of the two  trust captain hannock to cover himself well laughed the other you can bet he has her screwed up to the top notch  and what is this cargo insured for  mcneil didnt say not much less than a hundred thousand i guess of course youll go crocker  yaas replied the man addressed as crocker somewhat slowly i cant pick up a thousand dollars any easier than that  i thought i had struck you right are you ready to sail  anytime you say lowell i owe two weeks board now and mammy brown hinted last night id better pay up or seek other quarters  and crocker gave a short hard laugh  then meet me at the grapevine in an hour said the man called lowell ive got to make a few other arrangements before we start  right you are  and remember not a word  luff there as if i didnt understand the soundings  all right come and have one  the two men arose at once and headed for a saloon that stood upon the near corner  i arose also and watched them out of sight the conversation that they had held had not been a very lucid one yet i was certain they were up to no good one of them had spoken of making a thousand dollars in an easy manner and i was positive that meant the money was to be gained dishonestly  what was i to do i was no detective to follow the men and i was just at present on far from good terms with the police it seemed a pity to let the matter rest where it stood but for the present i did not feel inclined to investigate it i would keep my eyes open and if anything more turned up or was noted in the papers i would tell all i had heard  i wandered along the docks piled high with merchandise of all descriptions beyond a number of stately vessels rested at anchor large and small among which the steam tugs were industriously puffing and blowing on the lookout for a job  the sight was a novel one to me and soon i walked out upon the end of a dock to get a better view  hi there no loafing on this pier called a burly watchman and i lost no time in moving on  presently i came to a wharf that seemed to be more public and walked out to one side of it here it was shady and close at hand floated a large rowboat  the craft was deserted wishing to observe the scene without being noticed i leaped into her there was a cushion on the stern seat and on this i sat down  the breeze and the gentle motion of the boat were delightful and for a moment i thought how pleasant a life on the ocean must be alas little did i realize what was in store for me on the boundless deep  as i sat on the soft cushion i could not help but speculate on all that had transpired within the last few hours early in the morning my mind had been free from care that was anyway deep now i was a fugitive not knowing which way to turn or what to do  but i was not disheartened i was healthy and strong and i felt confident that i could work my way in the world but i was worried about clearing my fair name of the suspicion uncle felix had cast upon it i must do that at any and all costs  presently a footstep sounded above me on the dock and a welldressed young man appeared  hullo there he cried on catching sight of me  hullo i replied shortly i was not in a talkative humor and wished him to know it  what are you doing down there he went on rather sharply  nothing much  do you know that that is my boat  no i didnt know it i returned and then jumped to my feet excuse me but i havent hurt anything  but what are you doing there  only resting ive walked a good bit today and i am tired ill go if you want to use the boat  oh no thats all right i dont want the boat for a couple of hours yet you may stay where you are  thank you  he was about to turn away but a sudden thought seemed to come into his mind  you say you have walked a good bit today he asked curiously  thats it  you are not out of work and on the tramp are you  something like that i replied im out of work and as i cant pay to journey around ill have to walk  i see well i hope you strike something before long its not pleasant to be out of work and money  the young man nodded pleasantly and walked away i must confess i gazed after him longingly i warmly appreciated the few kind words he had given me  as i turned back to sit down once more i heard two men get up from behind a number of packingcases on the pier and walk away i had not noticed them before and i wondered if they had overheard the conversation which had taken place  it was rather warm in the boat and the rocking motion caused by the waves soon put me in a drowsy mood my time was my own and i felt in no humor to move away i allowed my head to fall back and almost before i knew it i had dropped into a light doze  my wakening was a rude one the rowboat gave a violent lurch nearly precipitating me into the water i tried to scramble to my feet but some one with a big bag pushed me back  here what does this mean i began indignantly  shut up come back in hurried tones  then the bag was pulled over my head and arms and in five seconds i found myself a prisoner and hardly able to move hands or feet  i tried to cry out and to ask questions but could not the bag was thick and being tied around my neck almost took away my breath  for the first instant i was afraid that the police from new york had found me but i as quickly gave up this idea they would never treat me in this strange fashion i felt certain but who were my strange assailants and what did they intend to do with me  i felt myself lifted out of the boat and into another craft then i was thrown on my back and something that felt like a piece of canvas was spread over me  the boat with me and my captors moved off and kept moving for perhaps ten minutes or quarter of an hour i tried to struggle to my feet but strung hands held me down  better keep still i heard a voice cry you cant escape no matter how hard you try  when the boat finally came to a standstill i was nearly suffocated for the want of fresh air and i wondered if i had not been chloroformed when first assaulted i was hoisted up by several men and placed upon my feet and then the cords which bound me were cut and the bag was removed  i looked around with a start i was on shipboard with the great ocean all around me  down with him shouted a voice behind me  before i could turn to face the speaker a big black hole loomed up in front of me and i was tumbled down into utter darkness the hatch above was closed and i was left a prisoner     chapter vii  on board the spitfire   as i have said i was tumbled into the black hole and the hatch was closed over me luckily i fell upon a pile of loose sailing so my fall was broken and did me no harm  but i was so completely bewildered by what had taken place that for a moment i did not know what had happened then i gradually became wide awake and realized that i had been entrapped on board the vessel which was probably short of sailors  i had read of men who were thus pressed into the service but never dreamed that such a thing could occur so close to the great metropolis and in broad daylight  who my captors were or where they were taking me was a mystery for an instant i thought the affair might be my uncles work but soon dismissed that idea as being too dimenovelish altogether  with some difficulty i rose to my feet but the motion of the vessel as the sailors got her under way was too strong for me and i was forced to lie down  the place was intensely dark and even after my eyes became accustomed to the blackness i could see little or nothing on all sides not a light was to be seen and overhead only a single streak of brightness around the hatch was visible i was indeed a prisoner and must make the best of it  i crawled about the hold for quite a while feeling everywhere for a place to escape but none came to hand meanwhile i heard the creaking of the blocks as the sails were being hoisted and the tramp of the sailors as they hurried around obeying orders i could hear the murmur of voices but try my best could not make out a word of what was being said  presently by the motion beneath me i knew we were fully under way the cargo below me groaned as it shifted an inch or two this way and that and for an instant i was alarmed lest a case of goods should by some chance break loose and crush me but nothing of the kind happened and after a while all became comparatively quiet  i knew not what time of the day it was but judged it must be about the middle of the afternoon how much longer would my captivity last  if i could have found something with which to do so i would have climbed up to the hatch or shoved it open but nothing was at hand and the opening was fully five feet above my head  the air in the hold was stifling and soon i breathed with difficulty i longed for a drink of water and wondered how long i could stand being in the place should those on deck forget i was there  but those on deck had not forgotten me as i soon saw presently the hatch was raised letting in a flood of sunshine and then a mans head was bent low  below there he called out  let me out i replied  will you be easy if we do he went on  that all depends why was i brought on board  because you belong here  belong here i ejaculated i dont belong to this vessel  well thats what i was told i dont know anything about it myself here catch the rope and ill haul you up  as the sailor spoke he lowered a piece of heavy rope thinking anything would be better than remaining in the hold i complied with his request and a moment later stood upon the deck of the vessel  as i came up a man whom i took to be the captain came towards me he was a tall lank individual with a red beard and hair the look on his face was a sour one and it was easy to see that he was not of a kindly nature  hello my hearty he exclaimed so youre up at last had quite a nap didnt you  why was i brought on this ship i demanded  why was you brought on board well now thats a mighty good one smash the toplight if it isnt  you have no right to bring me on board i went on and i want you to put me ashore at once  the captain gave a scowl  see here youngster i dont allow any one on board to speak to me in that fashion youve got to keep a civil tongue in your head  why was i brought on board  because you belong here  i dont belong here  oh yes you do  id like to know why i never saw or heard of this vessel before  come now thats a good one didnt you sign papers with lowell yesterday morning  this question astonished me in more ways than one first because i had not signed papers with any one and second because lowell was the name of one of the men i had overheard talking in the lumber shed in the morning was it possible i had been kidnapped upon the same ship the two had been discussing  i dont know what you mean i replied i dont know lowell and never signed any papers  nonsense lowell  aye aye sir  and the same man i had seen upon the dock in brooklyn came forward  isnt this luke foster that signed with you yesterday  aye captain  i was more astonished than ever how had they come to know my name  so you see there is no mistake went on the captain turning to me now i want you to go forward with lowell hell show you the ropes come step lively we allow no skulking on board the spitfire youve signed articles and youve got to abide by the deed  i didnt sign any articles and if he says so he lies i burst out in deep anger at the way i was being treated it is true my name is luke foster but how you came by it i dont know  well youre on the book and thats all there is to it perhaps you were drunk when you signed but i have nothing to do with that  i dont drink i replied and such was and is a fact this is all a putup job  hold your tongue cried the captain hold your tongue or ill crack your head open with a marlinspike i dont allow any one to talk back to me lowell take him forward  come along said the sailor if the old man gets his dander up it will be all day with you he added in a whisper  for a moment i stood irresolute i had a momentary idea of jumping overboard and swimming for liberty but land could be seen fully a good halfmile away and no vessels of consequence were near so i was forced to give such a course up  i walked forward but my mind was in a whirl never before had i been so completely taken in surely this was escaping from the law with a vengeance  who owns this boat i asked as we reached the forecastle  captain hannock shes just as good a twomasted schooner as sails is the spitfire so you have no reason to complain  where are we bound  on an eight months cruise up the down east coast and then to england  an eight months cruise what a time to stay on shipboard but perhaps i might escape before the end of the period  whats the first landing  new bedford  that was not so bad if i could leave the vessel at that place i could easily find my way up to boston and a sojourn in that city would just suit me all trace of my going there would be lost and it was not likely that my uncle would look for me so far from new york  heres your bunk and heres some old clothes to put on went on lowell as he pointed the things out you had better save your good clothes for shore knocking around the ship will wear them out in no time  what am i to do on board i asked as i surveyed the greasy shirt and trousers with some dismay  learn to do your duty as a foremast hand if you obey orders and dont kick up any muss youll have a firstclass time of it was his reply  i was somewhat doubtful of the truth of this statement but as nothing was to be gained by refuting it i bit my lips and said nothing  you can take your time about changing your clothes went on lowell there aint much to do at present when it storms is the time all hands work lively for their own sake as much as for the sake of any one else when youre in working rig come to the bow and ill give you a pointer or two about how to tackle things  with these words the boatswainfor such lowell wasleft me to myself     chapter viii  phil jones   i found the forecastle of the spitfire a dark and rather unwholesome place the ventilation was bad and the smell of tar and oakum was so strong that for a moment i had to turn away to catch my breath  luckily my bunk was close to the doorway so i had the best light the place afforded close to me was a chest and upon this i sat down to think  it would be hard to express my feelings at this moment had i gone on board the spitfire of my own will i would not have considered the matter as bad true i had no great fancy for a life on the ocean wave such as most boys are supposed to cherish i knew that at best it was little better than a dogs existence  hello there  i looked up a boy several years younger than myself stood near me he was thin and pale and his eyes had a frightened look  who are you i asked  im polly jones he replied  polly jones i repeated thats a girls name  taint my right name they used to call me phil at home but the sailors all call me polly here because they say i act like a girl  what do you do on board i asked with some curiosity  im the cabin boy and the cooks help what are you  i dont know what i am yet i didnt come on board of my own free will  you didnt phil joness eyes opened to their widest you dont look like a sailor  come down here said i i want to have a talk with you  the cabin boy gave a sharp look about the deck and then hurried into the forecastle  i dont want captain hannock to see me down here he explained if he did hed thrash the life out of me  is the captain such a hard man  is he just you wait until something goes wrong and youll find out quick enough see here the cabin boy bared his arm and exhibited several bruises that made me shudder he gave me those day before yesterday just because i wasnt spry enough to suit him  he must be a brute i exclaimed he shall not treat me like that i can tell you  id like to see some one stand up against him said phil none of the men dare to do it  what makes you stay on board  i have to captain hannock has charge of me until im twentyone  he is your guardian  yes  he ought to treat you better did you ever try to run away  once while we were at baltimore but lowell caught me and the captain nearly killed me when i got back i could have got away only i had no money  doesnt the captain allow you anything for your services i asked at the same time wondering if i would be paid for what i was called upon to do  not a cent to tell the truth he even takes away what the passengersif we have anygive me  he must be mighty mean said i  if youve any money you had better hide it went on the cabin boy taint safe here  thank you phil ill take your advice ive got four dollars and a half and i dont want to lose it  as i spoke i felt in my pocket to make sure that the amount was still safe  to my chagrin the money was gone  i must confess that i felt quite angry when i discovered that my hardearned savings had been taken from me to be sure four dollars and a half was not a large sum but it had been my entire capital and i had calculated upon doing a great deal with it  whats the matter asked phil jones as he stood by watching me turn my pockets inside out to make sure that there was no mistake  my money is gone i exclaimed i have been robbed  where did you have it  right here in my vest pocket  youre foolish to carry it loose any one could take it from you said the cabin boy with a knowing shake of his head  i didnt take every one for a thief who do you suppose took the money  the captain or lowell hes only boatswain but the two work hand in hand  i had already surmised this from the conversation i had overheard the two were well mated and no doubt the sailor was the captains ready tool on all occasions  what are you going to do about it asked phil curiously  get it back if i can i replied with determination im not going to be fleeced in this manner  youd better let it go said the cabin boy with a grave shake of his head youll only get yourself into trouble and it wont do a bit of good  phil joness advice was good and i would have saved myself considerable trouble by following it  but i was angry and as a consequence did not stop to count the cost  i searched my other pockets and soon learned that everything i had had about my person was gone including the letter from england no doubt it was through this letter that captain hannock had found out my name     chapter ix  up long island sound   the loss of the letter worried me even more than the loss of the money in the exciting events that had transpired since i had received it i had forgotten the writers name and his address i remembered the name was something like noddington and that the address was a number in old fellows road but that was all  this was deeply to be regretted for i had expected to put myself into immediate communication with my fathers friend having any reply addressed to the postoffice of the place i might be then stopping at  but now this scheme could not be carried out to send a letter haphazard would probably do no good  i was so worked up over my discovery that i left the forecastle without taking the trouble to don the clothing lowell had pointed out to me i looked around the deck and seeing the boatswain at the bow hastened towards him  his brow contracted when he saw me  why didnt you put on the suit i gave you he demanded  because i first wanted to speak to you i returned what have you done with my money  your money i havent seen any money he returned coolly  by his manner i could easily tell that his statement was untrue  i had four dollars and a half and some letters in my pockets i went on i want them back  why you goodfornothing landlubber he roared do you mean to say im a thief  well wheres my money  how do i know come do as i ordered you to  and he shook his fist at me savagely  i want my stuff and im going to have it i went on as stoutly as i could  youre going to obey orders thats what youre going to do he cried i take no back talk from any one  if you dont give up that money ill have you arrested as a thief the first time i get the chance was my reply and i meant just what i said  you will will you he roared just wait till i get a ropes end and well see who is boss here  i was somewhat startled at his words but i stood my ground lowell ran to the starboard side of the schooner and presently returned with a stout rope some three feet long  now are you going to do as i told you he asked as he advanced towards me  dont you dare to touch me i cried if you do you will have to take the consequences  dont talk to me he cried just wait till i tan your back for you  he swung the ropes end over his head and brought it down with all force i sprang aside and received the blow squarely on my shoulder had i not done so the rope would have cut my neck deeply  you big coward i cried and the next instant i gave him one strong blow from the shoulder that sent him staggering against the rail  i do not know to this day how i came to deliver that blow as i did perhaps it was that my temper was at its highest and i put all my force into it i was surprised at my own power  but if i was surprised lowell was more so the ropes end fell from his hand and his face took on a sickly green color a number of the sailors who had seen my action gathered around in amazement and one of them winked his eye in a most knowing manner  ill have your life for that yelled lowell as soon as he could recover  dont you come near me i replied  ill flay you alive  no you wont im not used to such treatment and i wont stand it  i stood my ground and for a moment the boatswain did not appear to know what to do next  catch him from behind crocker he said finally addressing the sailor i had seen with him in the lumber shed ill give him a lesson he wont forget as long as he remains on board the spitfire or else my name aint lowell  crocker advanced upon me to do as he had been ordered evidently he did not relish the job for he came on slowly  not to be caught in this manner i sprang aside and retreated rapidly towards the stern of the schooner i did not know anything about the vessel and finally found myself near the cabin and face to face with captain hannock  here whats the row about he demanded  i want lowell to give up the money and letters he took from me i replied and a moment later the boatswain came up  he wont mind orders captain he exclaimed  youve got to mind orders while youre on board foster  well perhaps i will if im treated fairly i replied  youll be treated fair enough never fear if lowell has anything of yours ill get it and keep it for you until you need it now go forward and do as you are told  for a moment i hesitated this was not a very satisfactory settlement but evidently it was the best i could get and so i retired  bully for you said phil jones as he followed me into the forecastle my how you did pitch into him  and ill do it again if he abuses me i returned hotly for i was not yet calmed down over the recent encounter  you look able to went on the cabinboy my dont i wish i was as strong as you  you will be some day phil  phil shook his head  i reckon notleastwise not while i have to live such a dogs life as this on the spitfire say are them your clothes he went on pointing to the articles of wearing apparel lowell had given me  i presume they arefor this trip but i dont fancy them much  and the smell of grease on them was decidedly unpleasant  youll get used to them after a while things on the spitfire aint as clean as they might be although the captain keeps me hustling to keep the cabin tidy can i help you any  before i could decline phils kind offer a dark form appeared at the entrance to the forecastle  hi phil you rat come out of that roared captain hannock savagely what business have you got in there git into the cabin and lively or ill warm you good  phil made a break for the deck as he passed the captain that brute raised his brawny hand and boxed him on the side of the head  take that to teach you a lesson the captain stormed and then he and his victim moved out of sight and hearing  this assault made me madder than ever but i was powerless to assist phil much as i wished to do so i could well understand the bullylike nature of captain hannock and i resolved to be well on my guard against him  after some consideration i put on the suit of ships clothing it fitted fairly well and after i had given the trousers several hitches i felt quite at home in them and then i went on deck     chapter x  a narrow escape   by the time the sun went down we were well out of sight of land here the breeze was even stronger and at last several of the sailors prevailed upon the man at the wheel to send down word to the captain that sail must be shortened  lowell came on deck with the captain and both had been drinking heavily  shorten sail roared the captain not a bit of it if the mast goes let her go  nevertheless the wind soon freshened so much that several of the sails were reefed i watched the performance from the bow  here you why dont you get to work cried lowell savagely as he came forward  i dont know what to do i replied quietly  dont know what to do youre too lazy to do anything get aloft there  where  there  he pointed up to one of the masts i looked in the direction indicated  as i did so he caught me by the waist  ill teach you to hit me he hissed  here hold up i cried in alarm  shut up  he placed one of his brawny hands over my mouth thus endeavoring to silence me but with an effort i cast the hand aside  let me go  ill let you go when im done with you he whispered  he was evidently in a very ugly mood and i saw that he did not intend to treat me with any show of gentleness nevertheless i was hardly prepared for what followed  once again he placed his hand over my mouth and this time in spite of my struggles he managed to keep it there then he gradually forced me close to the rail  in vain i tried to break away from him he exerted all of his strength and being but a boy i was no match for him in another moment he had me hard against the rail  i endeavored to turn my head to see if our struggle was not noticed by some of the others but lowell kept my eyes turned seaward and now he caught me about the arms and the waist  ill fix you he went on with a hiccough ill teach you to hit me  letlet me go i managed to gasp  oh ill let you go he went on sarcastically ill let you go quicker than you expect you imp how do you like that eh  and the next instant he had hurled me bodily over the side i went spinning through the air and then fell with a splash into the waters of long island sound  illustration i went spinning through the air and then fell with a splash into the water  lowells attack had been so unexpected that i hardly had time to realize what was taking place and did nothing to stop the catastrophe  but once in the water i regained my presence of mind i reached the surface as soon as possible and then shouted lustily for help  by this time the spitfire had gone on a considerable distance ahead and as the wind was blowing little short of a gale i was doubtful if my voice could be heard nevertheless i continued to call for assistance and at the same time did all in my power to keep afloat  this would have been an easy matter had i not been weighed down by any clothes but the shirt and trousers i wore were heavy and once soaked with water they felt like lead i tried to get them off and also to unloosen my shoes but as is usual in such cases succeeded in doing neither  at the same time i watched the spitfire and was not a little alarmed to see that the vessel was still forging ahead was it possible that those on board were going to leave me behind  it certainly seemed so and for a few moments i was thoroughly alarmed i was out of sight of land and the darkness of night was fast approaching  as i moved about in an endeavor to rid myself of some of my clothing my arm came in contact with something which proved to be a short spar i grasped it at once and its buoyancy helped greatly to keep me afloat  by this time the spitfire was far ahead and i had about concluded that i had seen the last of her i noticed that some of the sails were lowered and finally that the schooner swung around and began to tack back  it took some time for the old craft to come within hailing distance and once or twice she stopped as if those on board were about to give up the search  but finally she tacked to my right and i raised my voice to the top of its power  help help  for a moment no answer was returned and i repeated the cry  ahoy i see you was the answer  five minutes more and the schooner was alongside a rope was thrown over and thoroughly exhausted i crawled on board  you rascal roared captain hannock thought you could escape that way did you i had half a mind to let you go to davy joness locker  and he shook his fist at me savagely  at these words i was almost too dumfounded to speak did he really imagine i had jumped overboard  what do you mean i gasped i didnt go over on purpose lowell pitched me over  whats that thundered the boatswain thats the biggest whopper i ever heard in my life  its the truth  stuff and nonsense cried the captain lowell seems to worry you altogether too much go forward and dont you try any more such monkey tricks again or ill take the ropes end over you myself  and captain hannock advanced upon me so savagely that i was glad enough to retreat  i went down into the forecastle and here tony dibble a hand managed to hunt me up some dry clothing while i was putting it on the old sailor stood by and presently said  im afraid youre going to have a hard time of it my lad i was thinking lowell pushed you over though he stood by it that you had fallen i saw you just as you reached the water and i flung a stick after you thinking it might keep you afloat  and it did i replied if it hadnt been for that i might have been at the bottom by this time  the old man didnt want to turn back at first when he heard you were overboard went on the old sailor he said it was bad luck  you dont mean to say he would have let me go to the bottom i cried  thats it and me and goller and sampson wouldnt have it and told him so and then he turned back  i shall never forget what you have done for me said i and i never have to this day  with dry clothes on i went on deck with the old sailor lowell did not come near me and i saw nothing of him until the next day     chapter xi  captain hannocks plot   the sky was overcast and dibble said that a storm was brewing  will it be a bad one  i cant say sometimes a little storm outside is a bad one in the sound and then again its just the opposite i remember six years ago sailing from boston to norwalk that we struck a little storm that didnt look like more than a puff of wind and yet when we were done with it we hadnt any maintopmast worth speaking of  i should like to see a real storm i said  the old sailor shook his head  theyre nicer to sit by a good fire and read about than to be in you never know what to expect besides the spitfires best days are over  presently i saw the captain and lowell go below together i was satisfied that they intended to talk matters over especially when a little later crocker was called to join them  if only i could hear what was said both about myself and about the plan to be carried out by hook or by crook i must get within hearing distance  presently phil jones came up the companionway to throw something over the side i immediately approached him  say phil do you want to do me a favor  certainly i do replied the cabin boy readily im always ready to do a favor for any one who stands up before lowell  and phil jones gave a grin  in a few words i told him what i wanted stating that i wished to hear whatever the trio in the cabin had to say about me  tell you what ill do said he ill take you down to the pantry there is a door there that connects with the cabin and by looking through the keyhole you can see all that is going on and hear everything too  this just suited me and under pretext of getting something to eat i went aft with him and was soon within the pantry he had mentioned  it was not a large place and i had some difficulty in turning about in it without knocking down the dishes that it contained but at last i felt that i was in a good position and then after making me promise not to tell who had let me in if i was discovered phil jones closed the door and left me to myself  at first i could see and hear but little but as i grew accustomed to the place i discovered the captain lowell and crocker seated around the cabin table drinking  its going to be a stormy night and no mistake remarked crocker as he helped himself to some more of the liquor that stood on the table  guess youre right said lowell if its bad enough we might let the old tub go down here without going any further  captain hannock shook his head  it wont do he said we want her to sink in deep water where the insurance people cant find her you must remember that a good part of the cargo is bogus and if that was ever found out we wouldnt get a penny  how far do you calculate to sail asked lowell  ive been thinking id better wait till were about three days out from cape cod we can sail a little north of the regular track and so have things all our own way  dont go too far said crocker remember weve got to get back money wont do us any good if we lose our lives on the ocean  dont get chickenhearted cried the captain angrily  i aint chickenhearted replied crocker but whats the use of taking too much risk  i aint going to risk being sent to prison for ten years or more cried captain hannock in a rising voice if you  hush not so loud put in lowell we dont want any of the others to know of whats going on if they did theyd make short work of the three of us  now dont you get afraid lowell reckon your row with that boy has taken the nerve out of you  lowell muttered something under his breath  ill fix him yet he said  dont do it so openly said captain hannock if you do those who see it may get you into trouble  leave me to manage the affair  this last remark was followed by a brief spell of silence what i had heard interested me greatly these three men were plotting the destruction of the spitfire with a view of getting the insurance on the vessel and her cargo how it was to be done i did not know but i surmised that they intended to either sink the vessel or burn her up perhaps they intended to try both  while i was yet thinking over what i had heard and wondering what was to follow there came a loud knock on the cabin door and tony dibble appeared  excuse me captain but the storm is coming up fast from the southeast he said touching his cap  confound you and the storm howled captain hannock  its getting ready for a heavy blow added dibble we all thought we ought to tell you  get to the deck i know my business ill be up when its necessary  yes sir  touching his hat again dibble withdrew the captain brought his fist down on the table with a bang  dibble knows too much he cried i wish we had left him behind  hes a good sailor put in lowell maybe the storm is a bad one  dont croak lowell i know my business  by this time the glasses were empty and the three men filled them up again  i was considerably alarmed by what tony dibble had said i was sure he would not have spoken had there not been good cause if i had not been so interested in what was going on in the cabin i would have gone on deck at once  yet what followed enchained my attention so deeply that i was glad i remained  say lowell did you read the letter you took from the lad asked the captain after he had drained his glass  i glanced over it was the reply i didnt have time to read it through  well theres a surprise in it  what is it asked lowell and eagerly i bent forward to catch what might follow  the boy is felix stillwells nephew  what  it is a fact you could have knocked me down with a feather said the captain how he should come on board the spitfire is the strangest thing i ever heard of  i reckon stillwell would be mightily surprised if he knew his nephew was with us observed lowell  and i reckon youd treated the lad differently if youd known who he was  and captain hannock gave a loud laugh  this bit of conversation puzzled me not a little what did these men know about my uncle could it be possible that he had anything to do with the spitfire  i knew that he occasionally made a venture in lumber from down east on one occasion i knew him to invest several thousand dollars in a raft from maine although whether it paid or not i never found out  i had always believed my uncle straightforward and honest but now since receiving the letter from england my confidence in him was shaken he had not treated me rightly and this being so who knew where his wrongdoing ended  it dont make a bit of difference if he is the presidents son replied lowell savagely i wont allow any boy to square up to me and besides felix stillwell is no great friend of mine  nor of me for the matter of that said the captain but still we must keep on the right side of him remember he has us where the hair is short  when do i get my pay spoke up crocker who was fast becoming the worse for liquor  that will be safe never fear said the captain as he staggered to his feet only remember to keep a mum tongue in your head if any one hears of our plans they may blow us sky high  im all right onlywhat was that  as crocker asked the last question all sprang to their feet in alarm  i could have answered the question with ease my position had become too cramped for me and i had tried to change it in doing so i dislodged several dishes from the rack and they fell with a crash to the pantry floor  some ones spying on us cried the captain lowell see who it is     chapter xii  the storm   i was greatly alarmed at captain hannocks order to lowell to investigate the cause of the crash in the pantry if discovered i knew my punishment would be severe these three men were playing a desperate game and there was no telling what they would do if cornered  oh it was only a few dishes in the closet said lowell as he helped himself to more liquor  it gave me quite a shock declared crocker and he too took another drink  these remarks relieved me somewhat perhaps they would not search the pantry after all but the next words of the captain caused a chill to run down my back  ive lived in this cabin going on sixteen years he said and i never yet knew them dishes to jump themselves down im going to see what it was if its a spy ill string him up mark my words  i was now flat on the pantry floor and to move would cause quite a noise what was i to do it did not become necessary for me to decide the question the elements did it for me  for at that moment the schooner gave a fearful lurch first to the weather side and then over and an instant later there was a tremendous crash on the deck  for a moment the three men stood as if paralyzed then all of them made a bolt for the companionway  somethings gone by the board i heard the captain exclaim and then all of them passed out of hearing  as soon as they were gone i sprang to my feet and passing out of the pantry made my way after them to the deck none of the men saw me and i lost no time in going forward  the storm was now upon us and as tony dibble had reported it was a heavy one the sky was one mass of black angry clouds and the wind blew a perfect gale  the schooner pitched and tossed to such a degree that i had great difficulty in reaching the forward deck where i presently saw my sailor friend hard at work clearing away the remains of the boom of the mainmast which had swung around and snapped off  hello there you are he sang out i was afraid you had gone overboard again  not if i can help it i replied that is unless it becomes necessary  the old mans a fool went on dibble he has no business to sit in the cabin when theres a storm on we might all go to the bottom  will we weather it do you think  we can try replied the old sailor as cheerfully as he could  meanwhile captain hannock was shouting at the top of his voice but the wind was so great that little could be heard excepting such expressions as would have been better unuttered he was now thoroughly awake to the danger that threatened us and did all in his power to make up for the time he had lost  guided by the mate the sailors were already taking in what little sail was still spread in the wind this was no easy matter and some of it was torn to shreds  this storm will cost the captain a neat penny said dibble after the work was done  i dont know if it will or not i replied he doesnt expect to lose anything on this trip  how can he help it  he has a way maybe ill tell you when we are alone  thought the old man acted awfully careless said dibble as he went off  instead of abating the storm increased in violence until i could hardly keep my feet upon the deck at first i thought of retiring to the forecastle but concluded that if anything happened i would rather be on deck and so remained and held on tightly to the ropes  fortunately a few familiar lights from the shore were still to be seen or otherwise we would have been driven upon the rocks but the wheelman kept us in deep water and just enough sail was carried to keep the schooner head up  the storm kept on nearly the entire night and no one on board the spitfire had a moments sleep i remained on deck the entire time and kept close to dibble and the other sailors  i noticed that crocker had little to say and concluded that he was thinking over the scheme by which he was to make a thousand dollars i thought it rather strange that captain hannock and lowell had taken such a man into their confidence but made up my mind that it was necessary in order to do what they desired  as i stood upon the bow of the vessel a sudden flash of light revealed to me a sight that made my heart give a bound it was a wreck not a hundred feet ahead of us and driving onward at a furious rate  for an instant i was spellbound then i gave a wild cry that brought all the sailors to my side  what is it asked dibble anxiously are you hurt  no no didnt you see the wreck ahead  no  thought i saw something said one of the others but i wasnt sure  what kind of a wreck asked the mate peering forward  i pointed in the direction in which it had disappeared  a small sailboat of some kind i returned i didnt seelook look there  as i spoke there was another flash of light for an instant all hands beheld a small sloop with a broken mast kiting before the wind  youre right cried dibble wonder if there is any one on board  cant we hail her i asked  we might try although the wind is pretty strong  both of us cried at the same time and then the mate joined in  boat ahoy  for a moment there was no reply and we repeated the cry  and then came the faint answer  help where are you help  it was a mans voice and by its sound we could tell that he was wellnigh exhausted  what can we do for him i asked anxiously  well be on him in a moment said dibble lets throw him a rope or two  in an instant he had a stout rope ready seeing what he intended to do i also procured a rope  during this time the mate went to the man at the wheel and told him to steer a little to the starboard this brought the schooner somewhat around and gave us a chance to take in the man should he be fortunate enough to grasp one or the other of the ropes  im afraid well lose him in the darkness said dibble  let us do all we can i said thinking how i would feel if placed in a position similar to that occupied by the man on the wreck  help help repeated the unfortunate in lower tones  hes almost done for said the old sailor with a shake of his head  there he is i cried as another flash of light came  sure enough stand to catch the rope  stand to catch the rope i repeated  i will throw it to me came back the cry  in an instant both of us threw our ropes by an unfortunate twist dibbles went spinning from his hands and before he could catch it went over the side  my ropes gone he groaned yours must do the work boy or the man will be lost  i made no reply i had felt the rope in my hands growing tighter  i have the rope came the cry pull in  hes got it i repeated help me land him  dibble readily complied and slowly but surely we drew in on the rope  hurry up called the man i cant hold on much longer  youll be all right in a minute i called back dont let go  dibble took hold of the rope with me and held it up so that the man might have no difficulty in climbing over the rail  presently the unfortunate individual came in sight i could see that he was completely exhausted  give me your hand i said to him and leaned far over the side to reach it  with one remaining effort he threw up his arm at the same time letting the rope slip from his grasp  i caught his hand and held on to it with all my power the mans weight was a tremendous strain on my muscles but fortunately they stood the test and then i began to drag him over the rail  it was no easy task the schooner having lost part of her headway tossed and pitched dreadfully and once the water poured over me in a perfect deluge  but i had made up my mind to save the man and i did not give up i braced myself against the rail and then dibble gave me his hand and a moment later the unfortunate was safe upon the deck  thank god im saved he murmured and then he sank back unconscious  by this time captain hannock had come forward to see what had taken place  humph only another mouth to feed he ejaculated who saved him did you dibble  i tried to but foster was the one to do it brave lad that he is replied the old sailor  foster seems to carry himself high sneered the captain well take him to the forecastle some of you and let him get over it well carry him to new bedford providing he pays for his passage  i was utterly disgusted with captain hannocks brutal words but came to the conclusion that they were due in great part to the liquor he had drunk i helped dibble carry the rescued man to the forecastle and here the old sailor and myself did all in our power to bring him to his senses  it was quite a job but finally it was accomplished and the man sat up  where am i he asked in a dazed manner  safe on board the spitfire i replied  and the dora  the dora asked dibble  yes my boat  gone to the bottom of the sound said the old sailor i saw her founder just as you sprang for the rope  you did well let her go she wasnt worth much im glad im safe phew but wasnt it an awful storm  yes indeed said i  the man wanted to know how we had come to see him and all particulars and we told him  he was a tall and finelooking gentleman about forty years of age he gave his name as oscar ranson and said he was a lawyer in new york  i have been spending a few weeks at port jefferson on long island and yesterday set out for a two days cruise up the shore he explained but ive had enough of it he added with a shudder  we made mr ranson as comfortable as possible and while he was sipping a cup of hot coffee he asked me about myself saying that i didnt look much like a sailor  and then i told him my story of course he was surprised  i wouldnt have believed it possible he exclaimed but you have done me a good turn and now ill do as much for you  do you know mr ira mason a lawyer i asked  quite well  he is a friend of mine he has an office in the same building with my uncle  yes what is your uncles name  mr felix stillwell  at the mention of my uncles name mr oscar ranson jumped to his feet     chapter xiii  a new friend   felix stillwell your uncle exclaimed mr oscar ranson as he stepped up to me  i was amazed at his reception of the news  yes sir i replied  i know him quite well went on mr ranson slowly  you do  yes in fact i have had some dealings with him butbut  and here the gentleman hesitated  but what sir  well i dont know as i ought to tell was the reply you just saved my life and i dont want to hurt your feelings  these words puzzled me not a little and i said so  well the fact is your uncle and i could never agree on some business matters i did not think his actions were right and i told him so and we had quite a quarrel but of course this has nothing to do with you  it will not have i returned my uncle has not treated me fairly and we parted on bad terms so i do not care what opinion you have of him  indeed  yes sir i used to live with my uncle  are your parents living  no sir they were killed in a railroad accident in england and my uncle became my guardian  at this mr ranson was quite interested he asked me several questions and i ended up by telling him my whole story even to the missing money  its too bad he exclaimed when i had finished i can well understand how a man of mr stillwells manner would act under such circumstances he is a very unreasonable man  i suppose i made a mistake in running away i said  it would have been better to have faced the music but you had no one to advise you and did not know but that you would be sent to jail without a fair trial i suppose  what would you advise me to do  go back and stand trial you have done me a good turn and i will stand by you  further conversation was interrupted by the entrance of crocker who said captain hannock wanted to know if the rescued man could come to the cabin mr ranson rose at once  youll find the captain a very mean man i whispered as he prepared to leave when we get a chance i wish to tell you something very important about him  all right ill remember  mr ranson left the forecastle for a moment i was alone then lowell came in  well what are you doing now he asked savagely  nothing i replied as calmly as i could  think youre going to have a picnic of it i suppose he sneered  ill take things as they come was my quiet reply  well just get on deck and help clear things up he said the storm is over  i obeyed his orders i found the sky was now almost clear of clouds and the moon was just sinking in the horizon dibble and the rest were hard at work mending the broken boom and i turned in with a will  it took nearly an hour to repair the damage that had been done through the captains carelessness when at last we had finished i followed dibble below and we retired  i did not sleep well during that night on board the spitfire the place was strange to me and besides my mind was busy with the many things that had happened to me since i had left my uncles home  i could not help but wonder what my uncle had done after i escaped him had he put the police upon my track it was more than likely he was not the man to let six thousand dollars slip through his hands without making a great effort to get it back  then i wondered too if my cousin gus had really taken the sum i knew gus to be a mean fellow but had not dreamed that he would turn thief had not the evidence been so strong against him i would have felt sure an outside party had done the deed  for the present i felt myself perfectly safe from capture it was not likely the police had traced me to brooklyn and if so seen me taken on board the spitfire which lowell must have done as slyly as possible  i did not much like the idea of giving myself up after having once taken the trouble to run away but finally concluded to be guided by my newlyfound friends advice satisfied that if he would stand by me i would be safe  wake up there foster  it was dibble arousing me i was not long in obeying his summons i hopped out of my bunk and rubbed my eyes  time to get on deck unless you want lowell after you with the ropes end again  i dont think lowell will trouble me much again i replied as i began to dress if he does ill do what i can to defend myself  i like your grit it does my heart good to see a boy stand up to a man like him  at the bottom i think he is a coward i said most all brutes are  when i came on deck the sun was shining brightly captain hannock was up and he appeared quite a different man from what he had been the day before his face was still flushed from the liquor he had taken but he was sober and consequently much milder in his speech  take him around dibble he said to the old sailor and show him the ropes i guess youve got the making of a good sailor in you if you only set your mind down to learn he continued to me  im willing to work but i expect pay for it was my reply  he frowned slightly  well talk about that another time when ive seen what youre worth foster he returned and walked aft  dibble took me in hand at once he was a pleasant man to explain things and he said i learned rapidly by noon i knew many of the more important parts of a ship and how the sails were raised and lowered and as the weather was fine and we were bowling merrily along i fancied that a life on the rolling deep wasnt half so bad after all  as we walked around i cast many a glance about for mr ranson but could see nothing of him finally i asked phil jones concerning him and was told he was not well and was resting in the cabin  during my conversation with the gentleman i had made up my mind to tell him what i knew of captain hannocks plot i felt sure that he would know exactly what to do moreover being a lawyer he could perhaps take steps to nip the thing in the bud  dinner on board the spitfire was not an elaborate affair the variety of food was not extensive and the cook was not highly experienced in the culinary art nevertheless i was hungry and did full justice to what was placed before me  its good hearty stuff said dibble and that and the sea air will make you strongnot but what youre pretty strong already  late in the afternoon mr ranson came on deck he looked pale and he had his head bound up in a handkerchief which however he presently took off  it was some little time before i had a chance to speak to him but finally he saw me and came forward  why didnt you come and see me he asked after i had asked him how he felt and was told that he was fast recovering  foremast hands are not allowed in the cabin i laughed we are expected to stay where we belong  i found the captain a very disagreeable man last night he went on but this morning he was much pleasanter  he is sober now  yes and that makes a great difference in any one  i have something of importance to tell you i said in a lower tone  so you said last night what is it  it concerns the captain and this vessel i dont want any one to overhear it i returned  then let us go still further forward if any one comes near we can drop the subject and pretend to talk about the ships course  i thought this advice good and we acted on it at once     chapter xiv  some plain facts   my story took some time to tell once lowell came near us but he only heard mr ranson say that the schooner was making firstclass headway and taking no interest in this he walked away  you are sure of all this asked the lawyer after i had finished my narrative  yes sir every word of it  because it is a serious charge he continued in olden times they would have hung a man for such an offense and they might do so even now if any lives were lost through the going down of the ship  i dont know how he intends to sink the spitfire i suppose he can set fire to her or else bore holes in the bottom  it is a most atrocious plot i am glad he intends to do nothing until after he has left the down east coast wherever he makes a landing at new bedford or otherwise i can have him stopped but the evidence must be strong against him otherwise we will get ourselves into great trouble  this was a new idea i thought for a moment  if you only had some one to testify to your story went on mr ranson of course i believe you but we want evidence for the court  wouldnt the evidence of a bogus cargo be enough i asked suddenly  true it would i never thought of that but are you sure the cargo is bogus  i think it is one thing i know it is insured for considerably more than its value  what does it consist of  i dont know i think i could find out from dibble  the sailor who helped to save me  yes sir  it would be a good plan but he may suspect you if he is in the plot  i am satisfied dibble has nothing to do with it was my ready answer i was going to tell him what i have told you  oh well then it is all right and i dont know but that it would be better to have help in case captain hannock attempts to do anything before we land  just what i thought  where is this dibble  he has just gone below i will call him  dont do that it might excite suspicion these men are undoubtedly on the watch talk to him in the forecastle i will wait here until you return  i agreed and left at once i found the old sailor sitting on a chest mending some clothing  say dibble what kind of a cargo have we on board i asked  he looked at me rather curiously  what makes you ask that question  because i wanted to know  well he replied slowly were supposed to have fine furniture and crockery ware on board but its so packed up i didnt see any of it  did you help load  oh no the longshoremen did everything kind of queer too for captain hannock generally gets all the work out of his men that he can  then you didnt see any of the furniture or the crockery  no but what difference does it make we sail just as well as if we had lumber or steam engines on board  it makes a great difference let me tell you something  and taking a seat close beside him i whispered the story i had told to mr ranson  phew smash the anchor but thats a great scheme he exclaimed ive heard of such things being done but never thought the captain was such a great rascal  were going to stop the game do you know if we could get a look at any part of the cargo  tony dibble thought for a moment  just the thing he cried come with me  he rose and led the way to the end of the forecastle here there was a small door leading to a pantry  there is a trapdoor in that pantry explained the old sailor the old man doesnt know of it some of the boys made it on the last trip when we were carrying a lot of provisions and the captain tried to cut down the rations he saved one way but lost a good deal the other and the old sailor laughed at the memory of the affair  it was an easy matter to raise the trapdoor the distance to the cargo stowed below was but a few feet and i dropped down  shall i go with you or stand guard asked dibble  better stand guard i replied if any one comes get them out of the forecastle the best way you can have you a chisel or something like it  here is one and a wooden mallet too he brought the articles forward be careful how you make a noise  i will was my reply but i havent any light  heres a bit of candle be careful and dont set anything afire  dibble handed the candle to me and then closed the trap  by the feeble rays of the light i crawled backward for quite a distance finally i came to a large packingcase marked       s  co crockery b132 handle with care  the top lid of the case was well nailed on but after a quarter of an hours work i succeeded in loosening one half of it and pulled it off  illustration down in the hold  there was a quantity of straw next to the lid i scraped it aside and then took a look at what was below  the packingcase was filled with nothing but common stones  i had expected something of the kind so i was not greatly astonished when i beheld the bogus crockery that filled the packingcase i picked up several of the stones to make sure that i was not mistaken and then restored them to their place put the straw over the top and nailed on the cover  at first i thought to leave the place at once but so far i had not been disturbed and so i made up my mind to continue the investigation since it was once begun  i took up my candle and was not long in hunting up another packingcase this was marked furniture i took off some of the boards and soon brought to light a quantity of pretty fair kindling wood  as soon as i had made sure of what the packingcase contained i restored the wood to its original place and then began to nail down the cover as i had done on the crockery case i had just driven one of the nails home when a slight noise disturbed me  without any hesitation i ceased my labors and blew out the light i was none too soon for an instant later i heard lowells voice  i was almost certain i heard some one down here he exclaimed as he came forward  maybe it was rats suggested another voice which it was easy to recognize as belonging to captain hannock  i dont think so we have nothing to attract them this trip  if i find any of the men down here ill flog them was the captains savage comment and it was easy to see that he meant what he said  it would go rough with us if any of them should discover what we were carrying went on lowell paving stones and kindling wood  hush some one might hear you  the two men came close to where i was crouching indeed lowells foot came within a few inches of my arm and for an instant i did not see how i could avoid being discovered then they passed on  must have been mistaken lowell said the captain guess youre getting nervous  and he gave a low laugh  better be too careful than not careful enough returned the boatswain slightly disturbed at the slur i dont want to get caught at this job  neither do i  they can send us to prison for it  so they canif they catch us but i dont intend they shall  the two men carried a lantern and they swung it over their heads casting the rays as far as possible about them  i was in a direct line of light and for a second the captain caught sight of the top of my head as i moved behind the case  ha whats that he cried theres something behind the box  where asked lowell  there and captain hannock pointed in my direction  i gave myself up for lost and wondered what i should do when discovered  what was it like  ii dont know  lets look said the boatswain and he moved towards me  in another moment they would be upon me what was i to do     chapter xv  captain hannock tries to make terms   a sudden idea sprang into my mind i would try it if it failed there would be no harm done  captain hannocks reference to rats put me in mind of cats and drawing in my breath i let off the most unearthly cat cry that has ever passed my lips a cry that astonished even myself  both of the men tumbled back in great haste then the captain set up a laugh  its a cat he cried some old strayaway from the docks i suppose  must be a mighty large one returned lowell hold the light up till i catch her  nonsense suppose i want to get bit and die of hydrophoby exclaimed the captain let her stay where she is she can feed on the rats or starve to death  and taking the lantern he moved off towards the other end of the hold  somewhat reluctantly lowell followed him then i heard a sound as of a hatch closing and all became quiet  i crawled from my hidingplace and made my way with all possible speed to the trapdoor i reached up and knocked upon it softly and in a moment dibble opened it from above  quick i whispered they have been down after me let us get on deck just as if nothing had happened  dibble followed my advice on reaching the deck i found that neither the captain nor lowell had put in an appearance i saw mr ranson still at the bow and immediately went forward to speak to him  well how did you make out he asked anxiously you have been a long while  ive got all the evidence i returned but we must be careful or we shall be discovered listen to what i have done  as quickly as i could i related my adventures down in the hold  you have done exceedingly well he said and laughed heartily over the ruse i had used to escape detection paving stones and kindling wood it is a great swindle indeed  i guess we wont need any more proofs than that i said  no indeed  a moment later the captain came on deck followed by lowell they gazed sharply about and i was sure they were counting to see if any of the men were missing for presently the boatswain entered the forecastle to see if one of the men was not there  i will have to leave you now i said to the lawyer we must not excite suspicion  you are right he replied i will go into the cabin and take a rest and think over what you have told me we have as yet plenty of time in which to act  ranson left me and i joined dibble who was at work tarring some ropes  it was not very agreeable work but for the sake of being near him and at the same time to please captain hannock i lent a hand and we spent the remainder of the day together  when shall we reach new bedford i asked as we were going to mess  depends on the wind was dibbles reply if it holds out we may be there by tomorrow morning  so soon  might have been there before if it hadnt been for the storm that knocked us clear out of our bearings  my work had made me thoroughly tired and as a consequence it did not take me long to get to sleep when once i was in my bunk  the captain wants to see you said crocker as soon as i awoke in the morning  what about  he didnt say you are to go to the cabin  all right  wondering what was up i pulled on my clothing and made my way aft the captain was in the cabin alone  well foster ive sent for you to know what your intentions are he said as i entered  in what respect captain hannock  about remaining on board of course you came on the ship under peculiar circumstances but i think you like the life and i would like you to remain on board for the trip i will pay you the same as the other hands  of course i was astonished at these words what was up now had the captain hatched out some plot against me  i did not know then as i know now that mr ranson had spoken of me and that in consequence captain hannock was rather alarmed over the prospects should i get ashore kidnapping as mr ranson had put it is no light crime  i dont care to remain on board after we reach new bedford i replied after a moments hesitation  why not  you ought to know as well as i do  but i dont you signed articles and  i didnt sign anything i interrupted  your name appears on the books he returned with a shrug of his shoulders  if it does its a forgery  i know nothing about that but i am willing to do this if you are willing to go ashore quietly and say nothing i am willing that you shall do so  and if not  he frowned  then youll stay on board he said sharply  perhaps i wont i replied with spirit it is doubtful if i would have spoken so sharply had i not had my friends on board  yes you will do you suppose i am going to let a boy ride over me not much  you had no right to take me on board  i have a right to take my men where i find them now get to your work i will give you half an hour to think over what i have said then you will either sign off for the trip without pay or you will continue on the trip  and my money and the letter  i have nothing to do with them he replied coldly now clear out  i went on deck i was satisfied that there would be lively times ahead  yet little did i dream of all that was to befall me ere i parted company with captain hannock and the spitfire     chapter xvi  an important discovery   when i left the cabin after my interview with captain hannock i knew not what to do i was unwilling to leave the vessel with the promise that i would not prosecute him for what had been done to me and on the other hand i did not care particularly to stay on board if the spitfire should continue her journey  of course i knew mr ranson would stop the schooner at new bedford if he could and have the captain lowell and crocker arrested for conspiracy to defraud but there might be some slip and i wished to take no chances  had i had the london letter that had been taken from me i should not have cared what captain hannock wished me to do but watched my chances and gone ashore at the first opportunity  where the letter was i could not imagine excepting that it might be in the cabin or the captains stateroom  one thing was certain whatever happened i must regain the letter personally it was to me of greater importance than the exposure of what was going on aboard the schooner  i walked aft and discovered the lawyer in conversation with tony dibble  i suppose you have been to see the captain said mr ranson with a peculiar smile  yes sir i have and i related the result of the interview  i had a talk with him about your case went on the lawyer but i did not think he would get around it in this fashion well i will see that you get through all right  i wouldnt care excepting for that letter i returned  we can get a search warrant and hunt it up  but in the mean time captain hannock may destroy it no doubt he thinks it of small account  if i were you id hunt it up on my own account put in dibble you did slick work finding out about that cargo of stones and kindlings why cant you do as well finding out about that letter and your money  i have half a notion of that sort i replied what do you think of it mr ranson  im afraid it would go hard with you if captain hannock caught you  but would i be acting right  every person undoubtedly has a right to search for his own when it has been stolen from him  then ill hunt it up if i have to turn the cabin and staterooms upside down was my sudden determination  you will hardly have time while we are going up the harbor said dibble  are we in sight of new bedford  oh yes there it is right ahead  i looked sure enough land was not a great distance off  im going to get out of the way i said suddenly mr ranson you will see me later  do as you think best i will stand by you  i walked off i was not sure of my course and entered the forecastle to arrange my plans  by this time the captain had come on deck he saw where we were and gave orders to lower some of the sails and then called lowell to consult with him  seeing that i was not being noticed i slipped from the forecastle to the companionway in a moment i was down the steps and in the cabin  no one was present even phil jones was away i could hear him talking to the cook in the galley i had the place all to myself and now was the chance to do the work i wished to accomplish  i will not deny that i was nervous and for the first moment my hand trembled so that i could hardly open what i touched  but presently i grew more composed and even reckless and ransacked whatever came beneath my notice  my first work was to pull open the drawer of the cabin table i found it full of charts and nautical instruments accompanied by the logbook there was also stuffed in one corner the ships articles and opening it i discovered my name at the very end written in a rough hand entirely different from my own  this was evidently the captains or lowells work and it was on the strength of it that the two hoped to clear themselves the fact that i was a minor had not entered into their calculations  i put the articles back into the drawer and closed it then i looked around to see in what direction to continue the search  in one corner was a closet i opened it but found it contained nothing but bottles of liquor and medicine the former predominating i closed the closet and then wondered what i should attack next  while meditating i heard footsteps on the companionway it was captain hannock descending and i had hardly time to slip behind a curtain that led to one of the staterooms when he entered  confound the boy i wonder what has become of him i heard him mutter foster he called out  i made no sound the captain stood still for a moment  lowell must have been mistaken the young cub would never dare to come down here on his own hook  and with this comment and a final glance around captain hannock left the cabin and mounted to the deck  i breathed more freely when he was gone i had had a narrow escape had he looked in the stateroom i would have surely been discovered  i continued my search with difficulty the stateroom was comparatively dark and my ears were strained to their utmost to catch the first sound of any one approaching  the room was that belonging to the captain under the berth was a locker tightly fastened i was certain that the locker contained what i was seeking for because it was the one likely place that such a thing would be in but how could i open the box  i felt in my pockets but they were bare of everything that could be of use to me my eyes rested on a bunch of keys hung upon a nail near by i took them down and tried one after another  at length i came to the right one and in a moment had the locker open the box was filled with clothing but at the side was a smaller box or pocket and this contained letters and documents of various kinds  i took out the entire batch and ran my eyes over the superscriptions with all haste the letters were all addressed to captain hannock with but one exception  and that exception was the letter i had received from london  eagerly i opened the envelope the contents were intact and assured of this i stuffed the precious epistle in my bosom  i was about to restore the remaining letters to their original place when the handwriting upon several of them attracted my attention the chirography was of a peculiarly heavy and sloping character and i instantly recognized it as that written by my uncle  i was almost dumfounded by my discovery what did mr stillwell and captain hannock have in common  for a moment i hesitated about opening the letters then i reflected that both of the men were plotting against my welfare and i opened one of the epistles without any further compunction  it was dated at new york city ten days before and read as follows       dear hannocki will be unable to call upon you today as      agreed and perhaps it is just as well that we are not seen      together too much the cargo is now all ready at kinleys in      brooklyn well packed lowell can take charge of it for us      mutually the insurance is ok       i trust you have no trouble with the insurance on the vessel      powers will fix it up for you the new bedford business will be      all ready for you when you arrive and you need not wait but      half a day at the most will see you tomorrow       f s  i read the letter through with great care when i had finished i felt sick at heart  beyond a doubt my uncle was in league with captain hannock and the two were engaged in as big a piece of villainy as had ever come to my notice  i turned to several of the other letters the second was evidently a reply to one from captain hannock asking if my uncle considered the scheme safe to which mr stillwell said that nothing ventured nothing gained and that he needed money because he did not as yet dare to touch the amount placed in his care  this letter undoubtedly referred to my inheritance and i wondered how large a sum it was and why uncle felix did not dare to use it for his own benefit seeing that he would tell me nothing concerning it  i would fain have believed that he was not yet hardened to do such a deed but his actions towards me did not tend to confirm that idea and i was forced to come to the conclusion that he had as yet not had the courage to do so  i put the two letters in my bosom along with my own perhaps this was not exactly the right thing to do but i did not have time to consider my actions by the noise on deck i knew we were approaching a landing and i expected every moment to hear some one come down the companionway  the third letter was a long one and very hurriedly written so much so in fact that i had all i could do to decipher its contents i moved over to the skylight and was soon deeply absorbed  you rascal you what are you doing here  it was captain hannocks voice i started in alarm and found the skipper of the spitfire close at my elbow     chapter xvii  in a tight fix   captain hannocks face was deadly white and i knew he had taken in at a glance what i was doing  looking for my letter i replied as calmly as i could  are you he glared at me youre too smart young man ill have to take you down a peg  as he spoke he advanced upon me i saw that he had a large wooden belaying pin in his hand and i retreated as far as possible  but he was between me and the door and took good care not to go round the cabin table so i was soon forced to stop simply because i could back no further  dont you dare to touch me i cried  he gave a hard laugh  ill do just as i please lowell  there was no answer the captain repeated the call in a louder tone and presently the boatswain came hurrying down the stairs  whats up captain  ive found him replied captain hannock grimly prying through my private papers  what  jest so come get some rope well teach him a lesson he wont forget  lowell left the cabin at once i wondered what the skipper of the spitfire intended to do next was he going to flog me  i was not prepared for what was to follow in a moment lowell returned with a quantity of stout rope  now bind him well from head to foot said the captain  no you dont i cried  yes we do my hearty returned lowell and captain hannock shook the belaying pin in my face  stand still unless you want your head split open he commanded ill have you to understand your days of fooling are over youve discovered our secret but it shant do you any good  the boatswain sprang upon me and the skipper of the spitfire assisted him i struggled but soon found it of little use the two were too many for me and in a moment i was securely bound  now open the trap lowell and well chuck him down in the hold exclaimed captain hannock  he may yell captain  thats so tie a cloth over his mouth  the boatswain procured a towel and stuffing part of it in my mouth fastened it around my neck  then a trap door in the cabin floor was opened and i was lowered upon the cargo below  now you can stay there till you come to your senses observed captain hannock  then the trap was closed and i was left to my fate  fortunately for me the distance i was dropped was not great or i might have been severely injured i struck upon a packingcase and lay there helplessly i overheard my captors move about the cabin for some time and then all was quiet  the gag in my mouth nearly choked me but try my best i could not dislodge it the ropes about my body especially those that were tightened around my ankles hurt me not a little but all my efforts to loosen them only appeared to draw them closer until had i been able to do so i would have cried out from pain  as i have said once before the darkness in the hold was intense and try my best i could not see a thing had there been a light i might not have felt so bad but as it was i felt next to hopeless  i wondered what was going on above i was not kept long in suspense for presently there was a thump and i knew the spitfire had reached the dock  then came the noise of many feet as the schooner was tied up and the sails were lowered and made fast at length this task was completed and then all was quiet once more  i wondered if mr ranson had gone ashore without making any inquiries about me and if so if he would bring down the police or other officers of the law to arrest captain hannock and the others  the time dragged by slowly until i thought the entire day had passed i grew hungry and thirsty and at last chewed the bit of cloth in my mouth for pure consolation would no help come  at length when i had given up all hope of seeing any one i heard a noise at the other end of the hold and presently saw the dim rays of a candle moving slowly about  foster are you here  instantly i recognized the voice of tony dibble and my heart gave a bound i tried to cry out to him but could not  but though i could not cry i could make a noise with my heels and this i did with a right good will  it did not take me long to attract the old sailors attention he stopped short and held the candle over his head  is it really you foster he asked  rat tat tat i replied with my heels  where are you he went on  ratatat ratatat was all i could answer  gagged ill be bound he muttered to himself and at last found his way to my side  it did not take him long to unfasten the gag and that once out of my mouth i was able to breathe with some comfort a thing which gave me no little satisfaction  who did the job he asked as he unloosed the ropes  the captain and lowell i replied they caught me in the cabin  i made up my mind something was wrong went on dibble i couldnt find you anywhere and was pretty certain you wouldnt go ashore without letting me know  where is mr ranson  gone off to get the officers reckon well have lively times in an hour or two  perhaps id better stay down here until he returns i replied  you can do that unless you want to run the risk of sneaking ashore  i would like to do that if i can where is captain hannock  gone ashore  and lowell  on deck and crocker with him theyd be almost sure to see you  this was not very encouraging  ill go up and have a peep around i dont much like the idea of remaining in this close place any longer  and with this remark i followed dibble to the trapdoor leading from the forecastle pantry  we were soon in the forecastle and then the old sailor went out on deck to see if the coast was clear  he was gone but a few moments  its no use he whispered hurriedly the captains just come back and is on deck and lowell is coming down here you had better go back for a while  but if they find me untied  they wont know but what you untied yourself come hurry up  i followed tony dibbles advice i had hardly entered the hold when lowell appeared  is crocker here he asked  no sir replied dibble  better git on deck went on the boatswain as he turned and left again  aye aye sir  tony dibble followed him on deck and i was once more left to myself  hardly five minutes passed before i heard a sound that filled me with alarm the ropes holding the schooner fast to the dock were loosed the sails were hoisted and before i could realize it we were once more under way  what did it mean had captain hannock smelt a mouse and thus sought to outwit mr ranson it certainly looked that way     chapter xviii  i am put in irons   i was thoroughly dismayed all the plans the lawyer and myself had laid were now useless he was left behind and i was on board little better than a prisoner bitterly i regretted not having taken the chances of getting ashore without being observed of what use now was all my information against captain hannock and his confederates in an hour we would be far out at sea and then the chances of doing anything to save myself would be small indeed  suddenly the idea of jumping overboard and swimming ashore entered my mind we could not be far from the dock and anything was better than to stay aboard the doomed spitfire  no sooner had the idea suggested itself than i undertook to put it into execution i raised the trap and crawled up into the forecastle no one was there and i sneaked to the deck  as i had surmised the dock was not over a quarter of a mile away if indeed it was as far i was a fair swimmer and without hesitation i ran to the rail with the full intention of jumping overboard  hi you rascal come back stop him somebody  it was captain hannocks voice and it made me run faster than ever i gained the rail and in another moment would have been over  hi crocker why dont you stop the lad  the next instant i felt a hand on my collar and i was drawn forcibly back  let me go i cried and twisted with might and main to free myself  not so lively my hearty said crocker the captain says you are to stay aboard  and despite my struggles he held me until the others came  but now i was thoroughly desperate not knowing what would happen if i was carried to sea i continued my struggles even after captain hannocks hand was placed on my arm  this enraged the captain and he looked around for a ropes end with which to beat me into submission  seeing a chance i made another struggle and this time succeeded in breaking loose from crocker and gaining the rail before they could catch me again  splash i was over the side and into the water  i had taken as good a dive as possible and now i remained under water as long as my breath would allow consequently when i again came to the surface i was all of a hundred feet behind the spitfire i lost no time in striking out for the shore  but weighed down as i was by my clothing my progress was slow realizing how i was encumbered i paused long enough to pull off my coat and vest and kick off my shoes and then i struck out once more  in the mean time captain hannock was letting forth a flood of vile language at everything and everybody he wanted to know who had aided me to escape and he threatened to shoot me if i did not turn around and swim back  the threat rather alarmed me but as i did not see any firearm in his hand i paid no heed to it but kept on until the distance between me and the schooner was considerable  but now to my chagrin i saw the sails on the schooner being lowered then i heard the captain give the command to lower the boat  desperately i struck out for the shore still so far away i knew i could not make land but i was in hope that i might get close enough to summon assistance there were a number of boats both large and small moving about and why should i not be able to find some one upon one of these ready to assist me  help help i began to cry at the top of my voice  hes calling for help i heard crocker exclaim hell have somebody from shore at hand soon  man the boat quick returned captain hannock weve only got a couple of minutes to reach him in  crocker and the captain sprang into the boat and two sailors at once followed then two pairs of oars dropped into the water and the rowboat left the stern of the schooner  i continued to swim but my hopes of escape were rapidly leaving me i was still too far away from any of the shoreboats for their occupants to hear my cries and no one but those on the schooner and the schooners boat seemed to be looking in my direction  a few minutes more and the boat dashed up beside me i dove out of sight but the keen eyes of crocker kept sight of me and when i once more arose he put out his hand and caught me by the ear  come aboard he cried sharply  haul him in by the ear if he wont come roared captain hannock we cant afford to waste time on him the sooner we get away from this harbor the better  thats so returned crocker and he gave my ear a tremendous pull are you coming he demanded  yes dont yank my ear off i replied for the way he was treating me hurt not a little  then come aboard at once  he continued to pull my ear and one of the sailors caught me by the left hand so seeing it was useless to resist any longer i clambered over the side  on the way after me the party in the boat had picked up my coat and vest and these captain hannock now threw towards me  put them on and behave yourself he said briefly pull for the schooner boys  i donned the garments and sat down on the forward seat the captain sat close beside me and during the return to the vessel his watchful eyes did not once leave me  we were soon on deck once more and then without warning captain hannock burst forth into a perfect storm of anger  he sprang at me and struck me a cruel blow in the mouth that almost knocked me off my feet  thats the way to treat him put in crocker lay it to him good captain  you brute i cried  shut up cried captain hannock and then he turned away to give orders to the sailors to hoist sail again  youll catch it now went on crocker to me  i dont care i returned recklessly  you dont eh  no i dont do your worst  and i would say no more to him  presently the sails went up once more and again the spitfire moved away from the distant shore with the fading away of the land my last hope appeared to desert me  then captain hannock again approached me  how did you get loose demanded the skipper of the spitfire as he hurried up red with rage  thats my business was my reply you have no right to keep me on board  ill put you in irons crocker get the irons ill show the cub whos boss here  in a minute the handcuffs had been placed upon my wrists  weve lost one man i dont intend to lose two said the captain take him below  i thought i was to be pitched again into the hold but this time i was mistaken lowell led me to a small room situated in the extreme bow  youll spend a day or two here he said as he locked me in perhaps when you come out you wont be so disrespectful to your superiors  the room was not as bad as the hold had been there being a little light and ventilation at one end was a small bench and on this i sat down  i was left entirely to myself evidently all the sailors had been forbidden to come near me hour after hour went by yet no one appeared  i wondered why tony dibble did not manage to send me word of some kind i did not know that the honest old sailor was at this minute on the dock at new bedford speculating on what had become of the spitfire  at length towards evening lowell came with a tray of food which he set down on the floor of my prison  you want to make the most of it he said as he walked away it has got to last you till tomorrow noon  the food was not of the best and daintiest kind but i was hungry and even at the risk of starving later on i ate nearly the whole of it he had also brought along a pitcher of water and of this i took a deep draught  i sat for a long time meditating over my situation but could make nothing out of it as affairs had turned i must make the best of whatever came  i sat awake long after dark but finally my eyes grew heavy and then i went to sleep on the bench until morning  all the forenoon was passed in solitude to one unaccustomed to this the experience is terrible how i longed to have even a cat or dog to talk to but neither one nor the other was on board  when lowell came at noon i asked him how long my confinement was to continue  until you are ready to do your duty he said and not another word would he utter  the day passed slowly and the night was to me a restless one what was going on in the cabin and on deck were captain hannock and lowell getting ready to carry out their nefarious plan  i regretted not having taken one of the other sailors into my confidence but which of them could i trust  by this time i had made up my mind that dibble was not on board probably he had gone on a hunt for mr ranson and been left behind  i tried in vain to attract the attention of one of the men as he passed either he did not see me or else he did not dare to come near if only some of them knew  about four oclock i fell asleep i slept for some hours and would have continued doing so had not a wild cry suddenly brought me to my feet  fire fire  it was a fearful crydoubly fearful on a ship hundreds of miles from landand my face blanched as i sprang to my feet  could it be possiblewas the spitfire in flames  fire fire came that dreadful cry once more  then came loud voices issuing orders and the rush of the sailors feet  in vain i tried to catch sight of some one the men in a perfect panic rushed hither and thither but no one paid any attention to me  on deck there i heard lowell shout  where is the fire burst from half a dozen throats in chorus  in the holdit is one mass of flames  cant we put it out questioned one of the sailors  no the fire has gained too much headway for that  but we might try  it wont do i tell you we must get out a boat and leave the schooner ten minutes more and it will be too late  what as bad as that came back with a groan cant we save her nohow  no i tell you idiot ive been on board a burning vessel before man the jollyboat and lose no time  yes yes the jollyboat ejaculated half a dozen and then i heard another rush  i was terribly alarmed captain hannocks foul plot had been put into execution what would the end be  i was almost stunned by my discovery i paced up and down my cell like a madman but all to no purpose  hurry up men i heard captain hannock exclaim dont be an hour in doing five minutes work use your strength  ay ay sir no time to lose thats a fact  and the crew of the spitfire hurried their preparations even more than before  never mind your things boys save your lives we may have an explosion and then it will be too late     chapter xix  the burning of the spitfire   already i could smell the smoke that was pouring out of the cracks around the hatchway it would not be a great while before the entire vessel would be consumed  in my cell near the bow i could hear but little of what was going on at the stern i had no doubt but what active preparations were being made to leave the ship i knew well enough that no means would be taken to subdue the conflagration it was not captain hannocks desire to undo his nefarious work now it was once begun the quicker every one left the spitfire to her doom the better he would be suited  but my attention was soon taken from the schooner and centered upon my own safety at the start i had no thought but what somebody would come to release me but as the moments went by and no one came the awful suspicion crossed my mind that the master of the spitfire meant to leave me to my fate  i could not at first believe this to be possible but finally the thought forced itself home to me no sooner had it done so than i made every effort to attract the attention of some of the sailors who in their panic had evidently forgotten my existence  i cried out at the top of my voice not once but a number of times but such was the bustle and confusion on deck that no one heard me or if they did paid no heed  would the captain or lowell come surely surely they would not dare to leave me to die on board but the moments went by and no one put in an appearance the captain was going to make certain that nobody should live to tell any tales against him he had probably discovered that i knew of the plans he and my uncle had concocted  it was not long before i made an attempt to liberate myself the cell in which i was confined was built entirely of wood and the door was not an extra heavy one but with my hands locked together i was at a disadvantage yet terror lent me an artificial strength  i threw my whole weight against the door once twice thrice it groaned on its hinges but that was all i tried to obtain a purchase upon the floor and thereby push the door open but the flooring was slippery and this was a failure  as i have said the cell contained nothing but a bench in my desperation i took hold of this and was surprised to be able to pull off the heavy board seat  for an instant i was at a loss as to the manner in which i could utilize the board then the idea came to rest one end against the rear of the cell and the other against the top of the door and this i did then i brought my full weight down upon the pry thus formed as near the top as possible  instantly the door was pressed open at the top to the width of several inches into this opening i slid the end of the board and by thus working it down managed in a few moments to snap the lock and then the door flew open  meanwhile i could hear the creaking of the pulleys as the jollyboat was let down into the water would they leave before i could reach them  with my hands still chained together i rushed out upon the forward deck a heavy pall of smoke blew directly into my face and for a moment i was completely blinded and knew not which way to turn i noticed that the sails had been lowered and it was a strong west wind that caused the smoke to thus rush towards me  by the time the wind had shifted slightly i was half choked and staggered against the rail to recover my breath the jollyboat had reached the water in safety and the sailors and captain hannock were not long in entering it i tried to shout to them but the sound only ended in a violent cough due to the smoke which every moment was getting thicker  at last i got my wind and then cried out at the top of my voice  help stop the boat help  no one paid the slightest attention  pull away boys i heard captain hannock call out and an instant later the jollyboat had left the schooners side  in vain i repeated my cry if the master of the spitfire heard me he gave no heed and as for the sailors they were too busy doing their duty to give me a thought  deserted left to fight for life amidst the flames oh how bitterly i realized the awful position in which i was placed  the wind blew in such a manner that soon the jollyboat was hidden from view by the smoke evidently all had left the schooner in safety but myself  what was i to do now had my hands been free i could have done much but as it was i was next to helpless for a moment i stood irresolute upon the stern should i take a plank or what ever came to hand jump overboard and trust to luck  suddenly a wild cry startled me  save me save me  i looked and was astonished to see phil jones standing terrorstricken near the companionway  phil jones i cried  oh foster is that you exclaimed the cabin boy and he came running to my side  he was deadly pale and shook so that he could hardly speak  oh foster where are the others he continued  gone i replied  gone he ejaculated and we are left behind  yes the cowards have taken the small boat and we are left without any  what shall we do  i was just trying to think the fire is gaining headway fast  cant we put it out  i shook my head  it might have been put out at the start but its too fierce now  there aint any other boat he went on there used to be but it got stove to pieces  i can do but little with my hands chained together said i do you know where the key to this pair of handcuffs is  on a nail in the cabin i saw captain hannock put it there  come show me  i ran into the cabin jones following here all was confusion as if the inmates had been forced to leave in a great hurry the captain of the spitfire had left nothing undone to make the loss of the schooner appear purely accidental  here is the key said phil producing it let me take them off  in a moment he had the handcuffs loose and i slipped them off  they should be on captain hannock i remarked as we hurried on deck  indeed they should replied the cabin boy though he did not fully understand me i was dead tired and went to sleep on the pantry floor and no one came near me to wake me up i suppose the old man would just as soon see me dead as alive  i too was left alone i replied captain hannock and lowell set the ship afire and they didnt want any one to know it  i guess youre right was phils reply i overheard lowell speaking about something of the kind though i could not quite make it out  by this time we had reached the stern where the smoke was not so dense by the flames that were gradually working their way through the cracks in the deck where the oakum had burnt away i knew it would not be long before the entire ship would be enveloped if anything was to be done it must be done quickly  we will have to make a raft i said get all the ropes you can find near at hand  the cabin boy willingly complied now that he had a companion he did not appear so frightened and he worked with a will     chapter xx  on the raft   while phil was looking for ropes i collected all the planking i could and to this added a door or two then we tied all tightly together placing the doors on top as a sort of deck  fortunately i was thoughtful enough to build the concern with one end resting on the top of the rail had i not done so it is doubtful if we could have got the raft over the side when completed it was all of twelve feet square  now take that pole and help pry her over said i to phil try to make her strike right side up  he did as i directed at a favorable moment we gave the final push and the raft went over with a mighty splash  shes all right cried phil joyfully now what  get some stores together as quick as you can and jump aboard i replied ill look after some water  illustration on the raft   picking up one of the poles phil had thoughtfully taken aboard i placed it against the stern of the schooner and we shoved the raft away as far as possible then the cabin boy took a board and using it as an oar propelled the clumsy craft still further until we were at least a hundred feet off  there she goes thats the last of the spitfire  as the cabin boy uttered the cry there was a tremendous crash on board the schooner both of the masts had come down together  the fall tore a great hole in the vessels side into this the water poured at once  at last the schooner could stand it no longer she quivered from stem to stern then with a mighty plunge she disappeared beneath the surface of the ocean  the spitfire was no more and phil jones and i were left alone upon the bosom of the broad atlantic  i can hardly explain the feelings that filled my breast as i saw the schooner take her final plunge and sink beneath the waves it was to me like some gigantic living creature breathing its last i turned to the cabin boy and saw that his eyes were filled with tears  ive spent a good many years on her he whimpered and all i had was on board her it wasnt much but it was a good deal to me  let us be thankful that we saved our lives i replied captain hannock no doubt thinks we are at the bottom of the ocean  by the way where is the jollyboat asked phil suddenly  i stood up and looked eagerly in all directions not a craft of any kind was to be seen  shes gone i replied i suppose they have a compass and have set out for the shore  if it wasnt for a couple of the men id like to see the boat swamped said phil  captain hannock will be surprised if we ever meet again i replied  i dont want to meet him again i wont live with him ill kill myself first  i was surprised at the determination with which the cabin boy uttered the words  you are right i replied captain hannock is not a fit person for any one to have in charge if we ever escape depend upon it i will do all in my power to see that you are treated better in the future  will you oh thank you very much  the sun was now rising quite high in the eastern sky sending broad sheets of light over the ocean i climbed up on the top of the water cask and gazed eagerly around in all directions  not a boat was in sight  see anything asked phil  nothing but water and sky was the reply we must shift for ourselves and no mistake  luckily for us the planks we had lashed together were of sufficient buoyancy to cause the doors above them to ride clear of the waves so we were comparatively free from the wash of the sea although occasionally a wave broke over the flooring  we will lash the cask fast said i and then fasten the box of provisions on top of it  thats a good idea replied the cabin boy if the water strikes the food it wont be of much account  we did as i had suggested first however drawing sufficient water from the cask to last us for the day  now if we could hoist a sail wed be all right said phil  let us see if we cant raise the oar between the doors i think if we can we can tie some ropes fast to steady it and put the sail on it  we havent any boom  maybe we can split off a side of one of the doors and make one  we can try responded phil we aint got much else to do gracious aint i glad i aint alone  so am i was my warm rejoinder well live or die together  i aint much afraid of dying now you are with me  planting the oar for a mast was no easy matter of course we did not attempt to do it until we had made the boom and also a small crosstree at the top from which we suspended the sail not very artistically it is true but in such a fashion that it drew very well  there we are cried phil when the task was accomplished whats the matter with that  nothing i replied and then added with a laugh  let us go into a firm jones  foster boatbuilders and sailmakers  phil laughed heartily  youre right im glad its up it looks more like a regular boat now  it will act as a signal as well as a sail i replied and we need both  now weve got the sail how are we going to steer and in what direction the ocean looks all alike to me  we will have to be guided by the sun i know land is to the west of us though how far i havent the least idea and well have to make a rudder of some kind out of another piece of the door  suppose we run across captain hannock and the jollyboat  it isnt likely and if we do we will have to make the best of it ill stand no more nonsense     chapter xxi  night on the hasty   after the sail was rigged and the rudder lashed in position we took our first meal on the raft i was hungry but fearful of exhausting our stock of provisions before we reached land or help of some kind i ate no more than was absolutely necessary and the cabin boy did the same  what will we name the raft asked phil as he held a cup of water aloft  i thought an instant  how would the hasty do  just the thing he cried we were mighty hasty in building her the hasty she is  and by drinking the water he so named the raft upon which we passed so many anxious hours  it must have been near eleven oclock before the morning meal was concluded by this time the sun was almost overhead and poured down hotly upon us  this wont do i said feeling my face nearly burning up we must rig a covering of some kind  there was a small part of the sail that was not used this i cut off and putting the center of it over the box of provisions as it rested above the cask i fastened the four ends to the corners of the doors and that gave us a miniature cabin in which we took turns in resting  by good fortune there was a stiff breeze blowing directly from the east so by skillful management we kept the head of the raft pointed in the direction we wanted to go  as we sailed along phil jones told me much concerning himself  ive lived with captain hannock ever since i can remember he began my father was a sailor and he died on board the spitfire leaving me in charge of those on board my father was mate and ive heard that captain hannock was a better man in those days  wasnt your mother living  no she died when i was a little baby thats the reason i suppose the captain took me in charge  then perhaps he had no legal right to do so  i dont know about that but im sure he had no legal right to bang me around the way he did  certainly not and he shall not do so in the future  then phil asked me about myself and i told him much of my history he was not very old but the sharp knocks he had received had given him a wisdom beyond his years  talking made the time pass more swiftly and before we knew it the sun was sinking in the west it would not be long ere the night would be upon us  let us lose no time but sail along as far as we can i said  how about sailing by the stars  i dont know anything about that  i know a little  then we wont lower the sail until it is absolutely necessary come you take a nap if you can and i will steer as long as the sun lasts and then you can take the rudder  to this the cabin boy readily agreed he was soon asleep and i was virtually left alone  as the evening shadows deepened i realized for the first time our forlorn condition here we were afloat on the bosom of the broad atlantic with no land or sail in sight what would the outcome of this adventure be  from the present my mind drifted to what had been left behind i had no doubt but that my uncle felix was searching for me in every direction perhaps he had even made offers of reward for my discovery six thousand dollars was no mean sum to lose and i knew him well enough to understand that he would wellnigh turn the metropolis upside down ere he would submit to it  i could understand that my running away made it look bad for me every one would say if i was innocent why had i not stood my ground even mr banker and mr mason might shake their heads and have their doubts  then i thought of the evidence i held in my pocket against mr stillwell and captain hannock if i reached shore in safety what a sensation it would produce had my uncle treated me with more consideration i would have had some hesitation about exposing him even though he deserved it and justice demanded it but not for an instant had he thought of how he was ruining my good name for all time and i had been innocent while he was guilty he must suffer the penalty of his misdeeds  i could not help but think of mr ranson and tony dibble what had become of the two would they watch for captain hannocks return and expose him at once  slowly the evening wore on until the last trace of sunshine had gone and only the stars shone down upon the hasty phil was fast asleep and i did not like to wake him so much did he appear to enjoy the nap poor boy for once he knew that he would not be aroused by a kick or blow  it must have been ten oclock when phil did awaken he rubbed his eyes and sat up  where am i oh i remember how good of you luke to let me sleep so long  its getting pretty dark now phil are you sure you can steer  i think so  i handed him the rudder and lay down under the canvas at first i was too restless to sleep but after awhile tired nature could stand it no longer and i dropped into a heavy slumber  wake up luke wake up  whats the matter i exclaimed  i cant say but something is wrong he returned  at once alarmed i tried to crawl from under the bit of canvas when i had accomplished this featwhich was not easy considering how the hasty rolled and pitchedi gazed at phil and saw that he was trembling violently  what is it philwhat scared you i went on  we struck something he cried i most believe it was part of a boat  something from the spitfire most likely i returned  i dont knowbutbut  but what philwhat ails you  i believe there was a man on it he said in an awful whisper i couldnt see very well it gave me a fearful scare  a man are you sure  no but it looked like a man my it was terrible  you look it in what direction was it  phil pointed over his left shoulder i peered through the gloom as best i could but could see nothing  well its gone now whatever it was i said are you quite sure you didnt fall asleep and dream it  oh i wasnt asleep im not a bit sleepy after my long nap i am sorry i disturbed you butbut i couldnt help it  thats all right said i with a yawn well i might as well turn in again eh  yes turn in by all means  once more i crawled beneath the canvas i had not heard a single cry and i was inclined to think that phil had been mistaken concerning a person on the wreckage he had seen  my short nap had only made me more sleepy and it was not long before i dropped off into a sound slumber which even the fitful motion of the raft did not disturb  luke luke  it was phils voice again louder than ever before  now whats up i replied not in the best of humor  we must be careful we have struck  the cabin boy did not have time to finish the sentence for at that instant the hasty received a terrific shock which nearly split her in two  oh luke what shall we do cried phil in alarm as soon as he could catch his breath  before i could answer there came another shock a moment later phil and i were struggling in the dark waters     chapter xxii  a terrible loss   to be suddenly aroused out of a sound sleep and immediately afterwards to find yourself struggling in deep dark water is not an experience to be desired the first plunge made me shiver from head to foot and it was only by instinct that i kept my mouth shut and struck out to keep myself afloat  i had not the slightest notion of what had happened and in the darkness could see nothing it was some time ere i could recover and call out to the cabin boy  what is it phil where are you  here i am he cried close beside me and an instant later his hand touched my body  what happened i repeated  i dont know he replied either something struck the boat or else we hit a rock  i dont think we are near enough to shore to strike a rock i rejoined  well what was it then  i dont know and whats more im not going to try to find out just at present where is the raft  i guess the hasty has gone to the bottom i cant see her anywhere around  dont be foolish she couldnt sink  thats so i forgot well where is she then  we must find her can you keep on swimming  for awhile but dont leave me added the cabin boy in sudden alarm  i wont we can swim together take it easy  side by side we struck out my thoughts were busy suppose we were not able to find the raft to swim any great distance would be impossible and we could not float forever  its hard work and no mistake said phil after a few moments of silence i cant go much further  suppose we let ourselves drift with the current  thats a good plan for i suppose the hasty did the same thing  so we allowed ourselves to drift for fully ten minutes fortunately both of us were good swimmers and understood the art of floating if not it might have gone hard with us  whats that ahead cried the cabin boy at length  where  there to the right  i strained my eyes was it a light yes not one but several and all moving rapidly away  its a boat i cried let us yell  and yell we did once twice and then a dozen times in a tone that made me so hoarse i could hardly speak afterwards  its no use said phil its a steamer and they wont pay any attention  i shouldnt wonder but that it was the vessel that struck us i exclaimed  most likely but if they would only pick us up i wouldnt care a straw  after this there was another interval of silence then my arm struck something hard i put out my hand and was overjoyed to find that it was the raft  here she is i cried heres the hasty  thank our stars returned phil i couldnt have held out much longer  it did not take us long to get aboard and completely exhausted we sank down on the flooring and panted to get our breath  there was no more sleep for us that night so we both sat close together and talked of what had struck us and what damage it had done to the raft  the rudder is smashed said phil  never mind we can make another in the morning i returned its too dark to do anything now  so we let the raft drift at will trusting the wind was still blowing us toward the shore  slowly the night wore on and at the first streak of dawn we were both in motion it seemed a shame to rip up another part of the flooring to make a rudder yet there was no help for it while doing so i noticed that the doors were unusually wet but gave it no attention thinking it had been caused by the raft dipping under when the vessel had struck us  at last we began to get hungry and phil hauled some crackers from the provision box  they will make us mighty thirsty and we havent much water he said but i hadnt time to hunt up just the best things to take along  we ate our crackers and when we had finished them i turned to the cask to get some water i pulled out the bung and was horrified to discover that the cask was empty  the waters gone i gasped  what  its true there isnt a drop in the cask  phil was fully as much dismayed as i was alone on the broad atlantic and not a drop to drink  we cant live without water he cried  i know that it is worse than being without food  ten times over where has the water gone  we examined the cask carefully at the bottom was a bunghole in which a bung had been placed but either the riding of the raft or the shock had loosened the bung and it had dropped out and allowed the water to run away to the last drop  we are done for now groaned phil we cant stand it twentyfour hours without something to drink  perhaps well have a change in luck before that said i but i had my doubts  the hours that passed after i made the discovery were terrible ones we suffered intensely from thirst and i was almost tempted to drink the salt water that surrounded us had i done so this tale would probably have never been written  when the noonday sun shone down upon us we could not stand to be out in it phil crawled under the canvas his eyes rolling strangely  water water oh give me water he cried  i was startled was the poor boy going insane  let me wet the canvas i said it will make it cooler  i did as i suggested and the cabin boy declared it was much better than before then i coaxed him to try to sleep and at last he fell into a troublesome doze  throwing more water on the canvas until it was sopping wet i crawled in beside him  but not to sleep my mind was in a whirl and i could not think clearly my mouth was parched and my tongue so thick that when i tried to utter some words in reverie i could not a thing that frightened me still more     chapter xxiii  the deep blue sea   i lay several hours under the canvas wondering how the adventure would end at present things looked rather blue and perhaps neither phil nor i would live to tell the tale at length when i was about to give up in despair a low rumble brought me to my feet instantly  it was thunder  a storm a storm i cried pray god it brings us rain  my cries awoke phil and he pushed the canvas aside  what did you say he asked feebly  there is a storm coming up was my reply hear the thunder  what of it  what of it a storm means water and water means something to drink  hooray so it does  and the cabin boy jumped to his feet at once  it is wonderful what life the prospect of rain put into us eagerly we watched the approach of the dark clouds that were fast bearing down upon us  we must fix the cask to hold water i said and also the canvas  and we can fix the sail too added phil we must catch as much as possible  i put the bung back into the cask hammering it in well then by the aid of the mast rudder and boom we hung the canvas so that every drop that might fall upon it would be caught and poured into the cask  hardly had we finished our preparations when the storm bore down upon us the lightning was terrific the thunder deafening and the rain came down in a deluge  we heeded not the storm we drank our fill of the first water that entered the cask and oh how good it seemed many a time since i have drunk spring water of the purest and coolest but nothing that could compare with that which phil jones and i caught on the canvas in the middle of the atlantic  our thirst satisfied we turned our attention to filling the cask it was not long before we had it more than half full and as the cask was a twentygallon one this was not bad and would last us quite some time  of course we had to pay considerable attention to the raft which at times tossed and pitched in a fashion that made me sick all over and rendered it necessary to hold on tightly to prevent being swept overboard  for two hours the storm continued without showing any signs of abating by this time we were wet to the skin and shivering with the cold  now weve got water i wish it would clear off remarked phil as he stood holding fast to the mast  so do i its no fun thinking that any moment we may be swept overboard  hope the jollyboat is out in it he continued captain hannock deserves all the ducking agoing  he cant be to land yet wonder if all the sailors are with him  i suppose so im sure there wasnt a soul left on the ship  instead of letting up the sky grew darker and the wind increased in fury the hasty bounded up and down over the mighty swells and many were the times that i thought our last moment had come yet each time the clumsy raft righted herself ready to battle with the next wave  not without considerable danger i managed to tie the planks more tightly together that rude structure now seemed to be our only hope for safety  and thus the night of awful peril wore on                                       this is the very worst storm i ever saw  it was phil who uttered the words he was lying flat on the top of the cask holding on tightly to the ropes that held the mast he had been in that position for fully two hours and it was plain to see that he was nearly exhausted  keep up your courage i replied the worst is over im certain this storm wouldnt appear so bad if we were on shipboard  the box of provisions had become thoroughly watersoaked and it was now resting on the flooring of the raft and i was using it to lie upon so that the waves might not wash over me so freely  far over in the east i could see a faint break in the clouds and to this i laid my hope of a change for the better but the cabin boy shook his head  storms dont clear that way  yet this one may  hope youre right but i dont think so  an instant after these words there was a terrible clap of thunder and following it a deluge of rain that almost swept us from the raft  ill venture to say thats the end of it said i  after the downpour was over it began to brighten and in the course of half an hour there were several rifts in the clouds we watched them eagerly  dont know but that you were right said phil at last see see the storm is drifting southward  thank fortune for it was my reply i never want to pass through another like it  in another hour the rain had ceased i judged it was now about four oclock and i was not far out of the way for about an hour or so later the sun rose and peered dimly through the haze  it was not long before it was as bright and clear as ever but the water was still in a turbulent state and every minute or two a wave would break over us with a swash and a crack decidedly unpleasant  as soon as i was able to do so i overhauled the provision box with a view to saving what might still be fit to eat  it was in a sad mess and the salt water had made most of the things worthless the crackers and bread i threw away at once and this left us with nothing but some potted beef a jar of pickles and some canned corn and asparagusrather an odd collection but decidedly better than nothing  we will have to live on closer mess than ever i said as i viewed the stuff  i wont mind that so long as we have enough to drink returned phil i can stand hunger but i cant stand being dry  youre not very dry now said i with a faint attempt at humor  the cabin boy gave a laugh  i dont mean that way guess our clothes will dry fast enough when the sun gets up  the morning proved a long and warm one we did all we could to pass the time pleasantly but it was a failure there was no concealing the fact that we were both anxious about our situation  it must not be supposed that because i write so calmly of this involuntary cruise that we were not frightened for such is not a fact both of us were greatly alarmed and would have given about all we owned to be once more on dry land  about every hour one or the other of us would climb up to the top of the mast and look in all directions for a sail or land this we did until we were almost ready to give it up as nothing appeared  our dinner was a curious one some potted beef and cold green corn washed down with a cup of cold water  funny we didnt think of this corn when we were so thirsty said phil it would have done pretty well for a time  i didnt know it was there i returned never mind its over now and i hope we dont have any such experience again     chapter xxiv  picked up   the afternoon drifted into evening and somewhat disheartened we prepared to pass another night on the hasty we arranged that phil should sleep first for about three hours and then i was to take my turn  tie yourself fast said i or you may roll off  he followed my advice and it was not long before he was in a sound slumber i sat on the cask steering as well as i could by the stars suddenly from out of the gloom ahead an object loomed up i started to my feet and strained my eyes  it was a steam yacht  for an instant i could hardly believe my eyes then i gave a wild cry that caused phil to jump up in alarm  what is it he asked anxiously  a ship  a ship where  dead ahead let us hail her  and together we called out as loudly as we could  ship ahoy  there was no answer but the yacht came nearer  ship ahoy  ahoy here came back the welcome cry  then we heard the engine of the craft cease to work and presently the long slim yacht came close beside us  who are you asked some one from the deck  we are shipwrecked from the spitfire replied phil  will you take us on board i added  certainly we have been looking for you came the strange reply  but at that instant i recognized mr ranson standing at the rail the lawyer looked highly pleased to see us and waved his hand  in a moment a rope was thrown to us from the yacht and without any difficulty we ascended to the deck where a small crowd of men surrounded us  right glad am i to see you exclaimed mr ranson as he shook me by the hand and you too he added to phil  where are the rest of the crew asked the captain of the yacht  i dont know was my reply they went off in the jollyboat and left us behind  you can tell your story in the cabin put in another man who was dressed in navyblue and wore a badge upon his breast  yes that would be best said the lawyer how do you feel  all right  a little hungry added phil  you shall dine at once said the captain a man by the name of flagg  he led the way to the cabin and the lawyer the man in navyblue phil and i followed  this is luke foster and this is philip jones said mr ranson presenting us captain flagg and mr henshaw of the government force  we all shook hands and sat down then phil and i told our stories straight to the finish and i also produced the letters i had taken from the locker in captain hannocks stateroom  a serious case a serious case indeed said mr henshaw when we had finished will you let me retain these letters  i looked at mr ranson  yes let him have them the matter is now in the hands of the government  by the time our story was at an end the supper was served and never did two boys make a heartier meal than did phil and i as we all sat around the table mr henshaw asked us many questions and made numerous notes of our answers  and how did you come to be out here for us i asked of the lawyer  didnt i promise to help you he replied when i left the spitfire it was my intention to return before she set sail again i was under the impression that you had gone ashore especially as dibble thought so too  where is dibble he was not on board  he too was left captain hannock sent him ashore on an errand and set sail before either of us could return i think he must have smelt a mouse  hell smell a still bigger mouse when he reaches shore said the government officer with a broad laugh burning a vessel and a bogus cargo that are heavily insured is no light offense  where do you think he will land  the first place he strikes it isnt much fun sailing around in a jollyboat  it is my idea that he will land at nantucket said captain flagg  it wont make much difference to us said the lawyer we will certainly hear of him in a few days when he comes to make his claim he wont lose much time in doing that you can depend  and in the mean time i can telegraph to new york to have this stillwell arrested went on mr henshaw  i gave a start i had not thought of such an occurrence  whats the matter asked the government officer noticing me  stillwell is fosters uncle explained the lawyer  indeed well i am sorry for you but the law is no respecter of persons prince and pauper are alike to uncle sam  mr stillwell is my uncle only in name i replied he has never treated me half decent and is even now trying to defraud me out of my inheritance  indeed then there is no love lost between you  not a bit sir  by these letters i should say he was not a man to be trusted  by mr ransons advice i told my story mr henshaw was deeply interested  it was a great mistake in one way to run away he said but in another it has helped to gather evidence against him evidence that will count for much but let me tell you one thing  well sir  i doubt if his son took that money  but he was in the office  only for a short while that money was gone before the office was opened in the morning  i could hardly believe that when i had opened the office and swept it everything appeared all right  mark my words if i am not right went on the government officer  i cant see how a thief from the outside could get in the place i replied  no but a thief from the inside said mr ranson dryly  i started struck by a sudden thought  you dont mean i began  what  that my uncle took that money himself i burst out  i dont say he did but it may be so said mr ranson slowly he has your money in trust the letter to hannock says he does not as yet dare to touch the money in his charge with you in prison he could do as he pleased do you follow me  i do and its as plain as day but i never thought my uncle was such a villain  i do not say he is but it looks so who would have thought him in league with hannock  no one in new york surely said i  i could not help but think what a sensation my uncles arrest would produce how mr banker would stare when he heard of it i was sorry for my aunts sake but mr stillwell had brought it upon himself  then i wondered if i would be able to clear myself one thing gave me not a little comfort it was mr ransons words  remember they have got to prove you guilty until that is done every man is considered innocent  yet this did not entirely satisfy me i wanted to prove that i had not taken the money if i did not i was sure there would be some who would always look down upon me  now that mr ranson had found us the course of the steam yacht was changed so that we headed directly for boston phil and i were assigned a cosy stateroom and it is perhaps useless to state that both of us slept soundly  early in the morning i was aroused by a cry on deck and the next moment there was a sharp rap on the door  what is it i asked  we have sighted the jollyboat was captain flaggs reply you and jones keep out of sight and there will be fun ahead     chapter xxv  the capture on the ocean   it did not take me long to dress after captain flagg made the announcement that the jollyboat had been sighted i was eager to find out how the occupants had fared and what mr henshaw the government officer would do with them  in a few moments phil jones and i had on our clothing and both of us stepped out into the cabin where we found mr ranson awaiting us  where is the boat i asked  not over a quarter of a mile away he replied mr henshaw says you two and myself are to keep out of the way and he will give captain hannock lowell and the rest a complete surprise  all right i suppose if the captain saw us aboard he wouldnt feel much like coming on deck  you are right but he would have to nevertheless mr henshaw will place him under arrest immediately  i would like to see what takes place i rejoined  so would i put in phil captain hannock is no friend of mine  captain flagg has assigned us three a place where we may see all that happens returned the lawyer come with me  we followed him on deck close to the wheel was a small covered place used for storing odds and ends of various kinds it contained a window so that one might see and the door was covered with a wire netting through which we might hear all that occurred  it was this place that we entered closing the door tightly behind us no sooner were we inside than i heard the voice from the jollyboat sing out  yacht ahoy  hello there who are you was the answer returned  survivors of the schooner spitfire said a voice which i recognized as that belonging to lowell will you take us aboard  yes lay to under our bow  the yacht stopped moving and a moment later the jollyboat came alongside and captain hannock lowell crocker and the sailors stepped aboard  who are you asked captain flagg of captain hannock and i noticed that mr henshaw had laid aside his navyblue suit and badge and was standing by apparently as an ordinary passenger  captain hannock told him and also introduced the rest  my schooner the spitfire bound for liverpool took fire and sank he continued we just had time to get out the jollyboat and get a cask of water and some few things to eat when she went down  indeed replied captain flagg how did she catch fire  i cant imagine excepting that it was set afire by a hand on board who changed his mind about going and wanted me to let him land before we started  this was certainly cool to say the least of course captain hannock meant me mr ranson pinched my arm  where is that man asked mr henshaw  i dont know i wanted him to get into the jollyboat but he was sassy and told me to mind my own business and hed look out for himself  what was his name  luke foster he wasnt very old  are all the rest here  all but the cabin boy  where is he  dead i guess my boatswain here says he saw him jump overboard out of sheer fright as soon as he saw the fire  my what a whopper exclaimed phil under his breath  yes i guess hes gone to davy joness locker put in lowell he was a very nervous lad  captain flagg continued to ask questions and captain hannock and the others related their experience since the jollyboat had left the spitfire he said they had a compass on board but during the storm it had been washed overboard and they were then compelled to steer by the sun and stars then the supply of eatables had fallen short and the sailors had quarreled among themselves on account of it though he would make no complaint against the poor fellows  you dont look starved captain hannock said captain flagg coldly  i never show it in my face was the smooth reply but all the same i am mighty hungry  you shall have breakfast very soon and then as mr henshaw gave him a peculiar look the captain continued  wont you step into the cabin  thanks i will where are you bound  for boston  that will just suit me i cant pay for the passage though i havent any money  was your vessel insured  only about half value  the two captains and mr henshaw disappeared into the cabin we waited impatiently  i guess hes done for said phil  yes mr henshaw intends to arrest them one at a time so there will be no fuss replied the lawyer  about five minutes after there was a call for lowell and a minute after one for crocker  that settles it said phil with a grin  were none of the others in it asked mr ranson of me  i hardly think so  just then one of the yacht hands approached us  the captain would like to see you in the cabin he said  all of us i asked  yes sir  so we went down into the cabin mr ranson first phil following and myself last  the three prisoners were standing in a row all heavily handcuffed  i demand to know the meaning of this captain hannock was saying in a voice of pretended indignation  it means that you are a prisoner replied mr henshaw  i can see that plainly enough sneered the captain of the late schooner but why  for burning the spitfire with a view of obtaining the high insurance upon her  burning the spitfire who ever heard of such a thing  and captain hannock started back in assumed astonishment  we have heard of it and also of the bogus cargo you carried  its a falsehood cried lowell we know nothing of the burning of the schooner im almost certain that boy set her on fire  what boy  luke foster  did you hire him to do it  hire him do you think i am a fool shouted captain hannock  perhaps i do the reason i asked was because i know you started out with the intention of setting fire to the schooner or destroying her in some way returned mr henshaw  its false began captain hannock the spitfire was  at that instant he stopped short he had caught sight of us and his face turned a sickly green no doubt he felt that for once he had been thoroughly sold  lowell and crocker also noted our entrance the sailor fell back in a fright the boatswain turned upon me fiercely  you whippersnapper he exclaimed where did you come from  i offered him no reply and he went on  this is the chap who set the spitfire on fire  we know all about it said mr henshaw quietly for the present you three may consider yourselves under arrest  its an outrage cried captain hannock but evidently his heart was not in the words  ill risk it  youll be sorry for it put in lowell who was white with rage  mr henshaw paid no attention to him  where shall we place them he asked of captain flagg  there is no place but an empty coal locker or two  that is good enough  put me into a coal locker foamed the boatswain  yes my man and let me add that i think a coal locker plenty good enough for a man who tries to burn a boy up  i wont go  oh yes you will  i wont  mr henshaw suddenly caught him by the arm i could see that the clasp was as that of steel  see here i want no more nonsense he said sternly you will do just as i say come along  he marched lowell off the rest of us stood guard over captain hannock and crocker  you will catch it for this said captain hannock to phil  maybe i will returned the cabin boy after this im going to look out for myself  ill skin you when i get a chance  but you shant get the chance i put in that is not if i can help it  you why do you know who you are  yes sir  you are felix stillwells nephew  and what of that i asked wishing to draw him on  oh nothing only youll be sorry for what youve done  as mr henshaw says ill risk it i replied  youll risk it he repeated staring at me strangely  yes ill risk it  you talk like a fool foster  thank you  i can place your uncle in a very bad hole  how  never mind i can and thats enough  then youll have to go and do it thats all  dont you care he asked considerably astonished at my apparent indifference  yes i care i replied honestly but if my uncle has done wrong i suppose hell have to suffer for it  perhaps you dont think much of your uncle he said suspiciously  i do and i dont he has not treated me right at times  oh  of course i hate to see him in company in any transaction with you i added pointedly  dont crow foster he fumed the end hasnt been reached yet  not quite but well be close to it when you are landed in the boston jail  this remark made captain hannock more angry than ever and he began to use language that i would not care to remember much less repeat  well see he said at length i am not the only one to suffer when this goes into court felix stillwell will catch it too  yes and i reckon i can put in a word or two against this boy of his put in crocker who had been listening to what was going on  you may say what you please i returned calmly  say captain didnt that uncle of his send him along to set the spitfire on fire went on the sailor suggestively  why of course he did burst out captain hannock caught by the idea how else would he happen to be on board  i must confess i was rather taken back by this cool assertion  i was about to reply when mr ranson caught me by the arm and shook his head  dont waste time talking to him said the lawyer he will do and say what he can to get free but it will not avail himhe will only twist himself up  will i sneered captain hannock  you will you had better remain quiet and think over what youll have to say when you come up for a hearing in court  in a moment more mr henshaw reappeared with the information that since lowell had objected so strongly to the coal locker they had put him in the oil closet the rankest place on board and now there were two lockers for the two remaining prisoners  despite their protestations captain hannock and crocker were quickly transferred to their improvised cells they did not wish to be separated but mr henshaw would have it no other way  and then we steamed for boston harbor     chapter xxvi  on land once more   the disdain was a fine yacht and the morning was all that could be desired after the prisoners had been disposed of we all went on deck and had a talk over the affair  i learned that the disdain had been chartered by mr ranson he had found captain flagg without anything to do a party that was to have gone out for a weeks cruise having disappointed him at the last moment it had not taken long to get the yacht in trim for the trip and in the mean time the lawyer had hunted up mr henshaw and related the particulars of the case  the government officer had taken the matter in charge without hesitation i did not know his exact authority but mr ranson assured me that it was amply sufficient for the occasion and on this i rested content  what will you do when we arrive in boston the lawyer asked me after a while  i dont know sir i suppose i will be wanted at the examination  of course  the trouble is i havent any money i went on thinking it would be best that my friend should know the exact condition of affairs i had four dollars and a half but captain hannock or lowell took it from me  dont let that worry you he replied with a smile saving my life was worth considerable to me and i do not intend to forget it  if you will lend me ten or fifteen dollars i began  you shall have a hundred if you wish  i dont want so much i intend to pay you back  you need not i  i want to though  you can suit yourself but let me say that i am your friend and i intend to help you all i can not only here but when you reach new york your uncle will probably have you arrested as soon as you arrive unless he has his hands too full of his own affairs which i am inclined to believe will be so  i wish i could get at the bottom of that robbery i went on earnestly  depend upon it it will all come out in the end i have spoken to henshaw about it and he says he will give the full particulars to a fellow officer in new york who will willingly work it up  you are very kind was all i could say  while you are in boston you must be my guest went on mr ranson i have a legal connection there as well as in new york and have rooms at the ridgerow house  this conversation relieved me of not a little anxiety i thanked mr ranson again  and now about your companion he went on what do you know concerning him  i gave him all the knowledge i possessed then mr ranson called phil aside and had a long talk with him  and so you are sick of the sea said the lawyer at length  yes sir tired of the sight of it exclaimed phil id rather do anything on land than ship as a cabin boy again  well ill see what i can do towards getting you a place in some office or store and until then ill find you a boardinghouse and pay your board  but captain hannock is my guardian  he wont be after he is convicted have you any relatives  only an old aunt down at lynn  do you like her  yes sir very much but captain hannock would not let me visit her  then she may perhaps become your guardian and let you live in boston or wherever you find a place i will fix it up for you if you wish  oh thank you  and so it was arranged  tell you what said the cabin boy when we were alone mr ransons a brick  youre right phil i replied and a gold one  about noon boston appeared and shortly after we steamed up the bay i had never visited the hub before and the sight was to me a novel and interesting one  we will anchor out in the bay and go ashore in the small boat said captain flagg mr henshaw wishes to transact some business before the prisoners are transferred  can we go ashore i asked  you will have to ask mr henshaw  i think you can said mr ranson you do not intend to run away i believe  not much i laughed my running away days are over this has turned out very well but i dont want to try any more  presently the government officer came up  of course you can go ashore and do as you please only be on hand at the examination for you both will be needed as witnesses  it was not long before the small boat was launched and quite a party entered we soon reached the wharf and in a body proceeded to one of the court buildings where mr henshaw left us sitting in one of the lower rooms  he was gone full half an hour  come this way please he said on his return and led the way to an apartment on the second floor  here are the persons judge he said presenting us to an elderly gentleman sitting in a big chair  i know mr ranson very well was the judges reply sit down i wish to ask you a number of questions  so we all sat down i was the first witness and all i had to say was carefully noted then phil jones and mr ranson followed and after an hour or more the judge said he was satisfied  i wish all of you to appear here tomorrow morning at ten oclock he said as he dismissed us i will not bind any of you over but will trust to your honor to do as i wish  this was satisfactory to all hands and we left out on the street mr ranson told phil to come with him and he would see what he could do for him  you can come too foster if you wish he added  i think i would prefer to take a walk around the city i replied it is all new and strange to me  do just as you think best  before we separated the lawyer handed me two fivedollar bills he would have given me a larger amount but i did not wish it  dont get lost was his final remark  ill try not to i replied  i did not know one street from another but walked up and down to me all seemed quite different from new york and the time went by swiftly about the middle of the afternoon i took the cars out to bunker hill monument and surrounding places of interest  i returned at supper time mr ranson had given me directions for reaching the ridgerow house and i found no difficulty in doing so  i met him in the hall  ah here you are he exclaimed come up to the room and get into shape for supper  he led the way to an elegant room on the second floor  i was surprised at the sumptuousness of the apartment and did not hesitate to say so  it is nice he returned certainly far better than my quarters were at port jefferson  by the way wont the people be alarmed for your safety i asked  i have already telegraphed to them  i washed up and combed my hair my clothes were none of the best but they were the best i had and mr ranson told me i could get another suit the first thing in the morning  supper at the hotel was an elegant affair and both of us did full justice to it  during the meal i asked what he had done with phil  i have secured him a position in an office down on the wharves replied the lawyer the work just suits him and the pay six dollars a week is i think very good to start on he has written to his aunt telling her to come down upon my invitation as soon as she arrives i will fix the matter up so that there will be no trouble  i think captain hannock has some money belonging to him  so philip tells me i shall bring him to a strict accounting and make him pay over every penny if he has it  i am anxious to get back to new york i said now i have decided on what to do i am impatient to begin  i guess you will be able to start by tomorrow noon i will try to arrange it with judge boyden so there will be no trouble but i am sorry i shall not be able to go with you  no i repeated in considerable dismay for i had counted on the lawyer accompanying me  business will keep me in boston for a week or more but i have already written to mr ira mason to take your case in charge  mr mason i exclaimed  yes you said you knew him and he is as good a lawyer as i could get what do you think of it  i like it very much i replied  i thought you would i told mr mason to spare no expense to clear you and also to have the subject of your uncles guardianship investigated i know he will do what i asked  i am sure he will  if you wish to follow my advice write at once to this mr banker whom this harvey nottington of london says was to be your guardian with what you now know perhaps he may be able to throw some light on the subject  i will do so at once i replied  as soon as the meal was finished i sat down in the readingroom and wrote a long letter to mr banker telling him all that happened and what a villain i had found mr stillwell to be i also said that i expected to be in new york the following evening and wished very much he would meet me i likewise quoted the letter from london and asked why my fathers wish had not been carried out  that will do firstrate said mr ranson when i showed it to him  i think i will take a walk out and post it i said for to write the letters had taken over an hour and a half and i felt somewhat cramped from the work  all right you will find me in the room when you return remember it is number 67  i walked out upon the busy street it was brightly lighted and in the evening looked very similar to fourteenth street in new york  i found a mailbox on the corner and dropped my letter in it  i was just turning away from the box when i felt a hand on my arm and a cheery voice called out  well dash my toplights if it aint luke foster how under the polar star did you git here boy  i turned swiftly and found that the man who had addressed me so cheerily was none other than tony dibble  why dibble i returned warmly and clasped his hand  i thought you was on your way to liverpool  i just got in boston i returned  and wheres the spitfire  at the bottom of the atlantic dibble  no he stared at me for a moment then the old man he began in a whisper  hush not so loud i interrupted somebody may overhear you  thats so he lowered his voice still more she was really done for then  yes burned up  too bad she was an old tub nothin better but i kinder loved her havin sailed in her so long the villains they ought to be strung up to the yardarm every one of em  how did you get here i asked curiously  just came up from new bedford that there lawyer ranson said i had better come up here and wait till i heard from him he was going to git a boat and go after the spitfire  he did get a boat and rescued phil jones and i from a raft after the spitfire was burned  good for him and where is the captain now  locked up  what roared tony dibble in amazement do you mean to tell me they caught him redhanded  hardly but they caught him and the others too  good  mr ranson is now stopping at the ridgerow house and i am stopping with him  yes he told me the name of the hotel i was on the way down there now to see if he had got back  perhaps you can help him as a witness against captain hannock i went on  i reckon i can i aint a lovin the captain much i can tell you  i suppose not  no he was a corker to sail under it was only the old spitfire that took my eye but shes gone now tony dibble wiped the moisture from his eyes too bad ought to string em up say i  the law will deal with them never fear  dibble was curious to know the full particulars of the going down of the spitfire and walking to a somewhat retired part of the street i gave them to him he shook his head over and over again  and all my duds agoin with her he said whos goin to pay for them  captain hannock ought to  so he had is that there lawyer at the hotel now  yes  im going to see him at once coming along  not just now i will be back later  just so luke i hope you git justice for bein left aboard  and with a shake of his weatherbeaten face tony dibble started off for the ridgerow house  then i continued my stroll quite a distance some of the shop windows that were still lighted interested me and before i knew it i had gone a mile if not more at length i came to a railroad station a number of trains had just come in and a crowd of people were streaming from the various entrances and i stopped to watch them  suddenly some one stopped in blank amazement before me  so heres where you have been keeping yourself young man were the first words i heard  somewhat startled i looked full at the speaker  it was my uncle felix  mr stillwell i ejaculated  exactly and you shall not escape me this time  and with a very stern face my uncle caught me by the collar  let go of me i cried  not much and dont you dare to try to break away for if you do i will hand you over to the first policeman that appears     chapter xxvii  mr felix stillwells move   i was thoroughly astounded at being confronted by my uncle felix in boston i was under the impression that he was at his place in new york city and for a moment i did not know what to do  yes sir young man dont you dare to break away or the first policeman shall have you he repeated as he tightened his grasp  let go of my collar was all i replied  not a bit of it  yes you will  and with a twist i pulled myself loose  police he called loudly  keep quiet said i im not going to run away  ohho so youve had enough of it he exclaimed in derision  never mind what ive had i am not going to run away thats all  seems to me you are getting mighty independent he sneered  i have a right to be  he looked at me sharply  what do you mean by that  that is my affair  why you young rascal i  hold up mr stillwell im no rascal  yes you are what have you done with that six thousand dollars you took from the safe  i never took six thousand dollars from the safe and you know it i returned with spirit  as i spoke i noticed my uncle closely and saw that he turned slightly pale  you took that money luke whats the use of denying it longer  you cannot prove it mr stillwell i might as well say you took it  whywhyyouyou he stammered  are you sure the safe contained six thousand dollars i went on  of course i am didnt mr grinder give me the money only the afternoon before  and you are sure you placed it in the safe  see here boy one would suppose i was the one who had committed the crime  and why not you as much as me i asked as coolly as i could  do you mean that i didnt place the money in the safe he demanded  thats just what i do mean  you young rascal  hold up uncle felix i  im not your uncle any more i disown you  i am willing to be disowned you have not treated me rightly for years in fact ever since my father and mother died  ive done more for you than you deserved  you let me work like a slave for next to nothing now if you think you are going to send me to prison on such a charge as this you are entirely mistaken  you come along with me and youll soon see  i am willing to come along but you will get the worst of it mark my words  after this we walked along in silence for a few feet now that he had me he was evidently at a loss what to do next  what brought you to boston i asked just to see what he would say  none of your business  oh all right i wondered how you knew i was here  you can keep on wondering  i supposed i could my words had evidently completely upset mr stillwell  are you ready to go to new york with me he asked suddenly  i thought a moment what of the examination in the morning  i will if you will let me go to the hotel first was my reply  been putting up at a hotel have you nice way to live on other peoples money  will you let me go  yes but not for long  are you going back tonight  certainly  this was somewhat of a surprise to me i had thought that he intended to wait until the arrival of captain hannock with the news of the loss of the spitfire  but his next words solved the problem  i shall not be satisfied until i have put you under proper care you are a dangerous boy to have around  now it was perfectly clear he intended to take me to new york have me locked up and then return by the next train to boston but for once mr stillwell had missed his calculations  what hotel are you stopping at  ridgerow house  humph mighty fine place for you it strikes me  it is fine  seeing that he could make nothing out of me he relapsed into silence  it was not long before we reached the ridgerow house  is mr ranson in i asked of the clerk  yes sir  will you please send word that i would like to see him in the parlor at once  yes sir  mr stillwell started on hearing the name  whom did you ask for he inquired  i told him  oscar ranson  yes sir  what do you want of him  that is my affair  mr stillwell was much disturbed he walked up and down impatiently  thought you said you were stopping at this hotel he demanded  so i did  this doesnt look like it  i occupy a room with mr ranson  where did you meet him  excuse me but that is my business  at this reply my uncle was very angry he wanted to let loose a flood of bad temper but did not dare to do so in that public place     chapter xxviii  on the cars   in a few moments mr ranson came down followed by tony dibble on catching sight of mr stillwell the lawyer was greatly surprised  mr stillwell he exclaimed  how are you ranson replied my uncle gruffly  pretty well but i didnt expect  neither did i  i came to see you before going to new york i broke in hastily i met mr stillwell at the depot and he insists on my accompanying him back at once  indeed  and i wish to speak to you in private before i go i added in a whisper  we walked to one side mr stillwell was itching to hear what was said but i gave him no opportunity of doing so  in a few hurried words i told the lawyer what had happened and asked his advice  go to new york with him and keep him there if possible said mr ranson mr henshaw or his agent will be down soon and arrest him i will fix matters with the judge  shall i say anything to him  no let mr mason do it for you  a little more conversation passed between us and then i announced my readiness to start  and good luck go with you said mr ranson in a voice loud enough for mr stillwell to hear and it made his nose go up in anger  hope youre done he snarled  yes sir quite finished  then come along  mr stillwell marched me out of the hotel and down the street without further words  going right to new york  none of your business  but it is my business and i stood still  cant you see we are he retorted  after this hardly a word passed between us when he arrived at the depot he said sourly  i suppose you havent any ticket  i havent  have you any money to buy it with  if you want me to go to new york you will have to buy me a ticket was my reply  we marched up to the ticketoffice and with very bad grace he purchased me a single ticket  when does the train start he inquired of the agent  in ten minutes  that suits come on the latter to me  we boarded the train mr stillwell found a vacant seat in the middle of the car and insisted on my taking the inside next the window then he placed himself between me and the aisle  now i want none of your fooling he said as he settled back  i made no reply and we rode on in perfect silence  i sat awake for a long time i could not speculate upon what the future held in store for me i well knew that mr stillwell was a deep one and i determined to trust him no further than was absolutely necessary  when will we reach new york i asked  there was no reply and turning i saw that his eyes were closed  i was pretty sure he was shamming and to prove it made a slight movement as if to rise  instantly his eyes were wide open  no you dont sit down there he cried  i repeated my question  not before tomorrow morning  then he closed his eyes again and i did not further disturb him  outside of the car all was dark and as i could not see any of the scenery through which we were passing the ride soon grew monotonous  finally my head began to fall forward and before i knew it i was fast asleep  i slept for about an hour then i awoke with a start  mr felix stillwells hand was in my coat pocket  i could hardly believe the evidence of my senses when i found mr stillwells hand where it was was my uncle trying to rob me i did not open my eyes but moved slightly to one side uttering a deep sigh as i did so instantly the hand was withdrawn and when a moment later i sat up i saw that he was lying back as if in the soundest sleep  there was no more slumber for me that night and in order to keep awake i sat bolt upright this evidently did not please my companion for presently he too sat up and looked at me sharply  you might as well go to sleep he said we have a long ride before us i thought i wouldnt go to the expense of tickets for the sleepingcar  ive had a nap i replied  it wasnt very long  long enough  humph  my uncle sank back again but i could see that he was put out no doubt he had counted upon searching my clothing and finding some clew to what i had done and intended to do  it was all i could do to keep awake but i managed to do so with the aid of an early morning paper i bought on the train  the paper was one from new york that had just come from the metropolis on the three oclock paper train i spread it open and was rather startled to behold the following heading to one of the columns       set on fire       the schooner spitfire given over to the flames       arrest of captain hannock for trying to defraud the insurance      companies       was the cargo bogus  and then followed a description of the arrest by mr henshaw and a harrowing account of two boys phil and myself who had been left on board to be burned and of the reasons for believing that the cargo was bogus and that three new york merchants were supposed to be interested in the venture  of course the newspaper item was right in some particulars but it was terribly overdrawn and i could not help hut smile as i read it  i wondered what mr stillwell would say when he saw it i determined to keep the paper away from him it being time enough for him to hear of what had happened when he arrived in new york  by the time i had finished reading the train was approaching the upper part of the city  let me see the paper said mr stillwell  as he spoke i had the paper rolled up and resting on the sill of the window which was open not wishing to refuse him directly i gave the sheet a slight shove with my arm and this sent it fluttering away  its gone i replied its dropped out of the window  you threw it out on purpose he growled luke youre getting more uncivil every day  we have different opinions about that i returned with an air of utter indifference  i knew he was too close to town to buy a paper then there would be one at the office and he would wait until he could get that     chapter xxix  back in new york   we soon reached the depot and leaving it took an elevated train down town  now luke for the last and only time are you going to give up that money  my uncle asked me that question as we alighted from the train  there is no necessity for your asking that question mr stillwell i replied i have said all i care to on that subject  do you know what i am going to do with you  have me locked up i suppose  more than that i am going to have you sent to the state prison for a number of years i hate to do it but its the only way to manage you  perhaps it wont be an easy matter to send me to prison  i have proof enough never fear  i dont think so and let me say if you disgrace me by an arrest i will make it as hot for you as i can  you are an angel i must say  i dont pretend to be an angel im nothing but an everyday boy and ive got a temper just as well as any one ive always tried to do my duty both to you and to others and i cant see why you should suspect me any more than gus or one of your partners oror yourself  what  yes i mean just what i say i am not guilty and i am half inclined to believe you know it  you villain  if you have me arrested ill make you prove that you put the money in the safe and that gus didnt take it out  you scamp do you think that any one will doubt my word  perhaps they will  i have been a wellknown citizen here for twelve years i think not  folks dont all know you as i do when they hear of some of the things you have done they will think differently  what things  never mind youll know soon enough  mr stillwell was evidently much disturbed he pursed up his lips savagely  you speak as if i had committed some great crime he cried  maybe you have  he grew pale for an instant but quickly recovered himself  dont try to scare me luke it wont work  i am not trying to scare you  yes you are  i am only trying to prepare you for what may come  i want no help from you  very well but remember you will be sorry for what you do  i said no more and my uncle did not continue the conversation  it was not long before we reached nassau street as we passed along i could not help but think of the day i had so unceremoniously left mr banker and my uncle how much had occurred since that time what an experience i had had and how much i had learned  i speculated upon the time it would take for mr banker to receive my letter and reach new york and if mr mason had heard from mr ranson and would be ready for my return  i hoped from the bottom of my heart all would yet be right i hated the thought of going to jail even if only for a few hours i knew the stain would cling  what did mr banker do after i left i asked  none of your business growled mr stillwell  he did not think i was guilty i went on  i dont care what he thought  and mr mason did he think i was guilty  mr mason is a foolalways was  from this i inferred that my lawyer friend had thought as mr banker didthat i was innocent this gave me not a little satisfaction  how did you come to meet ranson he asked after a pause  i might say that it was none of your business i began  you scamp  but i will not i saved mr ransons life  saved his life i want none of your jokes please  i am not joking he says i saved his life and i am willing to take his word for it  how was it  i was on board a boat and his boat was swamped so i pulled him on board  and so you became friends  yes sir  humph you might have made a better choice  i think mr ranson a very nice man he certainly treated me extremely well  hes of small account  he said you and he were not on good terms  what did he do for you for saving him  he offered to do a great deal  i suppose so hes mighty free as far as words go  it made mr stillwell feel sore to think i had so many friends he knitted his eyebrows and said no more until we reached the office  when we arrived we found no one but my cousin gus in charge mr grinder was still away and mr canning had not yet arrived  hello so youre back exclaimed gus thought youd get sick of running away  i offered no reply and he continued  what did you mean by insinuating that i took the money from the safe  if you didnt what were you doing in the office that morning when you said you were going to coney island  who says i was at the office  i do and i can prove it  gus reddened  well i will own up that i was here but i didnt go near the safe  so you say but if you didnt what were you doing here  dont answer him augustus put in my uncle sternly what right have you to crossquestion my son he demanded turning to me  if he doesnt answer i may have him arrested was my firm reply  what  i mean every word i say  have me arrested cried gus turning pale  yes  ii came to put the office in disorder so that you would catch it he faltered i tore up some paper and spilt the ink but i didnt go near the safe  it was a mighty small revenge was my reply  iiknow it but you stole the money he continued triumphantly  i did not and you will have a job to prove it  well do it never fear wont we pop  i think we will augustus but i fear luke is in a very unhappy frame of mind he doesnt seem to realize the enormity of his crime  he will when hes behind the bars  i trust so  i will never realize what i am not guilty of what are you going to do with me next  just sit down until i finish the morning mail and you will see augustus watch him so that he does not escape again  dont fear i told you i would not run away and i always keep my word  i sat down on a chair and mr stillwell began to look over his letters i wondered what would happen next but i was not quite prepared for what did happen  suddenly the door opened and mr canning rushed in he held a morning paper in his hand and was highly excited  what does this mean he demanded of my uncle  what does what mean mr canning asked mr stillwell as sweetly as he could  this account of the burning of the spitfire  dear dear the spitfire burned cried my uncle wringing his hands in assumed anguish and i had a cargo on board of her and but partly insured  yes and this paper states that the vessel was set on fire by the captain and his accomplices went on mr canning  with a bound my uncle was on his feet  it cant be true he cried hoarsely  the officers of the law claim that it is true but that is not the worst of it they claim that the cargo was a bogus one and that you are guilty of fraud foster here  mr canning did not continue with a deep groan my uncle had sunk back into his office chair like one dead     chapter xxx  an unexpected death   i was alarmed when my uncle fell back in his chair as one dead i knew that his heart was affected and that any sudden shock might prove serious to him  whats the matter asked mr canning starting forward  the news has been too much for him i replied  youve killed my father cried gus white with fear hes troubled with his heart and what you have said has done him up  i sincerely trust not replied the junior partner let us raise him up and some one go for a doctor  we made him as comfortable as possible and opened all the doors and windows then while gus hurried off for a physician mr canning applied his ear to the unconscious mans breast  his heart still beats he exclaimed i trust he gets over it  we procured some water and bathed my uncles face and mr canning poured some wine that was in the desk down his throat  is this report true he asked as we were doing what we could for the unfortunate man  yes sir it is  the junior partner shook his head  i have suspected mr stillwell for some time he said slowly i was not in the firm a week before i was sorry i had invested my money with them  do you think i am guilty  hardly foster but mr stillwell seemed so positive  i dont think the money was ever put in the safe sir i went on  what makes you think that  because mr stillwell was not acting rightly about my late fathers estate and as i was beginning to suspect him he wished to get me out of the way  ah i see i am afraid he has got himself in a bad fix  i am afraid so too but it is not my fault mr canning  a moment later gus returned with a doctor the physician shook his head when he beheld my uncle  i have been called to attend him once before he said he is not at all strong and this may prove worse than you imagine  will it be fatal i cried  i trust not but i cannot say for certain the best thing is to get him home where he can have perfect quiet  at these words gus began to shed tears i could not help but feel sorry for him and also for my aunt and my cousin lillian when they should hear the news  i went out and procured the easiest coach i could find and inside of it we placed mr stillwell with the physician beside him and gus on the seat with the driver  are you coming along asked my cousin  no but i will be up later i replied  we watched the coach out of sight up the busy street and then mr canning and i returned to the office  it is a bad state of affairs said the junior partner i doubt after what the doctor has said if your uncle ever puts foot in the office again  i hardly know what to do i replied  and to tell the truth my mind was in a whirl of excitement the unexpected turn of affairs bewildered me  while we were discussing matters there was a knock on the door and mr mason came in  what foster back already i knew you were coming but did not expect you so soon  did you receive mr ransons letter i asked  yes and came to have a talk with mr stillwell where is he  in a few words i told him what had happened the lawyer was much surprised  this will change things a great deal especially if your uncle does not recover he said i think we ought to go up to the house and see him  but he is very ill i began  all the more reason we should see him he may have something to say before his death if this stroke is fatal  i could not help but shiver at the words it seemed awful to me that my uncle should die at such a time when he was least prepared  ill do whatever you think best mr mason i replied  then come we will go at once delays are always dangerous  in a moment more we were on the way while seated in the elevated car he asked me to tell him my whole story and i did so just as i have written it here  will you let me see that letter from london he asked  i did so he read it carefully  i believe this nottington is right he said i have found that he is a gentleman in good standing and that counts for much  i wish mr banker had been my guardian from the start i replied  when we arrived at my uncles home i found that he had been brought in but ten minutes before the entire household was in a great state of alarm in consequence  we met my aunt in the lower hall no sooner did she catch sight of me than she swooped down upon me  you are to blame for all this luke foster she cried in her shrill voice  i cant see how i replied as calmly as i could  you are you upset him by robbing the safe and then running away  i dont think the boy is guilty madam put in mr mason we all make mistakes and  there is no mistake here if my husband dies this boy will be the sole cause  and without waiting for a reply mrs stillwell swept by us and up the stairs  i took mr mason into the parlor a room that i hardly knew although i had lived in the house about two years presently gus came down the stairs  you here he exclaimed what brought you havent you done harm enough  i dont want to do harm i thought i might just see your father and then go away  well he just asked for you was guss unexpected reply but ma said you werent to be let up  if he asked im going i said with a sudden determination  i ran up the stairs at once at the head i met mrs stillwell  where are you going she asked coldly  to see uncle felix  well i guess you are not  gus says he asked for me  i dont care you shall not see the poor man  excuse me madam but i will i replied and brushed past her and on to the door of my uncles room  she caught me by the arm  you just march downstairs she cried  is that luke came a feeble voice from within  yes uncle felix i hastened to reply  let him come in dear i must see him  with a very bad grace mrs stillwell allowed me to enter at first she was about to follow but her husband motioned her away and she was forced to withdraw  my uncle lay on the bed his face was deadly white and awfully haggard he held out his hand  im glad youve come luke he said with something that sounded like a sigh the doctor tells me i cannot last long  oh uncle felix  never mind it is for the best i have done wrong and death is better than public disgrace did you come alone  no sir mr mason is with me  mason  yes sir i asked him to come with me he is to be my lawyer if i am arrested  do not fear you will not be i own up that money was not stolen i was afraid you had brought with you the officers of the law do you know anything of thisthis spitfire affair  i know all about it i was on board the vessel when she burned  you  my uncle was greatly astonished and he finally persuaded me to tell my story when i had concluded he asked me to call up mr mason and i did so  the three of us were closeted for fully an hour what took place will be told hereafter  at the end of the interview my uncle was very weak the doctor was called in and he revived him but it was not for long he died at sundown  his funeral three days later was a large one made up not only of mourners but also of those who came out of curiosity to see the remains of the man who had lived such a double life     chapter xxxi  conclusion   my uncles deathbed revelation was a strange one in brief it was as follows  at the time my father and mother were killed he was in a sore financial strait and needed money to keep himself from failing and losing every dollar he possessed  he had applied to my father for relief and my parent was about to grant him considerable assistance when the fatal catastrophe occurred  mr stillwell had immediately taken a steamer for england and on arriving there took entire charge of my fathers affairs though not without some difficulty with the english bankers who held my fathers funds in trust  on examining my fathers private papers my uncle was not a little chagrined to find that mr banker was to be appointed my guardian there being a will to that effect a will that mr mason and i afterwards found among mr stillwells papers  mr banker was not on good terms with my uncle so the latter knew that if the former became my guardian the loan that my father had consented to make would most likely never be carried out in this predicament my uncle had taken his first wrong step he had hidden my fathers will and brought forth an old one in which he himself was named as guardian  this wrong step accomplished the rest was easy enough but my uncles original intention had been to treat me fairly just as if mr banker had been my guardian  yet in the end the temptation to use the money for his own benefit was too strong for him and he had ended by losing something like ten thousand dollars out of an estate worth fifty  it was then that he had met captain hannock who was an old school chum and been persuaded to go into the scheme that had ended so disastrously the remainder the reader already knows  by a paper drawn up by mr mason uncle felix placed the charge of his affairs entirely in the lawyers hands mr mason was to settle his estate pay all that was due to me over to mr banker my new guardian and then settle the remainder upon gus and lillian taking out of course my aunts share as his widow  although my uncle did not say so i am pretty well satisfied that much of his wrongdoing was attributable to his wife who was a very proud and extravagant woman this i think is why he left her no more than he did  the day before my uncles funeral mr banker came down to the city he shook me warmly by the hand and slyly asked me if i had enough of the sea  yes indeed i replied life on shipboard is well enough to read about but the city is good enough for me  and what do you propose to do now he asked  you are my guardian i suppose ill have to do as you wish me to  no luke you are old enough to choose for yourself  then let me say that i would like to go to college and finish the education my father intended i should have  so be it replied mr banker  all this happened six years ago during that time great changes have taken place  immediately after my uncles death my aunt removed to her former home in boston taking gus and lillian with her they never write to me or come to new york and i am content to leave them go their own way  captain hannock and lowell are both in prison the former with ten years to serve and the latter five crocker was discharged about a month ago i have never seen any of them since the day they were sentenced in the boston courtroom and i trust i never shall  mr oscar ranson still spends his time between the hub and the metropolis and in him i have a true friend phil jones has now a responsible position on the wharfs at a good salary and as the work just suits him he will no doubt rise rapidly his old aunt has become his guardian and she holds in trust for him two thousand dollars which captain hannock was compelled to pay over because it belonged to the cabin boys late father tony dibble is at sea  two years ago in company with harry banker i finished my course at college and now i am duly installed in mr masons office as his private clerk having a good home with my employer i am happy and that being so what more is there to say  the end
