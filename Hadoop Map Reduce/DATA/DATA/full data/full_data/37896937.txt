37896937	tom sawyer abroad  by mark twain     chapter i tom seeks new adventures  do you reckon tom sawyer was satisfied after all them adventures i mean the adventures we had down the river and the time we set the darky jim free and tom got shot in the leg no he wasnt it only just pisoned him for more that was all the effect it had you see when we three came back up the river in glory as you may say from that long travel and the village received us with a torchlight procession and speeches and everybody hurrahd and shouted it made us heroes and that was what tom sawyer had always been hankering to be  for a while he was satisfied everybody made much of him and he tilted up his nose and stepped around the town as though he owned it some called him tom sawyer the traveler and that just swelled him up fit to bust you see he laid over me and jim considerable because we only went down the river on a raft and came back by the steamboat but tom went by the steamboat both ways the boys envied me and jim a good deal but land they just knuckled to the dirt before tom  well i dont know maybe he might have been satisfied if it hadnt been for old nat parsons which was postmaster and powerful long and slim and kind o goodhearted and silly and baldheaded on account of his age and about the talkiest old cretur i ever see for as much as thirty years hed been the only man in the village that had a reputationi mean a reputation for being a traveler and of course he was mortal proud of it and it was reckoned that in the course of that thirty years he had told about that journey over a million times and enjoyed it every time and now comes along a boy not quite fifteen and sets everybody admiring and gawking over his travels and it just give the poor old man the high strikes it made him sick to listen to tom and to hear the people say my land did you ever my goodness sakes alive and all such things but he couldnt pull away from it any more than a fly thats got its hind leg fast in the molasses and always when tom come to a rest the poor old cretur would chip in on his same old travels and work them for all they were worth but they were pretty faded and didnt go for much and it was pitiful to see and then tom would take another innings and then the old man againand so on and so on for an hour and more each trying to beat out the other  you see parsons travels happened like this when he first got to be postmaster and was green in the business there come a letter for somebody he didnt know and there wasnt any such person in the village well he didnt know what to do nor how to act and there the letter stayed and stayed week in and week out till the bare sight of it gave him a conniption the postage wasnt paid on it and that was another thing to worry about there wasnt any way to collect that ten cents and he reckond the govment would hold him responsible for it and maybe turn him out besides when they found he hadnt collected it well at last he couldnt stand it any longer he couldnt sleep nights he couldnt eat he was thinned down to a shadder yet he dasnt ask anybodys advice for the very person he asked for advice might go back on him and let the govment know about the letter he had the letter buried under the floor but that did no good if he happened to see a person standing over the place itd give him the cold shivers and loaded him up with suspicions and he would sit up that night till the town was still and dark and then he would sneak there and get it out and bury it in another place of course people got to avoiding him and shaking their heads and whispering because the way he was looking and acting they judged he had killed somebody or done something terrible they didnt know what and if he had been a stranger they wouldve lynched him  well as i was saying it got so he couldnt stand it any longer so he made up his mind to pull out for washington and just go to the president of the united states and make a clean breast of the whole thing not keeping back an atom and then fetch the letter out and lay it before the whole govment and say now there she isdo with me what youre a mind to though as heaven is my judge i am an innocent man and not deserving of the full penalties of the law and leaving behind me a family that must starve and yet hadnt had a thing to do with it which is the whole truth and i can swear to it  so he did it he had a little wee bit of steamboating and some stagecoaching but all the rest of the way was horseback and it took him three weeks to get to washington he saw lots of land and lots of villages and four cities he was gone most eight weeks and there never was such a proud man in the village as he when he got back his travels made him the greatest man in all that region and the most talked about and people come from as much as thirty miles back in the country and from over in the illinois bottoms too just to look at himand there theyd stand and gawk and hed gabble you never see anything like it  well there wasnt any way now to settle which was the greatest traveler some said it was nat some said it was tom everybody allowed that nat had seen the most longitude but they had to give in that whatever tom was short in longitude he had made up in latitude and climate it was about a standoff so both of them had to whoop up their dangerous adventures and try to get ahead that way that bulletwound in toms leg was a tough thing for nat parsons to buck against but he bucked the best he could and at a disadvantage too for tom didnt set still as hed orter done to be fair but always got up and sauntered around and worked his limp while nat was painting up the adventure that he had in washington for tom never let go that limp when his leg got well but practiced it nights at home and kept it good as new right along  nats adventure was like this i dont know how true it is maybe he got it out of a paper or somewhere but i will say this for him that he did know how to tell it he could make anybodys flesh crawl and hed turn pale and hold his breath when he told it and sometimes women and girls got so faint they couldnt stick it out well it was this way as near as i can remember  he come aloping into washington and put up his horse and shoved out to the presidents house with his letter and they told him the president was up to the capitol and just going to start for philadelphianot a minute to lose if he wanted to catch him nat most dropped it made him so sick his horse was put up and he didnt know what to do but just then along comes a darky driving an old ramshackly hack and he see his chance he rushes out and shouts a half a dollar if you git me to the capitol in half an hour and a quarter extra if you do it in twenty minutes  done says the darky  nat he jumped in and slammed the door and away they went aripping and atearing over the roughest road a body ever see and the racket of it was something awful nat passed his arms through the loops and hung on for life and death but pretty soon the hack hit a rock and flew up in the air and the bottom fell out and when it come down nats feet was on the ground and he see he was in the most desperate danger if he couldnt keep up with the hack he was horrible scared but he laid into his work for all he was worth and hung tight to the armloops and made his legs fairly fly he yelled and shouted to the driver to stop and so did the crowds along the street for they could see his legs spinning along under the coach and his head and shoulders bobbing inside through the windows and he was in awful danger but the more they all shouted the more the nigger whooped and yelled and lashed the horses and shouted dont you fret ise gwine to git you dah in time boss is gwine to do it sho for you see he thought they were all hurrying him up and of course he couldnt hear anything for the racket he was making and so they went ripping along and everybody just petrified to see it and when they got to the capitol at last it was the quickest trip that ever was made and everybody said so the horses laid down and nat dropped all tuckered out and he was all dust and rags and barefooted but he was in time and just in time and caught the president and give him the letter and everything was all right and the president give him a free pardon on the spot and nat give the nigger two extra quarters instead of one because he could see that if he hadnt had the hack he wouldnta got there in time nor anywhere near it  it was a powerful good adventure and tom sawyer had to work his bulletwound mighty lively to hold his own against it  well by and by toms glory got to paling down graduly on account of other things turning up for the people to talk aboutfirst a horserace and on top of that a house afire and on top of that the circus and on top of that the eclipse and that started a revival same as it always does and by that time there wasnt any more talk about tom so to speak and you never see a person so sick and disgusted  pretty soon he got to worrying and fretting right along day in and day out and when i asked him what was he in such a state about he said it most broke his heart to think how time was slipping away and him getting older and older and no wars breaking out and no way of making a name for himself that he could see now that is the way boys is always thinking but he was the first one i ever heard come out and say it  so then he set to work to get up a plan to make him celebrated and pretty soon he struck it and offered to take me and jim in tom sawyer was always free and generous that way theres aplenty of boys thats mighty good and friendly when youve got a good thing but when a good thing happens to come their way they dont say a word to you and try to hog it all that warnt ever tom sawyers way i can say that for him theres plenty of boys that will come hankering and groveling around you when youve got an apple and beg the core off of you but when theyve got one and you beg for the core and remind them how you give them a core one time they say thank you most to death but there aint agoing to be no core but i notice they always git come up with all you got to do is to wait  well we went out in the woods on the hill and tom told us what it was it was a crusade  whats a crusade i says  he looked scornful the way hes always done when he was ashamed of a person and says  huck finn do you mean to tell me you dont know what a crusade is  no says i i dont and i dont care to nuther ive lived till now and done without it and had my health too but as soon as you tell me ill know and thats soon enough i dont see any use in finding out things and clogging up my head with them when i maynt ever have any occasion to use em there was lance williams he learned how to talk choctaw here till one come and dug his grave for him now then whats a crusade but i can tell you one thing before you begin if its a patentright theres no money in it bill thompson he  patentright says he i never see such an idiot why a crusade is a kind of war  i thought he must be losing his mind but no he was in real earnest and went right on perfectly cam  a crusade is a war to recover the holy land from the paynim  which holy land  why the holy landthere aint but one  what do we want of it  why cant you understand its in the hands of the paynim and its our duty to take it away from them  how did we come to let them git hold of it  we didnt come to let them git hold of it they always had it  why tom then it must belong to them dont it  why of course it does who said it didnt  i studied over it but couldnt seem to git at the right of it no way i says  its too many for me tom sawyer if i had a farm and it was mine and another person wanted it would it be right for him to  oh shucks you dont know enough to come in when it rains huck finn it aint a farm its entirely different you see its like this they own the land just the mere land and thats all they do own but it was our folks our jews and christians that made it holy and so they havent any business to be there defiling it its a shame and we ought not to stand it a minute we ought to march against them and take it away from them  why it does seem to me its the most mixedup thing i ever see now if i had a farm and another person  dont i tell you it hasnt got anything to do with farming farming is business just common lowdown business thats all it is its all you can say for it but this is higher this is religious and totally different  religious to go and take the land away from people that owns it  certainly its always been considered so  jim he shook his head and says  mars tom i reckon deys a mistake about it somersdey mos sholy is is religious myself en i knows plenty religious people but i haint run across none dat acts like dat  it made tom hot and he says  well its enough to make a body sick such mulletheaded ignorance if either of youd read anything about history youd know that richard cur de loon and the pope and godfrey de bulleyn and lots more of the most noblehearted and pious people in the world hacked and hammered at the paynims for more than two hundred years trying to take their land away from them and swum neckdeep in blood the whole timeand yet heres a couple of sapheaded country yahoos out in the backwoods of missouri setting themselves up to know more about the rights and wrongs of it than they did talk about cheek  well of course that put a more different light on it and me and jim felt pretty cheap and ignorant and wished we hadnt been quite so chipper i couldnt say nothing and jim he couldnt for a while then he says  well den i reckon its all right becase ef dey didnt know dey aint no use for po ignorant folks like us to be trying to know en so ef its our duty we got to go en tackle it en do de bes we can same time i feel as sorry for dem paynims as mars tom de hard part gwine to be to kill folks dat a body haint been quainted wid and dat haint done him no harm dats it you see ef we wuz to go mongst em jist we three en say wes hungry en ast em for a bite to eat why maybe deys jist like yuther people dont you reckon dey is why deyd give it i know dey would en den  then what  well mars tom my idea is like dis it aint no use we cant kill dem po strangers dat aint doin us no harm till weve had practicei knows it perfectly well mars tomdeed i knows it perfectly well but ef we takes a axe or two jist you en me en huck en slips acrost de river tonight arter de moons gone down en kills dat sick famly dats over on the sny en burns dey house down en  oh you make me tired says tom i dont want to argue any more with people like you and huck finn thats always wandering from the subject and aint got any more sense than to try to reason out a thing thats pure theology by the laws that protect real estate  now thats just where tom sawyer warnt fair jim didnt mean no harm and i didnt mean no harm we knowed well enough that he was right and we was wrong and all we was after was to get at the how of it and that was all and the only reason he couldnt explain it so we could understand it was because we was ignorantyes and pretty dull too i aint denying that but land that aint no crime i should think  but he wouldnt hear no more about itjust said if we had tackled the thing in the proper spirit he would a raised a couple of thousand knights and put them in steel armor from head to heel and made me a lieutenant and jim a sutler and took the command himself and brushed the whole paynim outfit into the sea like flies and come back across the world in a glory like sunset but he said we didnt know enough to take the chance when we had it and he wouldnt ever offer it again and he didnt when he once got set you couldnt budge him  but i didnt care much i am peaceable and dont get up rows with people that aint doing nothing to me i allowed if the paynim was satisfied i was and we would let it stand at that  now tom he got all that notion out of walter scotts book which he was always reading and it was a wild notion because in my opinion he never couldve raised the men and if he did as like as not he wouldve got licked i took the book and read all about it and as near as i could make it out most of the folks that shook farming to go crusading had a mighty rocky time of it    chapter ii the balloon ascension  well tom got up one thing after another but they all had tender spots about em somewheres and he had to shove em aside so at last he was about in despair then the st louis papers begun to talk a good deal about the balloon that was going to sail to europe and tom sort of thought he wanted to go down and see what it looked like but couldnt make up his mind but the papers went on talking and so he allowed that maybe if he didnt go he mightnt ever have another chance to see a balloon and next he found out that nat parsons was going down to see it and that decided him of course he wasnt going to have nat parsons coming back bragging about seeing the balloon and him having to listen to it and keep quiet so he wanted me and jim to go too and we went  it was a noble big balloon and had wings and fans and all sorts of things and wasnt like any balloon you see in pictures it was away out toward the edge of town in a vacant lot corner of twelfth street and there was a big crowd around it making fun of it and making fun of the mana lean pale feller with that soft kind of moonlight in his eyes you knowand they kept saying it wouldnt go it made him hot to hear them and he would turn on them and shake his fist and say they was animals and blind but some day they would find they had stood face to face with one of the men that lifts up nations and makes civilizations and was too dull to know it and right here on this spot their own children and grandchildren would build a monument to him that would outlast a thousand years but his name would outlast the monument and then the crowd would burst out in a laugh again and yell at him and ask him what was his name before he was married and what he would take to not do it and what was his sisters cats grandmothers name and all the things that a crowd says when theyve got hold of a feller that they see they can plague well some things they said was funnyyes and mighty witty too i aint denying thatbut all the same it warnt fair nor brave all them people pitching on one and they so glib and sharp and him without any gift of talk to answer back with but good land what did he want to sass back for you see it couldnt do him no good and it was just nuts for them they had him you know but that was his way i reckon he couldnt help it he was made so i judge he was a good enough sort of cretur and hadnt no harm in him and was just a genius as the papers said which wasnt his fault we cant all be sound weve got to be the way were made as near as i can make out geniuses think they know it all and so they wont take peoples advice but always go their own way which makes everybody forsake them and despise them and that is perfectly natural if they was humbler and listened and tried to learn it would be better for them  the part the professor was in was like a boat and was big and roomy and had watertight lockers around the inside to keep all sorts of things in and a body could sit on them and make beds on them too we went aboard and there was twenty people there snooping around and examining and old nat parsons was there too the professor kept fussing around getting ready and the people went ashore drifting out one at a time and old nat he was the last of course it wouldnt do to let him go out behind us we mustnt budge till he was gone so we could be last ourselves  but he was gone now so it was time for us to follow i heard a big shout and turned aroundthe city was dropping from under us like a shot it made me sick all through i was so scared jim turned gray and couldnt say a word and tom didnt say nothing but looked excited the city went on dropping down and down and down but we didnt seem to be doing nothing but just hang in the air and stand still the houses got smaller and smaller and the city pulled itself together closer and closer and the men and wagons got to looking like ants and bugs crawling around and the streets like threads and cracks and then it all kind of melted together and there wasnt any city any more it was only a big scar on the earth and it seemed to me a body could see up the river and down the river about a thousand miles though of course it wasnt so much by and by the earth was a balljust a round ball of a dull color with shiny stripes wriggling and winding around over it which was rivers the widder douglas always told me the earth was round like a ball but i never took any stock in a lot of them superstitions o hers and of course i paid no attention to that one because i could see myself that the world was the shape of a plate and flat i used to go up on the hill and take a look around and prove it for myself because i reckon the best way to get a sure thing on a fact is to go and examine for yourself and not take anybodys sayso but i had to give in now that the widder was right that is she was right as to the rest of the world but she warnt right about the part our village is in that part is the shape of a plate and flat i take my oath  the professor had been quiet all this time as if he was asleep but he broke loose now and he was mighty bitter he says something like this  idiots they said it wouldnt go and they wanted to examine it and spy around and get the secret of it out of me but i beat them nobody knows the secret but me nobody knows what makes it move but me and its a new powera new power and a thousand times the strongest in the earth steams foolishness to it they said i couldnt go to europe to europe why theres power aboard to last five years and feed for three months they are fools what do they know about it yes and they said my airship was flimsy why shes good for fifty years i can sail the skies all my life if i want to and steer where i please though they laughed at that and said i couldnt couldnt steer come here boy well see you press these buttons as i tell you  he made tom steer the ship all about and every which way and learnt him the whole thing in nearly no time and tom said it was perfectly easy he made him fetch the ship down most to the earth and had him spin her along so close to the illinois prairies that a body could talk to the farmers and hear everything they said perfectly plain and he flung out printed bills to them that told about the balloon and said it was going to europe tom got so he could steer straight for a tree till he got nearly to it and then dart up and skin right along over the top of it yes and he showed tom how to land her and he done it firstrate too and set her down in the prairies as soft as wool but the minute we started to skip out the professor says no you dont and shot her up in the air again it was awful i begun to beg and so did jim but it only give his temper a rise and he begun to rage around and look wild out of his eyes and i was scared of him  well then he got on to his troubles again and mourned and grumbled about the way he was treated and couldnt seem to git over it and especially peoples saying his ship was flimsy he scoffed at that and at their saying she warnt simple and would be always getting out of order get out of order that graveled him he said that she couldnt any more get out of order than the solar sister  he got worse and worse and i never see a person take on so it give me the cold shivers to see him and so it did jim by and by he got to yelling and screaming and then he swore the world shouldnt ever have his secret at all now it had treated him so mean he said he would sail his balloon around the globe just to show what he could do and then he would sink it in the sea and sink us all along with it too well it was the awfulest fix to be in and here was night coming on  he give us something to eat and made us go to the other end of the boat and he laid down on a locker where he could boss all the works and put his old pepperbox revolver under his head and said if anybody come fooling around there trying to land her he would kill him  we set scrunched up together and thought considerable but didnt say muchonly just a word once in a while when a body had to say something or bust we was so scared and worried the night dragged along slow and lonesome we was pretty low down and the moonshine made everything soft and pretty and the farmhouses looked snug and homeful and we could hear the farm sounds and wished we could be down there but laws we just slipped along over them like a ghost and never left a track  away in the night when all the sounds was late sounds and the air had a late feel and a late smell tooabout a twooclock feel as near as i could make outtom said the professor was so quiet this time he must be asleep and wed better  better what i says in a whisper and feeling sick all over because i knowed what he was thinking about  better slip back there and tie him and land the ship he says  i says no sir don you budge tom sawyer  and jimwell jim was kind o gasping he was so scared he says  oh mars tom dont ef you teches him wes gonewes gone sho i aint gwine anear him not for nothin in dis worl mars tom hes plumb crazy  tom whispers and saysthats why weve got to do something if he wasnt crazy i wouldnt give shucks to be anywhere but here you couldnt hire me to get outnow that ive got used to this balloon and over the scare of being cut loose from the solid groundif he was in his right mind but its no good politics sailing around like this with a person thats out of his head and says hes going round the world and then drown us all weve got to do something i tell you and do it before he wakes up too or we maynt ever get another chance come  but it made us turn cold and creepy just to think of it and we said we wouldnt budge so tom was for slipping back there by himself to see if he couldnt get at the steeringgear and land the ship we begged and begged him not to but it warnt no use so he got down on his hands and knees and begun to crawl an inch at a time we aholding our breath and watching after he got to the middle of the boat he crept slower than ever and it did seem like years to me but at last we see him get to the professors head and sort of raise up soft and look a good spell in his face and listen then we see him begin to inch along again toward the professors feet where the steeringbuttons was well he got there all safe and was reaching slow and steady toward the buttons but he knocked down something that made a noise and we see him slump down flat an soft in the bottom and lay still the professor stirred and says whats that but everybody kept dead still and quiet and he begun to mutter and mumble and nestle like a person thats going to wake up and i thought i was going to die i was so worried and scared  then a cloud slid over the moon and i most cried i was so glad she buried herself deeper and deeper into the cloud and it got so dark we couldnt see tom then it began to sprinkle rain and we could hear the professor fussing at his ropes and things and abusing the weather we was afraid every minute he would touch tom and then we would be goners and no help but tom was already on his way back and when we felt his hands on our knees my breath stopped sudden and my heart fell down mongst my other works because i couldnt tell in the dark but it might be the professor which i thought it was  dear i was so glad to have him back that i was just as near happy as a person could be that was up in the air that way with a deranged man you cant land a balloon in the dark and so i hoped it would keep on raining for i didnt want tom to go meddling any more and make us so awful uncomfortable well i got my wish it drizzled and drizzled along the rest of the night which wasnt long though it did seem so and at daybreak it cleared and the world looked mighty soft and gray and pretty and the forests and fields so good to see again and the horses and cattle standing sober and thinking next the sun come ablazing up gay and splendid and then we began to feel rusty and stretchy and first we knowed we was all asleep    chapter iii tom explains  we went to sleep about four oclock and woke up about eight the professor was setting back there at his end looking glum he pitched us some breakfast but he told us not to come abaft the midship compass that was about the middle of the boat well when you are sharpset and you eat and satisfy yourself everything looks pretty different from what it done before it makes a body feel pretty near comfortable even when he is up in a balloon with a genius we got to talking together  there was one thing that kept bothering me and by and by i says  tom didnt we start east  yes  how fast have we been going  well you heard what the professor said when he was raging round sometimes he said we was making fifty miles an hour sometimes ninety sometimes a hundred said that with a gale to help he could make three hundred any time and said if he wanted the gale and wanted it blowing the right direction he only had to go up higher or down lower to find it  well then its just as i reckoned the professor lied  why  because if we was going so fast we ought to be past illinois oughtnt we  certainly  well we aint  whats the reason we aint  i know by the color were right over illinois yet and you can see for yourself that indiana aint in sight  i wonder whats the matter with you huck you know by the color  yes of course i do  whats the color got to do with it  its got everything to do with it illinois is green indiana is pink you show me any pink down here if you can no sir its green  indiana pink why what a lie  it aint no lie ive seen it on the map and its pink  you never see a person so aggravated and disgusted he says  well if i was such a numbskull as you huck finn i would jump over seen it on the map huck finn did you reckon the states was the same color outofdoors as they are on the map  tom sawyer whats a map for aint it to learn you facts  of course  well then hows it going to do that if it tells lies thats what i want to know  shucks you muggins it dont tell lies  it dont dont it  no it dont  all right then if it dont there aint no two states the same color you git around that if you can tom sawyer  he see i had him and jim see it too and i tell you i felt pretty good for tom sawyer was always a hard person to git ahead of jim slapped his leg and says  i tell you dats smart dats right down smart aint no use mars tom he got you dis time sho he slapped his leg again and says my lan but it was smart one  i never felt so good in my life and yet i didnt know i was saying anything much till it was out i was just mooning along perfectly careless and not expecting anything was going to happen and never thinking of such a thing at all when all of a sudden out it came why it was just as much a surprise to me as it was to any of them it was just the same way it is when a person is munching along on a hunk of cornpone and not thinking about anything and all of a sudden bites into a dimond now all that he knows first off is that its some kind of gravel hes bit into but he dont find out its a dimond till he gits it out and brushes off the sand and crumbs and one thing or another and has a look at it and then hes surprised and gladyes and proud too though when you come to look the thing straight in the eye he aint entitled to as much credit as he would a been if hed been hunting dimonds you can see the difference easy if you think it over you see an accident that way aint fairly as big a thing as a thing thats done apurpose anybody could find that dimond in that cornpone but mind you its got to be somebody thats got that kind of a cornpone thats where that fellers credit comes in you see and thats where mine comes in i dont claim no great thingsi dont reckon i could a done it againbut i done it that time thats all i claim and i hadnt no more idea i could do such a thing and warnt any more thinking about it or trying to than you be this minute why i was just as cam a body couldnt be any camer and yet all of a sudden out it come ive often thought of that time and i can remember just the way everything looked same as if it was only last week i can see it all beautiful rolling country with woods and fields and lakes for hundreds and hundreds of miles all around and towns and villages scattered everywheres under us here and there and yonder and the professor mooning over a chart on his little table and toms cap flopping in the rigging where it was hung up to dry and one thing in particular was a bird right alongside not ten foot off going our way and trying to keep up but losing ground all the time and a railroad train doing the same thing down there sliding among the trees and farms and pouring out a long cloud of black smoke and now and then a little puff of white and when the white was gone so long you had almost forgot it you would hear a little faint toot and that was the whistle and we left the bird and the train both behind way behind and done it easy too  but tom he was huffy and said me and jim was a couple of ignorant blatherskites and then he says  suppose theres a brown calf and a big brown dog and an artist is making a picture of them what is the main thing that that artist has got to do he has got to paint them so you can tell them apart the minute you look at them haint he of course well then do you want him to go and paint both of them brown certainly you dont he paints one of them blue and then you cant make no mistake its just the same with the maps thats why they make every state a different color it aint to deceive you its to keep you from deceiving yourself  but i couldnt see no argument about that and neither could jim jim shook his head and says  why mars tom if you knowed what chuckleheads dem painters is youd wait a long time before youd fetch one er dem in to back up a fac is gwine to tell you den you kin see for youself i see one of em apaintin away one day down in ole hank wilsons back lot en i went down to see en he was paintin dat old brindle cow wid de near horn goneyou knows de one i means en i ast him what hes paintin her for en he say when he git her painted de pictures wuth a hundred dollars mars tom he could a got de cow fer fifteen en i tole him so well sah if youll blieve me he jes shuck his head dat painter did en went on adobbin bless you mars tom dey dont know nothin  tom lost his temper i notice a person most always does thats got laid out in an argument he told us to shut up and maybe wed feel better then he see a town clock away off down yonder and he took up the glass and looked at it and then looked at his silver turnip and then at the clock and then at the turnip again and says  thats funny that clocks near about an hour fast  so he put up his turnip then he see another clock and took a look and it was an hour fast too that puzzled him  thats a mighty curious thing he says i dont understand it  then he took the glass and hunted up another clock and sure enough it was an hour fast too then his eyes began to spread and his breath to come out kinder gaspy like and he says  gerreat scott its the longitude  i says considerably scared  well whats been and gone and happened now  why the thing thats happened is that this old bladder has slid over illinois and indiana and ohio like nothing and this is the east end of pennsylvania or new york or somewheres around there  tom sawyer you dont mean it  yes i do and its dead sure weve covered about fifteen degrees of longitude since we left st louis yesterday afternoon and them clocks are right weve come close on to eight hundred miles  i didnt believe it but it made the cold streaks trickle down my back just the same in my experience i knowed it wouldnt take much short of two weeks to do it down the mississippi on a raft jim was working his mind and studying pretty soon he says  mars tom did you say dem clocks uz right  yes theyre right  aint yo watch right too  shes right for st louis

an hours diffunce everywhah mars tom  an hour no its four minutes difference for every degree of longitude you know fifteen of ems an hour thirty of ems two hours and so on when its one clock tuesday morning in england its eight oclock the night before in new york  jim moved a little way along the locker and you could see he was insulted he kept shaking his head and muttering and so i slid along to him and patted him on the leg and petted him up and got him over the worst of his feelings and then he says  mars tom talkin sich talk as dat choosday in one place en monday in tother bofe in the

and says  den dat monday could be de las day en dey wouldnt be no las day in england en de dead wouldnt be called we mustnt go over dah mars tom please git him to turn back i wants to be whah  all of a sudden we see something and all jumped up and forgot everything and begun to gaze tom says  aint that the he catched his breath then says it is sure as you live its the ocean  that made me and jim catch our breath too then we all stood petrified but happy for none of us had ever seen an ocean or ever expected to tom kept muttering  atlantic oceanatlantic land dont it sound great and thats itand we are looking at itwe why its just too splendid to believe  then we see a big bank of black smoke and when we got nearer it was a cityand a monster she was too with a thick fringe of ships around one edge and we wondered if it was new york and begun to jaw and dispute about it and first we knowed it slid from under us and went flying behind and here we was out over the very ocean itself and going like a cyclone then we woke up i tell you  we made a break aft and raised a wail and begun to beg the professor to turn back and land us but he jerked out his pistol and motioned us back and we went but nobody will ever know how bad we felt  the land was gone all but a little streak like a snake away off on the edge of the water and down under us was just ocean ocean oceanmillions of miles of it heaving and pitching and squirming and white sprays blowing from the wavetops and only a few ships in sight wallowing around and laying over first on one side and then on tother and sticking their bows under and then their sterns and before long there warnt no ships at all and we had the sky and the whole ocean all to ourselves and the roomiest place i ever see and the lonesomest    chapter iv storm  and it got lonesomer and lonesomer there was the big sky up there empty and awful deep and the ocean down there without a thing on it but just the waves all around us was a ring where the sky and the water come together yes a monstrous big ring it was and we right in the dead center of itplumb in the center we was racing along like a prairie fire but it never made any difference we couldnt seem to git past that center no way i couldnt see that we ever gained an inch on that ring it made a body feel creepy it was so curious and unaccountable  well everything was so awful still that we got to talking in a very low voice and kept on getting creepier and lonesomer and less and less talky till at last the talk ran dry altogether and we just set there and thunk as jim calls it and never said a word the longest time  the professor never stirred till the sun was overhead then he stood up and put a kind of triangle to his eye and tom said it was a sextant and he was taking the sun to see whereabouts the balloon was then he ciphered a little and looked in a book and then he begun to carry on again he said lots of wild things and among others he said he would keep up this hundredmile gait till the middle of tomorrow afternoon and then hed land in london  we said we would be humbly thankful  he was turning away but he whirled around when we said that and give us a long look of his blackest kindone of the maliciousest and suspiciousest looks i ever see then he says  you want to leave me dont try to deny it  we didnt know what to say so we held in and didnt say nothing at all  he went aft and set down but he couldnt seem to git that thing out of his mind every now and then he would rip out something about it and try to make us answer him but we dasnt  it got lonesomer and lonesomer right along and it did seem to me i couldnt stand it it was still worse when night begun to come on by and by tom pinched me and whispers  look  i took a glance aft and see the professor taking a whet out of a bottle i didnt like the looks of that by and by he took another drink and pretty soon he begun to sing it was dark now and getting black and stormy he went on singing wilder and wilder and the thunder begun to mutter and the wind to wheeze and moan among the ropes and altogether it was awful it got so black we couldnt see him any more and wished we couldnt hear him but we could then he got still but he warnt still ten minutes till we got suspicious and wished he would start up his noise again so we could tell where he was by and by there was a flash of lightning and we see him start to get up but he staggered and fell down we heard him scream out in the dark  they dont want to go to england all right ill change the course they want to leave me i know they do well they shalland now  i most died when he said that then he was still againstill so long i couldnt bear it and it did seem to me the lightning wouldnt ever come again but at last there was a blessed flash and there he was on his hands and knees crawling and not four feet from us my but his eyes was terrible he made a lunge for tom and says overboard you go but it was already pitchdark again and i couldnt see whether he got him or not and tom didnt make a sound  there was another long horrible wait then there was a flash and i see toms head sink down outside the boat and disappear he was on the ropeladder that dangled down in the air from the gunnel the professor let off a shout and jumped for him and straight off it was pitchdark again and jim groaned out po mars tom hes a goner and made a jump for the professor but the professor warnt there  then we heard a couple of terrible screams and then another not so loud and then another that was way below and you could only just hear it and i heard jim say po mars tom  then it was awful still and i reckon a person could a counted four thousand before the next flash come when it come i see jim on his knees with his arms on the locker and his face buried in them and he was crying before i could look over the edge it was all dark again and i was glad because i didnt want to see but when the next flash come i was watching and down there i see somebody aswinging in the wind on the ladder and it was tom  come up i shouts come up tom  his voice was so weak and the wind roared so i couldnt make out what he said but i thought he asked was the professor up there i shouts  no hes down in the ocean come up can we help you  of course all this in the dark  huck who is you hollerin at  im hollerin at tom  oh huck how kin you act so when you know po mars tom then he let off an awful scream and flung his head and his arms back and let off another one because there was a white glare just then and he had raised up his face just in time to see toms as white as snow rise above the gunnel and look him right in the eye he thought it was toms ghost you see  tom clumb aboard and when jim found it was him and not his ghost he hugged him and called him all sorts of loving names and carried on like he was gone crazy he was so glad says i  what did you wait for tom why didnt you come up at first  i dasnt huck i knowed somebody plunged down past me but i didnt know who it was in the dark it could a been you it could a been jim  that was the way with tom sawyeralways sound he warnt coming up till he knowed where the professor was  the storm let go about this time with all its might and it was dreadful the way the thunder boomed and tore and the lightning glared out and the wind sung and screamed in the rigging and the rain come down one second you couldnt see your hand before you and the next you could count the threads in your coatsleeve and see a whole wide desert of waves pitching and tossing through a kind of veil of rain a storm like that is the loveliest thing there is but it aint at its best when you are up in the sky and lost and its wet and lonesome and theres just been a death in the family  we set there huddled up in the bow and talked low about the poor professor and everybody was sorry for him and sorry the world had made fun of him and treated him so harsh when he was doing the best he could and hadnt a friend nor nobody to encourage him and keep him from brooding his mind away and going deranged there was plenty of clothes and blankets and everything at the other end but we thought wed ruther take the rain than go meddling back there    chapter v land  we tried to make some plans but we couldnt come to no agreement me and jim was for turning around and going back home but tom allowed that by the time daylight come so we could see our way we would be so far toward england that we might as well go there and come back in a ship and have the glory of saying we done it  about midnight the storm quit and the moon come out and lit up the ocean and we begun to feel comfortable and drowsy so we stretched out on the lockers and went to sleep and never woke up again till sunup the sea was sparkling like dimonds and it was nice weather and pretty soon our things was all dry again  we went aft to find some breakfast and the first thing we noticed was that there was a dim light burning in a compass back there under a hood then tom was disturbed he says  you know what that means easy enough it means that somebody has got to stay on watch and steer this thing the same as he would a ship or shell wander around and go wherever the wind wants her to  well i says whats she been doing sinceersince we had the accident  wandering he says kinder troubledwandering without any doubt shes in a wind now thats blowing her south of east we dont know how long thats been going on either  so then he pinted her east and said he would hold her there till we rousted out the breakfast the professor had laid in everything a body could want he couldnt a been better fixed there wasnt no milk for the coffee but there was water and everything else you could want and a charcoal stove and the fixings for it and pipes and cigars and matches and wine and liquor which warnt in our line and books and maps and charts and an accordion and furs and blankets and no end of rubbish like brass beads and brass jewelry which tom said was a sure sign that he had an idea of visiting among savages there was money too yes the professor was well enough fixed  after breakfast tom learned me and jim how to steer and divided us all up into fourhour watches turn and turn about and when his watch was out i took his place and he got out the professors papers and pens and wrote a letter home to his aunt polly telling her everything that had happened to us and dated it in the welkin approaching england and folded it together and stuck it fast with a red wafer and directed it and wrote above the direction in big writing from tom sawyer the erronort and said it would stump old nat parsons the postmaster when it come along in the mail i says  tom sawyer this aint no welkin its a balloon  well now who said it was a welkin smarty  youve wrote it on the letter anyway  what of it that dont mean that the balloons the welkin  oh i thought it did well then what is a welkin  i see in a minute he was stuck he raked and scraped around in his mind but he couldnt find nothing so he had to say  i dont know and nobody dont know its just a word and its a mighty good word too there aint many that lays over it i dont believe theres any that does  shucks i says but what does it meanthats the pint  i dont know what it means i tell you its a word that people uses forforwell its ornamental they dont put ruffles on a shirt to keep a person warm do they  course they dont  but they put them on dont they  yes  all right then that letter i wrote is a shirt and the welkins the ruffle on it  i judged that that would gravel jim and it did  now mars tom it aint no use to talk like dat en moreover its sinful you knows a letter aint no shirt en dey aint no ruffles on it nuther dey aint no place to put em on you cant put em on and dey wouldnt stay ef you did  oh do shut up and wait till somethings started that you know something about  why mars tom sholy you cant mean to say i dont know about shirts when goodness knows is toted home de washin ever sence  i tell you this hasnt got anything to do with shirts i only  why mars tom you said yoself dat a letter  do you want to drive me crazy keep still i only used it as a metaphor  that word kinder bricked us up for a minute then jim saysrather timid because he see tom was getting pretty tetchy  mars tom what is a metaphor  a metaphors awell its aaa metaphors an illustration he see that didnt git home so he tried again when i say birds of a feather flocks together its a metaphorical way of saying  but dey dont mars tom no sir deed dey dont dey aint no feathers dats more alike den a bluebird en a jaybird but ef you waits till you catches dem birds together youll  oh give us a rest you cant get the simplest little thing through your thick skull now dont bother me any more  jim was satisfied to stop he was dreadful pleased with himself for catching tom out the minute tom begun to talk about birds i judged he was a goner because jim knowed more about birds than both of us put together you see he had killed hundreds and hundreds of them and thats the way to find out about birds thats the way people does that writes books about birds and loves them so that theyll go hungry and tired and take any amount of trouble to find a new bird and kill it their name is ornithologers and i could have been an ornithologer myself because i always loved birds and creatures and i started out to learn how to be one and i see a bird setting on a limb of a high tree singing with its head tilted back and its mouth open and before i thought i fired and his song stopped and he fell straight down from the limb all limp like a rag and i run and picked him up and he was dead and his body was warm in my hand and his head rolled about this way and that like his neck was broke and there was a little white skin over his eyes and one little drop of blood on the side of his head and laws i couldnt see nothing more for the tears and i haint never murdered no creature since that warnt doing me no harm and i aint going to  but i was aggravated about that welkin i wanted to know i got the subject up again and then tom explained the best he could he said when a person made a big speech the newspapers said the shouts of the people made the welkin ring he said they always said that but none of them ever told what it was so he allowed it just meant outdoors and up high well that seemed sensible enough so i was satisfied and said so that pleased tom and put him in a good humor again and he says  well its all right then and well let bygones be bygones i dont know for certain what a welkin is but when we land in london well make it ring anyway and dont you forget it  he said an erronort was a person who sailed around in balloons and said it was a mighty sight finer to be tom sawyer the erronort than to be tom sawyer the traveler and we would be heard of all round the world if we pulled through all right and so he wouldnt give shucks to be a traveler now  toward the middle of the afternoon we got everything ready to land and we felt pretty good too and proud and we kept watching with the glasses like columbus discovering america but we couldnt see nothing but ocean the afternoon wasted out and the sun shut down and still there warnt no land anywheres we wondered what was the matter but reckoned it would come out all right so we went on steering east but went up on a higher level so we wouldnt hit any steeples or mountains in the dark  it was my watch till midnight and then it was jims but tom stayed up because he said ship captains done that when they was making the land and didnt stand no regular watch  well when daylight come jim give a shout and we jumped up and looked over and there was the land sure enoughland all around as far as you could see and perfectly level and yaller we didnt know how long wed been over it there warnt no trees nor hills nor rocks nor towns and tom and jim had took it for the sea they took it for the sea in a dead cam but we was so high up anyway that if it had been the sea and rough it would a looked smooth all the same in the night that way  we was all in a powerful excitement now and grabbed the glasses and hunted everywheres for london but couldnt find hair nor hide of it nor any other settlementnor any sign of a lake or a river either tom was clean beat he said it warnt his notion of england he thought england looked like america and always had that idea so he said we better have breakfast and then drop down and inquire the quickest way to london we cut the breakfast pretty short we was so impatient as we slanted along down the weather began to moderate and pretty soon we shed our furs but it kept on moderating and in a precious little while it was most too moderate we was close down now and just blistering  we settled down to within thirty foot of the landthat is it was land if sand is land for this wasnt anything but pure sand tom and me clumb down the ladder and took a run to stretch our legs and it felt amazing goodthat is the stretching did but the sand scorched our feet like hot embers next we see somebody coming and started to meet him but we heard jim shout and looked around and he was fairly dancing and making signs and yelling we couldnt make out what he said but we was scared anyway and begun to heel it back to the balloon when we got close enough we understood the words and they made me sick  run run fo yo life hits a lion i kin see him thoo de glass run boys do please heel it de bes you kin hes busted outen de menagerie en dey aint nobody to stop him  it made tom fly but it took the stiffening all out of my legs i could only just gasp along the way you do in a dream when theres a ghost gaining on you  tom got to the ladder and shinned up it a piece and waited for me and as soon as i got a foothold on it he shouted to jim to soar away but jim had clean lost his head and said he had forgot how so tom shinned along up and told me to follow but the lion was arriving fetching a most ghastly roar with every lope and my legs shook so i dasnt try to take one of them out of the rounds for fear the other one would give way under me  but tom was aboard by this time and he started the balloon up a little and stopped it again as soon as the end of the ladder was ten or twelve feet above ground and there was the lion aripping around under me and roaring and springing up in the air at the ladder and only missing it about a quarter of an inch it seemed to me it was delicious to be out of his reach perfectly delicious and made me feel good and thankful all up one side but i was hanging there helpless and couldnt climb and that made me feel perfectly wretched and miserable all down the other it is most seldom that a person feels so mixed like that and it is not to be recommended either  tom asked me what hed better do but i didnt know he asked me if i could hold on whilst he sailed away to a safe place and left the lion behind i said i could if he didnt go no higher than he was now but if he went higher i would lose my head and fall sure so he said take a good grip and he started  dont go so fast i shouted it makes my head swim  he had started like a lightning express he slowed down and we glided over the sand slower but still in a kind of sickening way for it is uncomfortable to see things sliding and gliding under you like that and not a sound  but pretty soon there was plenty of sound for the lion was catching up his noise fetched others you could see them coming on the lope from every direction and pretty soon there was a couple of dozen of them under me jumping up at the ladder and snarling and snapping at each other and so we went skimming along over the sand and these fellers doing what they could to help us to not forgit the occasion and then some other beasts come without an invite and they started a regular riot down there  we see this plan was a mistake we couldnt ever git away from them at this gait and i couldnt hold on forever so tom took a think and struck another idea that was to kill a lion with the pepperbox revolver and then sail away while the others stopped to fight over the carcass so he stopped the balloon still and done it and then we sailed off while the fuss was going on and come down a quarter of a mile off and they helped me aboard but by the time we was out of reach again that gang was on hand once more and when they see we was really gone and they couldnt get us they sat down on their hams and looked up at us so kind of disappointed that it was as much as a person could do not to see their side of the matter    chapter vi its a caravan  i was so weak that the only thing i wanted was a chance to lay down so i made straight for my lockerbunk and stretched myself out there but a body couldnt get back his strength in no such oven as that so tom give the command to soar and jim started her aloft  we had to go up a mile before we struck comfortable weather where it was breezy and pleasant and just right and pretty soon i was all straight again tom had been setting quiet and thinking but now he jumps up and says  i bet you a thousand to one i know where we are were in the great sahara as sure as guns  he was so excited he couldnt hold still but i wasnt i says  well then wheres the great sahara in england or in scotland  taint in either its in africa  jims eyes bugged out and he begun to stare down with no end of interest because that was where his originals come from but i didnt more than half believe it i couldnt you know it seemed too awful far away for us to have traveled  but tom was full of his discovery as he called it and said the lions and the sand meant the great desert sure he said he could a found out before we sighted land that we was crowding the land somewheres if he had thought of one thing and when we asked him what he said  these clocks theyre chronometers you always read about them in sea voyages one of them is keeping grinnage time and the other is keeping st louis time like my watch when we left st louis it was four in the afternoon by my watch and this clock and it was ten at night by this grinnage clock well at this time of the year the sun sets at about seven oclock now i noticed the time yesterday evening when the sun went down and it was halfpast five oclock by the grinnage clock and half past 11 am by my watch and the other clock you see the sun rose and set by my watch in st louis and the grinnage clock was six hours fast but weve come so far east that it comes within less than half an hour of setting by the grinnage clock now and im away outmore than four hours and a half out you see that meant that we was closing up on the longitude of ireland and would strike it before long if we was pinted rightwhich we wasnt no sir weve been awanderingwandering way down south of east and its my opinion we are in africa look at this map you see how the shoulder of africa sticks out to the west think how fast weve traveled if we had gone straight east we would be long past england by this time you watch for noon all of you and well stand up and when we cant cast a shadow well find that this grinnage clock is coming mighty close to marking twelve yes sir i think were in africa and its just bully  jim was gazing down with the glass he shook his head and says  mars tom i reckon deys a mistake somers haint seen no niggers yit  thats nothing they dont live in the desert what is that way off yonder gimme a glass  he took a long look and said it was like a black string stretched across the sand but he couldnt guess what it was  well i says i reckon maybe youve got a chance now to find out whereabouts this balloon is because as like as not that is one of these lines here thats on the map that you call meridians of longitude and we can drop down and look at its number and  oh shucks huck finn i never see such a lunkhead as you did you spose theres meridians of longitude on the earth  tom sawyer theyre set down on the map and you know it perfectly well and here they are and you can see for yourself  of course theyre on the map but thats nothing there aint any on the ground  tom do you know that to be so  certainly i do  well then that maps a liar again i never see such a liar as that map  he fired up at that and i was ready for him and jim was warming his opinion too and next minute wed a broke loose on another argument if tom hadnt dropped the glass and begun to clap his hands like a maniac and sing out  camelscamels  so i grabbed a glass and jim too and took a look but i was disappointed and says  camels your granny theyre spiders  spiders in a desert you shad spiders walking in a procession you dont ever reflect huck finn and i reckon you really havent got anything to reflect with dont you know were as much as a mile up in the air and that that string of crawlers is two or three miles away spiders good land spiders as big as a cow perhaps youd like to go down and milk one of em but theyre camels just the same its a caravan thats what it is and its a mile long  well then lets go down and look at it i dont believe in it and aint going to till i see it and know it  all right he says and give the command  lower away  as we come slanting down into the hot weather we could see that it was camels sure enough plodding along an everlasting string of them with bales strapped to them and several hundred men in long white robes and a thing like a shawl bound over their heads and hanging down with tassels and fringes and some of the men had long guns and some hadnt and some was riding and some was walking and the weatherwell it was just roasting and how slow they did creep along we swooped down now all of a sudden and stopped about a hundred yards over their heads  the men all set up a yell and some of them fell flat on their stomachs some begun to fire their guns at us and the rest broke and scampered every which way and so did the camels  we see that we was making trouble so we went up again about a mile to the cool weather and watched them from there it took them an hour to get together and form the procession again then they started along but we could see by the glasses that they wasnt paying much attention to anything but us we poked along looking down at them with the glasses and by and by we see a big sand mound and something like people the other side of it and there was something like a man laying on top of the mound that raised his head up every now and then and seemed to be watching the caravan or us we didnt know which as the caravan got nearer he sneaked down on the other side and rushed to the other men and horsesfor that is what they wasand we see them mount in a hurry and next here they come like a house afire some with lances and some with long guns and all of them yelling the best they could  they come atearing down on to the caravan and the next minute both sides crashed together and was all mixed up and there was such another popping of guns as you never heard and the air got so full of smoke you could only catch glimpses of them struggling together there must a been six hundred men in that battle and it was terrible to see then they broke up into gangs and groups fighting tooth and nail and scurrying and scampering around and laying into each other like everything and whenever the smoke cleared a little you could see dead and wounded people and camels scattered far and wide and all about and camels racing off in every direction  at last the robbers see they couldnt win so their chief sounded a signal and all that was left of them broke away and went scampering across the plain the last man to go snatched up a child and carried it off in front of him on his horse and a woman run screaming and begging after him and followed him away off across the plain till she was separated a long ways from her people but it warnt no use and she had to give it up and we see her sink down on the sand and cover her face with her hands then tom took the hellum and started for that yahoo and we come awhizzing down and made a swoop and knocked him out of the saddle child and all and he was jarred considerable but the child wasnt hurt but laid there working its hands and legs in the air like a tumblebug thats on its back and cant turn over the man went staggering off to overtake his horse and didnt know what had hit him for we was three or four hundred yards up in the air by this time  we judged the woman would go and get the child now but she didnt we could see her through the glass still setting there with her head bowed down on her knees so of course she hadnt seen the performance and thought her child was clean gone with the man she was nearly a half a mile from her people so we thought we might go down to the child which was about a quarter of a mile beyond her and snake it to her before the caravan people could git to us to do us any harm and besides we reckoned they had enough business on their hands for one while anyway with the wounded we thought wed chance it and we did we swooped down and stopped and jim shinned down the ladder and fetched up the kid which was a nice fat little thing and in a noble good humor too considering it was just out of a battle and been tumbled off of a horse and then we started for the mother and stopped back of her and tolerable near by and jim slipped down and crept up easy and when he was close back of her the child googood the way a child does and she heard it and whirled and fetched a shriek of joy and made a jump for the kid and snatched it and hugged it and dropped it and hugged jim and then snatched off a gold chain and hung it around jims neck and hugged him again and jerked up the child again asobbing and glorifying all the time and jim he shoved for the ladder and up it and in a minute we was back up in the sky and the woman was staring up with the back of her head between her shoulders and the child with its arms locked around her neck and there she stood as long as we was in sight asailing away in the sky    chapter vii tom respects the flea  noon says tom and so it was his shadder was just a blot around his feet we looked and the grinnage clock was so close to twelve the difference didnt amount to nothing so tom said london was right north of us or right south of us one or tother and he reckoned by the weather and the sand and the camels it was north and a good many miles north too as many as from new york to the city of mexico he guessed  jim said he reckoned a balloon was a good deal the fastest thing in the world unless it might be some kinds of birdsa wild pigeon maybe or a railroad  but tom said he had read about railroads in england going nearly a hundred miles an hour for a little ways and there never was a bird in the world that could do thatexcept one and that was a flea  a flea why mars tom in de fust place he aint a bird strickly speakin  he aint a bird eh well then what is he  i dont rightly know mars tom but i speck hes only jist a animal no i reckon dat wont do nuther he aint big enough for a animal he mus be a bug yassir dats what he is hes a bug  i bet he aint but let it go whats your second place  well in de second place birds is creturs dat goes a long ways but a flea dont  he dont dont he come now what is a long distance if you know  why its miles and lots of emanybody knows dat  cant a man walk miles  yassir he kin  as many as a railroad  yassir if you give him time  cant a flea  welli spose soef you gives him heaps of time  now you begin to see dont you that distance aint the thing to judge by at all its the time it takes to go the distance in that counts aint it  well hit do look sorter so but i wouldnt a blieved it mars tom  its a matter of proportion thats what it is and when you come to gauge a things speed by its size wheres your bird and your man and your railroad alongside of a flea the fastest man cant run more than about ten miles in an hournot much over ten thousand times his own length but all the books says any common ordinary thirdclass flea can jump a hundred and fifty times his own length yes and he can make five jumps a second tooseven hundred and fifty times his own length in one little secondfor he dont fool away any time stopping and startinghe does them both at the same time youll see if you try to put your finger on him now thats a common ordinary thirdclass fleas gait but you take an eyetalian firstclass thats been the pet of the nobility all his life and hasnt ever knowed what want or sickness or exposure was and he can jump more than three hundred times his own length and keep it up all day five such jumps every second which is fifteen hundred times his own length well suppose a man could go fifteen hundred times his own length in a secondsay a mile and a half its ninety miles a minute its considerable more than five thousand miles an hour wheres your man nowyes and your bird and your railroad and your balloon laws they dont amount to shucks longside of a flea a flea is just a comet biled down small  jim was a good deal astonished and so was i jim said  is dem figgers jist edjackly true en no jokin en no lies mars tom  yes they are theyre perfectly true  well den honey a bodys got to respec a flea i aint had no respec for um befo scasely but dey aint no gittin roun it dey do deserve it dats certain  well i bet they do theyve got ever so much more sense and brains and brightness in proportion to their size than any other cretur in the world a person can learn them most anything and they learn it quicker than any other cretur too theyve been learnt to haul little carriages in harness and go this way and that way and tother way according to their orders yes and to march and drill like soldiers doing it as exact according to orders as soldiers does it theyve been learnt to do all sorts of hard and troublesome things spose you could cultivate a flea up to the size of a man and keep his natural smartness agrowing and agrowing right along up bigger and bigger and keener and keener in the same proportionwhered the human race be do you reckon that flea would be president of the united states and you couldnt any more prevent it than you can prevent lightning  my lan mars tom i never knowed dey was so much to de beas no sir i never had no idea of it and dats de fac  theres more to him by a long sight than there is to any other cretur man or beast in proportion to size hes the interestingest of them all people have so much to say about an ants strength and an elephants and a locomotives shucks they dont begin with a flea he can lift two or three hundred times his own weight and none of them can come anywhere near it and moreover he has got notions of his own and is very particular and you cant fool him his instinct or his judgment or whatever it is is perfectly sound and clear and dont ever make a mistake people think all humans are alike to a flea it aint so theres folks that he wont go near hungry or not hungry and im one of them ive never had one of them on me in my life  mars tom  its so i aint joking  well sah i haint ever heard de likes o dat befo jim couldnt believe it and i couldnt so we had to drop down to the sand and git a supply and see tom was right they went for me and jim by the thousand but not a one of them lit on tom there warnt no explaining it but there it was and there warnt no getting around it he said it had always been just so and hed just as soon be where there was a million of them as not theyd never touch him nor bother him  we went up to the cold weather to freeze em out and stayed a little spell and then come back to the comfortable weather and went lazying along twenty or twentyfive miles an hour the way wed been doing for the last few hours the reason was that the longer we was in that solemn peaceful desert the more the hurry and fuss got kind of soothed down in us and the more happier and contented and satisfied we got to feeling and the more we got to liking the desert and then loving it so we had cramped the speed down as i was saying and was having a most noble good lazy time sometimes watching through the glasses sometimes stretched out on the lockers reading sometimes taking a nap  it didnt seem like we was the same lot that was in such a state to find land and git ashore but it was but we had got over thatclean over it we was used to the balloon now and not afraid any more and didnt want to be anywheres else why it seemed just like home it most seemed as if i had been born and raised in it and jim and tom said the same and always i had had hateful people around me anagging at me and pestering of me and scolding and finding fault and fussing and bothering and sticking to me and keeping after me and making me do this and making me do that and tother and always selecting out the things i didnt want to do and then giving me sam hill because i shirked and done something else and just aggravating the life out of a body all the time but up here in the sky it was so still and sunshiny and lovely and plenty to eat and plenty of sleep and strange things to see and no nagging and no pestering and no good people and just holiday all the time land i warnt in no hurry to git out and buck at civilization again now one of the worst things about civilization is that anybody that gits a letter with trouble in it comes and tells you all about it and makes you feel bad and the newspapers fetches you the troubles of everybody all over the world and keeps you downhearted and dismal most all the time and its such a heavy load for a person i hate them newspapers and i hate letters and if i had my way i wouldnt allow nobody to load his troubles on to other folks he aint acquainted with on tother side of the world that way well up in a balloon there aint any of that and its the darlingest place there is  we had supper and that night was one of the prettiest nights i ever see the moon made it just like daylight only a heap softer and once we see a lion standing all alone by himself just all alone on the earth it seemed like and his shadder laid on the sand by him like a puddle of ink thats the kind of moonlight to have  mainly we laid on our backs and talked we didnt want to go to sleep tom said we was right in the midst of the arabian nights now he said it was right along here that one of the cutest things in that book happened so we looked down and watched while he told about it because there aint anything that is so interesting to look at as a place that a book has talked about it was a tale about a cameldriver that had lost his camel and he come along in the desert and met a man and says  have you run across a stray camel today  and the man says  was he blind in his left eye  yes  had he lost an upper front tooth  yes  was his off hind leg lame  yes  was he loaded with milletseed on one side and honey on the other  yes but you neednt go into no more detailsthats the one and im in a hurry where did you see him  i haint seen him at all the man says  haint seen him at all how can you describe him so close then  because when a person knows how to use his eyes everything has got a meaning to it but most peoples eyes aint any good to them i knowed a camel had been along because i seen his track i knowed he was lame in his off hind leg because he had favored that foot and trod light on it and his track showed it i knowed he was blind on his left side because he only nibbled the grass on the right side of the trail i knowed he had lost an upper front tooth because where he bit into the sod his teethprint showed it the milletseed sifted out on one sidethe ants told me that the honey leaked out on the otherthe flies told me that i know all about your camel but i haint seen him  jim says  go on mars tom hits a mighty good tale and powerful interestin  thats all tom says  all says jim astonished what come o de camel  i dont know  mars tom dont de tale say  no  jim puzzled a minute then he says  well ef dat aint de beatenes tale ever i struck jist gits to de place whah de intrust is gittin redhot en down she breaks why mars tom dey aint no sense in a tale dat acts like dat haint you got no idea whether de man got de camel back er not  no i havent  i see myself there warnt no sense in the tale to chop square off that way before it come to anything but i warnt going to say so because i could see tom was souring up pretty fast over the way it flatted out and the way jim had popped on to the weak place in it and i dont think its fair for everybody to pile on to a feller when hes down but tom he whirls on me and says  what do you think of the tale  of course then i had to come out and make a clean breast and say it did seem to me too same as it did to jim that as long as the tale stopped square in the middle and never got to no place it really warnt worth the trouble of telling  toms chin dropped on his breast and stead of being mad as i reckoned hed be to hear me scoff at his tale that way he seemed to be only sad and he says  some people can see and some cantjust as that man said let alone a camel if a cyclone had gone by you duffers wouldnt a noticed the track  i dont know what he meant by that and he didnt say it was just one of his irrulevances i reckonhe was full of them sometimes when he was in a close place and couldnt see no other way outbut i didnt mind wed spotted the soft place in that tale sharp enough he couldnt git away from that little fact it graveled him like the nation too i reckon much as he tried not to let on    chapter viii the disappearing lake  we had an early breakfast in the morning and set looking down on the desert and the weather was ever so bammy and lovely although we warnt high up you have to come down lower and lower after sundown in the desert because it cools off so fast and so by the time it is getting toward dawn you are skimming along only a little ways above the sand  we was watching the shadder of the balloon slide along the ground and now and then gazing off across the desert to see if anything was stirring and then down on the shadder again when all of a sudden almost right under us we see a lot of men and camels laying scattered about perfectly quiet like they was asleep  we shut off the power and backed up and stood over them and then we see that they was all dead it give us the cold shivers and it made us hush down too and talk low like people at a funeral we dropped down slow and stopped and me and tom clumb down and went among them there was men and women and children they was dried by the sun and dark and shriveled and leathery like the pictures of mummies you see in books and yet they looked just as human you wouldnt a believed it just like they was asleep  some of the people and animals was partly covered with sand but most of them not for the sand was thin there and the bed was gravel and hard most of the clothes had rotted away and when you took hold of a rag it tore with a touch like spiderweb tom reckoned they had been laying there for years  some of the men had rusty guns by them some had swords on and had shawl belts with long silvermounted pistols stuck in them all the camels had their loads on yet but the packs had busted or rotted and spilt the freight out on the ground we didnt reckon the swords was any good to the dead people any more so we took one apiece and some pistols we took a small box too because it was so handsome and inlaid so fine and then we wanted to bury the people but there warnt no way to do it that we could think of and nothing to do it with but sand and that would blow away again of course  then we mounted high and sailed away and pretty soon that black spot on the sand was out of sight and we wouldnt ever see them poor people again in this world we wondered and reasoned and tried to guess how they come to be there and how it all happened to them but we couldnt make it out first we thought maybe they got lost and wandered around and about till their food and water give out and they starved to death but tom said no wild animals nor vultures hadnt meddled with them and so that guess wouldnt do so at last we give it up and judged we wouldnt think about it no more because it made us lowspirited  then we opened the box and it had gems and jewels in it quite a pile and some little veils of the kind the dead women had on with fringes made out of curious gold money that we warnt acquainted with we wondered if we better go and try to find them again and give it back but tom thought it over and said no it was a country that was full of robbers and they would come and steal it and then the sin would be on us for putting the temptation in their way so we went on but i wished we had took all they had so there wouldnt a been no temptation at all left  we had had two hours of that blazing weather down there and was dreadful thirsty when we got aboard again we went straight for the water but it was spoiled and bitter besides being pretty near hot enough to scald your mouth we couldnt drink it it was mississippi river water the best in the world and we stirred up the mud in it to see if that would help but no the mud wasnt any better than the water well we hadnt been so very very thirsty before while we was interested in the lost people but we was now and as soon as we found we couldnt have a drink we was more than thirtyfive times as thirsty as we was a quarter of a minute before why in a little while we wanted to hold our mouths open and pant like a dog  tom said to keep a sharp lookout all around everywheres because wed got to find an oasis or there warnt no telling what would happen so we done it we kept the glasses gliding around all the time till our arms got so tired we couldnt hold them any more two hoursthree hoursjust gazing and gazing and nothing but sand sand sand and you could see the quivering heatshimmer playing over it dear dear a body dont know what real misery is till he is thirsty all the way through and is certain he aint ever going to come to any water any more at last i couldnt stand it to look around on them baking plains i laid down on the locker and give it up  but by and by tom raised a whoop and there she was a lake wide and shiny with pamtrees leaning over it asleep and their shadders in the water just as soft and delicate as ever you see i never see anything look so good it was a long ways off but that warnt anything to us we just slapped on a hundredmile gait and calculated to be there in seven minutes but she stayed the same old distance away all the time we couldnt seem to gain on her yes sir just as far and shiny and like a dream but we couldnt get no nearer and at last all of a sudden she was gone  toms eyes took a spread and he says  boys it was a myridge said it like he was glad i didnt see nothing to be glad about i says  maybe i dont care nothing about its name the thing i want to know is whats become of it  jim was trembling all over and so scared he couldnt speak but he wanted to ask that question himself if he could a done it tom says  whats become of it why you see yourself its gone  yes i know but wheres it gone to  he looked me over and says  well now huck finn where would it go to dont you know what a myridge is  no i dont what is it  it aint anything but imagination there aint anything to it  it warmed me up a little to hear him talk like that and i says  whats the use you talking that kind of stuff tom sawyer didnt i see the lake  yesyou think you did  i dont think nothing about it i did see it  i tell you you didnt see it eitherbecause it warnt there to see  it astonished jim to hear him talk so and he broke in and says kind of pleading and distressed  mars tom please dont say sich things in sich an awful time as dis you aint only reskin yo own self but yous reskin ussame way like anna nias en siffra de lake wuz dahi seen it jis as plain as i sees you en huck dis minute  i says  why he seen it himself he was the very one that seen it first now then  yes mars tom hits soyou cant deny it we all seen it en dat prove it was dah  proves it how does it prove it  same way it does in de courts en everywheres mars tom one pusson might be drunk or dreamy or suthin en he could be mistaken en two might maybe but i tell you sah when three sees a thing drunk er sober its so dey aint no gittin aroun dat en you knows it mars tom  i dont know nothing of the kind there used to be forty thousand million people that seen the sun move from one side of the sky to the other every day did that prove that the sun done it  course it did en besides dey warnt no casion to prove it a body ats got any sense aint gwine to doubt it dah she is nowa sailin thoo de sky like she allays done  tom turned on me then and says  what do you sayis the sun standing still  tom sawyer whats the use to ask such a jackass question anybody that aint blind can see it dont stand still  well he says im lost in the sky with no company but a passel of lowdown animals that dont know no more than the head boss of a university did three or four hundred years ago  it warnt fair play and i let him know it i says  throwin mud aint arguin tom sawyer  oh my goodness oh my goodness gracious dahs de lake agin yelled jim just then now mars tom what you gwine to say  yes sir there was the lake again away yonder across the desert perfectly plain trees and all just the same as it was before i says  i reckon youre satisfied now tom sawyer  but he says perfectly cam  yes satisfied there aint no lake there  jim says  dont talk so mars tomit skyers me to hear you its so hot en yous so thirsty dat you aint in yo right mine mars tom oh but dont she look good clah i doan know how is gwine to wait tell we gits dah is so thirsty  well youll have to wait and it wont do you no good either because there aint no lake there i tell you  i says  jim dont you take your eye off of it and i wont either  deed i wont en bless you honey i couldnt ef i wanted to  we went atearing along toward it piling the miles behind us like nothing but never gaining an inch on itand all of a sudden it was gone again jim staggered and most fell down when he got his breath he says gasping like a fish  mars tom hits a ghos dats what it is en i hopes to goodness we aint gwine to see it no mo deys been a lake en suthins happened en de lakes dead en wes seen its ghos wes seen it twiste en dats proof de deserts hanted its hanted sho oh mars tom les git outen it id ruther die den have de night ketch us in it agin en de ghos er dat lake come amournin aroun us en we asleep en doan know de danger wes in  ghost you gander it aint anything but air and heat and thirstiness pasted together by a persons imagination if igimme the glass  he grabbed it and begun to gaze off to the right  its a flock of birds he says its getting toward sundown and theyre making a beeline across our track for somewheres they mean businessmaybe theyre going for food or water or both let her go to starboardport your hellum hard down thereease upsteady as you go  we shut down some of the power so as not to outspeed them and took out after them we went skimming along a quarter of a mile behind them and when we had followed them an hour and a half and was getting pretty discouraged and was thirsty clean to unendurableness tom says  take the glass one of you and see what that is away ahead of the birds  jim got the first glimpse and slumped down on the locker sick he was most crying and says  shes dah agin mars tom shes dah agin en i knows is gwine to die case when a body sees a ghos de third time dats what it means i wisht id never come in dis balloon dat i does  he wouldnt look no more and what he said made me afraid too because i knowed it was true for that has always been the way with ghosts so then i wouldnt look any more either both of us begged tom to turn off and go some other way but he wouldnt and said we was ignorant superstitious blatherskites yes and hell git come up with one of these days i says to myself insulting ghosts that way theyll stand it for a while maybe but they wont stand it always for anybody that knows about ghosts knows how easy they are hurt and how revengeful they are  so we was all quiet and still jim and me being scared and tom busy by and by tom fetched the balloon to a standstill and says  now get up and look you sapheads  we done it and there was the sureenough water right under usclear and blue and cool and deep and wavy with the breeze the loveliest sight that ever was and all about it was grassy banks and flowers and shady groves of big trees looped together with vines and all looking so peaceful and comfortableenough to make a body cry it was so beautiful  jim did cry and rip and dance and carry on he was so thankful and out of his mind for joy it was my watch so i had to stay by the works but tom and jim clumb down and drunk a barrel apiece and fetched me up a lot and ive tasted a many a good thing in my life but nothing that ever begun with that water  then we went down and had a swim and then tom came up and spelled me and me and jim had a swim and then jim spelled tom and me and tom had a footrace and a boxingmill and i dont reckon i ever had such a good time in my life it warnt so very hot because it was close on to evening and we hadnt any clothes on anyway clothes is well enough in school and in towns and at balls too but there aint no sense in them when there aint no civilization nor other kinds of bothers and fussiness around  lions acominlions quick mars tom jump for yo life huck  oh and didnt we we never stopped for clothes but waltzed up the ladder just so jim lost his head straight offhe always done it whenever he got excited and scared and so now stead of just easing the ladder up from the ground a little so the animals couldnt reach it he turned on a raft of power and we went whizzing up and was dangling in the sky before he got his wits together and seen what a foolish thing he was doing then he stopped her but he had clean forgot what to do next so there we was so high that the lions looked like pups and we was drifting off on the wind  but tom he shinned up and went for the works and begun to slant her down and back toward the lake where the animals was gathering like a campmeeting and i judged he had lost his head too for he knowed i was too scared to climb and did he want to dump me among the tigers and things  but no his head was level he knowed what he was about he swooped down to within thirty or forty feet of the lake and stopped right over the center and sung out  leggo and drop  i done it and shot down feet first and seemed to go about a mile toward the bottom and when i come up he says  now lay on your back and float till youre rested and got your pluck back then ill dip the ladder in the water and you can climb aboard  i done it now that was ever so smart in tom because if he had started off somewheres else to drop down on the sand the menagerie would a come along too and might a kept us hunting a safe place till i got tuckered out and fell  and all this time the lions and tigers was sorting out the clothes and trying to divide them up so there would be some for all but there was a misunderstanding about it somewheres on account of some of them trying to hog more than their share so there was another insurrection and you never see anything like it in the world there must a been fifty of them all mixed up together snorting and roaring and snapping and biting and tearing legs and tails in the air and you couldnt tell which was which and the sand and fur aflying and when they got done some was dead and some was limping off crippled and the rest was setting around on the battlefield some of them licking their sore places and the others looking up at us and seemed to be kind of inviting us to come down and have some fun but which we didnt want any  as for the clothes they warnt any any more every last rag of them was inside of the animals and not agreeing with them very well i dont reckon for there was considerable many brass buttons on them and there was knives in the pockets too and smoking tobacco and nails and chalk and marbles and fishhooks and things but i wasnt caring all that was bothering me was that all we had now was the professors clothes a big enough assortment but not suitable to go into company with if we came across any because the britches was as long as tunnels and the coats and things according still there was everything a tailor needed and jim was a kind of jack legged tailor and he allowed he could soon trim a suit or two down for us that would answer    chapter ix tom discourses on the desert  still we thought we would drop down there a minute but on another errand most of the professors cargo of food was put up in cans in the new way that somebody had just invented the rest was fresh when you fetch missouri beefsteak to the great sahara you want to be particular and stay up in the coolish weather so we reckoned we would drop down into the lion market and see how we could make out there  we hauled in the ladder and dropped down till we was just above the reach of the animals then we let down a rope with a slipknot in it and hauled up a dead lion a small tender one then yanked up a cub tiger we had to keep the congregation off with the revolver or they would a took a hand in the proceedings and helped  we carved off a supply from both and saved the skins and hove the rest overboard then we baited some of the professors hooks with the fresh meat and went afishing we stood over the lake just a convenient distance above the water and catched a lot of the nicest fish you ever see it was a most amazing good supper we had lion steak tiger steak fried fish and hot cornpone i dont want nothing better than that  we had some fruit to finish off with we got it out of the top of a monstrous tall tree it was a very slim tree that hadnt a branch on it from the bottom plumb to the top and there it bursted out like a featherduster it was a pamtree of course anybody knows a pamtree the minute he see it by the pictures we went for cocoanuts in this one but there warnt none there was only big loose bunches of things like oversized grapes and tom allowed they was dates because he said they answered the description in the arabian nights and the other books of course they mightnt be and they might be poison so we had to wait a spell and watch and see if the birds et them they done it so we done it too and they was most amazing good  by this time monstrous big birds begun to come and settle on the dead animals they was plucky creturs they would tackle one end of a lion that was being gnawed at the other end by another lion if the lion drove the bird away it didnt do no good he was back again the minute the lion was busy  the big birds come out of every part of the skyyou could make them out with the glass while they was still so far away you couldnt see them with your naked eye tom said the birds didnt find out the meat was there by the smell they had to find it out by seeing it oh but aint that an eye for you tom said at the distance of five mile a patch of dead lions couldnt look any bigger than a persons fingernail and he couldnt imagine how the birds could notice such a little thing so far off  it was strange and unnatural to see lion eat lion and we thought maybe they warnt kin but jim said that didnt make no difference he said a hog was fond of her own children and so was a spider and he reckoned maybe a lion was pretty near as unprincipled though maybe not quite he thought likely a lion wouldnt eat his own father if he knowed which was him but reckoned he would eat his brotherinlaw if he was uncommon hungry and eat his motherinlaw any time but reckoning dont settle nothing you can reckon till the cows come home but that dont fetch you to no decision so we give it up and let it drop  generly it was very still in the desert nights but this time there was music a lot of other animals come to dinner sneaking yelpers that tom allowed was jackals and roachedbacked ones that he said was hyenas and all the whole biling of them kept up a racket all the time they made a picture in the moonlight that was more different than any picture i ever see we had a line out and made fast to the top of a tree and didnt stand no watch but all turned in and slept but i was up two or three times to look down at the animals and hear the music it was like having a front seat at a menagerie for nothing which i hadnt ever had before and so it seemed foolish to sleep and not make the most of it i mightnt ever have such a chance again  we went afishing again in the early dawn and then lazied around all day in the deep shade on an island taking turn about to watch and see that none of the animals come asnooping around there after erronorts for dinner we was going to leave the next day but couldnt it was too lovely  the day after when we rose up toward the sky and sailed off eastward we looked back and watched that place till it warnt nothing but just a speck in the desert and i tell you it was like saying goodbye to a friend that you aint ever going to see any more  jim was thinking to himself and at last he says  mars tom wes mos to de end er de desert now i speck  why  well hit stan to reason we is you knows how long wes been askimmin over it mus be mos out o san hits a wonder to me dat its hilt out as long as it has  shucks theres plenty sand you neednt worry  oh i aint aworryin mars tom only wonderin dats all de lords got plenty san i aint doubtin dat but nemmine he aint gwyne to wase it jist on dat account en i allows dat dis deserts plenty big enough now jist de way she is en you cant spread her out no mo dout wasin san  oh go long we aint much more than fairly started across this desert yet the united states is a pretty big country aint it aint it huck  yes i says there aint no bigger one i dont reckon  well he says this desert is about the shape of the united states and if you was to lay it down on top of the united states it would cover the land of the free out of sight like a blanket thered be a little corner sticking out up at maine and away up northwest and florida sticking out like a turtles tail and thats all weve took california away from the mexicans two or three years ago so that part of the pacific coast is ours now and if you laid the great sahara down with her edge on the pacific she would cover the united states and stick out past new york six hundred miles into the atlantic ocean  i say  good land have you got the documents for that tom sawyer  yes and theyre right here and ive been studying them you can look for yourself from new york to the pacific is 2600 miles from one end of the great desert to the other is 3200 the united states contains 3600000 square miles the desert contains 4162000 with the deserts bulk you could cover up every last inch of the united states and in under where the edges projected out you could tuck england scotland ireland france denmark and all germany yes sir you could hide the home of the brave and all of them countries clean out of sight under the great sahara and you would still have 2000 square miles of sand left  well i says it clean beats me why tom it shows that the lord took as much pains makin this desert as makin the united states and all them other countries  jim says huck dat don stan to reason i reckon dis desert want made at all now you take en look at it like disyou look at it and see ef is right whats a desert good for taint good for nuthin dey aint no way to make it pay haint dat so huck  yes i reckon  haint it so mars tom  i guess so go on  ef a thing aint no good its made in vain aint it  yes  now den do de lord make anything in vain you answer me dat  wellno he dont  den how come he make a desert  well go on how did he come to make it  mars tom i blieve it uz jes like when yous buildin a house deys allays a lot o truck en rubbish lef over what does you do wid it doan you take en kyart it off en dump it into a ole vacant back lot course now den its my opinion hit was jes like datdat de great sahara warnt made at all she jes happen  i said it was a real good argument and i believed it was the best one jim ever made tom he said the same but said the trouble about arguments is they aint nothing but theories after all and theories dont prove nothing they only give you a place to rest on a spell when you are tuckered out butting around and around trying to find out something there aint no way to find out and he says  theres another trouble about theories theres always a hole in them somewheres sure if you look close enough its just so with this one of jims look what billions and billions of stars there is how does it come that there was just exactly enough starstuff and none left over how does it come there aint no sandpile up there  but jim was fixed for him and says  whats de milky waydats what i want to know whats de milky way answer me dat  in my opinion it was just a sockdologer its only an opinion its only my opinion and others may think different but i said it then and i stand to it nowit was a sockdologer and moreover besides it landed tom sawyer he couldnt say a word he had that stunned look of a person thats been shot in the back with a kag of nails all he said was as for people like me and jim hed just as soon have intellectual intercourse with a catfish but anybody can say thatand i notice they always do when somebody has fetched them a lifter tom sawyer was tired of that end of the subject    so we got back to talking about the size of the desert again and the more we compared it with this and that and tother thing the more nobler and bigger and grander it got to look right along and so hunting among the figgers tom found by and by that it was just the same size as the empire of china then he showed us the spread the empire of china made on the map and the room she took up in the world well it was wonderful to think of and i says  why ive heard talk about this desert plenty of times but i never knowed before how important she was  then tom says  important sahara important thats just the way with some people if a things big its important thats all the sense theyve got all they can see is size why look at england its the most important country in the world and yet you could put it in chinas vestpocket and not only that but youd have the dickenss own time to find it again the next time you wanted it and look at russia it spreads all around and everywhere and yet aint no more important in this world than rhode island is and hasnt got half as much in it thats worth saving  away off now we see a little hill astanding up just on the edge of the world tom broke off his talk and reached for a glass very much excited and took a look and says  thats itits the one ive been looking for sure if im right its the one the dervish took the man into and showed him all the treasures  so we begun to gaze and he begun to tell about it out of the arabian nights    chapter x the treasurehill  tom said it happened like this  a dervish was stumping it along through the desert on foot one blazing hot day and he had come a thousand miles and was pretty poor and hungry and ornery and tired and along about where we are now he run across a cameldriver with a hundred camels and asked him for some ams but the cameldriver he asked to be excused the dervish said  dont you own these camels  yes theyre mine  are you in debt  whome no  well a man that owns a hundred camels and aint in debt is richand not only rich but very rich aint it so  the cameldriver owned up that it was so then the dervish says  god has made you rich and he has made me poor he has his reasons and they are wise blessed be his name but he has willed that his rich shall help his poor and you have turned away from me your brother in my need and he will remember this and you will lose by it  that made the cameldriver feel shaky but all the same he was born hoggish after money and didnt like to let go a cent so he begun to whine and explain and said times was hard and although he had took a full freight down to balsora and got a fat rate for it he couldnt git no return freight and so he warnt making no great things out of his trip so the dervish starts along again and says  all right if you want to take the risk but i reckon youve made a mistake this time and missed a chance  of course the cameldriver wanted to know what kind of a chance he had missed because maybe there was money in it so he run after the dervish and begged him so hard and earnest to take pity on him that at last the dervish gave in and says  do you see that hill yonder well in that hill is all the treasures of the earth and i was looking around for a man with a particular good kind heart and a noble generous disposition because if i could find just that man ive got a kind of a salve i could put on his eyes and he could see the treasures and get them out  so then the cameldriver was in a sweat and he cried and begged and took on and went down on his knees and said he was just that kind of a man and said he could fetch a thousand people that would say he wasnt ever described so exact before  well then says the dervish all right if we load the hundred camels can i have half of them  the driver was so glad he couldnt hardly hold in and says  now youre shouting  so they shook hands on the bargain and the dervish got out his box and rubbed the salve on the drivers right eye and the hill opened and he went in and there sure enough was piles and piles of gold and jewels sparkling like all the stars in heaven had fell down  so him and the dervish laid into it and they loaded every camel till he couldnt carry no more then they said goodbye and each of them started off with his fifty but pretty soon the cameldriver come arunning and overtook the dervish and says  you aint in society you know and you dont really need all youve got wont you be good and let me have ten of your camels  well the dervish says i dont know but what you say is reasonable enough  so he done it and they separated and the dervish started off again with his forty but pretty soon here comes the cameldriver bawling after him again and whines and slobbers around and begs another ten off of him saying thirty camel loads of treasures was enough to see a dervish through because they live very simple you know and dont keep house but board around and give their note  but that warnt the end yet that ornery hound kept coming and coming till he had begged back all the camels and had the whole hundred then he was satisfied and ever so grateful and said he wouldnt ever forgit the dervish as long as he lived and nobody hadnt been so good to him before and liberal so they shook hands goodbye and separated and started off again  but do you know it warnt ten minutes till the cameldriver was unsatisfied againhe was the lowdownest reptyle in seven countiesand he come arunning again and this time the thing he wanted was to get the dervish to rub some of the salve on his other eye  why said the dervish  oh you know says the driver  know what  well you cant fool me says the driver youre trying to keep back something from me you know it mighty well you know i reckon that if i had the salve on the other eye i could see a lot more things thats valuable comeplease put it on  the dervish says  i wasnt keeping anything back from you i dont mind telling you what would happen if i put it on youd never see again youd be stoneblind the rest of your days  but do you know that beat wouldnt believe him no he begged and begged and whined and cried till at last the dervish opened his box and told him to put it on if he wanted to so the man done it and sure enough he was as blind as a bat in a minute  then the dervish laughed at him and mocked at him and made fun of him and says  goodbyea man thats blind haint got no use for jewelry  and he cleared out with the hundred camels and left that man to wander around poor and miserable and friendless the rest of his days in the desert  jim said hed bet it was a lesson to him  yes tom says and like a considerable many lessons a body gets they aint no account because the thing dont ever happen the same way againand cant the time hen scovil fell down the chimbly and crippled his back for life everybody said it would be a lesson to him what kind of a lesson how was he going to use it he couldnt climb chimblies no more and he hadnt no more backs to break  all de same mars tom dey is sich a thing as learnin by expeence de good book say de burnt chile shun de fire  well i aint denying that a things a lesson if its a thing that can happen twice just the same way theres lots of such things and they educate a person thats what uncle abner always said but theres forty million lots of the other kindthe kind that dont happen the same way twiceand they aint no real use they aint no more instructive than the smallpox when youve got it it aint no good to find out you ought to been vaccinated and it aint no good to git vaccinated afterward because the smallpox dont come but once but on the other hand uncle abner said that the person that had took a bull by the tail once had learnt sixty or seventy times as much as a person that hadnt and said a person that started in to carry a cat home by the tail was gitting knowledge that was always going to be useful to him and warnt ever going to grow dim or doubtful but i can tell you jim uncle abner was down on them people thats all the time trying to dig a lesson out of everything that happens no matter whether  but jim was asleep tom looked kind of ashamed because you know a person always feels bad when he is talking uncommon fine and thinks the other person is admiring and that other person goes to sleep that way of course he oughtnt to go to sleep because its shabby but the finer a person talks the certainer it is to make you sleep and so when you come to look at it it aint nobodys fault in particular both of thems to blame  jim begun to snoresoft and blubbery at first then a long rasp then a stronger one then a half a dozen horrible ones like the last water sucking down the plughole of a bathtub then the same with more power to it and some big coughs and snorts flung in the way a cow does that is choking to death and when the person has got to that point he is at his level best and can wake up a man that is in the next block with a dipperful of loddanum in him but cant wake himself up although all that awful noise of hisn aint but three inches from his own ears and that is the curiosest thing in the world seems to me but you rake a match to light the candle and that little bit of a noise will fetch him i wish i knowed what was the reason of that but there dont seem to be no way to find out now there was jim alarming the whole desert and yanking the animals out for miles and miles around to see what in the nation was going on up there there warnt nobody nor nothing that was as close to the noise as he was and yet he was the only cretur that wasnt disturbed by it we yelled at him and whooped at him it never done no good but the first time there come a little wee noise that wasnt of a usual kind it woke him up no sir ive thought it all over and so has tom and there aint no way to find out why a snorer cant hear himself snore  jim said he hadnt been asleep he just shut his eyes so he could listen better  tom said nobody warnt accusing him  that made him look like he wished he hadnt said anything and he wanted to git away from the subject i reckon because he begun to abuse the cameldriver just the way a person does when he has got catched in something and wants to take it out of somebody else he let into the cameldriver the hardest he knowed how and i had to agree with him and he praised up the dervish the highest he could and i had to agree with him there too but tom says  i aint so sure you call that dervish so dreadful liberal and good and unselfish but i dont quite see it he didnt hunt up another poor dervish did he no he didnt if he was so unselfish why didnt he go in there himself and take a pocketful of jewels and go along and be satisfied no sir the person he was hunting for was a man with a hundred camels he wanted to get away with all the treasure he could  why mars tom he was willin to divide fair and square he only struck for fifty camels  because he knowed how he was going to get all of them by and by  mars tom he tole de man de truck would make him bline  yes because he knowed the mans character it was just the kind of a man he was hunting fora man that never believes in anybodys word or anybodys honorableness because he aint got none of his own i reckon theres lots of people like that dervish they swindle right and left but they always make the other person seem to swindle himself they keep inside of the letter of the law all the time and there aint no way to git hold of them they dont put the salve onoh no that would be sin but they know how to fool you into putting it on then its you that blinds yourself i reckon the dervish and the cameldriver was just a paira fine smart brainy rascal and a dull coarse ignorant one but both of them rascals just the same  mars tom does you reckon deys any o dat kind o salve in de worl now  yes uncle abner says there is he says theyve got it in new york and they put it on country peoples eyes and show them all the railroads in the world and they go in and git them and then when they rub the salve on the other eye the other man bids them goodbye and goes off with their railroads heres the treasurehill now lower away  we landed but it warnt as interesting as i thought it was going to be because we couldnt find the place where they went in to git the treasure still it was plenty interesting enough just to see the mere hill itself where such a wonderful thing happened jim said he woudnt a missed it for three dollars and i felt the same way  and to me and jim as wonderful a thing as any was the way tom could come into a strange big country like this and go straight and find a little hump like that and tell it in a minute from a million other humps that was almost just like it and nothing to help him but only his own learning and his own natural smartness we talked and talked it over together but couldnt make out how he done it he had the best head on him i ever see and all he lacked was age to make a name for himself equal to captain kidd or george washington i bet you it would a crowded either of them to find that hill with all their gifts but it warnt nothing to tom sawyer he went across sahara and put his finger on it as easy as you could pick a nigger out of a bunch of angels  we found a pond of salt water close by and scraped up a raft of salt around the edges and loaded up the lions skin and the tigers so as they would keep till jim could tan them    chapter xi the sandstorm  we went afooling along for a day or two and then just as the full moon was touching the ground on the other side of the desert we see a string of little black figgers moving across its big silver face you could see them as plain as if they was painted on the moon with ink it was another caravan we cooled down our speed and tagged along after it just to have company though it warnt going our way it was a rattler that caravan and a most bully sight to look at next morning when the sun come astreaming across the desert and flung the long shadders of the camels on the gold sand like a thousand granddaddylonglegses marching in procession we never went very near it because we knowed better now than to act like that and scare peoples camels and break up their caravans it was the gayest outfit you ever see for rich clothes and nobby style some of the chiefs rode on dromedaries the first we ever see and very tall and they go plunging along like they was on stilts and they rock the man that is on them pretty violent and churn up his dinner considerable i bet you but they make noble good time and a camel aint nowheres with them for speed  the caravan camped during the middle part of the day and then started again about the middle of the afternoon before long the sun begun to look very curious first it kind of turned to brass and then to copper and after that it begun to look like a bloodred ball and the air got hot and close and pretty soon all the sky in the west darkened up and looked thick and foggy but fiery and dreadfullike it looks through a piece of red glass you know we looked down and see a big confusion going on in the caravan and a rushing every which way like they was scared and then they all flopped down flat in the sand and laid there perfectly still  pretty soon we see something coming that stood up like an amazing wide wall and reached from the desert up into the sky and hid the sun and it was coming like the nation too then a little faint breeze struck us and then it come harder and grains of sand begun to sift against our faces and sting like fire and tom sung out  its a sandstormturn your backs to it  we done it and in another minute it was blowing a gale and the sand beat against us by the shovelful and the air was so thick with it we couldnt see a thing in five minutes the boat was level full and we was setting on the lockers buried up to the chin in sand and only our heads out and could hardly breathe  then the storm thinned and we see that monstrous wall go asailing off across the desert awful to look at i tell you we dug ourselves out and looked down and where the caravan was before there wasnt anything but just the sand ocean now and all still and quiet all them people and camels was smothered and dead and buriedburied under ten foot of sand we reckoned and tom allowed it might be years before the wind uncovered them and all that time their friends wouldnt ever know what become of that caravan tom said  now we know what it was that happened to the people we got the swords and pistols from  yes sir that was just it it was as plain as day now they got buried in a sandstorm and the wild animals couldnt get at them and the wind never uncovered them again until they was dried to leather and warnt fit to eat it seemed to me we had felt as sorry for them poor people as a person could for anybody and as mournful too but we was mistaken this last caravans death went harder with us a good deal harder you see the others was total strangers and we never got to feeling acquainted with them at all except maybe a little with the man that was watching the girl but it was different with this last caravan we was huvvering around them a whole night and most a whole day and had got to feeling real friendly with them and acquainted i have found out that there aint no surer way to find out whether you like people or hate them than to travel with them just so with these we kind of liked them from the start and traveling with them put on the finisher the longer we traveled with them and the more we got used to their ways the better and better we liked them and the gladder and gladder we was that we run across them we had come to know some of them so well that we called them by name when we was talking about them and soon got so familiar and sociable that we even dropped the miss and mister and just used their plain names without any handle and it did not seem unpolite but just the right thing of course it wasnt their own names but names we give them there was mr elexander robinson and miss adaline robinson and colonel jacob mcdougal and miss harryet mcdougal and judge jeremiah butler and young bushrod butler and these was big chiefs mostly that wore splendid great turbans and simmeters and dressed like the grand mogul and their families but as soon as we come to know them good and like them very much it warnt mister nor judge nor nothing any more but only elleck and addy and jake and hattie and jerry and buck and so on  and you know the more you join in with people in their joys and their sorrows the more nearer and dearer they come to be to you now we warnt cold and indifferent the way most travelers is we was right down friendly and sociable and took a chance in everything that was going and the caravan could depend on us to be on hand every time it didnt make no difference what it was  when they camped we camped right over them ten or twelve hundred feet up in the air when they et a meal we et ourn and it made it ever so much homeliker to have their company when they had a wedding that night and buck and addy got married we got ourselves up in the very starchiest of the professors duds for the blowout and when they danced we jined in and shook a foot up there  but it is sorrow and trouble that brings you the nearest and it was a funeral that done it with us it was next morning just in the still dawn we didnt know the diseased and he warnt in our set but that never made no difference he belonged to the caravan and that was enough and there warnt no more sincerer tears shed over him than the ones we dripped on him from up there eleven hundred foot on high  yes parting with this caravan was much more bitterer than it was to part with them others which was comparative strangers and been dead so long anyway we had knowed these in their lives and was fond of them too and now to have death snatch them from right before our faces while we was looking and leave us so lonesome and friendless in the middle of that big desert it did hurt so and we wished we mightnt ever make any more friends on that voyage if we was going to lose them again like that  we couldnt keep from talking about them and they was all the time coming up in our memory and looking just the way they looked when we was all alive and happy together we could see the line marching and the shiny spearheads awinking in the sun we could see the dromedaries lumbering along we could see the wedding and the funeral and more oftener than anything else we could see them praying because they dont allow nothing to prevent that whenever the call come several times a day they would stop right there and stand up and face to the east and lift back their heads and spread out their arms and begin and four or five times they would go down on their knees and then fall forward and touch their forehead to the ground  well it warnt good to go on talking about them lovely as they was in their life and dear to us in their life and death both because it didnt do no good and made us too downhearted jim allowed he was going to live as good a life as he could so he could see them again in a better world and tom kept still and didnt tell him they was only mohammedans it warnt no use to disappoint him he was feeling bad enough just as it was  when we woke up next morning we was feeling a little cheerfuller and had had a most powerful good sleep because sand is the comfortablest bed there is and i dont see why people that can afford it dont have it more and its terrible good ballast too i never see the balloon so steady before  tom allowed we had twenty tons of it and wondered what we better do with it it was good sand and it didnt seem good sense to throw it away jim says  mars tom cant we tote it back home en sell it how longll it take  depends on the way we go  well sah shes wuth a quarter of a dollar a load at home en i reckon wes got as much as twenty loads haint we how much would dat be  five dollars  by jings mars tom les shove for home right on de spot hits moren a dollar en a half apiece haint it  yes  well ef dat aint makin money de easiest ever i struck she jes rained innever cos us a lick o work les mosey right along mars tom  but tom was thinking and ciphering away so busy and excited he never heard him pretty soon he says  five dollarssho look here this sands worthworthwhy its worth no end of money  how is dat mars tom go on honey go on  well the minute people knows its genuwyne sand from the genuwyne desert of sahara theyll just be in a perfect state of mind to git hold of some of it to keep on the whatnot in a vial with a label on it for a curiosity all we got to do is to put it up in vials and float around all over the united states and peddle them out at ten cents apiece weve got all of ten thousand dollars worth of sand in this boat  me and jim went all to pieces with joy and begun to shout whoopjamboreehoo and tom says  and we can keep on coming back and fetching sand and coming back and fetching more sand and just keep it agoing till weve carted this whole desert over there and sold it out and there aint ever going to be any opposition either because well take out a patent  my goodness i says well be as rich as creosote wont we tom  yescreesus you mean why that dervish was hunting in that little hill for the treasures of the earth and didnt know he was walking over the real ones for a thousand miles he was blinder than he made the driver  mars tom how much is we gwyne to be worth  well i dont know yet its got to be ciphered and it aint the easiest job to do either because its over four million square miles of sand at ten cents a vial  jim was awful excited but this faded it out considerable and he shook his head and says  mars tom we cant ford all dem vialsa king couldnt we better not try to take de whole desert mars tom de vials gwyne to bust us sho  toms excitement died out too now and i reckoned it was on account of the vials but it wasnt he set there thinking and got bluer and bluer and at last he says  boys it wont work we got to give it up  why tom  on account of the duties  i couldnt make nothing out of that neither could jim i says  what is our duty tom because if we cant git around it why cant we just do it people often has to  but he says  oh it aint that kind of duty the kind i mean is a tax whenever you strike a frontierthats the border of a country you knowyou find a customhouse there and the govment officers comes and rummages among your things and charges a big tax which they call a duty because its their duty to bust you if they can and if you dont pay the duty theyll hog your sand they call it confiscating but that dont deceive nobody its just hogging and thats all it is now if we try to carry this sand home the way were pointed now we got to climb fences till we git tiredjust frontier after frontieregypt arabia hindostan and so on and theyll all whack on a duty and so you see easy enough we cant go that road  why tom i says we can sail right over their old frontiers how are they going to stop us  he looked sorrowful at me and says very grave  huck finn do you think that would be honest  i hate them kind of interruptions i never said nothing and he went on  well were shut off the other way too if we go back the way weve come theres the new york customhouse and that is worse than all of them others put together on account of the kind of cargo weve got  why  well they cant raise sahara sand in america of course and when they cant raise a thing there the duty is fourteen hundred thousand per cent on it if you try to fetch it in from where they do raise it  there aint no sense in that tom sawyer  who said there was what do you talk to me like that for huck finn you wait till i say a things got sense in it before you go to accusing me of saying it  all right consider me crying about it and sorry go on  jim says  mars tom do dey jam dat duty onto everything we cant raise in america en dont make no stinction twix anything  yes thats what they do  mars tom aint de blessin o de lord de mos valuable thing dey is  yes it is  dont de preacher stan up in de pulpit en call it down on de people  yes  whah do it come from  from heaven  yassir yous jes right deed you is honeyit come from heaven en dats a foreign country now den do dey put a tax on dat blessin  no they dont  course dey dont en so it stan to reason dat yous mistaken mars tom dey wouldnt put de tax on po truck like san dat everybody aint bleeged to have en leave it offn de bes thing dey is which nobody cant git along widout  tom sawyer was stumped he see jim had got him where he couldnt budge he tried to wiggle out by saying they had forgot to put on that tax but theyd be sure to remember about it next session of congress and then theyd put it on but that was a poor lame comeoff and he knowed it he said there warnt nothing foreign that warnt taxed but just that one and so they couldnt be consistent without taxing it and to be consistent was the first law of politics so he stuck to it that theyd left it out unintentional and would be certain to do their best to fix it before they got caught and laughed at  but i didnt feel no more interest in such things as long as we couldnt git our sand through and it made me lowspirited and jim the same tom he tried to cheer us up by saying he would think up another speculation for us that would be just as good as this one and better but it didnt do no good we didnt believe there was any as big as this it was mighty hard such a little while ago we was so rich and could a bought a country and started a kingdom and been celebrated and happy and now we was so poor and ornery again and had our sand left on our hands the sand was looking so lovely before just like gold and dimonds and the feel of it was so soft and so silky and nice but now i couldnt bear the sight of it it made me sick to look at it and i knowed i wouldnt ever feel comfortable again till we got shut of it and i didnt have it there no more to remind us of what we had been and what we had got degraded down to the others was feeling the same way about it that i was i knowed it because they cheered up so the minute i says les throw this truck overboard  well it was going to be work you know and pretty solid work too so tom he divided it up according to fairness and strength he said me and him would clear out a fifth apiece of the sand and jim threefifths jim he didnt quite like that arrangement he says  course is de stronges en is willin to do a share accordin but by jings yous kinder pilin it onto ole jim mars tom haint you  well i didnt think so jim but you try your hand at fixing it and lets see  so jim reckoned it wouldnt be no more than fair if me and tom done a tenth apiece tom he turned his back to git room and be private and then he smole a smile that spread around and covered the whole sahara to the westward back to the atlantic edge of it where we come from then he turned around again and said it was a good enough arrangement and we was satisfied if jim was jim said he was  so then tom measured off our twotenths in the bow and left the rest for jim and it surprised jim a good deal to see how much difference there was and what a raging lot of sand his share come to and said he was powerful glad now that he had spoke up in time and got the first arrangement altered for he said that even the way it was now there was more sand than enjoyment in his end of the contract he believed  then we laid into it it was mighty hot work and tough so hot we had to move up into cooler weather or we couldnt a stood it me and tom took turn about and one worked while tother rested but there warnt nobody to spell poor old jim and he made all that part of africa damp he sweated so we couldnt work good we was so full of laugh and jim he kept fretting and wanting to know what tickled us so and we had to keep making up things to account for it and they was pretty poor inventions but they done well enough jim didnt see through them at last when we got done we was most dead but not with work but with laughing by and by jim was most dead too but it was with work then we took turns and spelled him and he was as thankfull as he could be and would set on the gunnel and swab the sweat and heave and pant and say how good we was to a poor old nigger and he wouldnt ever forgit us he was always the gratefulest nigger i ever see for any little thing you done for him he was only nigger outside inside he was as white as you be    chapter xii jim standing siege  the next few meals was pretty sandy but that dont make no difference when you are hungry and when you aint it aint no satisfaction to eat anyway and so a little grit in the meat aint no particular drawback as far as i can see  then we struck the east end of the desert at last sailing on a northeast course away off on the edge of the sand in a soft pinky light we see three little sharp roofs like tents and tom says  its the pyramids of egypt  it made my heart fairly jump you see i had seen a many and a many a picture of them and heard tell about them a hundred times and yet to come on them all of a sudden that way and find they was real stead of imaginations most knocked the breath out of me with surprise its a curious thing that the more you hear about a grand and big and bully thing or person the more it kind of dreamies out as you may say and gets to be a big dim wavery figger made out of moonshine and nothing solid to it its just so with george washington and the same with them pyramids  and moreover besides the thing they always said about them seemed to me to be stretchers there was a feller come to the sundayschool once and had a picture of them and made a speech and said the biggest pyramid covered thirteen acres and was most five hundred foot high just a steep mountain all built out of hunks of stone as big as a bureau and laid up in perfectly regular layers like stairsteps thirteen acres you see for just one building its a farm if it hadnt been in sundayschool i would a judged it was a lie and outside i was certain of it and he said there was a hole in the pyramid and you could go in there with candles and go ever so far up a long slanting tunnel and come to a large room in the stomach of that stone mountain and there you would find a big stone chest with a king in it four thousand years old i said to myself then if that aint a lie i will eat that king if they will fetch him for even methusalem warnt that old and nobody claims it  as we come a little nearer we see the yaller sand come to an end in a long straight edge like a blanket and on to it was joined edge to edge a wide country of bright green with a snaky stripe crooking through it and tom said it was the nile it made my heart jump again for the nile was another thing that wasnt real to me now i can tell you one thing which is dead certain if you will fool along over three thousand miles of yaller sand all glimmering with heat so that it makes your eyes water to look at it and youve been a considerable part of a week doing it the green country will look so like home and heaven to you that it will make your eyes water again  it was just so with me and the same with jim  and when jim got so he could believe it was the land of egypt he was looking at he wouldnt enter it standing up but got down on his knees and took off his hat because he said it wasnt fitten for a humble poor nigger to come any other way where such men had been as moses and joseph and pharaoh and the other prophets he was a presbyterian and had a most deep respect for moses which was a presbyterian too he said he was all stirred up and says  hits de lan of egypt de lan of egypt en is lowed to look at it wid my own eyes en dahs de river dat was turn to blood en is looking at de very same groun whah de plagues was en de lice en de frogs en de locus en de hail en whah dey marked de doorpos en de angel o de lord come by in de darkness o de night en slew de fustborn in all de lan o egypt ole jim aint worthy to see dis day  and then he just broke down and cried he was so thankful so between him and tom there was talk enough jim being excited because the land was so full of historyjoseph and his brethren moses in the bulrushers jacob coming down into egypt to buy corn the silver cup in the sack and all them interesting things and tom just as excited too because the land was so full of history that was in his line about noureddin and bedreddin and such like monstrous giants that made jims wool rise and a raft of other arabian nights folks which the half of them never done the things they let on they done i dont believe  then we struck a disappointment for one of them early morning fogs started up and it warnt no use to sail over the top of it because we would go by egypt sure so we judged it was best to set her by compass straight for the place where the pyramids was gitting blurred and blotted out and then drop low and skin along pretty close to the ground and keep a sharp lookout tom took the hellum i stood by to let go the anchor and jim he straddled the bow to dig through the fog with his eyes and watch out for danger ahead we went along a steady gait but not very fast and the fog got solider and solider so solid that jim looked dim and ragged and smoky through it it was awful still and we talked low and was anxious now and then jim would say  highst her a pint mars tom highst her and up she would skip a foot or two and we would slide right over a flatroofed mud cabin with people that had been asleep on it just beginning to turn out and gap and stretch and once when a feller was clear up on his hind legs so he could gap and stretch better we took him a blip in the back and knocked him off by and by after about an hour and everything dead still and we astraining our ears for sounds and holding our breath the fog thinned a little very sudden and jim sung out in an awful scare  oh for de lans sake set her back mars tom heres de biggest giant outen de rabian nights acomin for us and he went over backwards in the boat  tom slammed on the backaction and as we slowed to a standstill a mans face as big as our house at home looked in over the gunnel same as a house looks out of its windows and i laid down and died i must a been clear dead and gone for as much as a minute or more then i come to and tom had hitched a boathook on to the lower lip of the giant and was holding the balloon steady with it whilst he canted his head back and got a good long look up at that awful face  jim was on his knees with his hands clasped gazing up at the thing in a begging way and working his lips but not getting anything out i took only just a glimpse and was fading out again but tom says  he aint alive you fools its the sphinx  i never see tom look so little and like a fly but that was because the giants head was so big and awful awful yes so it was but not dreadful any more because you could see it was a noble face and kind of sad and not thinking about you but about other things and larger it was stone reddish stone and its nose and ears battered and that give it an abused look and you felt sorrier for it for that  we stood off a piece and sailed around it and over it and it was just grand it was a mans head or maybe a womans on a tigers body a hundred and twentyfive foot long and there was a dear little temple between its front paws all but the head used to be under the sand for hundreds of years maybe thousands but they had just lately dug the sand away and found that little temple it took a power of sand to bury that cretur most as much as it would to bury a steamboat i reckon  we landed jim on top of the head with an american flag to protect him it being a foreign land then we sailed off to this and that and tother distance to git what tom called effects and perspectives and proportions and jim he done the best he could striking all the different kinds of attitudes and positions he could study up but standing on his head and working his legs the way a frog does was the best the further we got away the littler jim got and the grander the sphinx got till at last it was only a clothespin on a dome as you might say thats the way perspective brings out the correct proportions tom said he said julus cesars niggers didnt know how big he was they was too close to him  then we sailed off further and further till we couldnt see jim at all any more and then that great figger was at its noblest agazing out over the nile valley so still and solemn and lonesome and all the little shabby huts and things that was scattered about it clean disappeared and gone and nothing around it now but a soft wide spread of yaller velvet which was the sand  that was the right place to stop and we done it we set there alooking and athinking for a half an hour nobody asaying anything for it made us feel quiet and kind of solemn to remember it had been looking over that valley just that same way and thinking its awful thoughts all to itself for thousands of years and nobody cant find out what they are to this day  at last i took up the glass and see some little black things acapering around on that velvet carpet and some more aclimbing up the creturs back and then i see two or three wee puffs of white smoke and told tom to look he done it and says  theyre bugs nohold on theywhy i believe theyre men yes its menmen and horses both theyre hauling a long ladder up onto the sphinxs backnow aint that odd and now theyre trying to lean it up atheres some more puffs of smokeits guns huck theyre after jim  we clapped on the power and went for them abiling we was there in no time and come awhizzing down amongst them and they broke and scattered every which way and some that was climbing the ladder after jim let go all holts and fell we soared up and found him laying on top of the head panting and most tuckered out partly from howling for help and partly from scare he had been standing a siege a long timea week he said but it warnt so it only just seemed so to him because they was crowding him so they had shot at him and rained the bullets all around him but he warnt hit and when they found he wouldnt stand up and the bullets couldnt git at him when he was laying down they went for the ladder and then he knowed it was all up with him if we didnt come pretty quick tom was very indignant and asked him why he didnt show the flag and command them to git in the name of the united states jim said he done it but they never paid no attention tom said he would have this thing looked into at washington and says  youll see that theyll have to apologize for insulting the flag and pay an indemnity too on top of it even if they git off that easy  jim says  whats an indemnity mars tom  its cash thats what it is  who gits it mars tom  why we do  en who gits de apology  the united states or we can take whichever we please we can take the apology if we want to and let the govment take the money  how much money will it be mars tom  well in an aggravated case like this one it will be at least three dollars apiece and i dont know but more  well den well take de money mars tom blame de pology haint dat yo notion too en haint it yourn huck  we talked it over a little and allowed that that was as good a way as any so we agreed to take the money it was a new business to me and i asked tom if countries always apologized when they had done wrong and he says  yes the little ones does  we was sailing around examining the pyramids you know and now we soared up and roosted on the flat top of the biggest one and found it was just like what the man said in the sundayschool it was like four pairs of stairs that starts broad at the bottom and slants up and comes together in a point at the top only these stairsteps couldnt be clumb the way you climb other stairs no for each step was as high as your chin and you have to be boosted up from behind the two other pyramids warnt far away and the people moving about on the sand between looked like bugs crawling we was so high above them  tom he couldnt hold himself he was so worked up with gladness and astonishment to be in such a celebrated place and he just dripped history from every pore seemed to me he said he couldnt scarcely believe he was standing on the very identical spot the prince flew from on the bronze horse it was in the arabian night times he said somebody give the prince a bronze horse with a peg in its shoulder and he could git on him and fly through the air like a bird and go all over the world and steer it by turning the peg and fly high or low and land wherever he wanted to  when he got done telling it there was one of them uncomfortable silences that comes you know when a person has been telling a whopper and you feel sorry for him and wish you could think of some way to change the subject and let him down easy but git stuck and dont see no way and before you can pull your mind together and do something that silence has got in and spread itself and done the business i was embarrassed jim he was embarrassed and neither of us couldnt say a word well tom he glowered at me a minute and says  come out with it what do you think  i says  tom sawyer you dont believe that yourself  whats the reason i dont whats to hender me  theres one thing to hender you it couldnt happen thats all  whats the reason it couldnt happen  you tell me the reason it could happen  this balloon is a good enough reason it could happen i should reckon  why is it  why is it i never saw such an idiot aint this balloon and the bronze horse the same thing under different names  no theyre not one is a balloon and the others a horse its very different next youll be saying a house and a cow is the same thing  by jackson hucks got him agin dey aint no wigglin outer dat  shut your head jim you dont know what youre talking about and huck dont look here huck ill make it plain to you so you can understand you see it aint the mere form thats got anything to do with their being similar or unsimilar its the principle involved and the principle is the same in both dont you see now  i turned it over in my mind and says  tom it aint no use principles is all very well but they dont git around that one big fact that the thing that a balloon can do aint no sort of proof of what a horse can do  shucks huck you dont get the idea at all now look here a minuteits perfectly plain dont we fly through the air  yes  very well dont we fly high or fly low just as we please  yes  dont we steer whichever way we want to  yes  and dont we land when and where we please  yes  how do we move the balloon and steer it  by touching the buttons  now i reckon the thing is clear to you at last in the other case the moving and steering was done by turning a peg we touch a button the prince turned a peg there aint an atom of difference you see i knowed i could git it through your head if i stuck to it long enough  he felt so happy he begun to whistle but me and jim was silent so he broke off surprised and says  looky here huck finn dont you see it yet  i says  tom sawyer i want to ask you some questions  go ahead he says and i see jim chirk up to listen  as i understand it the whole thing is in the buttons and the pegthe rest aint of no consequence a button is one shape a peg is another shape but that aint any matter  no that aint any matter as long as theyve both got the same power  all right then what is the power thats in a candle and in a match  its the fire  its the same in both then  yes just the same in both  all right suppose i set fire to a carpenter shop with a match what will happen to that carpenter shop  shell burn up  and suppose i set fire to this pyramid with a candlewill she burn up  of course she wont  all right now the fires the same both times why does the shop burn and the pyramid dont  because the pyramid cant burn  aha and a horse cant fly  my lan ef huck aint got him agin hucks landed him high en dry dis time i tell you hits de smartes trap i ever see a body walk interen ef i  but jim was so full of laugh he got to strangling and couldnt go on and tom was that mad to see how neat i had floored him and turned his own argument agin him and knocked him all to rags and flinders with it that all he could manage to say was that whenever he heard me and jim try to argue it made him ashamed of the human race i never said nothing i was feeling pretty well satisfied when i have got the best of a person that way it aint my way to go around crowing about it the way some people does for i consider that if i was in his place i wouldnt wish him to crow over me its better to be generous thats what i think    chapter xiii going for toms pipe  by and by we left jim to float around up there in the neighborhood of the pyramids and we clumb down to the hole where you go into the tunnel and went in with some arabs and candles and away in there in the middle of the pyramid we found a room and a big stone box in it where they used to keep that king just as the man in the sundayschool said but he was gone now somebody had got him but i didnt take no interest in the place because there could be ghosts there of course not fresh ones but i dont like no kind  so then we come out and got some little donkeys and rode a piece and then went in a boat another piece and then more donkeys and got to cairo and all the way the road was as smooth and beautiful a road as ever i see and had tall datepams on both sides and naked children everywhere and the men was as red as copper and fine and strong and handsome and the city was a curiosity such narrow streetswhy they were just lanes and crowded with people with turbans and women with veils and everybody rigged out in blazing bright clothes and all sorts of colors and you wondered how the camels and the people got by each other in such narrow little cracks but they done ita perfect jam you see and everybody noisy the stores warnt big enough to turn around in but you didnt have to go in the storekeeper sat tailor fashion on his counter smoking his snaky long pipe and had his things where he could reach them to sell and he was just as good as in the street for the camelloads brushed him as they went by  now and then a grand person flew by in a carriage with fancy dressed men running and yelling in front of it and whacking anybody with a long rod that didnt get out of the way and by and by along comes the sultan riding horseback at the head of a procession and fairly took your breath away his clothes was so splendid and everybody fell flat and laid on his stomach while he went by i forgot but a feller helped me to remember he was one that had a rod and run in front  there was churches but they dont know enough to keep sunday they keep friday and break the sabbath you have to take off your shoes when you go in there was crowds of men and boys in the church setting in groups on the stone floor and making no end of noisegetting their lessons by heart tom said out of the koran which they think is a bible and people that knows better knows enough to not let on i never see such a big church in my life before and most awful high it was it made you dizzy to look up our village church at home aint a circumstance to it if you was to put it in there people would think it was a drygoods box  what i wanted to see was a dervish because i was interested in dervishes on accounts of the one that played the trick on the cameldriver so we found a lot in a kind of a church and they called themselves whirling dervishes and they did whirl too i never see anything like it they had tall sugarloaf hats on and linen petticoats and they spun and spun and spun round and round like tops and the petticoats stood out on a slant and it was the prettiest thing i ever see and made me drunk to look at it they was all moslems tom said and when i asked him what a moslem was he said it was a person that wasnt a presbyterian so there is plenty of them in missouri though i didnt know it before  we didnt see half there was to see in cairo because tom was in such a sweat to hunt out places that was celebrated in history we had a most tiresome time to find the granary where joseph stored up the grain before the famine and when we found it it warnt worth much to look at being such an old tumbledown wreck but tom was satisfied and made more fuss over it than i would make if i stuck a nail in my foot how he ever found that place was too many for me we passed as much as forty just like it before we come to it and any of them would a done for me but none but just the right one would suit him i never see anybody so particular as tom sawyer the minute he struck the right one he reconnized it as easy as i would reconnize my other shirt if i had one but how he done it he couldnt any more tell than he could fly he said so himself  then we hunted a long time for the house where the boy lived that learned the cadi how to try the case of the old olives and the new ones and said it was out of the arabian nights and he would tell me and jim about it when he got time well we hunted and hunted till i was ready to drop and i wanted tom to give it up and come next day and git somebody that knowed the town and could talk missourian and could go straight to the place but no he wanted to find it himself and nothing else would answer so on we went then at last the remarkablest thing happened i ever see the house was gonegone hundreds of years agoevery last rag of it gone but just one mud brick now a person wouldnt ever believe that a backwoods missouri boy that hadnt ever been in that town before could go and hunt that place over and find that brick but tom sawyer done it i know he done it because i see him do it i was right by his very side at the time and see him see the brick and see him reconnize it well i says to myself how does he do it is it knowledge or is it instink  now theres the facts just as they happened let everybody explain it their own way ive ciphered over it a good deal and its my opinion that some of it is knowledge but the main bulk of it is instink the reason is this tom put the brick in his pocket to give to a museum with his name on it and the facts when he went home and i slipped it out and put another brick considerable like it in its place and he didnt know the differencebut there was a difference you see i think that settles itits mostly instink not knowledge instink tells him where the exact place is for the brick to be in and so he reconnizes it by the place its in not by the look of the brick if it was knowledge not instink he would know the brick again by the look of it the next time he seen itwhich he didnt so it shows that for all the brag you hear about knowledge being such a wonderful thing instink is worth forty of it for real unerringness jim says the same  when we got back jim dropped down and took us in and there was a young man there with a red skullcap and tassel on and a beautiful silk jacket and baggy trousers with a shawl around his waist and pistols in it that could talk english and wanted to hire to us as guide and take us to mecca and medina and central africa and everywheres for a half a dollar a day and his keep and we hired him and left and piled on the power and by the time we was through dinner we was over the place where the israelites crossed the red sea when pharaoh tried to overtake them and was caught by the waters we stopped then and had a good look at the place and it done jim good to see it he said he could see it all now just the way it happened he could see the israelites walking along between the walls of water and the egyptians coming from away off yonder hurrying all they could and see them start in as the israelites went out and then when they was all in see the walls tumble together and drown the last man of them then we piled on the power again and rushed away and huvvered over mount sinai and saw the place where moses broke the tables of stone and where the children of israel camped in the plain and worshiped the golden calf and it was all just as interesting as could be and the guide knowed every place as well as i knowed the village at home  but we had an accident now and it fetched all the plans to a standstill toms old ornery corncob pipe had got so old and swelled and warped that she couldnt hold together any longer notwithstanding the strings and bandages but caved in and went to pieces tom he didnt know what to do the professors pipe wouldnt answer it warnt anything but a mershum and a person thats got used to a cob pipe knows it lays a long ways over all the other pipes in this world and you cant git him to smoke any other he wouldnt take mine i couldnt persuade him so there he was  he thought it over and said we must scour around and see if we could roust out one in egypt or arabia or around in some of these countries but the guide said no it warnt no use they didnt have them so tom was pretty glum for a little while then he chirked up and said hed got the idea and knowed what to do he says  ive got another corncob pipe and its a prime one too and nearly new its laying on the rafter thats right over the kitchen stove at home in the village jim you and the guide will go and get it and me and huck will camp here on mount sinai till you come back  but mars tom we couldnt ever find de village i could find de pipe case i knows de kitchen but my lan we cant ever find de village nur sent louis nur none o dem places we dont know de way mars tom  that was a fact and it stumped tom for a minute then he said  looky here it can be done sure and ill tell you how you set your compass and sail west as straight as a dart till you find the united states it aint any trouble because its the first land youll strike the other side of the atlantic if its daytime when you strike it bulge right on straight west from the upper part of the florida coast and in an hour and three quarters youll hit the mouth of the mississippiat the speed that im going to send you youll be so high up in the air that the earth will be curved considerablesorter like a washbowl turned upside downand youll see a raft of rivers crawling around every which way long before you get there and you can pick out the mississippi without any trouble then you can follow the river north nearly an hour and three quarters till you see the ohio come in then you want to look sharp because youre getting near away up to your left youll see another thread coming inthats the missouri and is a little above st louis youll come down low then so as you can examine the villages as you spin along youll pass about twentyfive in the next fifteen minutes and youll recognize ours when you see itand if you dont you can yell down and ask  ef its dat easy mars tom i reckon we kin do ityassir i knows we kin  the guide was sure of it too and thought that he could learn to stand his watch in a little while  jim can learn you the whole thing in a half an hour tom said this balloons as easy to manage as a canoe  tom got out the chart and marked out the course and measured it and says  to go back west is the shortest way you see its only about seven thousand miles if you went east and so on around its over twice as far then he says to the guide i want you both to watch the telltale all through the watches and whenever it dont mark three hundred miles an hour you go higher or drop lower till you find a stormcurrent thats going your way theres a hundred miles an hour in this old thing without any wind to help theres twohundredmile gales to be found any time you want to hunt for them  well hunt for them sir  see that you do sometimes you may have to go up a couple of miles and itll be pison cold but most of the time youll find your storm a good deal lower if you can only strike a cyclonethats the ticket for you youll see by the professors books that they travel west in these latitudes and they travel low too  then he ciphered on the time and says  seven thousand miles three hundred miles an houryou can make the trip in a daytwentyfour hours this is thursday youll be back here saturday afternoon come now hustle out some blankets and food and books and things for me and huck and you can start right along there aint no occasion to fool aroundi want a smoke and the quicker you fetch that pipe the better  all hands jumped for the things and in eight minutes our things was out and the balloon was ready for america so we shook hands goodbye and tom gave his last orders  its 10 minutes to 2 pm now mount sinai time in 24 hours youll be home and itll be 6 tomorrow morning village time when you strike the village land a little back of the top of the hill in the woods out of sight then you rush down jim and shove these letters in the postoffice and if you see anybody stirring pull your slouch down over your face so they wont know you then you go and slip in the back way to the kitchen and git the pipe and lay this piece of paper on the kitchen table and put something on it to hold it and then slide out and git away and dont let aunt polly catch a sight of you nor nobody else then you jump for the balloon and shove for mount sinai three hundred miles an hour you wont have lost more than an hour youll start back at 7 or 8 am village time and be here in 24 hours arriving at 2 or 3 pm mount sinai time  tom he read the piece of paper to us he had wrote on it       thursday afternoon tom sawyer the erronort      sends his love to aunt polly from mount sinai      where the ark was and so does huck finn and she      will get it tomorrow morning halfpast six      this misplacing of the ark is probably hucks   error not      tomsmt  thatll make her eyes bulge out and the tears come he says then he says  stand by onetwothreeaway you go  and away she did go why she seemed to whiz out of sight in a second  then we found a most comfortable cave that looked out over the whole big plain and there we camped to wait for the pipe  the balloon come hack all right and brung the pipe but aunt polly had catched jim when he was getting it and anybody can guess what happened she sent for tom so jim he says  mars tom shes out on de porch wid her eye sot on de sky alayin for you en she say she aint gwyne to budge from dah tell she gits hold of you deys gwyne to be trouble mars tom deed dey is  so then we shoved for home and not feeling very gay neither  end
