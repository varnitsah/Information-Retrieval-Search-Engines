56451228	mosses from an old manse                        by nathaniel hawthorne                         ps correspondence    my unfortunate friend p has lost the thread of his life by the interposition of long intervals of partially disordered reason the past and present are jumbled together in his mind in a manner often productive of curious results and which will be better understood after the perusal of the following letter than from any description that i could give  the poor fellow without once stirring from the little whitewashed irongrated room to which he alludes in his first paragraph is nevertheless a great traveller and meets in his wanderings a variety of personages who have long ceased to be visible to any eye save his own  in my opinion all this is not so much a delusion as a partly wilful and partly involuntary sport of the imagination to which his disease has imparted such morbid energy that he beholds these spectral scenes and characters with no less distinctness than a play upon the stage and with somewhat more of illusive credence many of his letters are in my possession some based upon the same vagary as the present one and others upon hypotheses not a whit short of it in absurdity  the whole form a series of correspondence which should fate seasonably remove my poor friend from what is to him a world of moonshine i promise myself a pious pleasure in editing for the public eye  p had always a hankering after literary reputation and has made more than one unsuccessful effort to achieve it  it would not be a little odd if after missing his object while seeking it by the light of reason he should prove to have stumbled upon it in his misty excursions beyond the limits of sanity   london february 29 1845  my dear friend old associations cling to the mind with astonishing tenacity  daily custom grows up about us like a stone wall and consolidates itself into almost as material an entity as mankinds strongest architecture  it is sometimes a serious question with me whether ideas be not really visible and tangible and endowed with all the other qualities of matter sitting as i do at this moment in my hired apartment writing beside the hearth over which hangs a print of queen victoria listening to the muffled roar of the worlds metropolis and with a window at but five paces distant through which whenever i please i can gaze out on actual londonwith all this positive certainty as to my whereabouts what kind of notion do you think is just now perplexing my brain  whywould you believe itthat all this time i am still an inhabitant of that wearisome little chamberthat whitewashed little chamberthat little chamber with its one small window across which from some inscrutable reason of taste or convenience my landlord had placed a row of iron barsthat same little chamber in short whither your kindness has so often brought you to visit me  will no length of time or breadth of space enfranchise me from that unlovely abode  i travel but it seems to be like the snail with my house upon my head  ah well  i am verging i suppose on that period of life when present scenes and events make but feeble impressions in comparison with those of yore so that i must reconcile myself to be more and more the prisoner of memory who merely lets me hop about a little with her chain around my leg  my letters of introduction have been of the utmost service enabling me to make the acquaintance of several distinguished characters who until now have seemed as remote from the sphere of my personal intercourse as the wits of queen annes time or ben jensons compotators at the mermaid  one of the first of which i availed myself was the letter to lord byron  i found his lordship looking much older than i had anticipated although considering his former irregularities of life and the various wear and tear of his constitution not older than a man on the verge of sixty reasonably may look  but i had invested his earthly frame in my imagination with the poets spiritual immortality  he wears a brown wig very luxuriantly curled and extending down over his forehead  the expression of his eyes is concealed by spectacles  his early tendency to obesity having increased lord byron is now enormously fatso fat as to give the impression of a person quite overladen with his own flesh and without sufficient vigor to diffuse his personal life through the great mass of corporeal substance which weighs upon him so cruelly  you gaze at the mortal heap and while it fills your eye with what purports to be byron you murmur within yourself for heavens sake where is he  were i disposed to be caustic i might consider this mass of earthly matter as the symbol in a material shape of those evil habits and carnal vices which unspiritualize mans nature and clog up his avenues of communication with the better life  but this would be too harsh and besides lord byrons morals have been improving while his outward man has swollen to such unconscionable circumference would that he were leaner for though he did me the honor to present his hand yet it was so puffed out with alien substance that i could not feel as if i had touched the hand that wrote childe harold  on my entrance his lordship apologized for not rising to receive me on the sufficient plea that the gout for several years past had taken up its constant residence in his right foot which accordingly was swathed in many rolls of flannel and deposited upon a cushion the other foot was hidden in the drapery of his chair  do you recollect whether byrons right or left foot was the deformed one  the noble poets reconciliation with lady byron is now as you are aware of ten years standing nor does it exhibit i am assured any symptom of breach or fracture  they are said to be if not a happy at least a contented or at all events a quiet couple descending the slope of life with that tolerable degree of mutual support which will enable them to come easily and comfortably to the bottom  it is pleasant to reflect how entirely the poet has redeemed his youthful errors in this particular  her ladyships influence it rejoices me to add has been productive of the happiest results upon lord byron in a religious point of view  he now combines the most rigid tenets of methodism with the ultra doctrines of the puseyites the former being perhaps due to the convictions wrought upon his mind by his noble consort while the latter are the embroidery and picturesque illumination demanded by his imaginative character much of whatever expenditure his increasing habits of thrift continue to allow him is bestowed in the reparation or beautifying of places of worship and this nobleman whose name was once considered a synonyme of the foul fiend is now all but canonized as a saint in many pulpits of the metropolis and elsewhere  in politics lord byron is an uncompromising conservative and loses no opportunity whether in the house of lords or in private circles of denouncing and repudiating the mischievous and anarchical notions of his earlier day  nor does he fail to visit similar sins in other people with the sincerest vengeance which his somewhat blunted pen is capable of inflicting southey and he are on the most intimate terms  you are aware that some little time before the death of moore byron caused that brilliant but reprehensible man to be evicted from his house  moore took the insult so much to heart that it is said to have been one great cause of the fit of illness which brought him to the grave others pretend that the lyrist died in a very happy state of mind singing one of his own sacred melodies and expressing his belief that it would be heard within the gate of paradise and gain him instant and honorable admittance  i wish he may have found it so  i failed not as you may suppose in the course of conversation with lord byron to pay the weed of homage due to a mighty poet by allusions to passages in childe harold and manfred and don juan which have made so large a portion of the music of my life my words whether apt or otherwise were at least warm with the enthusiasm of one worthy to discourse of immortal poesy  it was evident however that they did not go precisely to the right spot i could perceive that there was some mistake or other and was not a little angry with myself and ashamed of my abortive attempt to throw back from my own heart to the gifted authors ear the echo of those strains that have resounded throughout the world  but by and by the secret peeped quietly out  byroni have the information from his own lips so that you need not hesitate to repeat it in literary circlesbyron is preparing a new edition of his complete works carefully corrected expurgated and amended in accordance with his present creed of taste morals politics and religion  it so happened that the very passages of highest inspiration to which i had alluded were among the condemned and rejected rubbish which it is his purpose to cast into the gulf of oblivion  to whisper you the truth it appears to me that his passions having burned out the extinction of their vivid and riotous flame has deprived lord byron of the illumination by which he not merely wrote but was enabled to feel and comprehend what he had written  positively he no longer understands his own poetry  this became very apparent on his favoring me so far as to read a few specimens of don juan in the moralized version  whatever is licentious whatever disrespectful to the sacred mysteries of our faith whatever morbidly melancholic or splenetically sportive whatever assails settled constitutions of government or systems of society whatever could wound the sensibility of any mortal except a pagan a republican or a dissenter has been unrelentingly blotted out and its place supplied by unexceptionable verses in his lordships later style  you may judge how much of the poem remains as hitherto published  the result is not so good as might be wished in plain terms it is a very sad affair indeed for though the torches kindled in tophet have been extinguished they leave an abominably ill odor and are succeeded by no glimpses of hallowed fire  it is to be hoped nevertheless that this attempt on lord byrons part to atone for his youthful errors will at length induce the dean of westminster or whatever churchman is concerned to allow thorwaldsens statue of the poet its due niche in the grand old abbey  his bones you know when brought from greece were denied sepulture among those of his tuneful brethren there  what a vile slip of the pen was that  how absurd in me to talk about burying the bones of byron who i have just seen alive and incased in a big round bulk of flesh  but to say the truth a prodigiously fat man always impresses me as a kind of hobgoblin in the very extravagance of his mortal system i find something akin to the immateriality of a ghost  and then that ridiculous old story darted into my mind how that byron died of fever at missolonghi above twenty years ago  more and more i recognize that we dwell in a world of shadows and for my part i hold it hardly worth the trouble to attempt a distinction between shadows in the mind and shadows out of it  if there be any difference the former are rather the more substantial  only think of my good fortune  the venerable robert burnsnow if i mistake not in his eightyseventh yearhappens to be making a visit to london as if on purpose to afford me an opportunity of grasping him by the hand  for upwards of twenty years past he has hardly left his quiet cottage in ayrshire for a single night and has only been drawn hither now by the irresistible persuasions of all the distinguished men in england they wish to celebrate the patriarchs birthday by a festival it will be the greatest literary triumph on record  pray heaven the little spirit of life within the aged bards bosom may not be extinguished in the lustre of that hour  i have already had the honor of an introduction to him at the british museum where he was examining a collection of his own unpublished letters interspersed with songs which have escaped the notice of all his biographers  poh  nonsense  what am i thinking of  how should burns have been embalmed in biography when he is still a hearty old man  the figure of the bard is tall and in the highest degree reverend nor the less so that it is much bent by the burden of time  his white hair floats like a snowdrift around his face in which are seen the furrows of intellect and passion like the channels of headlong torrents that have foamed themselves away the old gentleman is in excellent preservation considering his time of life  he has that crickety sort of livelinessi mean the crickets humor of chirping for any cause or nonewhich is perhaps the most favorable mood that can befall extreme old age our pride forbids us to desire it for ourselves although we perceive it to be a beneficence of nature in the case of others i was surprised to find it in burns  it seems as if his ardent heart and brilliant imagination had both burned down to the last embers leaving only a little flickering flame in one corner which keeps dancing upward and laughing all by itself  he is no longer capable of pathos  at the request of allan cunningham he attempted to sing his own song to mary in heaven but it was evident that the feeling of those verses so profoundly true and so simply expressed was entirely beyond the scope of his present sensibilities and when a touch of it did partially awaken him the tears immediately gushed into his eyes and his voice broke into a tremulous cackle  and yet he but indistinctly knew wherefore he was weeping  ah he must not think again of mary in heaven until he shake off the dull impediment of time and ascend to meet her there  burns then began to repeat tan oshanter but was so tickled with its wit and humorof which however i suspect he had but a traditionary sensethat he soon burst into a fit of chirruping laughter succeeded by a cough which brought this not very agreeable exhibition to a close  on the whole i would rather not have witnessed it  it is a satisfactory idea however that the last forty years of the peasant poets life have been passed in competence and perfect comfort  having been cured of his bardic improvidence for many a day past and grown as attentive to the main chance as a canny scotsman should be he is now considered to be quite well off as to pecuniary circumstances this i suppose is worth having lived so long for  i took occasion to inquire of some of the countrymen of burns in regard to the health of sir walter scott  his condition i am sorry to say remains the same as for ten years past it is that of a hopeless paralytic palsied not more in body than in those nobler attributes of which the body is the instrument  and thus he vegetates from day to day and from year to year at that splendid fantasy of abbotsford which grew out of his brain and became a symbol of the great romancers tastes feelings studies prejudices and modes of intellect  whether in verse prose or architecture he could achieve but one thing although that one in infinite variety  there he reclines on a couch in his library and is said to spend whole hours of every day in dictating tales to an amanuensisto an imaginary amanuensis for it is not deemed worth any ones trouble now to take down what flows from that once brilliant fancy every image of which was formerly worth gold and capable of being coined  yet cunningham who has lately seen him assures me that there is now and then a touch of the geniusa striking combination of incident or a picturesque trait of character such as no other man alive could have bit offa glimmer from that ruined mind as if the sun had suddenly flashed on a halfrusted helmet in the gloom of an ancient ball  but the plots of these romances become inextricably confused the characters melt into one another and the tale loses itself like the course of a stream flowing through muddy and marshy ground  for my part i can hardly regret that sir walter scott had lost his consciousness of outward things before his works went out of vogue it was good that he should forget his fame rather than that fame should first have forgotten him  were he still a writer and as brilliant a one as ever he could no longer maintain anything like the same position in literature  the world nowadays requires a more earnest purpose a deeper moral and a closer and homelier truth than he was qualified to supply it with  yet who can be to the present generation even what scott has been to the past  i had expectations from a young manone dickenswho published a few magazine articles very rich in humor and not without symptoms of genuine pathos but the poor fellow died shortly after commencing an odd series of sketches entitled i think the pickwick papers  not impossibly the world has lost more than it dreams of by the untimely death of this mr dickens  whom do you think i met in pall mall the other day  you would not hit it in ten guesses  why no less a man than napoleon bonaparte or all that is now left of himthat is to say the skin bones and corporeal substance little cocked hat green coat white breeches and small sword which are still known by his redoubtable name  he was attended only by two policemen who walked quietly behind the phantasm of the old exemperor appearing to have no duty in regard to him except to see that none of the lightfingered gentry should possess themselves of thee star of the legion of honor  nobody save myself so much as turned to look after him nor it grieves me to confess could even i contrive to muster up any tolerable interest even by all that the warlike spirit formerly manifested within that now decrepit shape had wrought upon our globe  there is no surer method of annihilating the magic influence of a great renown than by exhibiting the possessor of it in the decline the overthrow the utter degradation of his powersburied beneath his own mortalityand lacking even the qualities of sense that enable the most ordinary men to bear themselves decently in the eye of the world  this is the state to which disease aggravated by long endurance of a tropical climate and assisted by old agefor he is now above seventyhas reduced bonaparte  the british government has acted shrewdly in retransporting him from st helena to england  they should now restore him to paris and there let him once again review the relics of his armies  his eye is dull and rheumy his nether lip hung down upon his chin while i was observing him there chanced to be a little extra bustle in the street and he the brother of caesar and hannibalthe great captain who had veiled the world in battlesmoke and tracked it round with bloody footstepswas seized with a nervous trembling and claimed the protection of the two policemen by a cracked and dolorous cry  the fellows winked at one another laughed aside and patting napoleon on the back took each an arm and led him away  death and fury  ha villain how came you hither  avaunt or i fling my inkstand at your head  tush tusk it is all a mistake pray my dear friend pardon this little outbreak  the fact is the mention of those two policemen and their custody of bonaparte had called up the idea of that odious wretchyou remember him wellwho was pleased to take such gratuitous and impertinent care of my person before i quitted new england forthwith up rose before my minds eye that same little whitewashed room with the irongrated windowstrange that it should have been irongratedwhere in too easy compliance with the absurd wishes of my relatives i have wasted several good years of my life  positively it seemed to me that i was still sitting there and that the keepernot that he ever was my keeper neither but only a kind of intrusive devil of a bodyservanthad just peeped in at the door  the rascal  i owe him an old grudge and will find a time to pay it yet  fie fie the mere thought of him has exceedingly discomposed me  even now that hateful chamberthe irongrated window which blasted the blessed sunshine as it fell through the dusty panes and made it poison to my soullooks more distinct to my view than does this my comfortable apartment in the heart of london  the realitythat which i know to be suchhangs like remnants of tattered scenery over the intolerably prominent illusion  let us think of it no more  you will be anxious to hear of shelley  i need not say what is known to all the world that this celebrated poet has for many years past been reconciled to the church of england  in his more recent works he has applied his fine powers to the vindication of the christian faith with an especial view to that particular development  latterly as you may not have heard he has taken orders and been inducted to a small country living in the gift of the lord chancellor  just now luckily for me he has come to the metropolis to superintend the publication of a volume of discourses treating of the poeticophilosophical proofs of christianity on the basis of the thirtynine articles  on my first introduction i felt no little embarrassment as to the manner of combining what i had to say to the author of queen mali the revolt of islam and prometheus unbound with such acknowledgments as might be acceptable to a christian minister and zealous upholder of the established church  but shelley soon placed me at my ease standing where he now does and reviewing all his successive productions from a higher point he assures me that there is a harmony an order a regular procession which enables him to lay his hand upon any one of the earlier poems and say this is my work with precisely the same complacency of conscience wherewithal he contemplates the volume of discourses above mentioned  they are like the successive steps of a staircase the lowest of which in the depth of chaos is as essential to the support of the whole as the highest and final one resting upon the threshold of the heavens i felt half inclined to ask him what would have been his fate had he perished on the lower steps of his staircase instead of building his way aloft into the celestial brightness  how all this may be i neither pretend to understand nor greatly care so long as shelley has really climbed as it seems he has from a lower region to a loftier one  without touching upon their religious merits i consider the productions of his maturity superior as poems to those of his youth  they are warmer with human love which has served as an interpreter between his mind and the multitude  the author has learned to dip his pen oftener into his heart and has thereby avoided the faults into which a too exclusive use of fancy and intellect are wont to betray him formerly his page was often little other than a concrete arrangement of crystallizations or even of icicles as cold as they were brilliant  now you take it to your heart and are conscious of a heartwarmth responsive to your own  in his private character shelley can hardly have grown more gentle kind and affectionate than his friends always represented him to be up to that disastrous night when he was drowned in the mediterranean  nonsense againsheer nonsense what am i babbling about  i was thinking of that old figment of his being lost in the bay of spezzia and washed ashore near via reggio and burned to ashes on a funeral pyre with wine and spices and frankincense while byron stood on the beach and beheld a flame of marvellous beauty rise heavenward from the dead poets heart and that his firepurified relics were finally buried near his child in roman earth  if all this happened threeandtwenty years ago how could i have met the drowned and burned and buried man here in london only yesterday  before quitting the subject i may mention that dr reginald heber heretofore bishop of calcutta but recently translated to a see in england called on shelley while i was with him  they appeared to be on terms of very cordial intimacy and are said to have a joint poem in contemplation  what a strange incongruous dream is the life of man  coleridge has at last finished his poem of christabel  it will be issued entire by old john murray in the course of the present publishing season  the poet i hear is visited with a troublesome affection of the tongue which has put a period or some lesser stop to the lifelong discourse that has hitherto been flowing from his lips  he will not survive it above a month unless his accumulation of ideas be sluiced off in some other way  wordsworth died only a week or two ago  heaven rest his soul and grant that he may not have completed the excursion  methinks i am sick of everything he wrote except his laodamia  it is very sad this inconstancy of the mind to the poets whom it once worshipped southey is as hale as ever and writes with his usual diligence old gifford is still alive in the extremity of age and with most pitiable decay of what little sharp and narrow intellect the devil had gifted him withal  one hates to allow such a man the privilege of growing old and infirm  it takes away our speculative license of kicking him  keats  no i have not seen him except across a crowded street with coaches drays horsemen cabs omnibuses footpassengers and divers other sensual obstructions intervening betwixt his small and slender figure and my eager glance  i would fain have met him on the seashore or beneath a natural arch of forest trees or the gothic arch of an old cathedral or among grecian ruins or at a glimmering fireside on the verge of evening or at the twilight entrance of a cave into the dreamy depths of which he would have led me by the hand anywhere in short save at temple bar where his presence was blotted out by the porterswollen bulks of these gross englishmen  i stood and watched him fading away fading away along the pavement and could hardly tell whether he were an actual man or a thought that had slipped out of my mind and clothed itself in human form and habiliments merely to beguile me  at one moment he put his handkerchief to his lips and withdrew it i am almost certain stained with blood  you never saw anything so fragile as his person  the truth is keats has all his life felt the effects of that terrible bleeding at the lungs caused by the article on his endymion in the quarterly review and which so nearly brought him to the grave  ever since he has glided about the world like a ghost sighing a melancholy tone in the ear of here and there a friend but never sending forth his voice to greet the multitude i can hardly think him a great poet  the burden of a mighty genius would never have been imposed upon shoulders so physically frail and a spirit so infirmly sensitive  great poets should have iron sinews  yet keats though for so many years he has given nothing to the world is understood to have devoted himself to the composition of an epic poem  some passages of it have been communicated to the inner circle of his admirers and impressed them as the loftiest strains that have been audible on earth since miltons days  if i can obtain copies of these specimens i will ask you to present them to james russell lowell who seems to be one of the poets most fervent and worthiest worshippers  the information took me by surprise  i had supposed that all keatss poetic incense without being embodied in human language floated up to heaven and mingled with the songs of the immortal choristers who perhaps were conscious of an unknown voice among them and thought their melody the sweeter for it  but it is not so he has positively written a poem on the subject of paradise regained though in another sense than that which presented itself to the mind of milton  in compliance it may be imagined with the dogma of those who pretend that all epic possibilities in the past history of the world are exhausted keats has thrown his poem forward into an indefinitely remote futurity  he pictures mankind amid the closing circumstances of the timelong warfare between good and evil  our race is on the eve of its final triumph  man is within the last stride of perfection woman redeemed from the thraldom against which our sibyl uplifts so powerful and so sad a remonstrance stands equal by his side or communes for herself with angels the earth sympathizing with her childrens happier state has clothed herself in such luxuriant and loving beauty as no eye ever witnessed since our first parents saw the sun rise over dewy eden  nor then indeed for this is the fulfilment of what was then but a golden promise but the picture has its shadows  there remains to mankind another perila last encounter with the evil principle  should the battle go against us we sink back into the slime and misery of ages  if we triumphbut it demands a poets eye to contemplate the splendor of such a consummation and not to be dazzled  to this great work keats is said to have brought so deep and tender a spirit of humanity that the poem has all the sweet and warm interest of a village tale no less than the grandeur which befits so high a theme  such at least is the perhaps partial representation of his friends for i have not read or heard even a single line of the performance in question  keats i am told withholds it from the press under an idea that the age has not enough of spiritual insight to receive it worthily  i do not like this distrust it makes me distrust the poet  the universe is waiting to respond to the highest word that the best child of time and immortality can utter  if it refuse to listen it is because he mumbles and stammers or discourses things unseasonable and foreign to the purpose  i visited the house of lords the other day to hear canning who you know is now a peer with i forget what title  he disappointed me time blunts both point and edge and does great mischief to men of his order of intellect  then i stepped into the lower house and listened to a few words from cobbett who looked as earthy as a real clodhopper or rather as if he had lain a dozen years beneath the clods  the men whom i meet nowadays often impress me thus probably because my spirits are not very good and lead me to think much about graves with the long grass upon them and weatherworn epitaphs and dry bones of people who made noise enough in their day but now can only clatter clatter clatter when the sextons spade disturbs them were it only possible to find out who are alive and who dead it would contribute infinitely to my peace of mind every day of my life somebody comes and stares me in the face whom i had quietly blotted out of the tablet of living men and trusted nevermore to be pestered with the sight or sound of him  for instance going to drury lane theatre a few evenings since up rose before me in the ghost of hamlets father the bodily presence of the elder kean who did die or ought to have died in some drunken fit or other so long ago that his fame is scarcely traditionary now his powers are quite gone he was rather the ghost of himself than the ghost of the danish king  in the stagebox sat several elderly and decrepit people and among them a stately ruin of a woman on a very large scale with a profilefor i did not see her front facethat stamped itself into my brain as a seal impresses hot wax  by the tragic gesture with which she took a pinch of snuff i was sure it must be mrs siddons her brother john kemble sat behinda brokendown figure but still with a kingly majesty about him  in lieu of all former achievements nature enables him to look the part of lear far better than in the meridian of his genius  charles matthews was likewise there but a paralytic affection has distorted his once mobile countenance into a most disagreeable onesidedness from which he could no more wrench it into proper form than he could rearrange the face of the great globe itself it looks as if for the jokes sake the poor man had twisted his features into an expression at once the most ludicrous and horrible that he could contrive and at that very moment as a judgment for making himself so hideous an avenging providence had seen fit to petrify him  since it is out of his own power i would gladly assist him to change countenance for his ugly visage haunts me both at noontide and nighttime  some other players of the past generation were present but none that greatly interested me  it behooves actors more than all other men of publicity to vanish from the scene betimes  being at best but painted shadows flickering on the wall and empty sounds that echo anthers thought it is a sad disenchantment when the colors begin to fade and the voice to croak with age  what is there new in the literary way on your side of the water nothing of the kind has come under any inspection except a volume of poems published above a year ago by dr channing  i did not before know that this eminent writer is a poet nor does the volume alluded to exhibit any of the characteristics of the authors mind as displayed in his prose works although some of the poems have a richness that is not merely of the surface but glows still the brighter the deeper and more faithfully you look into then  they seem carelessly wrought however like those rings and ornaments of the very purest gold but of rude native manufacture which are found among the golddust from africa  i doubt whether the american public will accept them it looks less to the assay of metal than to the neat and cunning manufacture how slowly our literature grows up  most of our writers of promise have come to untimely ends there was that wild fellow john neal who almost turned my boyish brain with his romances he surely has long been dead else he never could keep himself so quiet  bryant has gone to his last sleep with the thanatopsis gleaming over him like a sculptured marble sepulchre by moonlight  halleck who used to write queer verses in the newspapers and published a don juanic poem called fanny is defunct as a poet though averred to be exemplifying the metempsychosis as a man of business  somewhat later there was whittier a fiery quaker youth to whom the muse had perversely assigned a battletrumpet and who got himself lynched ten years agone in south carolina  i remember too a lad just from college longfellow by name who scattered some delicate verses to the winds and went to germany and perished i think of intense application at the university of gottingen  williswhat a pitywas lost if i recollect rightly in 1833 on his voyage to europe whither he was going to give us sketches of the worlds sunny face  if these had lived they might one or all of them have grown to be famous men  and yet there is no telling it may be as well that they have died i was myself a young man of promise  o shattered brain o broken spirit where is the fulfilment of that promise  the sad truth is that when fate would gently disappoint the world it takes away the hopefulest mortals in their youth when it would laugh the worlds hopes to scorn it lets them live  let me die upon this apothegm for i shall never make a truer one  what a strange substance is the human brain  or ratherfor there is no need of generalizing the remarkwhat an odd brain is mine would you believe it  daily and nightly there come scraps of poetry humming in my intellectual earsome as airy as birdnotes and some as delicately neat as parlormusic and a few as grand as organpealsthat seem just such verses as those departed poets would have written had not an inexorable destiny snatched them from their inkstands  they visit me in spirit perhaps desiring to engage my services as the amanuensis of their posthumous productions and thus secure the endless renown that they have forfeited by going hence too early  but i have my own business to attend to and besides a medical gentleman who interests himself in some little ailments of mine advises me not to make too free use of pen and ink  there are clerks enough out of employment who would be glad of such a job  good by  are you alive or dead and what are you about  still scribbling for the democratic  and do those infernal compositors and proofreaders misprint your unfortunate productions as vilely as ever it is too bad  let every man manufacture his own nonsense say i  expect me home soon andto whisper you a secretin company with the poet campbell who purposes to visit wyoming and enjoy the shadow of the laurels that he planted there  campbell is now an old man  he calls himself well better than ever in his life but looks strangely pale and so shadowlike that one might almost poke a finger through his densest material  i tell him by way of joke that he is as dim and forlorn as memory though as unsubstantial as hope   your true friend  p  p spray present my most respectful regards to our venerable and revered friend mr brockden brown   it gratifies me to learn that a complete edition of his works in a doublecolumned octavo volume is shortly to issue from the press at philadelphia  tell him that no american writer enjoys a more classic reputation on this side of the water  is old joel barlow yet alive  unconscionable man  why he must have nearly fulfilled his century  and does he meditate an epic on the war between mexico and texas with machinery contrived on the principle of the steamengine as being the nearest to celestial agency that our epoch can boast  how can he expect ever to rise again if while just sinking into his grave he persists in burdening himself with such a ponderosity of leaden verses
